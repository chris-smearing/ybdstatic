					<description><![CDATA[Hi,
what would you recommend for a cat hotel (hosts your cat while 
you&#039;re on vacation). Our rooms are for max. 2 cats 
(3 if same family). they&#039;re small but 3D designed so the cat has 
actually a lot of space. it&#039;s very important that there&#039;s no smell so as
 not to bother the cat since the room is small. Also we can&#039;t afford to have the cat take a long time to get used to it.
Thanks !]]></description>
