					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your article. Question: of these personal blenders, which of them can I turn on and walk away from? I  have the hamilton beach product as well, and I definitely do not enjoy just having to stand there and hold down a button. It seems needless, especially when it takes forever to blend my smoothie.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You are full of shit. This has NOTHING to do with my problem. The blade component gets turned so tightly during blending that I cannot open the cup.  I wrote a scathing review on Facebook. Other Nutribullet users applauded my candor.  I doubt I&#039;ll ever use the poorly designed and executed product. And I certainly won&#039;t purchase anything from NutriLiving.  F/U.

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Susan! Sorry to hear about your issues with the Nutribullet. We haven&#039;t experienced the issue you&#039;re describing and I&#039;m not sure what may be happening in your exact case. Per their instructions they do recommend letting it cool off between blending so it doesn&#039;t overheat: &quot;Press down and twist to extract for no longer than 1 minute. If more extraction is needed, wait 1 minute, then repeat the extraction process in 1 minute intervals up to 3 times as needed to achieve the desired consistency. If more than 3 1-minute extractions are needed, allow the power base to cool for 2-3 minutes after the third extraction before beginning the next round.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Nutribullet Pro I have  is crap.  Right now the blade component is fused to the cup. More often than not, it smells like it&#039;s burning.  My unit goes into the trash today. You need to look at sites where consumers write the truth.  Back to my VitaMix.]]></description>
