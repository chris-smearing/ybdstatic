					<description><![CDATA[Hi Anni, thanks for your question!

We have continued to use both the Hamilton Beach and the T-fal kettles so that we could report back after long-term use. So far, both have continued to work as well as the day we started testing them. However, we have had to descale each of them a couple of times -- but that&#039;s typical for most kettles.

In order to descale, all you need to do is fill the kettle half with water and half with vinegar. Let it sit for an hour or two, then boil the solution and rinse the kettle out. Both times we did this each kettle looked like it was new again!]]></description>
