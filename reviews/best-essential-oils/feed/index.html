					<description><![CDATA[Hi Michelle, 
YoungLiving and DoTerra do a great job of convincing people that they&#039;re worth the extra money, and the fact that you develop a relationship with your local &quot;independent distributor&quot; isn&#039;t a small part of the good will. If you&#039;re turned off by MLM, of course, it has the opposite effect. 

We had to choose, and our writer chose not to include MLMs.

Having participated in the organic certification process for an avocado grove, I understand your skepticism about sustainability:  there are loopholes. But, there are always loopholes. 

At the end of the day we have to trust that these essentials are what the manufacturers say they are; GCMS testing is basically the only way to verify that the oils contain the expected active compounds (and not synthetics), so we were careful to collect data on how frequently these distributors test. We have to trust the distributors, the distributors have to trust the processors, and the processors have to trust the farmers, and the farmers have to trust and care about the plants and methods that they make their livelihood from.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While this article has lots of interesting details in points about the importance of how you use essential oils, the information about do terra and young living is false.  Young living has specific oils that are listed as  ingestible and they market them that way.  Also they make a big deal about being FDA compliant and not claiming to heal or fix any pathologies, only support your body so it can do what it&#039;s supposed to do. I&#039;ve used young living for years and they&#039;re pretty much the only company I would trust and I have tried some of these other oils on your list , organic is not  Always the best. The seed to seal guarantee from young  living is what pushed me over the edge to choose them over the others I researched. They encourage their customers to take part in harvest for some of their larger farms, they are extremely transparent when it comes to origin and the care taken from the planting of the seed come out the time of year it&#039;s planted, when it&#039;s cultivated,  And I could say  20 other things about them that put them in the front of the oily industry. This review that you have is based on what things smell like for crying out loud, and whether something&#039;s organic or not. Being sustainable is more important to me than being organic, so you are not depleting the wild. Lavender is grossly over harvested for example . I want a company who is involved in the entire process from the seed to the sealing of the oil,  Is transparent and honest about origin, and encourages teaching and education about the products which YL is awesome about. So my point being yl should be on this list,  They use the word therapeutic grade because it is.  Anti microbial and anti bacterial  are therapeutic results from using oils.  I can&#039;t say, take  Oregano To cure that sinus infection, but I can say take oregeno to support your body&#039;s natural defenses and help kill the infection. 
 Knowledge is power , so be informed when buying oils that is all but make sure the information you&#039;re getting is properly researched and there are quantifiable ways to back it up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Correct. 
We don&#039;t mean to imply that the personal preferences of our four testers will apply to everyone, but major factors like strength of a scent are important whatever your preference for nuances. Even if we had a thousand testers, it would be difficult to demonstrate anything conclusive about scent preferences with an averaged score.
If you&#039;re picky about scents, finding a local dealer who will let you sample the oils is usually a much, much better way to buy than finding a consensus among a large group of testers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The article clearly states: &quot;The popular multi-level marketing companies, dōTERRA and Young Living didn’t make our top picks for several important reasons: their high retail prices, their lack of organic certification for all of their oils, and their insistence that most of their essential oils are safe to take internally not giving any regard to the potential health hazards of self-prescribing without professional clinical supervision.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Do you think edens botanicals essential oils are any good? I want to buy from stillpoint aromatics but they&#039;re way too expensive and floracopeia&#039;s least costly shopping to my area costs over 50$ so I&#039;m deciding whether to go with the a lot cheaper edens botanicals or pay a lot more for stillpoint aromatics while still getting less.. I mean if it makes a big difference then I&#039;ll go with stillpoint aromatics but if they&#039;re just a little bit better then I&#039;d obviously go with edens botanicals]]></description>
