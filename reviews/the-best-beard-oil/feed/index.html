					<description><![CDATA[Hi Karan,
It&#039;s not easy to get that brand here, but after running this roundup we&#039;re not eager to do any more performance tests, as you say &quot;almost all brands are good.&quot; 
Anything unique about Gangs of Beards that makes it stand out to you?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Daniel, I am a beard lover and according to me all the brands are good and I used almost all the brands except &quot;cremo &#038; V76 by vaughn&quot;. But what about &quot;Gangs of Beard&quot; Company beard oil. I think you should add this one too in your list because currently I am using their beard oil and it works great on my beard. I think you should use this one and see the results yourself and I hope you&#039;ll like their beard oil and will consider it in this list.]]></description>
