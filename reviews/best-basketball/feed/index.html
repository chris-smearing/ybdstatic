					<description><![CDATA[You ignored the most important ball!  The NCAA standard Wilson Solution ball!  My question is if it&#039;s better than the Wilson Evolution or not, but your article really missed the mark and left the most important question in readers&#039; minds out of the equation!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Evolution is horrible with sweat.  You will see the ball fly out very frequently and players will think they just messed up but really, it&#039;s the ball!  Maybe it repels water too much?  I loved the old TF-1000(non classic/non ZK Pro) best.  My ball currently is (and sadly the next best thing) the Wilson NCAA official game ball and the old TF which I save to use on rare game occassions.  Spalding, you messed it all up.  The old TF-1000 was the best but your money making marketing efforts to make an entire line of TF-1000&#039;s(Legacy/Classic/Platinum ZK) all sucked.  The classic which is closest to the old TF 1000 is much lower quality in all regards and looks like crap literally(yes doo doo).  Spalding, you should&#039;ve just raised the price on the TF1000 instead.  After the NBA game ball change and the TF lineup being watered down, you&#039;ve failed all us loyal Spalding fans.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment Rachel. It looks like Molten updated their Amazon listing which is why it looked sold out to you. We updated the post and it looks like the current price for the official size is $32: https://www.amazon.com/Molten-Indoor-Outdoor-Basketball-Approved/dp/B010PTAZGE/?tag=ybdig-20. I checked the site you showed and it does look cheap, but shipping that would get there in less than 20 days would cost you $10+, which may offset the cost/be a risk if you&#039;re thinking about it for Christmas. If you have Amazon Prime, it would end up being cheaper (and much faster) going with Amazon. But if speed isn&#039;t an issue, Epic Sports could be a good choice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article. I&#039;m looking into purchasing a Molten BGM Basketball, Indoor/Outdoor,  - I found a site that sells them for $22. Is this correct (I know the article mentioned that they are more expensive.). -http://basketball.epicsports.com/prod/115090/index.html]]></description>
