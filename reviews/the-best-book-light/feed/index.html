					<description><![CDATA[Hi Nicole.

Please note that the Ecologic Mart lamp has changed design, the current link may not work in a few days, please update it to https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GL4VP6T. This lamp has the same advantages as the previous one but ADDITS:
- Two colors of light, 
- Improves the way to replace the battery (without tools).
- Increases the duration of the charge by installing LED with better quality and a 1200mAh battery (the previous one was 1000mAh).

I hope to be helpful.
