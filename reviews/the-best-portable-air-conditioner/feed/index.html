					<description><![CDATA[We haven&#039;t tried running them that way, but it&#039;s not how they&#039;re designed to work. In cooling mode, the system should evaporate almost all of the condensation, but there&#039;s a chance you&#039;d have dripping in humid climates. Is there a specific reason you want to remove the plug?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi! We&#039;re in the middle of testing the 12,000 BTU Whynter to see what efficiency and noise levels are like in the same conditions as our single-hose top pick, but here&#039;s some general advice:

Expect a dual-hose unit to perform better than a single-hose, but not in a way that will significantly reduce your electric bill.

For reference, the DOE down-rates our 12,000 BTU single-hose top pick to 7,000 BTU, and the equivalent Whynter dual-hose model gets down-rated to 7,500. 

Under those adjusted numbers your 10,000 BTU is still within spec to cool your 250-square-foot room, but obviously the adjustment isn&#039;t fully reflecting the weaknesses of a portable system. 

I&#039;m assuming that you don&#039;t have double-hung windows that will work with a window AC unit. If you can find a way to install (or get your landlord to install) a through-the-wall model or a mini-split system, it might be worth it.

The better-sealed your room is, the better any AC system will work; this goes double for a dual-hose since the main advantage is not relying on infiltration air as part of the cooling process. All the portable AC kits have some air gaps in the window-baffle that could be sealed with tape to improve efficiency.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Loved the details in the article, but I need a dual hose portable unit and you only rated the Whynter.  I&#039;d go with the LG that you recommended, but it&#039;s single hose.  I&#039;m scared of the Whynter bc of your comments about the volume, and I&#039;m not sure I need 14000 BTU anyway.
  
I&#039;m in Dallas (high humidity - 5:30 pm is 86째 but feels like 98째.) The bedroom is approx 240 SF room w/ 8&#039; ceiling, shade, and questionable attic insulation- although it IS an attic so I guess it&#039;s supposed to be hotter than everywhere else,) which according to the calculator, means I need 6,000 BTU.

I&#039;m currently using a Haier single hose 10,000 BTU that&#039;s not cooling the room so great. I think it&#039;s killing my electric bill (Model HPD10XCM - LW) which is why I think I need dual hose. (Maybe my expectations are too high.)

Help! Any suggestions are appreciated.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Don,
Portables are tricky to size. If you&#039;ve got a bigger spot in the house you&#039;d also use it, the LG we recommend above is still our pick. It&#039;ll cool down the small room very quickly; you&#039;d probably want to keep the door open to allow the AC to run longer so it can dry out the air.

If you have a vertical-sliding (&quot;double hung&quot;) window, we really like the Frigidaire window units (we just finished testing the 8,000 BTU model.) A 5,000 BTU unit is still fairly big for a room that size, but a window unit is always far more efficient than a portable if you&#039;re going to use it all summer.
Check out Frigidaire&#039;s brand new 5,000 BTU model on Amazon:

					<description><![CDATA[I am torn between the LG and the Haier. This would be for my 33&#039; boat. I currently have a 8,000 BTU unit that only cools what it&#039;s pointing at. Size and weight are big factors as I have to store this under my floor when not in use. And I live in South Florida so Humidity is a major factor. Aesthetics and noise are not big factors for me. I am leaning toward the LG but the moisture removal of the Haier is impressive. Any suggestions?]]></description>
