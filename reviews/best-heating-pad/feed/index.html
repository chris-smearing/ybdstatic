					<description><![CDATA[I have used both Thermophore and TheraTherm. I like TheraTherm because of the temperature and time setting, but as a Registered Massage Therapist, I recommend and use Thermophore on a daily basis as I prefer it. The two have been found to be a degree Celsius different. The auto turn off is a safety feature with Thermophore and it molds to the body well. Please keep in mind that you should never lay on a heating pad (I’ve seen a second degree burn from one!) or sleep with one.]]></description>
