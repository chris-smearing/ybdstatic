					<description><![CDATA[Hi Yulia,
We&#039;re sorry to hear that the Brookstone didn&#039;t meet your expectations. We&#039;re surprised to hear that the massage felt weak, since ours was pretty aggressive and was the clear favorite of our ten testers. Did you try all of the settings?

We don&#039;t make any money from pitching specific products, and we definitely don&#039;t make anything if people return the products they buy through our links, so we&#039;re pretty careful to test thoroughly. We want you to keep coming back, and we hope that we can earn your trust again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am very disappointed that I bought Brookstone massager following your review. For this money it very bad massager. I made decision to return it after few minutes I tried it. Massage very weak. All what I felt it is pressure from air pillows on top. And there is no option to turn off the air pressure. massage rollers on the bottom could be barely feel. After my own research I bought amazing massage and very happy. I don&#039;t trust your articles anymore. I believe that your articles it is just paid commercial.]]></description>
