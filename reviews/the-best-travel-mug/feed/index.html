					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment, this review was one of those really tough calls you hate to have to make! :)
The hinge and button are definitely vulnerabilities (fully addressed by a design like the CamelBak). We didn&#039;t have any problems with our test mug, but the 20% complaint rate for the Thermos is higher than it used to be. The Zojirushi has some problems of its own, though, and in our testing it&#039;s just too skinny and too fragile to beat the Thermos. 
There are other Thermos commuter designs that look like they&#039;d avoid the issues with the button, but typically there are complaints about other things that are just as important (like leak-proofing). 
We&#039;re on the lookout for new test candidates, though!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, you can definitely wash these out with detergent. One of the advantages of stainless steel is that it&#039;s pretty hard to wreck it unless you leave it with concentrated acid inside for a long time. 
Sadly, that doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re all equally easy to scrub. The Thermos really needs a bottle brush if you accidentally leave flavored coffee in it for a week. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s definitely something to be said for those tumblers! Perfect for boating, lounging, and probably good for around the house. 
If you want to carry coffee around inside your bag, though... the Yeti/Ozark/etc. will leave you with laptop soup. :(]]></description>
