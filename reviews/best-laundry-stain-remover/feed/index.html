					<description><![CDATA[Working in retail, I always had ink stains from putting pens in my pockets without capping them. Most of the time hairspray took them out pretty good, not sure if it was the alchol or other ingredients. And as far as blood goes, I used peroxide. Now working for Home Depot I had to replace some of my clothes more often, not sure if those stain removing methods quicken the replacement or not. 
I am on my way to the store now to shop and will pick up some Oxiclean!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Try something from your kitchen... I use Dawn Dishwashing soap (the blue one) on petroleum or oil based stains and it gets it out every time. Actually, I use a combination of Dawn and Oxi Clean on most stains and get 99% of them out every time - always in cold water.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article and testing, thank you for your hard work! - But I think BIZ will outperform all of those you have tested here.  It&#039;d be great to see an updated article based on actual results from the same testing in a side-by-side Oxi Clean v BIZ.  I&#039;ve used Oxi Clean for years and then switched to BIZ because it simply works better than Oxi Clean.  Additionally - the cost of BIZ is considerably less.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oxi Clean or a good pre-soak in your regular laundry detergent should get most residual light petroleum solvents out. If you&#039;ve got a stain from a solvent and a detergent doesn&#039;t help rinse it out, there&#039;s a good chance that the stain is a permanent change to the color of the cloth (i.e. the solvent has removed some dye) rather than some chemical left behind. If it&#039;s a heavy oil like motor oil sometimes you can use a lighter oil or solvent (like naptha or &quot;gun wash&quot; from a paint supply store) to wash it away, but it doesn&#039;t sound like that&#039;s your problem.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article. Still not clear on best temperatures for soaking relative to stain. I know blood and chocolate (proteins) are cold water. You also say mix Oxi with cold. What stains are removed best with a warm or hot soak?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your article is nothing more than an advertisement for Oxiclean which I happen to think is the worst line of products out there and I have tried them all.  My husbands Black work shirts always came out of the dryer with these round oil looking stains.  I do not use bargain products I use clorox 2 and tide pods and still I couldn&#039;t get clean laundry so I tried oxiclean and then I tried zout and gonzo and all the other products out there and still had the stains.  Then I found Resolve Max and without pre-soaking I just sprayed the shirts and put them straight into the laundry and they came out beautiful.

So while you sing the praises of oxiclean I will tell the truth.  Oxi to me is the worst out there and I will stick to my Resolve Max..]]></description>
