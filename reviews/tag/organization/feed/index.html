<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>Before choosing our rolling duffel bag contenders, we consulted with two flight attendants, Erin Lee and Lam Nguyen, for their tips on buying a high-performing rolling duffel. Erin and Lam have 47 years of combined steward experience between them.</p>
<p>Lam points out that the two downfalls of most rolling duffel bags are poorly designed handles and wheels that don’t roll smoothly. “It can be awkward because duffel bags aren’t made to have wheels, due to their long shape,” she says. “It helps to have large wheels that won’t get stuck in cracks in the ground and a handle design that’s ergonomic and easy to pull up and push down.”</p>
<p>For checked luggage, Erin recommends a duffel made of ballistic materials, which are the most durable.</p>
<p>We also researched buyers’ most highly sought-after features by reading through Amazon reviews and Reddit threads. Based on our findings, we searched for duffels with the following qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two-wheeled, rather than four-wheeled (two-wheeled rollers can handle a variety of surfaces better than four-wheeled; spinner wheels also protrude and take up more space in overhead bins)</li>
<li>An exterior made of nylon (preferably ballistic) or polyester with at least an 800 denier count (see our “Fabric” section below)</li>
<li>A D-shaped or clamshell opening, which is generally easier to access than a slit-style opening</li>
<li>A roomy but well-organized interior</li>
<li>A balanced design that stands up on its own without tipping over</li>
<li>Sturdy, wide-set inline skate wheels</li>
<li>At least two exterior handles plus a base grip for easy carrying and lifting</li>
<li>A smooth telescoping handle</li>
<li>High-quality zippers</li>
<li>Price point below $150</li>
</ul>
<p>We tested two categories of rolling duffels: carry on (around 21 inches in length) and full size (about 30 inches).</p>
<p>For our full-size duffel category, the 30-inch <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005OQZ5ZA/?tag=ybdduff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FŪL &#8211; Tour Manager Deluxe</a> caught our eyes first. Made of durable 1680D ballistic nylon, the bag features a clamshell design that can also transform into one large compartment. We also selected the 30-inch, 1500D-polyester <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010C61G8G/?tag=ybdduff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Olympia &#8211; Drop Bottom Rolling Duffel</a>, which users praise for its lightweight yet sturdy construction.</p>
<p>Our carry-on contenders are the 20-inch <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000HO8F8I/?tag=ybdduff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A. Saks &#8211; Expandable Wheeled Duffel</a>, a spacious, expandable design made of 420D nylon, and the 21-inch expandable <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D45H5P4/?tag=ybdduff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">eBags &#8211; TLS Mother Lode Mini</a>, a reviewer favorite made of 840D and 900D twisted poly.</p>
<h2 id="compare">Compare the best rolling duffel bags</h2>
[table id=327 /]
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Fabric</h3>
<p>Duffel bags are mainly soft-sided and therefore prone to tearing when checked at the airport. So it’s important to choose one that&#8217;s made of sturdy fabric with a high denier count. Denier — the “D” you often see in fabric descriptions (such as 600D, 1200D, etc.) — is a measurement of fabric weight.</p>
<p>Generally, the higher the denier number, the stronger the fabric. However, the measurement is only good for comparing weights within one fabric category (for example, a 600D polyester is actually weaker than a 450D nylon, and so on).</p>
<p>Nylon is a great rip-resistant, durable fabric for luggage, with ballistic and Cordura nylon being the heaviest and sturdiest. Polyester is a more lightweight and less durable option; if you’re going to buy a poly duffel, look for one that’s at least 800D.</p>
<h3>Wheels</h3>
<p>Duffel bags come in two rolling variations: two-wheeled (rollers) and four-wheeled (spinners). Each has its pros and cons, and the choice ultimately comes down to personal preference.</p>
<h3>Two-wheeled</h3>
<p><b>Pros: </b>Wheels tend to be larger and recessed (meaning they’re better protected) and are easier to roll over a variety of surfaces than four-wheelers. They also can be rolled up flights of stairs (spinners have to be lifted up stairs) and can handle speedy maneuvering (like when you’re running to catch your flight at the airport) without catching.</p>
<p><b>Cons: </b>They can only roll forward and backward, and their recessed wheels take up space inside the bag.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Choose a two-wheeled duffel with the wheels placed a good distance apart. If they’re too close together, the bag will tip more easily from side to side.</p>
<h3>Four-wheeled</h3>
<p><b>Pros: </b>Spinners can swivel 360 degrees and be pushed ahead of you or pulled beside or behind you while upright. They don’t pull on the arm and shoulder.</p>
<p><b>Cons: </b>A spinner’s wheels are “on” at all times, so you will need to monitor your bag if you’re on even the slightest incline. Because the wheels aren’t recessed, they take up space in overhead bins and are more susceptible to damage.</p>

<p>To test our duffel contenders, we packed them with clothes, shoes, toiletries and other travel essentials to test capacity, compartment usability and general ease of packing. Then we dragged the duffels over various terrains (pavement, dirt, gravel and cobblestones) and up three flights of stairs to test the quality of their wheels and telescoping handles.</p>
<p>We also carried them by their other handles and lifted the carry-on duffels over our heads to gauge how easy it would be to place them in an overhead bin. We then rated the duffels using these metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive design</li>
<li>Ease of packing</li>
<li>Pockets and compartments</li>
<li>Materials and construction</li>
<li>Zippers</li>
<li>Wheel performance</li>
<li>Top, side and telescoping handles</li>
<li>Ability to stand upright</li>
<li>Aesthetic look</li>
</ul>

<p>The heavy-duty <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005OQZ5ZA/?tag=ybdduff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FŪL &#8211; Tour Manager Deluxe</a> was the clear winner in the full-size category. Made of super-durable 1680D ballistic nylon, the FŪL has a split-level design with a hard-sided, water-resistant bottom. Its wide-set inline skate wheels make for a stable, balanced roll, and its telescoping handle extends smoothly and doesn’t wobble. We also like its heavy-duty oversized zippers, which are easy to grab and don’t catch.</p>
<p>All in all, the FŪL is a pleasure to pack. Duffel bags of this size can sometimes feel like black holes that require lots of digging to find the one thing you need. But the FŪL is thoughtfully segmented to prevent that. Among the outer pockets are two deep compartments at either end of the bag — one perfect for shoes or boots, and another next to the telescoping handle for stowing plane tickets, snacks, and other travel necessities.</p>
<p>The top half of the duffel is separated from the hard-sided bottom compartment by a zippered flap, so travelers have the option of dividing the bag into two self-contained compartments or leaving it as one large compartment accessible from the top opening. The hard sides of the bottom compartment make it especially easy to pack, since they stand upright and don’t fall in on themselves. The duffel’s top opening could be a bit larger for easier access, but it isn’t a dealbreaker.</p>

<p>One feature we found unnecessary and disappointing for such a well-designed bag is the mesh “window” in the middle of the bag’s separator flap. A solid, windowless flap would be a much sturdier choice for dividing the top and bottom compartments. We also wish there were a strap or pocket to stow the flap when unzipped, just to get it out of the way.</p>
<p>Weighing in at 10 pounds when empty, the FŪL is on the heavier side (the Olympia &#8211; Drop Bottom Rolling Duffel weighs about 6.5 pounds). However, if the duffel’s sturdy ballistic nylon and strong construction can hold their own on the tarmac, it’s worth the weight — especially since a similarly sized suitcase weighs about 12 pounds on average. When packed, the FŪL can stand upright on its own, though it did fall over about a third of the time during testing.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The FŪL &#8211; Tour Manager Deluxe is built heavily but solidly, with 1680D ballistic nylon, heavy-duty zippers and wide-set, strong wheels that roll smoothly.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s organized well to make good use of its interior space, with a special pocket for shoes and an interior divider flap to separate the bag into two large compartments.</li>
<li>The FŪL’s clamshell design features a hard-sided bottom that conveniently doesn’t collapse in on itself while packing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Intuitively designed and loaded with well-thought-out features, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008MCZ224/?tag=ybdduff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">eBags &#8211; TLS Mother Lode Mini</a> may just be the perfect carry-on bag. The duffel’s exterior construction is well-designed and solid, remaining upright and refusing to fall over no matter how full we stuffed it (the bag even comes with optional interior rods that can be quickly installed to increase upright support). With large, corner-set inline skate wheels, the duffel rolls smoothly with minimal tipping.</p>
<p>The Mother Lode Mini has a total of four exterior handles, which made it easy to lift horizontally — essential for stowing a carry-on in a plane’s overhead compartment. The bag’s telescoping handle extends to three heights, making it comfortable to pull for travelers of various statures (and kids, too).</p>
<p>We appreciated its stowable strap for securing other luggage on top of the bag, as well as the ID tag tucked securely into a viewable mesh pocket. Even its zipper-pulls are specially designed, ergonomically shaped for the curves of the thumb and forefinger.</p>

<p>Inside the bag, a zippered flap separates the clamshell duffel’s two compartments: a hard-sided bottom half and a soft upper compartment, which can also be accessed via the bag’s top opening. While the bottom half features an optional Velcroed divider, the top compartment includes compression straps that can function for the bag’s one-compartment and two-compartment options. The bag is expandable and also includes exterior compression straps.</p>
<p>Like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005OQZ5ZA/?tag=ybdduff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FŪL &#8211; Tour Manager Deluxe</a>, the duffel’s top opening is disappointingly small and cramped, especially when the interior divider flap is unzipped and you’re left with one large interior compartment. This may be our only criticism of the Mother Lode Mini, and since the bag functions best with its two compartments separated anyway, it’s not a dealbreaker. The trade-off is a hard-sided segment of the soft top compartment that hinders it from opening wider, but it also protects and further stabilizes the bottom of the bag.</p>
<p>In a perfect world the Mother Lode Mini would be made out of nylon rather than 840D and 900D twisted poly. However, polyester with those denier counts is plenty durable for a carry-on duffel.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The expandable eBags &#8211; TLS Mother Lode Mini is loaded with great features and perks designed especially for travelers, such as movable interior compartment dividers, an ID tag and even ergonomically designed zipper pulls.</li>
<li>The duffel stands up extremely well on its own due to a hard-sided bottom half that extends one-third of the way up the front of the bag. The bag also includes optional interior rods that can be installed for extra support.</li>
<li>This duffel features large, smooth-rolling inline skate wheels positioned at the corners of the bag to reduce tipping.</li>
</ul>

<p>With a cheaper price point, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010C61G8G/?tag=ybdduff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Olympia &#8211; Drop Bottom Rolling Duffel</a> is a perfectly good bargain option. Though the Olympia’s 1500D polyester pales in comparison to the FŪL’s brawny 1680D ballistic nylon, the Olympia is lighter in weight, has a wider top opening for better visibility and is well-built for the price. Its inline skate wheels also performed well in our tests, though they aren’t as wide-set and stable as the FŪL’s.</p>
<h3>A. Saks &#8211; Expandable Wheeled Duffel</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25678" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Made of 420D nylon, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000HO8F8I/?tag=ybdduff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A. Saks &#8211; Expandable Wheeled Duffel</a> is built like a traditional soft-sided duffel, with collapsible sides and no hard bottom. It rolls well, though its telescoping handle is a bit wobbly and a good couple of inches shorter than the eBags duffel. The A. Saks doesn’t stand up well on its end. We do like its extra cushy carrying handle, and the bag is expandable.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After assessing four top-rated rolling duffel bags, we named the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005OQZ5ZA/?tag=ybdduff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FŪL &#8211; Tour Manager Deluxe</a> as our pick for best full-size duffel bag. The FŪL duffel won us over with its extremely durable ballistic nylon exterior, superior construction and great use of interior space. While we didn’t love the unnecessary mesh window in the bag’s interior divider flap, it wasn’t a dealbreaker for such a high-quality travel bag.</p>
<p>For the best rolling carry-on duffel bag, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D45H5P4/?tag=ybdduff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">eBags &#8211; TLS Mother Lode Mini</a> was our hands-down favorite, solidly built and packed with perks and features that made it a pleasure to test (despite its smallish zippered top opening).</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>Before selecting backpacks to test, we thoroughly researched the different types of carry-on backpacks and read up on recommendations from travel bloggers. We also consulted with a seasoned flight attendant, who advised that the most important features in a carry-on are light weight, good quality materials and plenty of zippered organizing pockets both inside and out.</p>
<p>Based on what we learned, we made a list of features that comprised the ideal carry-on backpack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exterior dimensions (width plus length plus height) totaling 45 linear inches or less, to comply with standard domestic carry-on requirements.</li>
<li>A capacity of roughly 40 liters, and no more than 45 liters. (An interior volume of 40–45 liters roughly equates to 45 total linear inches.)</li>
<li>Bags with clamshell or panel-loading openings, so packed belongings can be seen clearly and accessed easily.</li>
<li>A well-padded, easy-to-access laptop compartment with at least a 15-inch capacity, preferably positioned against the back plate (the most efficient location, in terms of weight bearing).</li>
<li>Zippered pockets for storage.</li>
<li>A streamlined exterior without too much bulk.</li>
<li>Multiple handles (for lifting the bag in and out of overhead bins).</li>
<li>Comfortable, stowable shoulder straps and a breathable back panel. Bonus points for a sternum strap and hip belt.</li>
<li>Exterior and interior compression straps.</li>
<li>No wheels (to lessen weight).</li>
</ul>
<p>With these standards in mind, we hunted for potential backpacks to test that aligned with our desired features, reading through trusted review sites, Amazon reviews and YouTube video reviews. Aiming for affordability, we also weeded out any contenders priced over $100.</p>

<p>We packed each backpack with a laptop and enough clothing, toiletries and other supplies for a four-day trip. We then tested and judged them using the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Backpack capacity</li>
<li>Ease of packing</li>
<li>Laptop compartment</li>
<li>Comfort during wear</li>
<li>Carrying comfort</li>
<li>Exterior design</li>
<li>Construction quality</li>

<p>It was a very close call between the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J24H6MO/?tag=ybdcaron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AmazonBasics &#8211; Carry-On Travel Backpack</a> and our runner-up. Ultimately, the AmazonBasics backpack won out in a few key areas: its comfort level, laptop compartment and compression straps.</p>
<p>With an ultra-cushy back plate and well-padded mesh straps, the AmazonBasics pack was the most comfortable to wear on our backs for an extended period of time. Though its optional waist belt is nothing to write home about, its sternum strap felt solid and stabilizing. The back of the bag also has a strap to secure it to a suitcase’s telescoping handle.</p>
<p>The backpack’s poly exterior features built-in compression straps, one deep front pocket and a larger front compartment with mesh pockets and plenty of interior organization. The bag also comes with a padded shoulder strap that can be clipped on to wear the pack like a messenger bag.</p>
<p>The AmazonBasics bag’s lockable laptop compartment is the most well-padded and protected of all of the backpacks we tested and is elevated above the bottom of the pack to guard against impact.</p>

<p>You won’t find any bells or whistles inside the main clamshell compartment — just simple compression straps and a zippered mesh pocket in the top lid — but you will find plenty of space. The bag is already roomy and expands further to allow for even more packing space inside. Unfortunately, the top mesh pocket doesn’t span the full width of the lid, falling short by about 5 inches and limiting valuable packing space.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>With a plush back plate and shoulder straps, the AmazonBasics &#8211; Carry-On Travel Backpack is the most comfortable of all the backpacks we tested.</li>
<li>Its laptop compartment is well-padded and elevated above the bottom of the bag.</li>
<li>The backpack features a spacious interior that’s expandable, though the top lid’s mesh interior pocket is puzzlingly narrow.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GTBP3Y7/?tag=ybdcaron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">eBags &#8211; eTech 3.0</a> is a well-made bag with a high-quality dobby polyester exterior and large, sturdy ergonomic zipper pulls. Though the bag’s back plate is just as well-padded as the AmazonBasics backpack, its shoulder straps are slightly less plush than its rival’s.</p>
<p>The backpack offers two shallow front pockets and a larger organized compartment, plus a deep, slim pocket perfect for magazines and other in-flight reading material. The eBags’ laptop compartment is noticeably less padded and not as well protected as the one in the AmazonBasics backpack, but it is lockable, elevated above the bottom of the bag and lined with soft felt.</p>
<p>The eBags pack’s main clamshell compartment is roomy and practically identical to the AmazonBasics interior. The eBags backpack has a leg up in this area, with a mesh top compartment that extends all the way to the edge of the lid to make full use of the space available. The eBags’ top and side handles are also cushier and more comfortable to carry than those on the AmazonBasics bag — something to keep in mind if you plan to carry your bag less like a backpack and more like a suitcase.</p>

<p>Like the AmazonBasics bag, the eBags pack has a streamlined exterior, though it may err too far on the side of minimalism: It only includes one exterior compression strap that’s detached from the bag. To us, this feature seems unwieldy and more trouble than it’s worth to put on and take off every time you want to access the pack’s compartments.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The eBags &#8211; eTech 3.0 is made of high-quality materials, with strong ergonomic zipper pulls and a cushy back plate, though its shoulder straps are not as well-padded as those on the AmazonBasics bag.</li>
<li>The eBags interior is basically twinning with the AmazonBasics, though the former offers more interior mesh pocket space.</li>
<li>Though it isn’t as well-cushioned as the AmazonBasics, the eBags backpack’s laptop compartment is lined with soft felt, offers moderate cushioning and is positioned above the bottom of the bag for protection.</li>
</ul>

<p>Made of “splash-resistant” nylon, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F255JP9/?tag=ybdcaron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Inateck</a> is an excellent, high-quality travel pack that happens to have a less spacious main compartment than our winning backpack and runner-up.</p>
<p>The Inateck is generous with its padding, offering a very well-cushioned lockable laptop compartment, back plate, straps and carrying handles. Though a side shoulder strap is not included with this bag, it does have an adjustable water bottle holder and handy elasticized rain cover.</p>
<p>The Inateck is also the only backpack we tested with little zippered pouches sewn into its straps, large enough to hold credit cards, ID, cash, lip balm, etc. We also loved the horizontal zippered compartment at the base of the back plate, which would be ideal for storing valuables during wear.</p>

<p>The only panel-loading backpack in the bunch, the Inateck lacks interior compression straps, but it does include a vinyl pouch for toiletries and two mesh interior pockets in its main compartment. On its exterior, there are two front slash pockets (one of which has interior pockets and sleeves) and sturdy compression straps.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The “splash-resistant” nylon Inateck features quality construction and durable materials, though it offers less interior packing space than the AmazonBasics and eBags backpacks.</li>
<li>The Inateck’s padding is luxurious throughout, with a well-protected laptop compartment and cushioning for comfort.</li>
<li>The Inateck features a rain cover, a vinyl storage pouch and zippered pockets in the shoulder straps and against the back plate.</li>

<h3>eBags &#8211; TLS Mother Lode Weekender</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25665" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/motherlode-solo.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/motherlode-solo.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/motherlode-solo-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/motherlode-solo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/motherlode-solo-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/motherlode-solo-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/motherlode-solo-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/motherlode-solo-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/motherlode-solo-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/motherlode-solo-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/motherlode-solo-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/motherlode-solo-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>With its roomy interior, cushy shoulder straps and bonus features like a USB port, detachable toiletry pouch and customizable interior dividers, we were ready to rank the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QBB5QQD/?tag=ybdcaron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">eBags &#8211; TLS Mother Lode Weekender</a> at the top of our list — until we opened the laptop compartment. Unfortunately, the bag’s flimsy “laptop sling” is unpadded and not nearly secure enough. We were also disappointed that the bag’s back plate was so poorly padded — a missed opportunity for both carrying comfort and laptop cushioning.</p>
<h3>Dinictis</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25662" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dinictus-solo.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dinictus-solo.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dinictus-solo-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dinictus-solo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dinictus-solo-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dinictus-solo-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dinictus-solo-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dinictus-solo-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dinictus-solo-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dinictus-solo-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dinictus-solo-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dinictus-solo-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QDWZ8KV/?tag=ybdcaron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dinictis</a> is an okay bag that left us feeling lukewarm. Its laptop compartment is barely padded and unfortunately located in the front of the bag. Dinictis was also stingy with its back-plate padding. We did like the backpack’s expandable water bottle holder and the zippered plastic compartment for toiletries inside the main compartment.</p>
<h3>Hynes Eagle</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25669" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07432ZH6M/?tag=ybdcaron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hynes Eagle</a> design was very similar to that of the Dinictus. Not only was its laptop compartment sparsely padded and located in the front of the bag, it also rested directly on the bottom of the pack, providing no protection from impact. The backpack’s materials felt a little flimsy compared to our winners, though this bag does get points for its large zipper pulls and expandable water bottle holder.</p>
<h3>G4Free</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25668" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>At the bottom of the totem pole is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H2SFNT3/?tag=ybdcaron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">G4Free</a>, which was not up to the standard of the other bags we tested. The G4Free doesn’t have a dedicated laptop compartment; travelers would have to stow their computers inside the main clamshell compartment or in the back sleeve, where the backpack’s straps are meant to be stored. The bag’s compression straps also failed us, loosening as soon as we let go of them.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Our winning carry-on backpack, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J24H6MO/?tag=ybdcaron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AmazonBasics</a>, won us over with its large interior capacity, quality laptop compartment and cushioned comfort. We also liked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GTBP3Y7/?tag=ybdcaron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">eBags &#8211; eTech 3.0</a>, which is just as roomy and offers a well-padded back plate and ergonomic zipper pulls.</p>
<p>Our recommendation for light packers is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F255JP9/?tag=ybdcaron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Inateck &#8211; Travel Backpack</a>, a luxe, comfortably cushioned backpack with a well-padded laptop compartment and clever features like a hidden zippered compartment positioned against the back during wear.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>or college students, a backpack is not just a backpack; it’s a constant on-campus companion and portable locker. To find the best bags for the task, we put five highly rated laptop backpacks through the ringer, loading them up with the average college student’s everyday essentials and testing them for capacity, organization, comfort, support and water-resistance.</p>
<p>We chose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KSYM4Q6/?tag=ybdbpack-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InCase &#8211; Icon</a> as the best backpack for college. It’s a sleek, structured, well-organized backpack made of strong, water-resistant ballistic nylon that has a compartment for anything a student could need on campus. Our runner-up pick is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MTQ663B/?tag=ybdbpack-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fjallraven &#8211; Raven 28</a>, a spacious, durable, water-resistant pack with a classic design that received high marks for comfort.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>To kick off our research, we interviewed college students to find out what they actually lugged around on their backs on an average day. In general, these items included a laptop, tablet, phone, binder, planner, heavy textbook, keys and a variety of pens.</p>
<p>A laptop sleeve was vital: Most students said that while they only carried books when they would need them for class, they rarely left home without their computers. They also preferred plenty of pockets, as well as space for workout clothes in case they decided to hit the gym after class. We also discovered that, in general, they preferred durability and comfort over a “dope” backpack design.</p>
<p>With this info in mind, we set out to find the top-rated backpacks on Amazon with especially high-rated laptop compartments. We also scoured Reddit for backpack recommendations from college students that aligned with our metrics, aiming for durable, high-quality bags under $200 that could endure all four years of college.</p>
<p>First on our list was the InCase &#8211; Icon, a sleek, well-constructed backpack with a plethora of interior compartments and pockets, including a protected laptop compartment. The Timbuk2 &#8211; Spire’s large capacity and quick-access laptop opening impressed us as well. We also wanted to give the Fjallraven &#8211; Raven 28 the old college try, since it had gotten great reviews for its comfort and quality laptop sleeve.</p>
<p>The most utilitarian of the group was the SwissGear &#8211; 1900 ScanSmart, an Amazon darling that got top marks for its large capacity and durability. Rounding out our lineup was the North Face &#8211; Recon, a sportier ripstop backpack that came highly recommended for its roomy design and lasting power.</p>

<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Fabric</h3>
<p>When buying a backpack, you’ll most likely be choosing between four of the common fabrics used in backpack manufacturing: nylon, polyester, canvas and ripstop.</p>
<h3>Nylon</h3>
<p><strong>The good</strong>: Known for its durability and strength, nylon is water- and mold-resistant and currently the most popular backpack material choice.</p>
<p><strong>The bad</strong>: Nylon has poor UV resistance, meaning the fabric can weaken when exposed to the sun for extended periods of time.</p>
<h3>Polyester</h3>
<p><strong>The good</strong>: Cheaper than nylon, polyester is recyclable and highly UV-resistant.</p>
<p><strong>The bad</strong>: It’s less durable than nylon.</p>
<h3>Canvas</h3>
<p><strong>The good</strong>: The classic backpack material, canvas is nylon’s predecessor and quite strong and durable. Waxed canvas, which is water-resistant, has been making a comeback with cool-kid brands like Fjallraven and Herschel.</p>
<p><strong>The bad</strong>: Canvas is generally heavy unless it’s blended with synthetic fibers to lighten the weight of the fabric.</p>
<h3>Ripstop</h3>
<p><strong>The good</strong>: Originally developed for parachutes in World War II and made to be especially tough, ripstop is sewn in a grid pattern designed to stop ripping in its tracks.</p>
<p><strong>The bad</strong>: Ripstop is useful for college backpacks if blended with strong fabrics (such as nylon), but it can wear quickly when blended with lighter fabrics, since the lightweight fabric threads and strong ripstop threads wear at different rates.</p>
<h3>Fabric weight</h3>
<p>You’ve probably seen backpack fabrics described cryptically with a number followed by a “D” (such as 600D, 1200D, etc.). The “D” stands for denier, which is a fabric weight measurement. Generally, a higher denier number equals stronger fabric; however, this measurement is only good for comparing weights within one fabric category (for example, a 600D polyester is actually weaker than a 450D nylon).</p>
<h3>Zippers</h3>
<p>When it comes to weather-resistance, your backpack’s zipper makes all the difference. Unless your bag features a truly waterproof zipper (like the TIZIP and YKK AquaSeal), there will always be a chance that water will sneak in. You can help safeguard against this with high-quality zippers and zipper flaps, and also by choosing a bag with less entry points exposed to the elements (such as a roll-top backpack).</p>
<h3>Comfort and support</h3>
<h4>Straps</h4>
<p>Well-padded straps are a no-brainer when it comes to backpack comfort. But what kind of padding is best for all-day comfort? Closed-cell foam, which has closed-off cells to seal off the foam’s interior from air, is flatter and denser than open-cell foam and provides better long-term support. Look for terms like “dual density” and “EVA” in product descriptions.</p>
<p>Also important for comfort is the width and placement of the straps. Wider straps placed farther apart provide better weight distribution, and prevent rubbing on the neck and under the arms. A sternum strap can also help distribute weight evenly across the body. (Pro tip: sternum straps should fall about 1 inch below your collarbone.)</p>
<h4>Back panel</h4>
<p>A padded back panel is important for comfort. However, if the bag’s laptop compartment is located against the back of the bag, you’ll want some rigidity there to protect your computer from impact.</p>
<h4>Laptop compartment</h4>

<p>To protect your computer, you’ll want a laptop compartment with plenty of structured padding and shock protection. A compartment that hovers above the bottom of the bag or has a padded base is best. If the compartment is located against the back of the bag, the back panel should also be heavily protected with sturdy padding. Also consider the size of the compartment; you’ll want to choose one that matches your laptop closely to prevent your computer from shifting around too much.</p>

<p>To test our backpacks contenders, we loaded them up with the supplies our surveyed college students told us they carried: a laptop (ours was a 15-inch), tablet, phone, binder, planner, heavy textbook, keys and a variety of pens. We also threw in a pair of sneakers and gym clothes for good measure.</p>
<p>After packing up the backpacks, carrying them around, testing the accessibility of their compartments and giving them a good rinse in a simulated rain shower, we rated each of the packs. While we kept functionality and comfort top of mind, we did give a few extra points to the backpacks that looked cool as well (these are for college students, after all). We judged the backpacks using the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>How would you rate the capacity and interior organization of the backpack?</li>
<li>How accessible was the laptop compartment, and how well was it padded and protected?</li>
<li>How comfortable did you feel wearing this backpack?</li>
<li>Was it breathable?</li>
<li>How would you rate the bag’s back support?</li>
<li>Were the backpack’s materials durable?</li>
<li>Was the construction high quality?</li>
<li>How well did you like the aesthetic look of the backpack?</li>
<li>Is this pack worth its price?</li>
</ul>

<p>For college students, we highly recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KSYM4Q6/?tag=ybdbpack-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InCase &#8211; Icon</a>. Sleek and compact on the outside, the 17-liter Icon is surprisingly roomy on the inside and superbly organized, with a laptop compartment, separate tablet compartment, two large main compartments, front zippered pocket and fleece-lined top pocket (for sunglasses, phone, keys, etc.).</p>
<p>Within the bag’s main compartments are plenty of zippered and Velcro pockets, pen holders and large sleeves for holding books, binders and papers. There seems to be a designated place for everything in this backpack, which makes it a cinch to find and extract exactly what you need without having to dig around. The only pockets it lacks, unfortunately, are water bottle holders.</p>
<p>Located against the back of the pack, the Icon’s laptop compartment is well-padded and lined with soft fleece to prevent surface scratches. With all of the thought and care that clearly went into the design of this backpack, we were surprised that the laptop compartment isn’t raised up from the bottom of the bag. However, since the bottom of the compartment has a padded flap to soften any impact in that area, it isn’t a dealbreaker.</p>
<p>We were impressed with the Icon’s sturdy construction and standout intuitive design; the other backpacks in our lineup felt floppy and second-rate by comparison. With its solid, square base, the Icon is the only backpack in our lineup that stands up easily on its own, whether it’s empty or filled to bursting. Because of its clean, structured design, the Icon is not bulky and lays relatively flat against the body.</p>

<p>This pack is made of durable materials, with an 840D ballistic nylon exterior, thick cushioning and smooth zippers that seemed incapable of snagging. In our rain-shower tests, water simply beaded up and rolled right off the Icon’s water-resistant surface.</p>
<p>The Icon is also a standout in terms of fit, with three sets of adjustable straps that can be fine-tuned for different heights and body types: shoulder straps, a sternum strap (adjustable both laterally and vertically) and load stabilizer straps on each shoulder to tighten or loosen depending on how much weight you’re carrying.</p>
<p>The Icon’s top carrying handle and shoulder straps are well-padded and comfortable, with cushioning that extends across the trapezius area for additional comfort and weight distribution. The bag’s back plate, while supportive, is made of dense foam that some may find a bit too stiff.</p>
<p>This backpack gets bonus points for its sleek monochrome design, which is sophisticated enough to transition easily from college to the workplace.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The InCase &#8211; Icon is superbly organized with a variety of well-placed pockets and compartments for virtually anything you would want to bring on campus.</li>
<li>The Icon features a well-padded, fleece-lined laptop compartment. Though it isn’t positioned above the bottom of the pack, the compartment base includes cushioning to soften impact.</li>
<li>Made of durable 840D ballistic nylon that’s truly water-resistant, the Icon features high-quality materials throughout, including smooth zippers and thick shoulder cushioning. The foam back plate, though a little stiff, provides good back support.</li>

<p>Coming in second place is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MTQ663B/?tag=ybdbpack-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fjallraven &#8211; Raven 28</a>. Unlike its boxy hipster cousin, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G4ZYFXI/?tag=ybdbpack-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fjallraven Kanken</a>, the Raven 28 is a more classically shaped backpack that’s reminiscent of Jansport’s old <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018JIU2C/?tag=ybdbpack-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">standby</a>. As its name suggests, the Raven 28 has a spacious 28-liter capacity. This gives it more breathing room than our top pick, the InCase &#8211; Icon, though considerably less structure (the Raven cannot stand up vertically on its own).</p>
<p>The bag’s back compartment includes a well-padded laptop sleeve partially lined in fleece fabric and positioned above the bottom of the bag, as well as a tablet sleeve. The center compartment is pocketless and cavernous, making it perfect for large items like books, binders and gym clothes. The two front compartments include a good number of open sleeves and zippered pockets for pens, keys and other odds and ends. A small, fleece-lined top pocket is perfect for sunglasses or a phone.</p>
<p>The Raven 28 is made of Fjallraven&#8217;s durable G-1000 fabric (65% polyester and 35% cotton), which is treated with Greenland Wax and touted as water-resistant and quick-drying. However, in our tests the Raven 28’s exterior wasn’t as impervious as that of the InCase &#8211; Icon; though water did bead up and flow off its surface, the G-1000 fabric took longer to dry. Regardless, the items inside the backpack did remain dry.</p>

<p>Unlike the Icon’s three-point adjustment system, the Raven 28’s shoulder straps are only adjustable at one point. However, they are nicely cushioned, and we found the pack comfortable to wear for an extended period of time. The Raven’s back plate is well-padded but not too stiff; some may find it more comfortable than the Icon’s structured back plate. We thought the bag’s leather-top handle could use at least a little padding.</p>
<p>The Raven 28 has a nicely understated look; the only wink to the popular Fjallraven brand is its fox logo, stitched onto a little leather patch on its front pocket. Though not as office-appropriate as the InCase Icon, the Raven 28 is a durable and all-around great campus companion for college students.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The 28-liter Fjallraven &#8211; Raven 28 provides spacious storage and plenty of pockets for on-campus essentials, including a well-padded laptop compartment positioned above the bottom of the pack.</li>
<li>The Raven 28 features strong, durable construction and high-quality, water-resistant materials.</li>
<li>Though not as structured as the InCase &#8211; Icon, the Raven 28 is well-cushioned and comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="others">Other products we tested</h2>
<p>Though the InCase &#8211; Icon and Fjallraven &#8211; Raven 28 stood out as the best backpacks for college students with laptops, the other backpacks in our lineup were high performers as well.</p>

<p>We liked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M480ON4/?tag=ybdbpack-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Timbuk2 &#8211; Spire</a>’s cool rolltop look and well-protected laptop compartment, which was positioned above the bottom of the pack. However, the pack’s single large compartment is quite large and would benefit from more separation and organization. We were also annoyed by the top flap’s hook closure, which was consistently awkward to unlatch, as well as its noisy Velcro flap, which would be disruptive in class and the library.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HNAC7J6/?tag=ybdbpack-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SwissGear &#8211; 1900 ScanSmart</a> is very comfortable and supportive to wear, but we were disappointed with its odd laptop compartment, which only has a single strap to hold our computer in place. It simply didn’t feel secure enough for our 15-inch MacBook Pro.</p>
<h3>North Face &#8211; Recon</h3>

<p>We had similar issues with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07657ZZ4M/?tag=ybdbpack-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">North Face &#8211; Recon</a>, which is roomy and well-constructed with a weak laptop compartment, and lacking the padding and support needed for proper protection. The Recon’s thin fabric also felt too flimsy for carrying a heavy load of electronics and books around campus.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>It’s essential for a college student’s backpack to have a well-protected laptop compartment, as well as a good balance of comfort and durability.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KSYM4Q6/?tag=ybdbpack-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InCase &#8211; Icon</a> has these qualities in spades. An intuitively designed backpack featuring sturdy structure, hardy materials and a wealth of organization pockets and compartments, the Icon is our top pick for college students.</p>
<p>Our runner-up is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MTQ663B/?tag=ybdbpack-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fjallraven &#8211; Raven 28</a>, a classically designed, spacious backpack that’s comfortable to wear and made of durable materials.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We tested ten of the best drywall anchors and found that the E-Z Ancor - Toggle Anchor is ideal for mounting decor without a stud for support.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e found eight of the strongest and most innovative products that will help you install your decor and even moderately-heavy shelves on standard drywall without a wooden or metal stud for support. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2JVJE2/?tag=ybddrwlanch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">E-Z Ancor &#8211; Toggle Anchor</a> is the best drywall anchor for most jobs, with easy self-drilling installation and enough support for moderately heavy loads. If you need maximum strength, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0050SWSWU/?tag=ybddrwlanch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wing-Its &#8211; Master Anchor</a> will hold fast until you pull your wall apart, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001KVMNPI/?tag=ybddrwlanch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Monkey Hooks</a> are great for decorating.</p>
<h2>How we selected</h2>
<p>Everyone who owns a screwdriver probably knows that drywall isn&#8217;t strong enough by itself to support cabinets, flat-screen TVs or large mirrors. But many of us need a way to mount in a specific location without the support of a wooden stud, and few of us can add a brace just for decorating.</p>
<p>Every handyman has different preferences for fasteners, and drywall anchors see a lot of debate. We looked for recommendations from handyman blogs, forums, and publications like This Old House to narrow down what we were expecting from anchors we found.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/lHb-Tcvkn7M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProjectFarm&#8217;s channel on YouTube</a> has an admirable dedication to thorough testing of products like these, so we were eager to check well-reviewed products they didn&#8217;t test and to verify their results.</p>
<p>After compiling a list of all the top recommended anchors, we eliminated basic options that weren&#8217;t at least rated to the strength of an easy-to-use self-drilling anchor like the Toggler &#8211; SnapSkru. We also eliminated options like molly bolts that require extra work for little return in actual strength for a drywall installation.</p>
<p>When multiple vendors made the same product, we picked the option with better reviews, a better price or better availability. (In that order of priority.)</p>
<p>We tested a cast-zinc anchor that is supposed to help in situations where you might accidentally hit a stud, but it fared so poorly in testing (it held half the weight of pop-open plastic anchors) we didn&#8217;t include it in the final list.</p>
<h2>Important features to consider</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/drywall-16-9.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p><strong>Installation type</strong> &#8211; If you&#8217;re handy with a screw gun, you probably won&#8217;t blink at pre-drilling holes, but you can save a lot of time with self-drilling anchors. Hammer-in anchors are also an option, though pushing through the drywall backing paper can tear it and make a weak spot. A sharp awl and a drywall saw can be even easier than a drill, so long as you keep your hole centered.</p>
<p><strong>Support type &#8211;</strong> Pop-open anchors are easy to install and hold well compared to drywall alone, but if you want to hold up a shelf you need an anchor that spreads the weight out. The biggest factor in anchor strength for most applications is how well the anchor spreads tensile load (pulling away from the wall) across a wide area of the inside of the drywall sheet. Look for a two-piece design with a brace inside the wall that clamps down when you tighten your screw through the anchor.</p>
<p><strong>Reusable designs &#8211;</strong> Some anchors will pop out of the wall easily when you remove the screw, but others will require prying or even poking around with wire inside the screw hole to straighten the flip-out anchor so you can pull it out. A few designs are basically permanent, so you need to make a larger hole to remove them.</p>
<p><strong>Hole and flange size &#8211;</strong> If you&#8217;ve got the world&#8217;s strongest anchor but it leaves an ugly plastic flange sticking out past the edge of your shelf bracket, it&#8217;s not much help. Some anchors also require making holes in your wall as big as 3/4&#8243;.</p>
<p><strong>Screw size &#8211;</strong> If you&#8217;ve got a particular bracket you need to bolt to the wall, note the size of the holes and compare your options. A small high-strength machine screw can still work with a larger bracket hole if you add a fender washer, but an oversize screw won&#8217;t go through a small hole unless you get out the drill.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We researched and tested the best garage shelving racks from major retailers and found that the Gladiator - Heavy Duty Wire Rack is the best way to organize your garage.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter researching online and inspecting popular options at national chain stores, we bought the top sellers and found that the <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/Gladiator-18-in-D-x-48-in-W-x-72-in-H-4-Tier-Steel-Freestanding-Shelving-Unit-NSF-Certified/1000219111" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gladiator &#8211; Heavy Duty Rack</a> with wire deck is the best garage shelving rack. With center-braced 48-by-18-inch shelves and pre-welded components for easy assembly, this is a great way to keep your garage organized. If you want more flexibility, the 14-inch-deep <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071DZHLXH/?tag=ybdgarsu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon Basics &#8211; Wire Racks</a> are an affordable way to store smaller items.</p>
<h2>How we selected</h2>
<p>Our garage testing team has built and maintained everything from cheap two-by-four shelves in farm sheds to pallet racks at an audio-video rental warehouse. We spent a long time narrowing down the available options. If you&#8217;ve got a particular shelving need, there&#8217;s someone out there who makes a product or has a DIY plan.</p>
<p>But to find out specifically what most garage enthusiasts are installing, we scoured forums like garagejournal.com, grassrootsmotorsports.com and survivalistboards.com for garage storage ideas. We also checked garage and workshop storage system reviews on YouTube and Reddit.</p>
<h3>Only shelves under $200</h3>
<p>After considering industrial pallet racks shelving that&#8217;s designed to hold loaded freight pallets, we decided to eliminate anything that costs above $200 per shelf. The weight capacity of more expensive shelves is better if you want to store a spare engine for your muscle car, but pallet racks are tricky to assemble and not as efficient when you just need a place for your collection of <a href="http://yourbestdigs.com/reviews/best-storage-containers/">heavy-duty storage tubs</a>.</p>
<h3>Only tool-free, free-standing shelves</h3>
<p>If you leave out industrial and DIY options, the obvious choice is tool-free shelving kits. The components are simple, but when you slide them all together the resulting shelf is strong.</p>
<p>If you want to install drawers or cabinet doors on your shelves there are purpose-built systems available, but free-standing shelves are far more versatile and a better buy in most cases. Cabinets are nice if you do painting work or make a lot of dust in your garage, but most of the time the doors are just in the way.</p>
<p>We compared all the tool-free-assembly shelves we could find locally with popular models online, and bought a less-expensive and a more-expensive option in both wire-rack shelving and boltless shelving. Except for one, these designs all turned out to be generic. Edsal makes most of the boltless shelving that&#8217;s sold in hardware stores, and wire rack shelving is even harder to tell apart.</p>
<h2>Important features to consider</h2>

    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/garageshelfassembly.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p><b>Shelf material &#8211; </b>If you need water or mildew resistance because you&#8217;re parking wet vehicles right next to your storage, wire shelving is your best bet. In less demanding conditions, chip-board shelves are stiff and fairly attractive and can be painted to protect it.</p>
<p><b>True weight capacity &#8211; </b>A shelf&#8217;s maximum load rating (often in hundreds of pounds) assumes evenly spread weight and is determined by the strength of the frame. If you weigh down the middle of an unsupported chip-board shelf with even half that much weight, it will bow or even break. Of the boltless clip-together shelving units we tested, only the Gladiator comes with a center support bracket, though you can sometimes buy aftermarket supports. Wire rack shelving is more rigid because the shelves have truss-reinforced welded side support.</p>
<p><b>Shelf dimensions &#8211;</b> Check carefully for how much space you have in your garage, and remember that you&#8217;ll need room to stand in front of the shelves. The most common shelf depth is 18 inches, which holds most of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-storage-containers/">the best storage containers</a> in smaller and medium sizes. If you want to load up <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-lawn-mower/">a 21-inch lawn mower</a> for the winter, you&#8217;ll need to pick a deeper 24-inch version of these shelves.</p>
<p><b>Tool-free assembly &#8211;</b> Screwing or bolting together shelves is tedious work. Tool-free shelves, like the models we tested, will save you some time and frustration. The first shelf is always tricky if you&#8217;re assembling by yourself, though.</p>
<p><b>Wheels or anchors &#8211;  </b>Some shelving comes with holes in the bottom of the shelf uprights so you can anchor it to a floor; boltless shelves aren&#8217;t solid enough that you can move them around. Wire racks, on the other hand, are fairly stiff and rigid, so you can order them with casters that let you move your parts shelf around the garage as you work.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After testing the top-selling brands, we've picked the Rubbermaid - Roughneck as the best storage containers for closet and garage.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter testing seven different types of containers side-by-side and taking a close look at materials, we&#8217;re confident that the classic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KBJ46LK/?tag=ybdstorcon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Roughneck</a> bin is still the best storage container. These polyethylene tubs are tough, so they won&#8217;t shatter in cold storage or when dropped like most bins will. If you&#8217;ve got less demanding needs, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MWTJX2S/?tag=ybdstorcon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ziploc &#8211; Weathershield</a> containers let you see what&#8217;s inside, they&#8217;re water-tight and they come in stackable combinations.</p>
<h2>How we selected</h2>
<p>Our test team has been using storage containers to organize nearly every part of their eclectic lives: In homes, on the farm, at warehouses and even for travel. Over the years, our testers have bought numerous brands and styles of storage containers for different applications. Some have served faithfully for decades in storage sheds, while some were only good for a year before cracking.</p>
<p>We carefully examined lids and materials on all the bins we could find at four different retailers, and cross-referenced with online reviews from sites like Wirecutter, Art of Cleanliness, and Reddit.</p>
<h3>The beloved classic</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KBJ46LK/?tag=ybdstorcon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Roughneck</a> containers are made of flexible, tough polyethylene, and most discussion board posts we read agree that they&#8217;re the gold standard for rugged and reliable storage.</p>
<p>The downside we saw immediately to the Roughneck is that many retailers have stopped keeping them on store shelves and require you to buy sets of six or eight tubs to justify the not-exactly-free shipping.</p>
<p>Sadly, most retailers are now mostly stocking alternatives that only look similar to Rubbermaid&#8217;s styling. In a few cases the polypropylene imitators had cracked while they were still on the store shelf.</p>
<h3>Alternatives</h3>
<p>We found one other affordable polyethylene bin, the Sterilite &#8211; Ultra, with better in-store availability and some design trade-offs. We dismissed other imitators that look more similar to Roughneck&#8217;s construction, but with the same availability issues and poor reviews.</p>
<p>We also sought out the most affordable containers we&#8217;d still trust to keep in storage and found a few options that have compelling features to make up for reduced durability compared to tough polyethylene bins.</p>
<p>We looked into sealed roto-molded containers from brands like Pelican and SKB, but the prices aren&#8217;t justifiable unless you&#8217;re transporting delicate devices to the field or on flights every day. Other large freight-quality shipping containers are a neat idea, but also too expensive for garage or closet storage. We did pick up a Rubbermaid &#8211; Brute commercial-grade container, to see just how much tougher it is to justify the big price jump over Roughneck bins.</p>
<h2>Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Materials: Polyethylene vs. polypropylene &#8211;</b> Low-density polyethylene (stamped on the bottom as LDPE, recycling group number four) is more flexible than stiff, cheap polypropylene (recycling group five), so it won&#8217;t crack as easily if you drop a loaded bin on the garage floor. It also won&#8217;t become brittle at freezing temperatures the way polypropylene does.</p>

<p>Each material has some advantages. <a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/lab-plasticware-supplies/plastic-material-selection/polypropylene-pp-labware.html#pp-physical" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polypropylene</a> can be made see-through, and it&#8217;s much more heat resistant — all the way up to boiling temperatures. <a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/lab-plasticware-supplies/plastic-material-selection/low-density-polyethylene-ldpe-labware.html#ldpe-physical" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LDPE</a> is always tougher, but it gets very soft at temperatures above 110 degrees fahrenheit and melts in boiling water. Our testers have seen far more polypropylene bins fail in long-term storage, especially in cold climates, but in a baking-hot attic you&#8217;d want to be very careful about how much weight stack on an LDPE bin.</p>
<p><b>Latching lids &#8211;</b> A flip-up latch will hold your bin closed even if you over-stuff it, which is handy for things like bulky sweaters and puffy blankets. If you put too much strain on latches, though, they&#8217;re prone to pop out of the mounting holes. Those holes also mean an entry point for moisture and insects.</p>
<p><b>A waterproof seal &#8211;</b> If you just need a bin to shed rain, almost any will do: with one exception, the lids we tested cover the edge of the bin, which means water will roll off without getting inside. A totally sealed lid (like our top pick) will also keep out humidity, though damp items can mildew quickly if you&#8217;re not careful about what you put in the bin.</p>
<p><b>Stackable designs &#8211;</b> Nearly any bin can stand on top of another, but some designs are able to neatly mix and match small and large bins while creating a topple-resistant tower.</p>
<p><b>Single-size lids &#8211;</b> If you&#8217;re building a collection of storage containers to fully organize your life, it can be handy to have bins with same-size openings. This usually means you can stack and nest different sizes as well as sharing lids between them. Usually there will be at least two sizes in a series of containers with a common lid and footprint size, with the difference in volume made up by height.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected containers to test</h2>
<p>Whether you’re looking to reorganize your kitchen cabinets or pantry or want to prevent pests from burrowing into flour, sugar and other baking ingredients, dry food storage containers that are functional and airtight are essential.</p>
<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, Tupperware was the most recognized brand for food storage containers, and even today, it’s still used as a generic term for all plastic containers. Although Tupperware expanded globally, the company’s sales are primarily made by private parties, while its competitor, the less-expensive Rubbermaid, can be purchased virtually anywhere.</p>
<p>We previously <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-food-storage-container/">reviewed food storage containers</a> that are made for refrigerating, freezing and reheating food, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a>, was our top pick for plastic containers.</p>
<p>For this review of containers for storing dry goods, we added Brilliance&#8217;s line of containers and another well-reviewed Rubbermaid product to our list to see how they held up to other highly rated containers. Amazon reviewers give a lot of love to certain containers, so we selected those that had at least a 4.3-star rating.</p>
<p>Since not everyone wants to use plastic, we decided to test acrylic and glass containers as well to determine whether they were better than plastic for storage of dry goods. The majority of dry food storage containers are sold as sets of three or more different sizes, and even though many may be bought separately, it’s more cost-effective to purchase them as a set.</p>

<p>Every container we tested was heralded as airtight, which is especially important for storing flour, sugar and rice, since they are prone to infestation by Indian-meal moths, more commonly known as pantry moths.</p>
<p>To test whether a container was airtight, we sealed a piece of toilet tissue inside each container, locked its lid and then plunged it into two gallons of water. We held the container under water and revolved it several times. When we removed the container from the water and unsealed the lid, if the tissue paper was wet, the container wasn’t airtight. Only three of the seven storage containers we tested were 100 percent airtight.</p>
<p>Overall, dry food storage containers are either tall rectangles or cylinders. Some were slender modulars, no taller than 10 inches, designed to fit in most kitchen cabinets. Although they would look attractive on a countertop, these containers were too narrow to hold a five-pound bag of flour or to allow scooping flour out with a one-cup measuring cup.</p>
<p>Some people might only want containers for beans, rice and pasta, but we leaned heavily toward those that stored baking ingredients in a shape that allows easy access.</p>

<p>Not only were the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LWS0LK9/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Progressive &#8211; Prepworks ProKeeper</a> containers airtight, they’re truly unique from the others we tested — or any other containers we’ve seen. Although the ProKeepers could be used for storing any food item, each container in the six-container set is designed for storing a specific dry-goods product.</p>
<p>For example, the 15-cup flour container can hold an entire five-pound bag of flour, and it has a built-in leveler for leveling flour from a measuring cup, which easily fits into the container. The brown-sugar ProKeeper includes a terra-cotta disc that, when moistened, prevents brown sugar from hardening. The powdered-sugar ProKeeper has a sifting spoon, and the two mini containers each have a shaker for herbs, spices or cupcake sprinkles.</p>
<p>Progressive sells other containers for coffee, cereal, grains and pasta separately, and each has an individual feature, such as a coffee scoop or a wide-mouth pour spout for the cereal container. The herb ProKeeper is ingenious: washed herbs drain into a basket, and excess water drips into the lower part of the container, which can then be emptied through a built-in drain hole.</p>

<p>Each container is made from <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-food-storage-container/#health">BPA-free</a> crystal-clear plastic, and lids are latched shut and sealed with a silicone gasket that can be removed for cleaning.</p>
<p>The containers were perfectly airtight, <i>except</i> for the white sugar container, which we found frustrating, because of a small design flaw. The white sugar ProKeeper has a pour spout, and although all other ProKeepers have a ¼-inch-thick silicone gasket for sealing their lids, the sugar container’s is thinner and doesn’t secure the spout cover tightly enough.</p>
<p>The white sugar container is large enough to store four pounds of sugar, so it’s a shame the clever pour spout didn’t work better in keeping contents airtight. However, the sugar container could certainly be used for storing beans or pasta or other dry foods that aren’t plagued by pantry pests and another of the airtight ProKeepers used for storing white sugar instead.</p>
<p>The six-piece set is slightly more expensive than other sets, but the superb design features and bonuses, like the terra cotta disc, are worth the added cost.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Progressive &#8211; Prepworks ProKeeper six-piece set is the most unique and well-designed container system that we tested.</li>
<li>Each one has features for a specific ingredient, such as flour, brown sugar or cake toppings.</li>
<li>In testing, the ProKeepers were completely airtight, except for the sugar container, which has a pour spout that didn’t seal.</li>
<li>Other containers for coffee, grains, herbs and pasta are also available individually.</li>

<p>The thoughtful design of the Progressive &#8211; Prepworks containers gave them a slight edge over our runner-up, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076N6DLFJ/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> four-container set. In our review of food storage containers, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> won best plastic food storage container for refrigerating, freezing and reheating food, because of its durability, ease of opening/closing and its 100% airtight seal, thanks to a thick, built-in silicone gasket.</p>
<p>Other than size and shape, there’s no difference between the Brilliance all-purpose containers and the Brilliance dry food storage containers that we tested for this review. The dry food set is, however, better suited for pantry storage, taking advantage of vertical space with taller containers.</p>
<p>The eight-piece set — each lid counts as a piece — includes a 9.25-inch-tall, 16-cup container that holds a five-pound bag of flour, a 12-cup container for sugar, a 9.25-inch-tall and narrow 6.6-cup container for pasta (which is a half-inch too short for uncooked spaghetti) and a squat, rectangular 3.2-cup container.</p>

<p>The small 3.2-cup container brought the Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance set down a notch in our rating, since it’s just a regular food-storage container and is too small for standard pantry items. However, additional sizes, including a container tall enough for spaghetti, are available to purchase either in sets or individually.</p>
<p>The eight-piece set is modestly priced, but it’s likely you’ll need to add to it for storing more than three dry food products in your kitchen or pantry. Still, the Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance containers are one of three containers we tested that you can completely rely on to keep pantry goods fresh and pest-free.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance containers are made of durable and crystal-clear Tritan plastic, easy to open and close and are 100 percent airtight.</li>
<li>The three larger containers are great for storing dry pantry goods, such as flour, sugar and rice.</li>
<li>The smaller container in the set is too small for pantry items, but it’s still excellent for refrigerated food storage.</li>
<li>The Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance set is well-priced, but you’ll probably need to buy other pieces individually to store more pantry goods.</li>

<h3>Bellemain &#8211; Acrylic Canister Set</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZXY51MA/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bellemain &#8211; Acrylic Canister Set</a> is the only other set we tested that was airtight. Honestly, we were surprised, because they’re very lightweight and their chrome latches are thin and wobbly. The containers look like glass Mason jars and would be an attractive addition to a kitchen counter. They’re supposedly unbreakable, but the lids and latches might not survive being accidentally knocked to the floor.</p>
<p>Because they’re airtight, the Bellemain will keep flour and sugar fresh, but they’re only large enough for scooping out a half-cup. If you wish to store dried food items, such as beans, lentils and short pasta, these glass containers would be a decent alternative to plastic containers.</p>
<h3>OXO Good Grips &#8211; POP Containers</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D78X2V6/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; POP Container</a> set includes two tall, narrow canisters, two small narrow canisters and a squat square. None are large enough to hold flour and sugar or wide enough for scooping with a measuring cup.</p>
<p>The POP lids are a great idea. They secure by pushing down on a large button in the center of the lid, which lowers the silicone seal into the lip of the container; pushing the button again releases the seal. Unfortunately, the seal isn’t airtight, and during our test, water seeped into the canister. If water can find its way in, so can bugs. The POP container set was the most expensive set we tested, and even though they look nice, they just don’t work.</p>
<h3>Brabantia &#8211; Glass Storage Containers</h3>
<p>There aren’t many glass containers available, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JFWP6EO/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brabantia</a> is highly rated on Amazon. They’re not made of heavy-duty glass, like a Mason jar, but have a similar weight to an all-purpose wine glass. They have pretty colored lids in neutral Martha-Stewart-ish tones that are interchangeable. They’re too small for holding more than a pound of flour or sugar, and because they’re not airtight, we could see them being used for storing cotton puffs or Q-tips.</p>
<h3>Chef’s Path &#8211; Food Storage Container Set</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L6MH96Z/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chef’s Path</a> seven-piece set includes containers of four different heights, one of which is designed specifically for spaghetti. However, because they’re all only four-inches wide, they’re useless for storing flour or sugar, unless you want to scoop it out with a tablespoon. Since this is a modular design, the lids fit all the containers. The Chef’s Path lids secure with a vertical latch that can be closed on either side of the lid. A very thin silicone band isn’t enough to seal the container, and during our tests, water flooded in. The Chef’s Path containers have a sleek, modern design, but they aren’t airtight.</p>
<h3>Rubbermaid &#8211; Modular Containers</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003BKGJ1A/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; 1776464 Modular Containers</a> are basic containers for a kitchen cabinet or pantry; they won’t be sitting pretty on your counter. The rectangular Modulars are wide and deep enough for scooping out flour and sugar, and the bright-red lids are interchangeable. Frequent criticism of the Rubbermaid Modulars is that the lids are ill-fitting and difficult to snap on. It does take a bit of effort, and we assumed the seal was secure. However, like most of the containers we tested, the Rubbermaid Modulars failed to be airtight.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Dry food storage containers need to be functional and airtight, but only two of the seven products we tested were both.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LWS0LK9/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Progressive &#8211; Prepworks ProKeepers</a> were each specifically designed for storing a particular ingredient. The flour container is wide enough for scooping and has a built-in leveler; the container for brown sugar includes a terra cotta disc that prevents brown sugar from drying out.</p>
<p>Only the white-sugar container had a design flaw that made it not completely airtight; all other containers in the six-canister set were 100% airtight. We also like that Progressive has matching containers for coffee, cereal, grains and herbs in its product line.</p>
<p>A close runner-up is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076N6DLFJ/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> four-container set. These durable and attractive Tritan plastic containers are perfectly airtight and wide enough for scooping and measuring. The set includes a small container that’s better suited for refrigerated food storage, but like Progressive, Rubbermaid also sells other Brilliance containers that are intended for particular food products.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e submerged, froze, microwaved, baked and machine-washed ten of the most popular food storage containers to find which one could keep food fresh longest. The best glass food storage container is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075GRTNN6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; Smart Seal</a>. Its unique lid with a soft silicone gasket ensures a leakproof and airtight seal. A lightweight and less expensive option is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a>. Made out of sturdy BPA-free Tritan plastic, this attractive set is also 100-percent leakproof and looks like new even after repeated use.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>There are literally hundreds of food storage containers that you could buy online and at practically any store. There’s a very good chance that you’ve got cabinets, drawers and pantries stuffed with them and that they’re stained, warped and damaged from microwaving leftovers. You probably want to throw them out, but what do you buy as replacements?</p>
<p>To narrow our selection, we started by reading customer reviews on Amazon. The reviews pointed us in the direction of food storage containers that stand up to years of heating and reheating, radical changes in temperature and dishwashing.</p>
<p>We also checked out reviews from reputable cooking websites and recommendations from health and diet websites. Parents of schoolchildren had lots of opinions about which containers are best for school lunches, as did people who do weekly meal prep dietary or workout regimen.</p>
<p>Finally we divided our finalists into those that were plastic and those that were glass — five of each — since the number of consumers who prefer one to the other is about equal.</p>
<p>Although glass containers last longer than plastic containers, glass containers are also prone to chip, particularly around the edges where the top snaps on. There are also complaints that glass containers can explode in the oven. We had some highly rated glass containers on our list, but we eliminated those that tended to chip and shatter.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs food storage containers?</h2>
<p>There’s a wide variety of uses for food storage containers. Whether you cook for yourself or a family brood, you may have leftovers you wish to enjoy the next day. Other people cook in bulk and freeze food for a month or longer. In both cases, you need a storage container that is airtight and leak proof so it will keep food fresh and, if frozen, frost-free.</p>
<p>It’s also important for some people that the container can be removed from the refrigerator or freezer and go directly into the oven. In this case, the container must be borosilicate glass that can withstand high heat without shattering.</p>
<p>Pot-luck dinners are popular in many communities, so a large, sturdy container with a secure lid is ideal for transportation. Parents of school children pack their lunches in food storage containers to be carried in backpacks. In this case, it’s important that the container be leak-proof, since its contents can easily shift sideways or upside down.</p>
<p>Meal prep containers are food storage containers in specific amounts for people who are dieting or on a workout regimen. Oftentimes, meal prep containers are divided in half to apportion two types of food in a single container.</p>
<p>Food storage containers aren’t just for food; people who do their own home repair use them for storing various sizes of screws, bolts, nails and other hardware.</p>
<h2 id="health">Health concerns about using plastic</h2>
<p>You’re probably aware of two chemicals associated with plastic containers: BPA and phthalates. BPA (Bisphenol A) is a chemical used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastic, which is the type of plastic used in most food containers.</p>
<p>When heated in a microwave, BPA leeches into the food or liquid, and although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration stated the low levels of BPA are safe, research suggests there are possible health effects on the brain and behavior of infants and children.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/sya-bpa/index.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The National Institute of Environmental Sciences recommends</a> avoiding products that are not labeled BPA-free and not microwaving products made of polycarbonate plastic.</p>
<p>Phthalates are chemicals used to make plastic pliable. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/Phthalates_FactSheet.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state</a> that although phthalates have affected the reproductive system of lab animals, research continues as to how phthalates affect humans.</p>
<p>If you prefer to use plastic food containers, buy those that are labeled “BPA-free” and “Phthalate-free.” However, additional research is being conducted about whether such products are actually harmful as well.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Plastic vs. glass: </b>Both have pros and cons. Plastic containers come in a variety of shapes and sizes, large and small, and they’re lightweight, so you can carry them in a backpack or shoulder bag. If they’re leakproof and airtight, food and liquids won’t spill out if the container is dropped or accidentally turned upside down or sideways.</p>
<p>Plastic containers are also significantly cheaper than glass containers. For $20, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PSKSG1M/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids</a> comes with 24 various sizes of containers and lids.</p>
<p>The downside to plastic containers is that they simply don’t last. Mostly everyone microwaves food in a plastic container and then tosses it into the dishwasher. After our testing, all of the plastic containers were stained to some extent, and most were pitted and scratched.</p>
<p>Glass food storage containers are heavier and more expensive. However, they’re also far more durable than plastic and much easier to clean. If you’re concerned about BPAs and phthalates, you can rest assured that a glass container is healthier. All of the glass containers we tested had plastic lids, so these should not be microwaved or run through the dishwasher.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’re ecologically mindful, glass is one of the best options.</p>
<p><b>Silicone gasket:</b> Many of the food storage containers we tested had a silicone gasket inserted into the inner lip of the lid where it connects to the top of the container. When the lid is locked into place, the silicone gasket forms a tight seal.</p>
<p>Our two winners — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075GRTNN6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO &#8211; Smart Seal</a> — had gaskets that were twice as thick as the other finalists, so their lids floated on top of the containers. When the latches are locked, a vacuum seal is created, thus ensuring both were leakproof and airtight.</p>
<p>Food particles can get trapped between the gasket and the lid’s lip, and silicone tends to retain food odors and must be periodically soaked in a vinegar-water solution. You’ll want a silicone gasket that can be removed for cleaning and easily reinserted.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075GRTNN6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO &#8211; Smart Seal</a> was, by far, the easiest silicone gasket to remove. The lid has side tabs that allow you to pull out the gasket and then snap it back on. (In fact, its design reminded us of the Instant Pot, which we loved in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-pressure-cooker/">review of the best pressure cookers</a>.)</p>
<p><b>Stacking/Nesting: </b>Whether you have a big or small kitchen, ample cabinet or drawer space is a premium. Glass food storage containers aren’t great for stacking or nesting, because sometimes a smaller container gets stuck in a larger one. Many plastic containers are designed for nesting, but you run into trouble with all of the bothersome lids.</p>
<p>Of the containers we tested, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PSKSG1M/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids</a> were the easiest to nest, and their interlocking lids prevent your rummaging around the bottom of drawer trying to find the right size.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Leaks</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/testing-leakproof.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We filled each container two-thirds full with water and secured the lid. Then we vigorously shook each container for one minute over paper towels and noted any leaks. Almost all of the manufacturers advertised their container as leakproof, and for the most part, they were. The Pyrex and Sistema don’t claim to be leakproof, and they weren’t; water leaked from their corners. But Prep Naturals was supposed to be leakproof, and water also poured out.</p>
<h3>Airtight seals</h3>
<p>Airtight containers hold in moisture and keep out odors from other foods in the refrigerator.  For this test we made sure that each container was completely dry. Then we placed one sheet of toilet tissue into the bottom of the container and sealed it. Next, we filled a three-gallon bucket with water colored with food dye and plunged each container one at a time into the bucket, holding it under for one minute. After that, we flipped the container upside down and submerged it for another minute. We then withdrew the container from the bucket, unsealed the lid and noted whether the toilet tissue was wet or dry.</p>
<p>All of the manufacturers claimed their containers were airtight. Not surprisingly, the same three that were not leakproof — Pyrex, Sistema and Prep Naturals — were also not airtight.</p>
<h3>Lid sealing</h3>
<p>The majority of food storage containers that we tested were sealed by aligning a silicone gasket inside the lid with the edge of the container, then locking it with hinged latches on all four sides. Four exceptions were the Pyrex and the Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids, which simply had snap-on lids, and the Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance and Sistema, both of which had two latches on the longer sides of the container.</p>
<p>We tested the lids and latches by opening them and closing them repeatedly and noted whether or not they were easy to snap on and release.</p>
<h3>Staining</h3>
<p>Plastic food containers are notorious for being stained by tomato-based foods, such as spaghetti sauce, and curries with turmeric. We began this test by filling each container three-quarters full with marinara and then froze them overnight in the freezer. The next day, we defrosted the containers with lids askew in the microwave until the marinara was boiling. When the sauce had been completely defrosted, we allowed each container to fully cool before dumping the marinara out.</p>
<p>As expected, all of the plastic containers and their lids were stained. The Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance, however, was only slightly stained. All of the plastic lids for the glass containers — except for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075GRTNN6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO &#8211; Smart Seal</a> — were also stained.</p>

<p>After we microwaved the frozen marinara in the plastic containers, we checked each one over for signs of warping. None were affected by the long microwaving. Two glass containers, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N90AWNF/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1790</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LN7X92K/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glasslock</a>, warned to not microwave their plastic lids. Since their lids were exactly the same as the other glass containers, we ignored the dire warning. Other than staining, neither were affected by the microwave.</p>

<p>If you read consumer reviews online, you’ll see some terrifying photos of glass food storage containers that have exploded in the oven. Borosilicate glass is resistant to sudden high changes of temperature, because it doesn’t expand like regular glass.</p>
<p>Still, all manufacturers advise putting borosilicate glass containers — especially from the refrigerator or freezer — into a preheated oven. This seems to defy logic, but when a glass container is put into a cold oven and then the heat is turned on, the heating element initially radiates heat unevenly, which doesn&#8217;t allow the glass to expand properly and will cause it to crack or shatter.</p>
<p>For our test, we removed the plastic lids from each glass container filled with frozen marinara and put the containers into a preheated 350℉ oven. All of the glass containers reheated the marinara in the same amount of time, and none shattered.</p>
<h3>Dishwasher cleaning</h3>

<p>The dishwasher undoubtedly does the most damage to plastic food containers and lids. We followed manufacturer instructions and loaded the glass containers into the lower part of the dishwasher and the plastic containers and all the lids into the upper rack. We then set the dishwasher on a heavy-duty wash cycle.</p>
<p>All of the glass containers cleaned beautifully. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> was the only plastic food container and lid that showed no signs of damage. The other plastic containers were deeply stained and pitted, the worst being the Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids.</p>
<h3>Odor retention</h3>
<p>Plastic food containers and silicone tend to retain food odors, so after dishwashing, we did a sniff test. Only the Vremi, the silicone container, smelled strongly of marinara sauce. The silicone gasket in the Glasslock lid didn’t retain food odor but instead had an acrid chemical odor.</p>
<h3>Retesting latches and leakproof capability</h3>
<p>Amazon reviewers frequently complain that after dishwashing and microwaving, the latches are too difficult to close, and we found this to be true only with the Glasslock and OXO. However, we opened and closed the OXO’s latches several times, and they worked normally again. Although the Vremi’s silicone container held up in the dishwasher, one of its plastic lid’s latches had cracked after a single wash.</p>
<p>Finally, we repeated our leakproof test to see if freezing, microwaving and dishwashing had any structural effect on the containers. The same three that failed the first time — Pyrex, Sistema and Prep Naturals — leaked again. But this time the 1790 also leaked.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> 14-piece set is made of Tritan, a BPA-free plastic that resembles glass, but it’s shatter resistant and more durable than other plastics. The seven lids for the seven containers are also made of Tritan, which allow you to see their contents from all sides in the refrigerator. The set includes a large 9.6-cup container, two medium 3.2-cup containers and four small 1.3-cup containers.</p>
<p>Each container in this attractive set is rectangular with flat lids that are slightly recessed, so you can stack them in the refrigerator without fearing they’ll topple.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, a thick silicone gasket inside the inner lip of the lid floats on top of the container. When you press down on the lid, air is expelled out of the container through the lid’s vent holes with a whoosh. The two small latches on the long sides snap shut and create an airtight seal, which proved to be 100-percent leakproof.</p>

<p>The containers also have one-quarter-inch extensions at opposite ends, which stay cool when you lift the hot container out of the microwave.</p>
<p>Online instructions advise that turmeric will stain the Tritan plastic but tomato-based sauces will not. Our marinara sauce did stain the container and lid very slightly, but it was much less than on other containers we tested.</p>
<p>The Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance made it through the heavy-duty dishwashing cycle and showed no signs of pitting or scratching. Except for the rosy tint left by the spaghetti sauce in the container’s beveled edges, the container and lid looked brand new.</p>
<p>The only thing we didn’t like about the Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance is that the silicone gaskets cannot be removed from the lids. The gasket bends so you can scrub underneath its ridges, but to completely avoid odor retention, the entire lid would need to be submerged in cleaning solution.</p>
<p>Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance is reasonably priced for such a high-quality product. It’s available in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNEJSO/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">6-piece</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNEIC6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">10-piece</a> sets, and you can also buy various sizes individually if you need more of one size than another. The 1.3-cup size, which is perfect for packing school lunches or snacks, are available in a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077M4T91S/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">very affordable two-pack</a>.</p>
<p>Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance proved resistant to microwaving and dishwashing, and we believe it will outlast all of the other plastic food containers we tested.</p>

<p>Glass containers are much easier to clean than plastic, and you don’t have to worry about BPAs and phthalates. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075GRTNN6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; Smart Seal</a> was our favorite of the glass containers. It’s made of borosilicate glass, so it can withstand changes in temperature and go from the freezer to the microwave or a preheated oven.</p>
<p>What made OXO stand out from the other finalists is the thick silicone gasket that’s set into a channel in the lid. The gasket is made of soft silicone and floats on top of the container, so when you press down, not only does it make an airtight seal, the latches are easy to lock into place. The silicone gasket slips right off for cleaning and slides back into the lid’s channel with no effort.</p>

<p>The OXO performed perfectly in all our tests. It was leakproof, airtight, and the marinara sauce heated evenly in the microwave and oven. Although the glass container emerged sparkling clean from the dishwasher, the plastic lid was moderately stained. A big plus, however, is that the silicone gasket could be removed for washing.</p>
<p>OXO’s glass containers are a little more expensive than the others we tested, but the OXO’s sturdy lid and latches made the strongest seal and were the easiest to clean.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C6LRW61/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fullstar &#8211; 12-Pack</a> has five different sizes in rectangular, square and round shapes. They’re made of regular polypropylene plastic like the other containers we tested, so after microwaving and dishwashing they got stained and pitted. Its silicone gasket is embedded in the lid’s channel, and it needed to be precisely lined up or the latches wouldn’t close properly.</p>
<p>The Fullstar was leakproof and airtight and remained so after our testing. The container survived the microwave and dishwasher, but its lid warped and became convex.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PSKSG1M/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; 2063704 Easy Find Vented Lids</a> was one of our early favorites. Like traditional Rubbermaid or Tupperware, the lid snaps on top of the container and is then removed with a corner tab. We found the lids very easy to open and close. A square vent, which snaps up and down, is intended for releasing steam in the microwave. The Rubbermaid was the only plastic container that had a lid designed for the microwave.</p>
<p>The Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids design was leakproof, even with the vent. Surprisingly, it was even airtight. But the marinara sauce proved its downfall. After microwaving and dishwashing, the container was deeply stained and massively pitted. Although the lid still closed easily, and the container was still leakproof, it was clear that the Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids wouldn’t last.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NSJ88V8/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sistema &#8211; Klip-It</a> are rectangular, divided containers for storing two different food items. The small size, which comes in a pack of three, are quite tiny, and can only really fit baby carrots and small grapes inside. The 4-cup container is a good size for school or work lunch, and the 8-cup container is for storing leftovers. Two problems plague the Sistema containers: They’re not leakproof or airtight, so if you’re toting something with liquid, expect to find it pooled in the bottom of your bag. Also, the dividers aren’t high enough to reach the lid, so liquid or sauce on one side easily leaks into the opposite side.</p>
<p>We really wanted to love the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071JVT2HC/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vremi &#8211; VRM020376N silicone</a> containers. Their four rectangular sizes are in bright primary colors, and because the containers are made of silicone, they collapse to one-third of their fully expanded height. We researched several silicone containers, and most buckle when you secure the lid, resulting in an explosion of anything liquid inside. The Vremi containers, however, have a rigid lip, so after some practice, we were able to snap on the lid without the sides buckling in.</p>
<p>Sadly, the Vremi was neither leakproof nor airtight, and after its round through the dishwasher, one of the lid’s latches had cracked, and the container reeked of marinara. Great idea but poorly executed.</p>

<p>None of the glass containers showed any signs of damage from the freezer, microwave or dishwasher. The plastic lids, however, differentiated one from the other.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LN7X92K/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glasslock &#8211; 11339</a> was leakproof and airtight, but its hinges were stiff to close. The smaller ends snapped on and off without too much struggle, but there was more resistance from the hinges on the long side of the container. We had to press down very hard to get the hinges to secure. Although the glass container itself is fine, someone with weak hand strength would be frustrated by these lids.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N90AWNF/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1790 &#8211; Glass Meal Prep Containers</a> did well in our tests. The latches were easy to lock and unlock, and when sealed, they were leakproof and airtight. 1790’s label warnings about the glass containers are a bit scary; it’s a long list of don’ts, some in capital letters. The containers are made of durable borosilicate glass, yet the manufacturer states that hot glass could shatter if the container is placed on a countertop, metal surface or sink.</p>
<p>We were justifiably nervous about what to do with the hot 1790 when we removed it from the oven. We opted for the marble counter, and thankfully, no explosion occurred.</p>
<p>After dishwashing, the 1790’s lid was stained and slightly pitted. The latches still closed easily, but now the seal was no longer leakproof.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075BLP5XV/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prep Naturals</a> is a popular brand with people who use the containers for meal prep. The containers are divided in two, so you can store two different portions of food in them. Since the dividing glass wall doesn’t reach the lid, anything that’s liquid on one side will leach into the other side. When sealed, the Prep Naturals were neither leakproof nor airtight; so much water had been absorbed by the tissue, we had to squeeze it out. After dishwashing, the lid was stained and pitted, and the latches were difficult to snap shut. As for cleaning, food particles were trapped between the gasket and the lid and could not be removed.</p>
<p>We tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0157G34AY/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pyrex &#8211; 1123268 Simply Store</a> set, because it was frequently mentioned by Amazon reviewers as their long-time favorite. It passed the freezer, microwave and oven tests, and its lid was not harmed by the dishwasher. From the beginning, however, the lid was difficult to snap on, and we had to pry it off before it would release from the container. Naturally, we thought this would indicate that the Pyrex would be airtight and leakproof. But the Pyrex performed just as poorly as the Prep Naturals.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Plastic food containers are great for storing food in the refrigerator or freezer and for carrying lunch or leftovers to work or school. They’re less expensive than glass, but as our tests showed, microwaving and machine-dishwashing damages both the containers and their lids. You’ll probably want to replace them after a few months of use.</p>
<p>An exception was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; 1977447 Brilliance</a>, our top pick for plastic food container. The Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance was 100-percent leakproof and airtight, and although it stained very slightly — much less than the other plastic containers we tested — its durable Tritan plastic retained clarity and structure over the course of our rigorous tests. It’s a quality product for a reasonable price.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to worry about potential health hazards from plastic, our favorite glass food storage container was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075GRTNN6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; Smart Seal</a>. The OXO is more expensive than other glass containers (not to mention plastic containers), but its unique removable silicone gasket ensures a perfect seal. The OXO is leakproof, airtight, freezer-, microwave- and dishwasher-safe and will hold up for years.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent over 25 hours researching and thoroughly testing each aspect of the seven top label makers, including handheld, computer-connected and combination models. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OCEKCB2/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brother &#8211; P-Touch PT-D600</a> was the clear choice for best label maker due to its easy functionality and the option to use either its keyboard or plug it into the computer. If you’re looking for a mobile option, then the handheld <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005J7Y6GS/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EPSON &#8211; LabelWorks LW-400</a> is a perfect choice as it has a bunch of one-touch features.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>In our search for the best, we went through multiple websites like Reddit, the best-seller lists on Amazon and we read and watched other reviews to see what the lifetime-users had to say. From there we found out what the most important aspects of label makers were and refined our list. With our criteria, decades spent using label makers and looking at some top choices from places like The Wirecutter, only seven ended up making the cut.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the selection process, we examined these products in a way that would best mimic normal use. For example, we used the labels on common materials like glass, plastic, cardboard and paper and placed them in the freezer and dishwasher to see if they could stand the test of time. We took into account the versatility of the label makers, their user-friendliness and other attributes that made them stand out from the pack.</p>

<h2 id="bit-about-organization">A bit about organization</h2>
<p>We all know it is important to stay organized and usually end up creating a system that works for us, but is it actually worth it? The debate continues on whether those who are organized are smarter than <a href="http://time.com/3852042/disorganized-brain-good-creativity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those who are disorganized</a>. But, taking intelligence out of it, there is indisputably a certain peace of mind when things are organized.</p>
<p>The easiest way to stay ahead of the chaos life brings is to create a universal system wherein your stuff is labelled clearly and everything has a specific spot, even if that means a drawer for miscellaneous items. Printed labels are a great tool because they are “semi-permanent”, meaning you can change them if you really want to, but if you don’t then they are there to stay.</p>
<p>Staying organized can be scoffed at by those who dismiss its importance, but it has been found that “clutter can up your anxiety levels” (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/22/home-organization-stress-survey_n_3308575.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this was a testimonial study</a>). An easy way to reduce bad stress is to use labels to create a system that will help you stay organized.</p>
<h2 id="why-need">Why someone would need a label maker</h2>
<p>Label makers help facilitate organization by allowing you to specify where certain objects are supposed to go or keep track of what herbs are growing in your garden. Labels help create a “system of stuff”, otherwise your memory is taking on the load of knowing where everything is. So with the advent of professional-looking labels, the task of getting and staying clean becomes much easier.</p>
<p>The simplicity of label makers lets you quickly create labels that are always perfectly neat. There is no doubt you can make your own labels with some DIY tricks, but we found that using a label maker is more conducive to remaining organized because it takes no preparation to print or reprint a label. And you don&#8217;t have to spend a load of money, you can just grab a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005X9VZ70/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DYMO LabelManager 160</a>, type something out and push ‘print’.</p>
<p>With label makers you can keep a consistent style that is much harder to maintain with handwriting. You can also set the mood of your organization with different fonts for specific needs, like a professional font for your office or a more fun one for the kids’ rooms. When you use a label maker there is no discrepancy about what it says. In short, label makers are the easiest and most effective way to make labels and stay organized.</p>

<p><strong>Labeling food</strong><br />
There are many different ways to use a label maker effectively, one of which is on food products. Ever avoid looking for that specific spice or herb you want because your cupboard is absolute chaos? We’ve all been there. Or what about when you don’t know how long ago Grandma’s special home-cooked spaghetti sauce has been in the back of the freezer? Labels have purpose (and are freezer-compatible!).</p>

<p>Alongside using labels for containers themselves, you can categorize the inside of your fridge and cupboards with them: “Fruit”, “Meat”, “Leftovers”, “Glassware”, “Bowls”, “Plates”&#8230; you can have a spot for everything and everybody is able to see what should go where. This clear compartmentalizing really holds the power to ease the mind.</p>
<p><strong>Household objects and office supplies</strong></p>
<p>Another key way to take advantage of this organizational tool is to use it for your office and house in general. You can use labels to cover the inside of all cupboards and closets for blankets, towels, toys and whatever else. Remember, starting organized is the key to staying organized.</p>
<p>You can use labels for anything that is unknown on the outside like boxes, flash drives, CDs and DVDs. Think about holiday decorations: (possibly) a disaster waiting to be organized. There is usually not a good spot to just write on big plastic containers. And if you choose to do so, then it is permanent. Although permanence is good when it comes to organization, you still want things to be able to change. That is why using label makers is perfect: you can take them off.</p>

<p>Of course the stickability is an important aspect to labels, which we’ll get to later, but the semi-permanence of labels produced from a label maker puts it way ahead of writing directly on a container. It allows your system of organization to be dynamic when it needs to be, an exquisite balance between flexibility and rigidity. For example, if you need to switch your HDMI from the XBOX to the TV you can use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B013DG2FNW/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brother P-touch PT-D210</a> to easily make new cord labels.</p>
<p>More areas that can be organized with labels include office files, wires and power cords, toy boxes, sports containers, art supplies and the list goes on. A huge contributor to why label makers are so useful is because it gives off this professional aesthetic, which makes us more likely to abide by our own organizational code. On top of that, the ability to easily change the label of a container, if needed, and the capacity to quickly make up a new label allows for a near-seamless process of organization.</p>
<p><strong>Learning new languages<br />
</strong></p>
<p>This may sound a bit off the cuff but in our initial research we came across people that have used labels for everyday objects to help them learn a new language, for example before they go on a trip. It makes sense if you think about it, and usually the people who are organized enough to use a label maker are those who will plan ahead for a trip they are taking to Cabo to get those everyday necessities down.</p>
<h2 id="types-of">Handheld vs. computer plug-in</h2>

<h3>Handheld</h3>
<p>These are print-on-the-spot label makers. They are incredibly quick and easy to use. There is no other hardware or software involved, just this mini-machine you hold in your hand. You just type out what you want printed, press print and boom! Label. Though some store recent prints and have save functions, these are typically used for one or a few labels at a time.</p>
<h3>Computer plug-in only</h3>
<p>These are label makers that require a computer to use. There is no keyboard on the machine itself so you would usually keep them on your desk or close by. On most there is no requirement to download any software so that you can print within seconds of plugging them into a USB port.</p>

<p>Computer plug-in label makers are best if a lot of printing is required as they can print large volumes for things like address books and business inventory (the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0027JIIKQ/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DYMO LabelWriter 450 Turbo</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DSYEB28/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brother PC Connectable PT-P700</a> proved to be especially valuable in these areas). And it&#8217;s the same type of deal: you just plug it in, type what you want, click print and bang! Label! Label! Label!</p>
<h3>Hybrids</h3>
<p>These are a bit more rare and incredibly versatile label makers. Just what it sounds like, it has its own keyboard which you can use to type what you want and print from there and it can be plugged into the computer. These are used for those who have multiple preferences on what they’d like printed, sometimes wanting a more elaborate, imported design and other times wanting the quick there-in-the-moment print job.</p>
<h2 id="features-to-look">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Printer Style:</strong> If you think you are the type who is going to be printing as you go then you will probably want a smaller hand-held label maker. On the flip side, if you are the type to plan out what you want to print then a computer-compatible printer may be more in line with what you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Versatility:</strong> There are a lot of attributes to look for: amount of lines, font sizes, tape width, types of tape, symbols and colors. So first step, figure out what exactly you need it for or what you may want to use it for.</p>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> In terms of the label you should look for something that prints with your preferred resolution and sticks well to the materials you are going to use it on.</p>
<p>For the label maker, if it is impossible to change to the font you want, or the desired size, then there is little reason to buy it. We recommend you check out its rating on ease-of-use where we determined which label makers were the most-user friendly and whose software can be most easily navigated through.</p>

<p><strong>Energy source:</strong> All of the label makers we tested can use batteries (both AAA and AA) and some can be plugged in as well. The computer-compatible label makers are the ones that can be plugged in for power, some even have a lithium-ion battery inside that charges when plugged in. Another thing to keep in mind is how long these batteries can power the product.</p>
<p><strong>Tape efficiency:</strong> One of the biggest user complaints is wasted tape. This is the blank, unused tape on either side of the print on the label. So you are going to want something that either allows you to chain-print a bunch in a row, which you can then manually cut, or that allows you to minimize the amount of unused tape on each side.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6149" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/printer-tape.png" alt="Printer Tape Data Chart" width="900" height="674" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/printer-tape.png 991w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/printer-tape-610x457.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/printer-tape-768x575.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/printer-tape-300x225.png 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/printer-tape-295x221.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/printer-tape-885x663.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/printer-tape-360x270.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/printer-tape-375x281.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/printer-tape-414x310.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/printer-tape-320x240.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The cost of the tape itself is another thing to look at because, assuming you actually use the label maker, you are going to need to buy refills and a variety of types of tape. Also, the durability of the tape is involved here as the tape that lasts longer is going to be more cost-effective (though, after our testing, we’ve found that this is a minimal cost to bear in mind).</p>
<p><strong>Screen legibility:</strong> A huge part of the label-making process is the preview of the print. If you can’t see what you’ve typed and what is going to print then it becomes an ineffective guessing game. You can look for ones that are backlit and that have a big screen to best see what is going to print.</p>
<p><strong>Keyboard type:</strong> Most people are used to typing on computers that have a QWERTY keyboard and unfortunately some label makers use an ABCDEF keyboard. If that doesn’t bother you then feel free to purchase whichever type, but all of our choices were QWERTY keyboards.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Initial thoughts</h3>
<p>We first used each label maker before reading any user-manual or guides just to get an initial impression (and because we figured that is what most people do anyways). This semi-subjective first impression definitely played a role in our “overall rating” of the ease of use, but was by no means the only thing considered, especially after reading the user-manuals.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6160 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pt-p600-w-manuals.jpg" alt="LCD color display" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pt-p600-w-manuals.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pt-p600-w-manuals-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pt-p600-w-manuals-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pt-p600-w-manuals-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pt-p600-w-manuals-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pt-p600-w-manuals-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pt-p600-w-manuals-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pt-p600-w-manuals-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pt-p600-w-manuals-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pt-p600-w-manuals-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Ease of use</h3>
<p>After getting a general feel for each label maker, and creating a general network of comparison between each one, we looked at the overall navigation of each label maker. The objective measurements included things like recording the amount of “button presses” it took to do a specific task, such as changing the font size or decreasing the amount of unused tape. We also considered the ability to save past prints and the access to a history of recently printed items.</p>
<p>Once we recorded the amount of presses for a multitude of categories we then compared them to each other. On top of that we rated how well the software was formatted, how easy it was to maneuver through and do any particular task without having to refer to the user-manual (that you will probably throw away with the box it came in). So the combination of the subjective inferences and objective efficiencies is what resulted in our overall rating on the ease of use.</p>
<h3>Versatility</h3>
<p>The versatility of the label maker refers to how many different tasks it can be used for. For this category we took into consideration nearly every aspect of the fonts and tapes possible, including the amount of lines, sizes, types, widths, colors and symbols. We basically measured how many different things the label maker could do. This will become easier to see once you look at the charts.</p>

<h3>Cost-efficiency and refills</h3>
<p>The way we determined cost-efficiency was to find cost per label. We used standard labels of both half inch and full inch widths (when applicable). And because there is no set length of tape we calculated an average cost of 10 feet of the standard label tape. We then made labels using two inches of words (the length from first letter to the last was two inches) with each label maker to incorporate the wasted tape.</p>
<p>Integrating the amount of unused tape we were able to calculate the total amount of labels that would be produced with the 10 feet of tape. So, using the cost of the tape and the total length of tape wasted per label, we determined the cost per label.</p>

<p>We also looked at the chain-printing ability on some that drastically decreased the cost per label (by over a third!). Chain-printing is used when you need the same label printed multiple times. The label maker will print your desired number in a row, without giving you time to manually cut the tape. And with this function the label maker doesn’t need the usual required amount of tape to begin printing so it lessens the overall amount of tape used by minimizing the waste.</p>
<h3>Quality of labels</h3>
<p>The quality of the labels is based primarily on their stickiness and durability. We evaluated both these qualities by putting all the standard white labels, of equal lengths, on surfaces for which they would most likely be used. These surfaces included plastic for Tupperware and containers, glass for spices, cardboard for shipping boxes and paper for folders and letters. We used both flat and curved surfaces when appropriate.</p>

<p>We then conducted a general sight test to see if any of the labels lifted on their own. After that we put some Tupperware in the freezer for two weeks to see how they held up. Next we put the Tupperware and glassware into both the microwave and dishwasher. We microwaved them for a total of 10 minutes each and ran the dishwasher five separate times after they were fully cooled.</p>
<p>After all was said and done, we peeled off each one (if they weren’t off already) to see how hard it was to pull off each label, and if it came off in one piece or not. For the labels used on the cardboard and paper we looked at how much material was taken off with the label as a more objective testament to its stickability.</p>

<p>This is where it all comes together, where the versatility, user-friendliness and overall quality of the label maker meet. Of course we all have our own desired uses and specific functions we’d like our label makers to serve, so the most multi-faceted one easily stood out. When you want to be able to print right then and there, on the spot, or import a custom symbol or picture from the internet or your phone the label maker that can do both is paramount.</p>

<p>In deciding the best overall label maker we looked at what could be done, how easy it could be done and how well it was done. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OCEKCB2/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brother &#8211; P-touch PT-D600</a> was by far the best overall label maker. It can do the most out of any “standard” label maker (non-computer) with eight different font sizes and six different tape widths. It has an incredible amount of symbols within its program and can almost double the amount of lines per label as compared to the next best.</p>
<p>At first it seemed a bit big and clunky, which makes it more of a hassle to move around compared to the others, but after putting it to use the size was forgotten. It has a great chain printing function which reduces the cost of two inches of words to seven cents per label. The PT-D600 can store 99 labels inside it and is computer-compatible (both PC and Mac) which makes its storage essentially limitless. It prints barcodes and has the highest resolution at 360 dots per inch (DPI) when printing from the computer.</p>

<p>One of our favorite features is the quality of the print preview, there is no mistaking what you are about to print. It is clear and very well backlit. Also there is a great home page from which to navigate where there are a very good amount of templates to choose from (that you would actually use!). This Brother PT-D600 ended up with one of the highest scores on our user-friendliness as it was beyond easy to navigate through.</p>
<p>Another cool feature specific to this label maker was the automatic cutting. In order to get a label from all of the other label makers you had to push down a button to manually cut the label. It’s 2017, who wants to work that hard? Obviously this is not too big of a deal, but nonetheless it is still pretty cool and worth a mention.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The handheld and computer-compatible <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OCEKCB2/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brother &#8211; P-touch PT-D600</a> is the most versatile label maker as it has wide-ranging capacities on the machine itself, like 600 plus symbols and six different tape widths, and can be connected to a PC or Mac where you can import images and symbols to customize your labels as you like.</li>
<li>Its print preview function is the best out there. There is a wide screen that has a white backlight allowing you to see what you are trying to print before you do.</li>
<li>The interface is very clear and provides the user with an easy-to-maneuver main menu where files and templates can be simply accessed.</li>
<li>It has a great automatic chain-printing function that cuts down the cost per label to around seven cents and contains a more-than-necessary 99 labels in storage.</li>

<h2 id="best-handheld">Best handheld: Epson &#8211; LabelWorks LW-400</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6163 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/epson-lw-400.jpg" alt="EPSON LabelWorks LW-400" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/epson-lw-400.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/epson-lw-400-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/epson-lw-400-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/epson-lw-400-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/epson-lw-400-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/epson-lw-400-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/epson-lw-400-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/epson-lw-400-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/epson-lw-400-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/epson-lw-400-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The best simple label maker was a tough choice because they were all more or less scored the same in user-friendliness. But when we went through all of the comparisons, the ability to save up to 50 labels for reprinting, use a label width of ¾” and print barcodes, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005J7Y6GS/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EPSON &#8211; LabelWorks LW-400</a> became the clear winner. It can also print twice as many lines on one label (four) as its competitors in this category.</p>
<p>With over 300 symbols to choose from and one-push changes there is little to complain about. Well, actually, in the beginning it was a bit harder to get used to because it uses symbols to describe specific actions as opposed to words. So this made the learning curve a bit longer, but ultimately it allows for the quickest changes between font sizes and types, lengths and saves. This makes it incredibly easy and quick to work with.</p>

<p>Something that stood out to us was that this LW-400 will not allow you to print if the text is too long (if you’ve chosen to stray from the automatic settings). There is a nice preview of the print as well, which most of the label makers we tested have, but nonetheless became a favorite function of ours. Another useful aspect of this compact printer is the ability to print up to nine copies so you don’t have to keep pressing print for each copy.</p>
<p>And because there is a shift key it is like using a computer keyboard to input symbols on the number keys, which avoids a lot of hassle (the Brother P-touch PT-D210 has a shift key as well). The wrap-around function allows you to print a label for cables or wires with just one push of a button.</p>
<p>There is also a plethora of tapes that you can use with this label maker. And you can print in up to seven languages. One of the drawbacks is the cost of its labels. Though 12 cents per the label is not too costly (using the same standard two inches of print from beginning to end), it was one of the highest priced labels we tested.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once you get used to the interface, the handheld <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005J7Y6GS/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EPSON &#8211; LabelWorks LW-400</a> has the most one-push changes that allow you to quickly switch up the label contents.</li>
<li>You can print up to four lines with this label maker due to its maximum ¾” thick tape, which is 50% bigger when compared to the other handheld options.</li>
<li>It scored near-perfect on the stickability and durability of the labels which is nice to see because the cost per our standard label (two inches of font) averages about 12 cents.</li>
<li>This was the only solely handheld option that allowed you to print barcodes for shipping.</li>

<p>When deciding which computer-compatible label maker was the best (excluding the best overall which was a hybrid) it was a bit of a toss up because each one was dominant in different categories. After much thought, we figured that someone who is buying a computer-compatible label maker is most likely going to want to use if for shipping labels, barcodes and addresses. So we crowned the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0027JIIKQ/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DYMO &#8211; LabelWriter 450 Turbo</a>.<br />
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0027JIIKQ/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-450-turbo-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-450-turbo-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-450-turbo-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-450-turbo-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-450-turbo-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-450-turbo-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-450-turbo-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-450-turbo-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-450-turbo.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best PC-Connected: DYMO - 450 Turbo</h3><p>The DYMO LabelWriter 450 Turbo proved to be the best in the game for quick and massive prints for things like multiple addresses for letter heading as it can print at an astounding 71 labels per minute.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0027JIIKQ/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>In terms of tape size and type, this printer has the most variety out of any we tested. All of the computer-compatible choices can link up with the address book in your computer. Plus, this DYMO 450 Turbo is really fast, allowing you to print over 70 labels per minute. Unfortunately the standard tape that came with it is not laminated so it performed terribly in the dishwasher (it was the only one whose print faded on the Tupperware and that fell off completely from the glassware).</p>
<p>Something else that was not as impressive as the other options was the software. It was harder to change certain things, for example, moving or getting rid of an imported symbol or image took many more clicks. It was as if it wouldn’t register perfectly and did not allow you to maneuver imported images seamlessly like the other softwares.</p>
<p>There were little downsides in comparison, however, as the Turbo’s labels are incredibly cost-effective and ended up being the cheapest ones we found (reminder: the unlaminated standard labels it comes with are not compatible with the dishwasher). There is very little unused tape and it can print with a resolution of 300 dots per inch.</p>
<p>Alongside the wide variety of tape sizes that are compatible with this printer (more than any other label maker we tested). The types of tape are not necessarily as flashy as the others but DYMO provides you with many durable options that are resistant to heat, cold, water and UV (that are presumably compatible with the dishwasher).</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The computer-connected <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0027JIIKQ/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DYMO &#8211; LabelWriter 450 Turbo</a> provides you with the most overall choice. There are more than 10 different tape widths you can choose from.</li>
<li>The software isn’t the best but once you get the hang of it there are loads of different templates from which to choose, making it incredibly easy to customize.</li>
<li>This was the fasted printing label maker, printing more than one per second, allowing you to print out your address entire book quickly and without any more effort than setting up the print.</li>
<li>The standard non-laminated tape it came with are not dishwasher compatible and do not stick as well as the other similar labels. Nonetheless there is plenty of stick for sending out packages.</li>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B013DG2FNW/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brother &#8211; P-touch PT-D210</a> was the runner up to the non-computer label maker. It is extremely clear and easy to use with a normal keyboard akin to that on a computer. The interface is as simple as it gets. There is chain-printing capability which reduces the price of an average label to about eight cents and you can also print multiple copies without chain-printing if you’d like.</p>
<p>There is an auto-store history function which was very nice to have as it allows you to reprint something you recently did without hassle. Unfortunately there are only three font sizes to choose from, but there are over 600 symbols available. As far as the non-computer competition, this PT-D210 stands out with its ability to print on labels only 1/8th of an inch, making it very useful for more detailed organizing.</p>

<p>This incredibly inexpensive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005X9VZ70/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DYMO &#8211; LabelManager 160</a> can be bought for about $15 on Amazon (and its buttons have that amazing silky rubber feel to them). Even though the tape didn’t perform well on the cardboard, in all other areas it performed perfectly. So if you are just looking for something to get a quick job done and don’t want to spend more than $20 then this is your go to.</p>

<p>It is definitely a take-with-you type of label maker. However, due to its compact size, it does not have a shift key which makes attaining certain symbols on the keyboard a bit more cumbersome than it should be. On the flipside, though, the LabelManager 160 makes it beyond easy to change font size, embolden, italicize and underline, as well as print vertical labels. And if you are trying to learn a language, this DYMO has 19 to choose from.</p>
<h3>Brother &#8211; PC Connectable PT-P700</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DSYEB28/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brother &#8211; PC Connectable PT-P700</a> had a tough start trying to download and install the software on a Mac, but did fine on the PC. The amount of tape-widths (and the maximum width) this label maker is compatible with, makes it more versatile than the DYMO Plug N Play. Unfortunately, the resolution is only 180 dots per inch on this computer-compatible label maker which really decreases the value of importing images.</p>

<p>Another thing to keep in mind is the cost of these labels. These were the most expensive labels we tested (at about 13 cents per label&#8211;again using our standard two inches of words) because of the immutable margins, which were an inch on either side. The labels themselves did seem to hold up well in all the tests though. This is another instance where the labels used are flat, which makes them easy to peel and place.</p>
<h3>DYMO &#8211; Plug N Play</h3>
<p>Talk about easy to use. This <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00464E5P2/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DYMO &#8211; Plug N Play</a> has it in the name, it was actually plug in and go. You can print without downloading the full version (which you can do with all of the other computer-compatible label makers, but this one was exceptionally easy). However, upon downloading the full version, the recent history saved items would only keep one at a time as opposed to the option of storing many on all the other programs.</p>

<p>Another downside to this computer printer was its maximum tape size: half an inch. This was a bit disappointing because with such a great amount of dots per inch (300), the printer was not really able to show its full potential. And because of this lack in size, the amount and types of labels and barcodes diminishes. Nonetheless, this was an easy-as-pie label maker to work with.</p>
<p>Also, a quick note on replacing the the lithium-ion battery: it has to be purchased from DYMO and is about $25. This was one of the most common complaints from many of the review sites we checked.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>When it comes down to it, the more you can do with a label maker, the better. And when we look at the versatility and performance of the hybrid handheld and computer-compatible <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OCEKCB2/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brother &#8211; P-touch PT-D600</a>, there was really no other option. This was our top choice because it has the most options in nearly every category, is very cost effective and outperformed every other label maker in testing with six different tape widths, 600 plus symbols and a beautiful display for previewing your label.</p>
<p>The handheld <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005J7Y6GS/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EPSON &#8211; LabelWorks LW-400</a> was easy to use, could print bar codes and had great storage and proved to be a very smart handheld choice. If you want a specialty printer for address labels, stamps or barcodes then the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0027JIIKQ/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DYMO &#8211; LabelWriter 450 Turbo</a> should be your pick. Though these two and the rest of the competition could hold their own in some categories, the Brother P-touch PT-D600 was the winner as it has the best of both worlds.</p>
