				<description><![CDATA[After testing four top-ranked options, the Brita - BB10 won our pick as the best filtered water bottle for safe-to-drink city water.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter using four top-ranked bottles at home, on the go and in the great outdoors, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H1F6N2F/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; BB10</a> won our pick as the best filtered water bottle for better taste from safe-to-drink city water. If you&#8217;re going out into the wilderness, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C6HAYCS/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Grayl &#8211; Ultralight</a> is a purifying water bottle that removes organisms like bacteria and protozoa, as well as mineral contaminants like heavy metals.</p>
<h2>How we selected</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve tested a lot of water filters over the years, including <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">the best water filter pitchers</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-faucet-water-filter/">faucet filters</a>. Our staff has come to appreciate the taste of chlorine-free drinking water without the added expense of buying bottled water.</p>
<p>We looked for systems in two different classes:</p>
<p>First, we looked at filters that were designed to remove only bad-tasting elements like chlorine from treated, safe-to-drink water. The standards for this type of filter are fairly easy to meet, but they&#8217;re specific. An activated carbon block or column of granules will capture most of the stuff you can smell in city water.</p>
<p>Second, we looked at bottles designed for use in the back country and overseas travel, where the concern is more for biological contamination than taste. We consulted guides from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/backcountry_water_treatment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Center for Disease Control</a> and <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/t-d/pubs/pdf/hi_res/07231304hi.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forest Service</a> to ensure we were checking for the right factors.</p>
<p>We narrowed our choices to bottles that had affordable replacement filters and were easy to purchase. A few other picks, like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075X5R67T/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Katadyn &#8211; BeFree</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078WYNCZ5/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LifeSaver</a>, weren&#8217;t available when we tested and weren&#8217;t competitive with the LifeStraw on pricing despite using similar technologies.</p>
<h2>Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Carbon filters</strong> &#8211; If you want a filter to remove the taste of chlorine and other volatile substances, activated carbon is economical and very effective. It isn&#8217;t effective at removing dissolved minerals, though, and the size of particles carbon passes through will depend on the design. Carbon filters soak up less and less contaminants the more they&#8217;re used, and they can&#8217;t be cleaned.</p>
<p><strong>Ion-exchange filters</strong> &#8211; If you want to remove the dissolved salts and metals in water, ion-exchange resin will grab them. Some new tests also show that this works to capture microbial contaminants. This is one of the technologies used in <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">Zero Water filter pitchers</a> to get rid of all dissolved solids. Like activated carbon, the filter is used up as it cleans water, but you can&#8217;t tell how much it has left unless you count the number of times you fill the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>Particle filters</strong> &#8211; If you&#8217;re mostly worried about avoiding beaver fever while backpacking, a hollow-fiber or ceramic filter can be effective at removing everything from silt to tiny virus and bacteria organisms, depending on the size of the holes. In the extra-dense microbiological filters they require hand-pump pressure or hours-long gravity filtration to make questionable water safe. These filters are fairly easy to clean and continue using for a long time, but they don&#8217;t do much to improve the taste of city water or if you use treatment drops.</p>
<p><strong>Particulate ratings</strong> &#8211; NSF International and other water quality testers rate filters based on the largest compounds they can possibly let through. A smaller class number or absolute filter size will be more effective, but it will also stop working more quickly. Class I is the important class, since this means the filter stops particles larger than 0.5 microns, and that category includes some of the most worrisome organisms in mountain streams.</p>
<p><strong>Effectiveness against biological contaminants</strong> &#8211; Class I particulate ratings — or better still, testing that shows compliance with the NSF Standard 53 or 58 for “cyst reduction / removal” — mean filters can trap protozoan cysts like giardia or cryptosporidium. However, these filters might still let some bacteria (which can be as small as 0.2 microns) through. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/backcountry_water_treatment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC highly recommends</a> using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075XVMZG2/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">chlorine dioxide treatment</a> or just boiling water before you filter it.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re travelling in populated areas, virus-size organisms are a bigger concern and require an even tighter, slower filter that meets <a href="https://www.msrgear.com/blog/water-101-decoding-water-filter-testing-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the strict P248 standard</a> for worst-case water supplies. That kind of filter requires a high-pressure hand pump or a slow gravity-drain mechanism.</p>
<p>Bottles like Grayl and Seychelle claim to be effective at removing viruses with ion-exchange filters, but they don&#8217;t publish the specifications of their tests and they&#8217;re definitely not P248-rated.</p>
<p><strong>Flow rating</strong> &#8211; The more quickly water flows through a filter, the easier it is to use. That&#8217;s almost always a trade-off with effectiveness, though. Also remember that if you use water that&#8217;s cloudy, the particles will plug up your filter more quickly and reduce the flow.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter weeks of in-depth research and testing in multiple environments with varying levels of signal blockage, we determined the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001WMFYH4/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Midland &#8211; GXT1000VP4</a> is the best walkie talkie.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Deciding on the best walkie talkie comes with a catch: The most <i>professional </i>walkie talkies require legal permission in the form of a ham radio license. The license isn&#8217;t overly difficult to obtain, but it does require classes administered by the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/amateur-radio-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FCC</a>.</p>
<p>Operation of a two-way radio while on a General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) channel <a href="http://www.pineapplejuice.net/ham-pine/?page_id=50" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requires a license to legally operate</a>. This is due to the possible safety hazards of radio waves at higher wattages. This can be overkill for the casual walkie talkie user, so we selected models that are sure to perform best <i>without </i>requiring a ham radio license.</p>
<p>This type of walkie talkie operates on frequencies in the Family Radio Service or FRS. Two of the models we tested, Midland and Motorola, contain channels in both <a href="https://www.walkietalkiecentral.com/frs-vs-gmrs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GMRS and FRS</a>. This is potentially very useful in case you ever decided to get yourself a ham radio license for additional range and privacy.</p>
<p>In deciding which models to test, we dove into Reddit forums like r/CampingGear and r/BuyItForLife to learn what regular walkie talkie users have to say about their devices. Then, we took to Amazon for detailed information, specs and user reviews . W</p>
<p>e found that even some of the best-selling walkie talkies had large numbers of negative reviews and complaints of complete malfunction. Through our research, we aimed to buy and test models that were well-known and had a higher percentage of positive user reviews and feedback.</p>
<p>Various features of different brands make some models more fit than others for certain activities. For example, features such as weather reports, SOS sirens and water resistance could be useful if you’re the adventuring type.</p>
<p>We decided to split our top picks into three categories: best overall, best on a budget and best for kids. This is because the intended uses of walkie talkies can vary greatly from one person to another, and we wanted to cover all bases to help you find the best fit for your needs.</p>

<h2 id="why-buy">Why buy a walkie talkie?</h2>
<p>Aside from feeling strangely professional and speaking in code for no reason, there are many practical reasons to implement walkie talkies into your life. Some of the most common uses of walkie talkies include camping, road trips, skiing/snowboarding, cruises, hunting, traveling abroad and simply communicating around your workplace or neighborhood.</p>
<p>In areas where your cell service is limited or unavailable, walkie talkies are also a great way to maintain easy communication with your fellow adventurers through the magic of radio waves.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you have children, walkie talkies can put your mind at ease when they’re running around the neighborhood, the cruise ship, the mountain or the campsite. They’ll never be late for dinner again!</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >

<p>The 10 walkie talkies we reviewed have a variety of different features and strengths. It’s important to ask yourself which combination of features is best for your needs.</p>
<p><b>Effective distance of transmission:</b> How far can this thing <i>actually</i> reach? At further distances, is transmission full of static and/or unintelligible?</p>
<p><b>Battery life:</b> How long will a full charge last? Can other batteries be used as backup?</p>
<p><b>Features:</b> What sets each model apart from the rest? Would you prefer a multitude of transmission, privacy and alert settings over functional simplicity?</p>
<p>Choosing the “right” walkie talkie isn’t a black-and white decision. Where some models fall short in certain areas, others may surpass them while lacking other features. For example, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001UE6MIO/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Motorola &#8211; MH230R</a> proved to be, by far, the model with the best battery life. However, it also fell short on transmission distance to compared models that cost a fraction of its price.</p>
<p>Regardless of your intended activities with walkie talkies, the units’ abilities to transmit at greater distances with a higher sound quality are of the utmost importance. What good is an excellent battery life if all you hear is static? Conversely, a solid battery life or the ability to swap to AA batteries is surely worth prioritizing if you aren’t able to charge your device often, perhaps during long road trips or overnight camping.</p>
<p>Some products we considered had a high rate of positive feedback from users, but they also had a concerning subset of poor feedback on Reddit and Amazon. We remained skeptical of these products if we chose to test them.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>

<h3>Effective distance</h3>
<p>To accurately rank our top contestants, we devised detailed tests for transmission distance, battery life, sound quality and maximum output volume. We equipped ourselves with our 10 walkie talkies and measured their effective ranges in a variety of terrains. We also tested for sound quality and max volume using a decimeter.</p>
<p>Let’s start with what we feel is most important: the effective transmission distance — or how far apart you can be while successfully communicating with your device. To best simulate various user experiences, we split this test into three different terrains:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Low blockage: </b>Beach, coastline and surrounding wide-open areas</li>
<li><b>Medium blockage: </b>Suburban neighborhoods</li>
<li><b>Dense blockage: </b>Downtown San Diego</li>
</ul>
<p>We structured our experiment in this way to accurately simulate the various environments that walkie talkie users would likely find themselves in. At each environment, we stationed one person with one of every device, as another person drove further and further away from that location. The driver stopped at three different checkpoints per environment, which varied in distance dependent upon the walkie talkies’ transmission strength in each terrain. Distance “as the crow flies” was measured using the Waze app on an iPhone. Records were taken for each model at each distance to gauge their effectiveness.</p>
<p>While none of the models successfully transmitted at the distances advertised by their manufacturers, we found that most models reached up to similar distances — with the exception of the kids’ models <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MSSU87M/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Swiftion</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U8AD9MI/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Floureon</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OXLY49A/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Retevis</a>. We were surprised at the functionality of the cheaper models, particularly <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077G8C1KJ/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tacklife</a>, as they stood their ground and even surpassed the far more expensive models in the wide-open terrain.</p>

<p><strong>Low blockage test</strong></p>
<p>Our five-mile distance at the beach was across wide-open ocean and coastline from Torrey Pines State Beach to La Jolla Shores in San Diego. There were cliffs nearby, but we still had a clear line of sight to each other. We feel it was a fair test of the true maximum range of each model.</p>
<p>At longer distances, many of the devices began to transmit only when we pointed the antennae to certain directions. Though we could understand each other while transmitting, we felt that without our cell phones allowing us to hear everything it would have been very difficult to maintain regular communication while relying so heavily on the direction of the antennae. We noted this in our test results as “a.d.” or antenna dependent.</p>
<p><strong>Medium blockage test</strong></p>
<p>In the common setting of suburban neighborhoods, we were surprised at the difficulty all of the models had in successfully transmitting at longer distances. It is, however, important to note the frequent changes in elevation between each device. This may not come as much of a surprise, but walkie talkies have a much poorer range when operated in areas where hills are common.</p>
<p>Environments like this are very inconsistent due to vastly differing amounts of houses, buildings and hills, thereby making successful transmission difficult to rely upon. We conducted our suburban testing in multiple locations from similar distances to account for these inconsistencies in other suburban environments.</p>
<p><strong>High blockage test</strong></p>
<p>In the thick of the city in downtown San Diego, some of our contestants struggled to maintain connection between each other. At our one-mile mark, with many buildings in between, the only models that were able to reach their counterparts were Tacklife and Midland.</p>

<p>Through our experience with these walkie talkies, we’ve come to recognize that for all intents and purposes there are two different layout types among these models. Let’s call them “high tech” and “bare bones.”</p>
<p>Whether you prefer a minimalistic walkie talkie or an in-depth and feature-packed device is up to you. If your only intended use for your walkie talkies is to communicate with your recipient(s), and you don’t feel the need for privacy channels, weather reports, GMRS frequency options, SOS sirens, and so forth, then we’d recommend saving yourself some money and sticking with one of the simpler options.</p>
<p>If you are the type of adventurer that intends to buy one walkie talkie for life and wants to ensure all of your bases are covered, then go “high tech” all the way. Even for the Midland, perhaps the most feature-packed model, the interface is very intuitive and the operation manual can get you on your feet quickly.</p>
<h3>Battery life</h3>
<p>At first we tested  battery life by simply leaving the devices powered on and then waiting for them to die. However, we decided that a more accurate method was to leave them transmitting constantly.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, we taped a coin over the transmit button on each device (with quite a bit of pressure) so the walkie talkies were actually in use the whole time. In this test, the devices were being operated in a way that would drain battery life far quicker than the “idle” alternative and thereby would simulate regular usage more realistically.</p>
<p>We also grouped all of them together to ensure they were transmitting audio of a consistent volume. This gave us an accurate gauge of each model’s battery life, relative to each other.</p>
<p>One important thing to note is that some of the models actually have a time out timer (TOT) built in that caps the maximum transmit time to one to three minutes. Unless you plan to talk consistently for one to three minutes without stopping or allowing yourself to hear your fellow communicant, this shouldn’t be anything to worry about. However, it likely did affect our test results to a small extent.</p>

Although you have the option to switch to regular batteries, it likely won’t ever be necessary. Just charge at your convenience, and it’ll last a very long time.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001UE6MIO/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>To combat this TOT feature for testing purposes, as soon as we saw that a device had stopped transmitting (via the small red indicator lights on all of the devices), we immediately unwrapped the tape and pressed the coin back onto the button. Although it was only a matter of seconds, that time adds up throughout the entire duration of testing, so the margin of error should be considered to be up to a few minutes.</p>
<p>As you can see below, the battery life of the devices lessened dramatically through our testing method, as compared to what was advertised. You can infer that your battery life with any model will lie somewhere in between our test result and the maximum battery life advertised by the manufacturer, dependent upon your ratio of transmission versus idle time.</p>
<p>While using the Motorola or Midland models, you might as well use the rechargeable battery until its depletion before switching to AA batteries for additional usage. Both of these models should be recognized as having far better battery life than the other models we tested, due to their dual-power battery option.</p>
<h3>Audio quality and volume</h3>
<p>We also ran a couple of tests to find which models have the loudest max volume and the best quality and clarity of sound. Using a decibel meter, we fed audio of a consistent volume (a note on an electronic piano) into the sending walkie talkie while holding the meter one inch from the recipient walkie talkie. Our test for volume was short-lived, as the volume from each model proved to be almost exactly the same.</p>
<p>For audio quality, we simply conversed through each model from a fixed distance away and rated each walkie talkie’s quality of sound on a scale of 1-10.</p>
<p>To our ear, the clear winner of this shoot-out was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077G8C1KJ/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tacklife &#8211; MTR01</a> due to its superb quality of sound and lack of any static interference.</p>
<p><b>To our surprise, the Motorola had consistent static accompanying any and every transmission.</b> This static persisted throughout our distance testing as well; for such an expensive model, we were unimpressed.</p>
<p>The Baofeng, Proster, Arcshell and ESYNiC models had a good quality of sound, but were definitely a step down in clarity from the Tacklife and Midland. These models tested to be virtually identical, and all had more static during transmission as well.</p>
<p>The kids&#8217; models also sounded surprisingly clear, with Floureon and Retevis beating Swiftion only slightly. The Midland’s audio quality was second to the Tacklife and was only ranked below it due to our personal preference of the Tacklife sound. The Midland sounded as if the sender was speaking from six inches away from the device, so the voice didn’t sound quite as full. However, it surely earned its place behind Tacklife.</p>

<p>We also addressed the comfortability and functionality of the various attachments that come included with the purchase of walkie talkies. We spent many hours with the different models clipped to our belts and used the earpieces throughout our testing of transmission distance. Shown below are our overall ratings and notes on the attachments of each model.</p>
<h4>Antennae</h4>
<p>The models we reviewed also contained either an attached or detachable antenna;  there are subtle pros and cons to each of these options.  Ultimately, it comes down personal preference. The models with detachable antennae were consistently larger than those with attached antennae, but after unscrewing them, the different models were all a similar height and would be easy to pack and store away as needed.</p>
<h4>Waist clips</h4>
<p>Each of the belt clips that came with the finalists would do their job. However, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001UE6MIO/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Motorola &#8211; MH230R</a> excels over the rest in a unique way. Frankly, we never thought we would rave about the waist clip of a walkie talkie, but this mechanism is actually pretty cool. Its clip fits snug and secure and has the capability to spin freely while on your waist. When you want to use the device, you press a small button to release it from the clip. When you want to clip it back to your waist, you  simply press it against the clip, and it snaps back into place. It’s oddly satisfying.</p>
<p>Since the Motorola is smaller than all of the adult models, it sits more comfortably on your waist than any of the other models. If you are looking to snap your device on and off regularly while engaging in rigorous physical activity like skiing, running or biking, this would be a great model and feature to consider for this reason alone!</p>
<p>In the Baofeng, Proster, Arcshell and ESYNiC models, there is the minor annoyance of having to unscrew a backplate and re-screw the plate with the waist clip attached. This may not matter much to users that plan to keep the clip on their device at all times, but if you prefer the ability to remove the clip when it’s not in use, you would have to carry a screwdriver as well.</p>
<p>The Midland clip is second best to the Motorola, as it is very easy to clip on and off, due to a spring mechanism in the clip itself. As long as you are moderately cautious, less intense physical activities such as hiking, hunting and travel by foot shouldn’t be enough to knock this model off your waist. The clip is built well with strong plastic and should not break, even through excessive use.</p>
<p>The Tacklife model has an extremely strong clip that holds to your waist with roughly the same force as the clip of the Midland model. For good or bad, the clip can be difficult to detach from the walkie talkie itself, but the low-profile shape and design of the clip makes it unlikely that you’ll want to remove it once it’s attached.</p>
<h4>Earpieces</h4>
<p>If you’re thinking we didn’t end up on the pro-earpiece side, you’re correct. Regardless of their size, shape, transmission method and audio quality, the earpieces proved to be an overall flop.</p>
<p>The main problem we had with the earpieces is that they seemed impractical for the vast majority of situations. If it&#8217;s necessary to use one hand to operate the push to talk (PTT) button on the earpiece cord, you might as well just use that hand to hold the walkie talkie itself.</p>
<p>For some of the models, the earpiece transmission button didn’t work at all and we had to press the regular PTT button on the device to use it. The earpieces on all models were moderately uncomfortable and made communication difficult. It’s nice that some of the models come with earpieces included, but unless you’re buying them for your children to pretend they’re secret agents or AT&amp;T Customer Support, we’d recommend against letting them influence your decision at all.</p>

<p>While it was neck and neck with the Tacklife &#8211; MTR01 throughout most of our tests, the additional features on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001WMFYH4/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Midland &#8211; GXT1000VP4</a> earned it the top spot, even with its (well-deserved) higher price tag. In addition to its strong performance, this model has useful features that can come in handy.</p>
<p>The battery options alone are enough to set this model apart from the rest. For long trips or overnight camping, the ability to swap your rechargeable battery pack for AA batteries is extremely valuable. For different levels of signal amplification and battery length, you can also choose between low, medium and high power options.</p>
<p>This model also holds communication features such as whisper, group call and eVOX hands-free operation. The whisper setting increases volume output for communication at whispered volumes. This can be useful when operating your device late at night or in a quiet area or workplace, so as not to disturb others around you.</p>
<p>Group calling allows you to make direct calls to other people within your group without alerting your entire group, and eVOX operation gives you the capability to do so without needing to hold down the push-to-talk button. The model’s 142 privacy codes also help to keep contact with your communicants without other users stumbling upon your frequencies.</p>

Its versatility and functionality make it a walkie talkie that excels in all environments and activities.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001WMFYH4/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>In addition to both GMRS and FRS channel capabilities, the Midland also houses a weather report channel. With weather reporting, an SOS siren and hazard alerts, this device is a smart pick to have by your side when wandering the wilderness or open ocean. Its resistance to splashing and light rain is also handy in these situations, as long as you’re careful not to get it too wet.</p>
<p>The list of features goes on and is ultimately what led us to choose this model as our overall best pick.

<p>Throughout our testing, we grew fonder of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077G8C1KJ/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tacklife &#8211; MTR01</a>. We started its testing skeptically due to its low cost and lack of an abundance of Amazon reviews. However, after separating ourselves long distances to test the effective ranges of the devices, we were surprised to find that this model became our fallback option as our cell phone batteries died!</p>
<p>The Tacklife excelled in every environment and terrain. It successfully transmitted to its counterpart at a greater range and clarity than all the other walkie-talkies we tested, without relying on the position and direction of its antenna.</p>

With its unrivaled transmission distance and perfect simplicity, this three-buttoned device leaves us wondering how it works so well with such a comparably low price tag.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077G8C1KJ/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>For a price so similar to the majority of the popular models and brands on the market, the transmission distance and practical simplicity of this model are unparalleled. The smooth, slick shape and design with detachable antenna and sturdy belt clip felt very natural both in our hands and on our waists. If you’re a fan of simplicity over complexity, and don’t mind the drop-off of available in-depth features, the Tacklife &#8211; MTR01 is a no-brainer.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Tacklife &#8211; MTR01 houses perfect simplicity and functionality. It cuts to the chase without the need for any bells and whistles.</li>
<li>Superb transmission distance and better audio quality tin this device even surpasses the far more expensive models.</li>
<li>Very well built and durable. This model feels good in your hand and clips very securely to your waist.</li>

<p>Our number one pick for kids is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U8AD9MI/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Floureon</a>. Its pocket-friendly size, simplicity and low cost make this model a perfect choice for small children, provided that they don’t stray too far from home!</p>
<p>After all testing was said and done, we were perplexed by the considerable difference in Amazon ratings and reviews between the Floureon and the Retevis walkie talkies, since they&#8217;re basically the same thing but with different names and price tags.</p>
<p>The Floureon’s 22 channels are more than enough to ensure you don’t share your radio waves with other families. Its display and interface are easy to read and navigate, and its functionality is very intuitive and kid-friendly.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U8AD9MI/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Floureon-Two-way-Radio-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Floureon-Two-way-Radio-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Floureon-Two-way-Radio-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Floureon-Two-way-Radio-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Floureon-Two-way-Radio-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Floureon-Two-way-Radio-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Floureon-Two-way-Radio-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Floureon-Two-way-Radio-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Floureon-Two-way-Radio.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Kids' Pick: Floureon - Two-way Radio</h3><p>This great little device is perfect for children who frequently wander around the house or neighborhood. Its low price and great battery life make it a low-maintenance option that can cheaply be replaced if your kids like to throw things.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U8AD9MI/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Either model will do just fine, and you can’t argue with their size, utility and price. We chose the Floureon over the Retevis as our top pick simply because its cost is slightly lower. However, if you feel that a larger model is good for your child, and the price difference doesn’t bother you, we’d recommend spending the extra money and going with the Tacklife &#8211; MTR01.</p>
<p>As a note, there&#8217;s nothing that prevents this model from being suitable for adults. If you prefer something durable and bare bones, you might enjoy the Floureon just as much as your favorite kiddo.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Floureon is small and easy to carry around. However, if you don’t require a smaller device, consider the upgrade to the Tacklife &#8211; MTR01.</li>
<li>This model tested exactly the same as the Retevis but is less expensive.</li>
<li>Floureon’s simple design and interface are well catered to children.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Motorola &#8211; MH230R: </b>The leader of our battery life test was by far the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001UE6MIO/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Motorola &#8211; MH230R</a>. By the time the rest of the models had fully depleted their batteries, this model stood strong and touted its full 3/3 battery indicator. In all fairness, this model also had the shortest time out timer and therefore was transmitting less frequently than the other models. Even so, a display of “full battery” after 90 minutes of mostly constant operation is impressive.</p>
<p>The size of the Motorola paired with its uniquely designed and handy waist clip attachment make it an excellent choice for use during rigorous physical activity. This model sits comfortably by your side and spins freely on its clip, allowing free movement during activities like biking, running and skiing/snowboarding.</p>
<p>However, we were disappointed with its lack of transmission range. For such a huge price increase from the Midland and Tacklife models, the Motorola became heavily dependent upon its antenna direction at further distances. Transmission was also accompanied by a consistent and annoying static sound.</p>
<p>However, for shorter distances between you and your communicant, the size of this device paired with its unparalleled battery life and waist clip utility still make this model a great buy — provided your budget allows for its price.</p>
<p><b>Retevis: </b>The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OXLY49A/?tag=ybdwalk-20">Retevis</a> performed on par with its competitor, Floureon, through our testing. In our observation and testing experience, the Floureon seemed to be <i>exactly</i> the same as the Retevis, but with a slightly lower price tag. In our experience, either model will be fine and they should both perform (almost) exactly the same.</p>

<p><b>Baofeng, Proster, Arcshell and ESYNiC: </b>You may have noticed our lack of enthusiasm  for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ECW9DB4/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baofeng</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KGVV78C/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Proster</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072JJFVJG/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Arcshell</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019MGPT9O/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ESYNiC</a>. All four are pretty much the  same but have slight variations to charging methods and/or earpieces and, most importantly, their <i>cost.</i> Oddly, these models differ in price, ranging between $18 to $30.</p>
<p>We couldn’t help but compare them to the Tacklife due to their similar price and design, leaving us with a collection of models that simply fell short to the Tacklife’s functionality, build quality and overall reliability. Their operation manuals were poorly written and lacked sufficient detail, ultimately leaving us with a device that we felt was nothing more than second best.</p>
<p><b>Swiftion: </b>We were fairly disappointed with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MSSU87M/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Swiftion</a>. While the device itself looks like it would be perfect for kids, it tested to have the worst range out of all 10 walkie talkies. It also boasts the highest number of buttons with seemingly unnecessary and confusing functionality for use intended for children.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>In choosing which walkie talkie is best for you, it’s important to ask yourself what you need from the device. Realistically, the majority of people would likely get by just fine with a simpler and cheaper choice like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077G8C1KJ/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tacklife &#8211; MTR01</a>. Its utility and ease of use are more direct than even the models intended for children, and its transmission strength is right up there with models four times its price.</p>
<p>If you’re the adventurer type who prefers to study up on the user manual and explore the many features and benefits of a more complex and feature-packed device, then you should look no further than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001WMFYH4/?tag=ybdwalk-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Midland &#8211; GXT1000VP4</a>. From the mountains to the city, and everything in between, this model’s versatility and high-level functionality make it a great tool to have for any and all experiences and activities.</p>
<p>Regardless of your choice, it’s time to brush up on the lingo and make your way into the world of radio frequencies. “Over and out.”</p>

<p>With all the different types of water bottles — plastic, metal, glass, insulated or not — it can be confusing to pick the best one for your needs. In addition to our top pick, we’ve identified four runner-up options to give you plenty of choices to pick from, including a collapsible version.</p>
<p>Each bottle material has its own strengths, and knowing the advantages of each will help you find a bottle you&#8217;ll be happiest with. The only type of bottle to keep drinks hot <em>or</em> cold are vacuum insulated bottles. Every other type does not, and these other ones all form condensation on the outside when you put cold water inside. Check out the breakdown below for more differences:</p>
<p><a href="#best-insulated-water-bottle">Vacuum insulated bottles</a> are the best way to keep your water super cold for an entire day, or to keep beverages hot for an impressive five hours. These insulated bottles have two inner chambers, one for the water and then one surrounding that with a vacuum channel. This proves to be a very effective method for insulation, but these weigh more because of it.</p>
<p><a href="#best-glass-water-bottle">Glass water bottles</a> eliminate plastic or metal tastes and chemicals / BPAs. Being able to see how much liquid is left without having to pick up or open the bottle is a nice perk. All were covered in a silicone sleeve for drop protection (no bottles cracked or shattered in our drop tests) but glass and silicone will not insulate your water. Condensation formed on all glass and silicone surfaces even though the silicone sleeves helped improve grip.</p>
<p><a href="#best-stainless-steel-water-bottle">Stainless steel bottles</a> are an effective, low-cost option. They’re non-reactive, BPA free, and lightweight compared to glass or their insulated stainless steel counterparts. You can&#8217;t put hot water in these as directed by the manufacturers (and you&#8217;ll burn your hands). But if you just need something for short amounts of time and don’t care about insulation, it’s tough to beat the value. Some folks prefer glass to avoid the metal smell or taste, but we found no issue with tastes on these bottles at all. We also tested one aluminum bottle, which is a bit lighter but otherwise similar.</p>
<p><a href="#best-plastic-bottle">Plastic water bottles</a> are geared towards sports and workouts. Even if you&#8217;re not using it for those purposes you can still benefit from their sporty design features. Three of the bottles we tested had a flip-top lid that lets you drink using one hand, which we loved. They&#8217;re also lightweight compared to glass and insulated bottles. Every bottle we tested was made of Tritan, a material claiming to be free of BPAs, estrogenic and androgenic activity. We still found these bottles to have the strongest smell though.</p>
<p><a href="#best-collapsible-water-bottle">Collapsible water bottles</a> are perfect if you&#8217;re traveling or hiking and space is very limited. They are incredibly thin and the lightest weight option by a large margin &#8212; collapsible bottles we tested weighed eight times less than insulated bottles, and four times less than our tested plastic bottles. These do have a smell but mostly go away after a few washes.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-chose">How we chose the best bottles to test</h2>
<p>There are a lot of water bottle options out there, so we started by narrowing our list of finalists by only selecting those that fit specific criteria. There are many materials and styles these bottles are made in, so we tested five of the most popular types.</p>
<p>We searched Amazon, Reddit, forums and other water bottle reviews to find the highest quality and most popular brands of water bottles.</p>
<p>A review on Outside Online cited a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GOF6TAU/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SIGG bottle</a> that outperformed anything we’ve heard of in terms of thermoregulation, so we had to add that to the test list as well.</p>
<p>Every bottle we chose fit these criteria:</p>
<p><strong>Water capacity:</strong> It held enough water to quench thirst, but it wasn&#8217;t too big that it would be cumbersome to lug around. Many brands have larger bottles at 32 and even 64 oz capacities.</p>
<p><strong>They&#8217;re well-reviewed:</strong> Other reviews that praised bottles, and bottles on Amazon&#8217;s best-sellers list were slightly favored.</p>
<p><strong>Fewer issues with quality:</strong> Any bottles that have a higher than average history of complaints on build quality, leaking or other functional qualities were omitted.</p>
<p><strong>They&#8217;re not too specialized:</strong> We avoided bottles that were designed for very specific tasks, such as cycling.</p>
<p><strong>They&#8217;re not knockoffs:</strong> Whether it&#8217;s a knockoff or rebrand, many of these are actually the same exact bottle so we didn&#8217;t test duplicates. See more detail below.</p>
<h3>Knock-off and rebranded water bottles</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2991" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles.jpg" alt="two different rebranded bottles side by side" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>If you shop for water bottles online or in many retail stores, you&#8217;ll notice many brands with products that look identical. For example, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MIRA-Insulated-Double-Vacuum-Stainless/dp/B00XK4BCZ0/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mira</a> bottle we tested seems to have the same design as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Modern-Vacuum-Insulated-Bottle/dp/B01GKGEZUI/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Simple Modern</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ICONIQ-Stainless-Vacuum-Insulated-Bottle/dp/B01BFX24XG/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ICONIQ</a>, and the popular <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Swell-Womens-Teakwood-Water-Bottle/dp/B00M00OPZ4/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">S&#8217;well</a> to name a few.</p>
<p>The popular Hydro Flask looks to have the same design as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vacuum-Insulated-Mouth-Stainless-Bottle/dp/B0181FY83K/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">321 Strong</a>, Glacier Point, and Fifty Fifty.</p>
<p>Some Redditors explained the source of the many knock-offs of popular water bottle brands out there: most knock offs are just rebrands that come out of the same factory as the originals. So we assumed their performance to be the same and avoided testing any rebranded products.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more that goes into a great water bottle than meets the eye! We put our 22 finalists through an extensive series of tests to see which would come out on top. Those tests included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thermal insulation test</li>
<li>Hot water test</li>
<li>Leak and drop test</li>
<li>Condensation test</li>
<li>Usability test</li>
</ul>
<h3>Thermal insulation test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2835" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures.jpg" alt="testing water bottle temperatures with thermometer" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Since drinking room-temperature water isn&#8217;t something most people prefer, we tested every bottle for its ability to keep water cold. For the bottles that were designed for it, we tested their ability to keep water hot too.</p>
<p>We tested temperatures with an <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-digital-meat-thermometer/">instant-read thermometer</a> so the bottles only needed to be opened for a short amount of time during temperature testing.</p>
<p>Just for good measure, we tested the vacuum insulated bottles as well as the uninsulated bottles with cold water: glass bottles, plastic bottles, collapsible plastic bottles and stainless steel bottles. Starting with cold, 42°F water, we let the bottles duke it out in a temperature controlled room  and measured the temperatures along the way.</p>
<p>The cold water in uninsulated bottles rose a whopping 20°F in the first hour and coasted to room temperature after just five hours.</p>
<p>Insulated bottles, on the other hand, fared much better. It took about 20 hours for all of the bottles to reach near room temperature, which is very impressive! This means you can be sipping on ice-cold water throughout the course of a normal 8 or 10-hour day using an insulated bottle.</p>

It&#8217;s clear from the poor rank of the 10-ounce Sigg in this test that a big factor in keeping your drink cold is how much water is inside. With cold water (or ice), the more you can keep inside, the better it will stay cold.</p>
<h3>Hot water test</h3>
<p>Four of our five vacuum insulated bottles were suitable for use with hot water. We tested the Klean Kanteen, SIGG, Hydro Flask, and the Mira bottles. We added boiling water to each bottle, and adjusted water levels until each reached 196°F, then checked on them in even intervals.</p>
<p>We removed the lids and tested temperatures with the same instant-read digital thermometer we used on the cold water test. Hot water returned to room temperature much faster than the cold water did, but these bottles performed according to manufacturer promises.</p>

<h3>2018 Updates: 32oz bottle test</h3>
<div id="visualizer-18685-1743287293" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-18685"></div>
In 2018 we tested our new contenders in another heat retention test. This time, we picked a standard size (32 ounces) and tested with an uninsulated stainless steel bottle as a control. Water started at a rolling boil, but by the time we pre-filled and blended the water between the bottles to get a fair comparison the average temperature was 184.</p>
<p>In this test, it was once again the narrowest-neck bottle that took top position. Unlike the narrow mouth on the Mira bottle from our first lineup, Klean Kanteen&#8217;s Classic 1.7-inch opening is wide enough to fit full-size ice cubes, but it still gives an edge in insulation performance. 160 degrees after 12 hours is toasty, even on the edge of piping hot.</p>
<p>The other standout in this test is YETI, with the heavy (and expensive) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072BVN7JB/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rambler Bottle.</a> If you want top insulation with a wide-open mouth, YETI was only four degrees lower than the Klean Kanteen after a full twelve hours, compared to more than 20 degrees difference in the other wide-mouth bottles.</p>
<h3>Leak and drop test</h3>
<p>A bottle that leaks is not much more useful than a lidless cup, so we tested each bottle for leak potential. Thankfully, none of the bottles leaked with normal use and vigorous shaking or twisting, so we decided to do some drop tests to see how they stand up to some abuse.</p>
<p>We filled each bottle to 75% capacity, then dropped it from standing position three feet from the ground on its bottom, then once again on its top, and finally we pushed it off a table about three feet tall.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, all bottles remained leakproof after being dropped. All stainless steel bottles dented to some degree, and the uninsulated steel variety dented the worst, causing them to wobble when placed on a flat surface.</p>
<p>We expected the sport bottles with seemingly fragile flip caps &#8212; like the Embrava, Under Armour and the Thermos &#8212; to break or at least leak after they were dropped, but they did not. During one drop, the Embrava&#8217;s lid actually shifted off the cap threads a bit and took some force to unscrew &#8212; yet it still remained leakproof after being put back on.</p>
<p>While dropping the glass bottles, we were bracing ourselves for shattered glass everywhere with each drop, yet no bottles ever shattered. The silicone sleeves did a good job of absorbing the drop impact.</p>
<h3>Condensation test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2836" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles.jpg" alt="condensation buildup on bottles" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Condensation forms on the outside of cold water bottles because cooler air around the bottles can&#8217;t hold as much moisture as warmer air, causing the moisture to condense. This matters because it will affect grip on the bottle, as well as potential to damage electronics you&#8217;re storing in the same bag as your water bottle if enough moisture is formed.</p>
<p>Every uninsulated bottle had condensation form on the outside of the bottle when there was cold water inside. Even the glass bottles with silicone covers had condensation form on top of the covers.</p>
<p>The amount of moisture was consistent between the bottles, but varied by day, depending on the humidity. If you plan to transport bottles with laptops or other electronics, the safest option is to use a vacuum insulated bottle or room temperature water.</p>
<h3>Usability test</h3>

<p>Each bottle went through usability testing, to see how it stood up to regular use.</p>
<p><strong>Ice:</strong> We wanted to know if it was possible to add ice and how easy it was to add water. We used standard ice cubes from a freezer&#8217;s automatic ice machine. About five of the bottles we tested didn&#8217;t have mouths wide enough for ice or for cleaning with brush. Some could only fit one at a time, while many wider mouth bottles could be filled with multiple cubes at once.</p>
<p><strong>Loops and grip:</strong> We took bottles out on trips over the course of a few weeks to test how easy each was to carry. Loops in the lid made it much easier to hold a bottle at the same time as groceries, bags or keys, whereas bottles without any loops forced you to dedicate a hand to it. Loops and clips make it easy to hang bottles from a backpack too.</p>
<p><strong>Cupholders:</strong> Larger bottles and most collapsible bottles we tested were not made to fit in cupholders. Most fit fine, but some barely made the cut. We tested the bottles in our cars for fit.</p>
<p><strong>Cleaning:</strong> Before the first use and after multiple refills, we washed each bottle by hand with a bottle brushing, hot water and dish soap. This proved fairly easy for most bottles, but a few caused problems with a spout that was too small, or just because the bottle was too long.</p>

<p>After testing a variety of sizes over the last three years, the best insulated bottle is from Klean Kanteen, either the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Klean-Kanteen-Insulated-Stainless-20-Ounce/dp/B004PXWG4G/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">20-ounce wide mouth</a> if you need a compact bottle or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SA2XNWW/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">32 ounce classic</a> if you want to keep beverages cold or hot all day long.</p>
<h3>A smaller insulated bottle</h3>
<p>The wide mouth of the 20-ounce made it easy to fill with ice and to drink out of, and its slim design made it easy to fit in cupholders and bottle compartments in most backpacks. The wider mouth is a slight compromise in insulation, but for a smaller bottle you might not notice the difference since you&#8217;ll be refilling long before your ice is gone.</p>

<p>The big loop lid makes it easy to carry with a few fingers or loop onto bags with a carabiner. If you don&#8217;t care for this feature, wide mouth Klean Kanteen bottles can also take the totally leakproof <a href="http://www.kleankanteen.com/products/cafe-cap?variant=19736711878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cafe Cap 2.0</a> twist-open lid. We tested this design in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/#how-we-tested" rel="noopener">travel mug review</a>. We liked it better than cheap flip-up lids, though it&#8217;s not as good as other mugs for one-hand sipping and has a lot of parts to clean.</p>
<p>This bottle fared well in our drop tests with minimal damage to both the bottom and the lid. In the insulation tests it ranked 2nd for cold water, and 3rd for hot water. One downside of any steel bottle is that the mouth gets hot to the touch after letting it bake in the car on a hot day.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SA2XNWW?th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klean Kanteen-Classic 32-ounce</a> is a great water bottle for storing and sipping ice-cold water without as many refills. The opening is about half an inch narrower than the wide mouth on Klean Kanteen&#8217;s mug-size bottles, which means it&#8217;s a little more tricky to pack with ice, but still much easier than the wine-bottle shaped MIRA and S&#8217;WELL bottles.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re filling with ice water or some other beverage, this insulation will keep it cold (or hot) for longer than any wide-mouth bottle. Klean Kanteen also sells this same bottle design with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Klean-Kanteen-Insulated-Stainless-Growler/dp/B00X6ZNOAO" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">with a clamp-down growler lid</a> for filling up at your favorite micro-brewery. (The Growler model also works with the standard lid.)</p>

<h3>Hydro Flask vs. Klean Kanteen</h3>
<p>The 32 oz. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K5ZRUZ8/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hydro Flask</a> is a strong runner-up. Hydro Flask ranked 3rd in our cold water test and 4th in the original hot water test, but they&#8217;re a very close competitor for our top pick. The loop on the cap makes it easy to pick up with one finger if your hands are full carrying other things and the grip on the cap makes it easy to open and close the lid.</p>
<p>We interviewed loyalists for each brand, and they all have glowing accounts of how great the bottles are. They also rave about how easy it was to get a replacement cap or sometimes even a free replacement bottle after a dramatic accident.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between Klean Kanteen and Hydro Flask is in the availability of different neck shapes. Hydro Flask uses wide-mouth openings for sizes from 18 to 64 ounces, with the narrower &#8220;standard&#8221; mouth is only available in 18, 21 and 14 ounce bottles. Klean Kanteen has almost the opposite selection, with their &#8220;classic&#8221; narrow-mouth design available in sizes from 12 up to 64 ounces, with wide-mouth options in 12, 16 and 20 ounces.</p>
<p>Since the narrower mouth is better at insulating while still making ice fairly easy to add, and the 32 ounce Klean Kanteen is more affordable, we think Klean Kanteen has the edge overall. If you&#8217;re carrying a bottle packed with ice for sipping cold water on a hot day, the temperature difference is going to be less important and you should feel free to buy whichever bottle has the cap and styling you prefer.</p>
<p>Both of these brands also makes a spectrum of durable powder-coat colors that should satisfy anyone, but the availability of your favorite color might change from month to month. If you can&#8217;t find the color you like in stock, it&#8217;s probably worth checking the other brand.</p>

The 25 oz. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H9F72H1/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mira bottle</a> performed best in the cold water test. It likely gets a bump in performance due to its relatively small cap design &#8212; the main area where there isn&#8217;t vacuum insulation and where external temps would seep in.</p>
<p>The smaller opening of this bottle also comes with a downside though &#8212; it&#8217;s slightly awkward to drink out of since it&#8217;s sized perfectly to hit your nose with each sip. In the hot water test, it was not a surprise that the Mira ranked second. The 25 oz. bottle we tested was a bit on the larger side for cupholders, so if you opt for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0764P6DR2/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mira&#8217;s 17 oz. bottle</a> it would be a nicer fit.</p>

We also liked its latch mechanism, but unfortunately it's intended only for cold beverages (not hot liquids).</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E6O7CAC/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>As another great option geared for sports, we liked the 24 oz. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E6O7CAC/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Under Armour bottle</a>. It ranked fourth in our cold water test, but is by no means a poor performer given its other perks. This bottle features a spring-loaded flip cap and silicone grip makes it easy for one-handed operation while running or driving. It even has a latch to ensure the bottle stays locked during transport in your backpack or gym bag. One downside is the manufacturer says this bottle can&#8217;t be used with hot water, likely because of the plastic components in the lid.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GOF6TAU/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SIGG Thermo</a> performed best of the small bottles in our first hot water test, sadly, it&#8217;s becoming difficult to track down. Specifically designed for tea drinkers, the SIGG has a built in metal filter, if you won&#8217;t ever use that feature you can remove it for hot water or coffee. You have to separate the lid by unscrewing it which is not as simple as it should be, but it is an option. We looked at the larger versions in Sigg&#8217;s Classic series, but most owners agree they&#8217;re better as a thermos (using the cup that slides over the base of the bottle) than as a bottle to drink from.</p>

<p>Our top pick for glass bottles was the Takeya Classic 22 ounce. We loved the large cap threads around the top of the bottle, which makes it easy to open and close the cap without missing the threads.</p>
<p>This bold and simple design of the cap helps prevent it from damage when dropped too. In our drop tests there was minimal cap damage, and the silicone sleeve surprisingly prevented the bottle from shattering. The sleeve design on this bottle makes it easy to see the remaining water levels too.</p>

<p>Just like the other glass bottles we tested, there&#8217;s no insulation, but there&#8217;s also no lead or chemicals and it&#8217;s completely dishwasher safe. However, this bottle&#8217;s perfectly sized for easy holding and drinking, and the silicone grip makes it even more secure if you&#8217;re using it for sports.</p>

The silicone sleeve isn't just for looks — it also helped the Ello survive our impact tests.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BUUW476/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>We ranked the 20 oz. Ello bottle in a close second place, largely due to its simplicity. It gets the job done without features that are prone to issues. Like the Takeya, it has large threads in the cap for easy opening and closing of the lid. Its large loop on the cap lets you carry the bottle with multiple fingers, distributing the weight for comfortable carrying for longer periods of time.</p>
<p>This cap design also helped spread the impact nicely in our drop test that left no noticeable damage on the bottle. Like the other glass options, we have lots of options in silicone sleeve design and color too.</p>
<p>The little drinking spout on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B9DJWTM/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Life Factory</a> bottle might be convenient to some, but there was no other hole to let air in as you drink from it, so you basically have to waterfall from the little spout to take a sip. Although this bottle didn&#8217;t leak in our tests, the mini spout cap is very prone to popping off so you don&#8217;t want to throw this into a bag that you can&#8217;t keep an eye on.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007L6953Y/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CamelBak&#8217;</a> storable straw doesn&#8217;t have issues with potential leaks because it is easily folded back when not in use. The uncentered design of the cap loop can affect the outcome of a drop depending on how it happens to be dropped, but in our testing it fared well. The CamelBak is a well-designed bottle overall that&#8217;s easy to use, but the straw makes it pretty difficult to ensure a proper cleaning, putting it further down on our list.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard for the short <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PV9Y72W/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bKr bottle</a> to go unnoticed &#8212; it looks very well designed! This one&#8217;s basically famous for being used by celebrities and being covered in magazines. When we bought it, the price was $35; this is an astounding 2-3x the cost of the other glass options. The slanted cap made screwing the cap on particularly difficult, and the small spout makes it impossible to fit any ice or a bottle brush. The bKr bottle is definitely a design-centric purchase if you&#8217;re willing to put up with its issues and price tag.</p>

<p>The Klean Kanteen was an easy #1 pick out of the three finalists. The mouth was much bigger, easier to fill with ice and water and more pleasant to drink from. It also had a cap with bigger threads to more easily open and close the bottle.</p>
<p>Its lid was the best of the steel bottles we tested, but a bit squeaky sounding and not as smooth in opening and closing as the insulated or glass bottles. For those who want options, this brand has many cap options you can buy separately, like a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0083F0TQ4/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">sport cap</a> or a sippy cap.</p>

It&#8217;s easy to sip from, but still easy for adding ice, too. All three stainless steel bottles are very basic products and similar in concept, but the Klean Kanteen is built with better materials and feels like a more polished product, making it our clear winner in this category.</p>

<p>The bottom of all of these bottles were dented in our drop test, which caused a few to wobble on the table. However, all remained leakproof afterwards. None of these were made to insulate liquids, and all had condensation running down the outside. These are a good cheap route to go if you just need to keep water cold for shorts amount of time.</p>
<p>The aluminum <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006PTIVTW/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SIGG</a> bottle is lightweight, but it has a tiny cap and threads. This made for a slightly clumsy opening and closing, and was the only bottle in this category that couldn&#8217;t fit ice in the mouth unless it was crushed. The aluminum dented slightly on the bottom in our drop test but still sat perfectly flat on a table. Even though it can&#8217;t fit ice, this bottle felt a little more polished than the Cheeki bottle.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BYGAAUE/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cheeki</a> was the largest stainless steel bottle we tested, perhaps contributing to the amount it was dented in our drop test. This bottle was noticeably uneven and even wobbled on the table after this test. Its mouth was large enough to fit ice cubes in, but the usage of the flip top lid is a bit awkward because of its small size and poor design. In terms of quality of materials, this bottle was easily the worst when you examine the cap material, design, and loop material.</p>

<p>We loved the Thermos &#8211; Intak, ranking it our top plastic water bottle. The flip top lid and single-handed use were pretty big factors that helped set this model apart. It&#8217;s tough to beat that convenience.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This bottle&#8217;s the only one that has a textured design built into the bottle to help improve grip &#8212; great for when you&#8217;re using this for sports since this bottle builds up condensation with cold water inside. </span></p>

<p>Although all of the plastic bottles we used had markings to measure liquids on the side, the Thermos has a unique ring built into the cap ranging from 1-5 so you can track how many times you&#8217;ve refilled or used the bottle throughout the day.</p>

This plastic water bottle option also features a one-piece tether that keeps the lid and cap attached to the bottle.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015DJC71C/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>We loved the look of the plastic CamelBak bottle and it proved to be very durable and leakproof. The spout has a cap that locks into the lid, which is a bit difficult to snap in each time, but it works to keep it out of the way. This bottle features a loop that keeps the lid attached to the bottle when you remove the lid for refilling too, something not present on the Embrava or Contigo or Thermos.</p>
<p>Although the the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B011LC85PM/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Embrava</a> and the Contigo also had single-handed operation, the Embrava was slightly on the small side, with six ounces less capacity than the top ranking Thermos. Embrava&#8217;s next size up is a whopping 32 ounce bottle, which is a bit on the large side. However, we appreciated the spout&#8217;s added air vent in the cap for easier drinking. The flip cap was surprisingly strong in our drop test too. If you prefer a slightly smaller bottle than the Thermos and can get past Embrava&#8217;s design aesthetics, this was a close runner up.</p>
<p>Both the CamelBak and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NCDE8Y/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Nalgene</a> had large threads for an easy opening lid and a wide mouth for cleaning and adding ice. However, the Nalgene had pretty bad plastic smell, even after a few washes. It looks like many other owners of this bottle had this issue too, although many reported no smells. Perhaps they vary by bottle or manufacturing batch, but this factor, combined with a very cheap looking lid, pushed this bottle further down our list.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A74ZU18/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo Autoseal</a> has a unique button you hold on the back to open the drinking spout. This bottle was leakproof when the button isn&#8217;t held, but it&#8217;s far too easy for that button to be pressed when thrown into a bag. Having to put your mouth on the bottle proved to be a little weird, and almost like a toddler&#8217;s sippy cup, but it has an air valve so you can drink without having to waterfall.</p>
<p>These bottles are not for hot beverages. If you&#8217;re looking for a hot beverage bottle take a look at our vacuum insulated stainless steel pick above. All five bottles we tested were made of the copolyester, Tritan, which is a trademark of Eastman Chemical Company. This material is popular because it&#8217;s impact resistant, free of BPAs, as well as estrogenic and androgenic activity. However,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> every bottle we tested, including the collapsible plastic bottles, were made from BPA-free plastic.</span></p>
<h2 id="best-collapsible-water-bottle">Best collapsible: Vapur &#8211; Element</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3083 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-collapsible-water-bottle.jpg" alt="best collapsible water bottle (Vapur Element)" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-collapsible-water-bottle.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-collapsible-water-bottle-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-collapsible-water-bottle-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-collapsible-water-bottle-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-collapsible-water-bottle-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-collapsible-water-bottle-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-collapsible-water-bottle-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-collapsible-water-bottle-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-collapsible-water-bottle-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Our top pick was the Vapur &#8211; Element bottle. This bottle has a flip-top cap for easy access, but it also closes securely with an audible click and will not pop off accidentally in your bag. The Vapur and the Tap were the only two we tested with mouths wide enough for ice cubes and for a brush to fit inside for thorough cleaning.</p>

<p>This was a 0.7L model, and you can get the most of that capacity by first blowing up the bag to expand it before adding water. Materials and construction on this bottle are excellent and should last for many years of use. In addition, it&#8217;s light weight and easily folded, which makes it great for taking on runs, hikes, or stowing away into luggage or carryons when traveling.</p>
<h3>The other collapsible water bottles we tested</h3>

<p>Our second pick for collapsible bottles was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B575B96/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Tap</a>, which was sold in a pack of two. Like the Vapur, it has high quality construction and has a wide mouth for ice cubes and for cleaning with a bottle brush. Cleaning is much harder without a wide mouth since it wouldn&#8217;t clean well in a dishwasher. This bottle has a carabiner for convenience, but is only pushed to second place because lack of a convenient spout when compared to the Vapur.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012H5QDYW/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aquabod</a> is a unique bottle since you can roll it up, secure it, then stash in your gym bag or backpack until you&#8217;re ready to use it. It&#8217;s also the only collapsible one we tested made of silicone. The bottle has a neat spout designed to limit how much water comes out, but both the cap and the carabiner felt cheap compared to the others.</p>
<p>Although all these bottles have some flop to them when you drink, the Aquabod was extra floppy since there&#8217;s less structure to it, forcing you to use two hands to drink most of the time. The flop also makes it difficult (but not impossible) to put this bottle into a backpack&#8217;s bottle pocket, making clipping with the carabiner the way to go.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t need a carabiner, you might appreciate the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0076ZSR3Y/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Platypu</a>&#8216; more utilitarian design, and slim center for easier handling. Its mouth was too small for ice or a cleaning brush, so you might have to boil it or do lots of manual shaking to get it clean. The only reason to go with a Platypus is to utilize the push-pull cap option they have. For us, we would rather just go with the Tap bottle with a carabiner and wider mouth.</p>
<p>All bottles had a slight smell &#8212; plastic or otherwise, before the first wash. You might have to wash it a few times or soak it in vinegar and water to get rid of most of the smell and taste. If you&#8217;re very sensitive to smells, you may want to consider another bottle material altogether.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">The bottom line</h2>
<p>What better way to stay hydrated throughout the day and your workouts than by bringing along a bottle? There are so many <em>types</em> of water bottles and seemingly endless varieties within those that it helps to narrow down your search first.</p>
<p>We found it best to start your search by thinking about what you&#8217;ll be using the bottle for most.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ll be stowing a bottle in a bag which may contain electronics or other moisture-sensitive items you want to keep away from condensation, a vacuum insulated bottle is the best option for you. Specifically our top pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004PXWG4G/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klean Kanteen</a>. This is the only type of bottle suitable for hot beverages. This bottle is also our overall top pick too, because of its wide mouth design and easy usability and maintenance. This brand also has some well-loved lid options to fit your needs like the new <a href="http://www.kleankanteen.com/collections/accessories/products/cafe-cap?variant=19736711878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cafe Cap 2.0</a>, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0093IKZGY/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Flip D-Ring</a> lid.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re on the move or prefer something lighter, something made of plastic might be the best fit for you. For extreme portability at the cost of some utility, our top pick for collapsible bottles was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007UU6JI0/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vapur Element</a>. If you&#8217;re just hitting the gym or just want something lightweight and convenient to use at your desk, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002VJX4C4/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos Intak</a>.</p>
<p>Although all the plastic bottles we tested were BPA-free, some still had an odd smell. If you&#8217;re particularly sensitive to that kind of thing and don&#8217;t care about insulation, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EAIW5MY/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klean Kanteen &#8211; Classic stainless steel bottle</a> is a good option for you, thanks to its wider-than-normal mouth and easy-to-use loop cap.</p>
<p>And if you don&#8217;t mind a little weight and like the clear look and vibrant designs that come with glass bottles, then we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003DTLNY2/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Takeya Classic</a>. Glass is totally safe for the dishwasher, and is void of any smells or concerns about chemicals and tastes we have with the other bottles. Even if you&#8217;re a bit of a klutz, our tests showed these all are capable of surviving a few drops.</p>
