								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter four weeks of testing five best-selling models in the summer heat, we&#8217;ve concluded that electric coolers are not actually very good at keeping things cold. If you need to keep food at a safe temperature over multiple days, check out our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-coolers/">review of the best coolers</a> that use ice instead of ineffective thermoelectric devices. But if you only need to keep drinks or your lunch a bit cooler while you&#8217;re driving, the 29-quart <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001MQ7DQ/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koolatron &#8211; P27 Voyager</a> is the best thermoelectric cooler in a disappointing lineup.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>After searching for reviews, we found that only a few sites have really compared and tested electric coolers. We relied on the comparison from OutdoorGearLab to set our expectations, which is to say we realized that many buyers aren&#8217;t happy with these coolers.</p>
<p>We searched for coolers that customers liked most, and found a set of five with fairly good reviews and a similar set of features. We wanted to compare with a 45-quart ice-filled cooler from our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-coolers/">cooler review</a>, so we settled on that size as a baseline.</p>
<p>We specifically looked for an upgraded or higher-tier cooler to compare with mainstream models, and settled on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077HXJS6H/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dometic &#8211; TC35-DC-A</a> because of its thermostat control. Dometic isn&#8217;t the only company selling a model like this, but they have a good reputation among RV and van enthusiasts.</p>
<p>We also bought two smaller coolers with high review counts — the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001MQ7DQ/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koolatron &#8211; P27 Voyager</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007ZYH4BM/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Igloo &#8211; Iceless 28 Quart</a> — that we could use as a comparison for the effect of cooler capacity on cooling performance.</p>

<p>An electric cooler is a bit like the traditional <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-coolers/">insulated ice chest coolers that we&#8217;ve reviewed before</a>, but it uses a thermoelectric “Peltier” device to move heat out of the cooler rather than absorbing it into ice.</p>
<p>The device itself seems almost too good to be true: Electricity carries heat from one side of a semiconductor pad to the other. Interestingly, that means if you reverse the polarity of the power cable, most of these coolers will turn into heaters.</p>
<p>These are usually advertised as &#8220;ice-free&#8221; coolers, and that&#8217;s how we used and tested them. You could add sealed gel ice packs to an electric cooler to help it absorb more heat, but dumping in a bag of ice can cause electrical shorts and isn&#8217;t recommended.</p>
<h3>Limitations of electric coolers</h3>
<p>There are two factors that limit the effectiveness of an electric cooler: the thermoelectric mechanism itself and the effectiveness of insulation.</p>
<p>The bigger the device and the more amperes of current you push through it, the more heat it can move. There are limits, though: Most thermoelectric systems can only change the temperature on one side by 30 or 40 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the problem of getting rid of all that heat on the outside: All the models we tested use an aluminum heatsink and fan to dissipate the heat once it&#8217;s on the outside of the cooler. Better performance would require larger, more complex heat-dissipation systems.</p>
<p>Coolers for drinks and snacks have another major hurdle to overcome. Even when the cooler has good insulation, If you’re opening the lid constantly, the heat rushing in makes efficiency quite poor.</p>
<h3>Power draw of electric coolers</h3>

<p>The coolers we tested are designed to only use 5 amps of 12-volt power, which is about the same draw as one headlight. That&#8217;s low enough that it won&#8217;t kill your battery over a short stop.</p>
<p>The battery for our tester&#8217;s Honda Odyssey minivan is rated for two hours of reserve capacity at 25 amps, so we could theoretically run one of these coolers for 8 hours before the battery would hit the bottom quarter of reserve life. You don&#8217;t ever want to go that low on the same battery you&#8217;re starting your vehicle with, though.</p>
<p>On a dedicated deep-cycle battery you can get away with more use, but most of us don&#8217;t have one of those in the car. These coolers are really only designed for active cooling while you&#8217;re driving or when you have access to a 120-volt AC outlet. (120-volt operation requires <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009PUQ3C/?tag=ybdecool-20">a separate adapter</a> not included with most electric coolers.)</p>
<h2 id="pros-and-cons">Pros and cons of electric coolers</h2>
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Electric coolers don’t require making or buying ice to keep lunch and drinks cool (or hot) while you&#8217;re driving.</li>
<li>No ice means no water soaking into your lunch.</li>
<li>Thermoelectric coolers are far less expensive than compressor-type refrigerators.</li>
<li>Fewer moving parts means that these coolers should be more reliable (or at least easier to repair) than refrigerators.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>An electric cooler won&#8217;t chill enough to protect raw meat on a hot day.</li>
<li>Most models aren&#8217;t as easy to clean as a good ice chest.</li>
<li>A thermoelectric cooler needs to run constantly, so it actually drains your battery faster when parked than a 12-volt compact fridge would.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vs-regular-coolers">Ice chests vs. electric coolers</h2>
<p>For the sizes that we tested, manufacturers rated the cooler performance at 40 degrees lower than the temperature outside the cooler, but that assumes a lot of things.</p>
<p>if you need to keep food (or anything else) below 40 degrees, you’d be better off using ice. When surrounded with ice, perishables are protected from heat for two or three days. So long as your food is in a waterproof container, even melted ice will typically keep food at safe temperatures for another day or so.</p>
<p>If you’re only keeping drinks chilled, or if you’re transporting something like medication that’s safe up to room temperature, an electric cooler will help you out without the constant re-stocking that makes ice inconvenient.</p>
<p>Adding frozen gel packs can help level the playing field between electric and regular coolers, but of course that still requires you to have access to a freezer.</p>
<h2 id="vs-fridges">Electric coolers vs refrigerators</h2>
<p>The key advantage that a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072MLT6QW/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">12-volt refrigerator like this 50-watt model from Dometic</a> has over a thermoelectric cooler is that it can keep your food cold even in extreme conditions.</p>
<p>Refrigerators use a coolant (like R-22, the modern replacement for Freon gas) that changes from liquid to gas inside a coiled metal tube. That process sucks all the heat out of your fridge very efficiently. A compressor makes that gas liquid again for another pass through the coil, and as the process repeats indefinitely, it can move an amazing amount of heat.</p>
<p>This phase-change system still works well on an incredibly hot day, but all those moving parts make a 12-volt fridge more expensive than a thermoelectric cooler.</p>
<p>Thermoelectric coolers will chill your drinks or help keep your lunch cold while your AC is on while you&#8217;re driving, but they need a constant supply of power. Reading <a href="http://campinnforum.com/community/threads/12v-120v-freezer-fridge.3816/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user testimonials about real-world use of 12-volt fridges and freezers</a>, it&#8217;s clear that the more expensive systems are more efficient at keeping things cold, but they still need extra battery capacity to be worthwhile.</p>
<p>Another big difference between an electric fridge and a thermoelectric cooler will be the built-in thermostat. A fridge cools quickly in short bursts to maintain a steady average temperature, while a thermoelectric cooler will need to run constantly and still not hit 40 degrees Fahrenheit on a hot day.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Internal size:</b> The size of a cooler is usually measured in quarts. The best way to keep food cool is to pack the cooler&#8217;s space full of pre-chilled or frozen beverages, so pick a size you&#8217;ll really use.</p>
<p><b>Shape:</b> Most coolers are roughly box-shaped, but some are designed to fit in between front bucket seats if you have that configuration in your vehicle.</p>
<p><b>Door orientation: </b>Coolers can be made to open upward, like an ice chest, or sideways, like a fridge. Some can work in both positions, but generally the top-opening models are the most versatile and popular.</p>
<p><b>Dividers and shelves:</b> If you have food that should be stored at different temperatures, large full-featured coolers should come with slide-in pieces that will help you keep specific items closer to or farther away from the cooling element.</p>
<p><b>Power draw:</b> Your vehicle&#8217;s battery has some reserve capacity, but you don&#8217;t want to risk getting stranded by using that all up. Higher power means better cooling power, though available models we looked at only differ by about 20 percent.</p>
<p><b>Thermostatic control: </b>A built-in thermostat will turn a premium cooler on and off to try and maintain a set temperature. This will save power if you&#8217;re only using it in an air-conditioned car or on a cloudy day, but in a heat wave it&#8217;ll be running full-time anyhow.</p>
<p><b>Drain plug: </b>This isn&#8217;t as critical a feature as it is for regular ice-filled coolers, but it still makes rinsing out an electric cooler much easier.</p>
<p><b>Heating mode:</b> Most thermoelectric coolers can be switched from chilling to heating simply by reversing the polarity of the power plug, moving heat into the cooler instead of out. This is a nifty perk if you&#8217;re delivering lunches, but our test crew agreed that they&#8217;d rarely use it.</p>

<p>We set up our group of coolers on the patio for six days of 90-plus-degree weather. Each cooler was loaded with a pack of hot dogs, a pair of yogurt cups, and a water bottle. All items were refrigerated to about 40° F before we loaded up the coolers, but the coolers themselves had been sitting in 80° outdoor temperatures.</p>
<p>The coolers were running off of household electrical power for this test, which required the use of adapters not included with most coolers.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re storing or transporting perishable food for more than a few hours, 40 degrees is the hottest temperature that will still stop bacteria from multiplying and keep your food safe.</p>
<p>We checked temperatures with an instant-read probe thermometer in the morning and afternoon, but we also tracked changes over the week with two SensorPush wIreless data-logging thermometers.</p>
<p>For a control, we loaded the top-ranked model from our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-coolers/">review of the best coolers</a>, the ORCA &#8211; 40 Quart Classic, with 20 pounds of ice and checked its temperature at the same time.</p>
<div id="visualizer-24388-1615359270" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-24388"></div>
<p>The first day of the test was overcast, with temperatures starting at 80 degrees and dropping to the mid 70s. This is close to the conditions inside the back of a car or truck, and the coolers did not perform as well as we&#8217;d hoped. After two hours, temperatures in most of the coolers stabilized at a mere fifteen degrees colder than outside air. The high starting temperature of the coolers just couldn&#8217;t be overcome by the thermoelectric systems.</p>
<p>As expected, the temperatures in the evening were much better, finally dropping down below 40 and even freezing in one unit when outside temperatures were in the 60s overnight. But that&#8217;s still not the performance necessary to keep perishable items like potato salad safe if you have to unplug when you&#8217;re stopped.</p>
<div id="visualizer-24394-2135545697" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-24394"></div>
<p>When we looked at the temperatures from the two data-log thermometers, it was clear that the insulation and cooling power of these coolers is insufficient for use outside on a hot day. As soon as the sun hit the spot they were sitting at around 10 a.m., the temperature would climb above 50 in a better cooler or all the way up to 70 in a cheaper cooler. Things only dropped again when outside temperatures fell below 70 overnight.</p>
<p>We weren&#8217;t expecting these coolers to perform well in the hot sun, but look at these results and think about what conditions you&#8217;ll actually be using your cooler in.</p>
<p>Ice and bear-proof insulation like you&#8217;ll find on <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-coolers/">the best coolers we&#8217;ve reviewed</a> are still far superior to a small thermoelectric device when it comes to keeping the heat out of your food.</p>
<p>That goes double when you consider that ice doesn&#8217;t need electricity to do its job. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009PUQ3C/?tag=ybdecool-20">A 120-volt adapter</a> will help if you&#8217;ve got power hookups or a hotel room overnight, but that&#8217;s not usually an option if you&#8217;re camping.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001MQ7DQ/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koolatron &#8211; P27</a> has the best combination of size and performance. With the best cooling performance on a 90-degree day, this 29-quart cooler will help keep your food and drinks cool.</p>
<p>Koolatron makes a wide range of electric cooler sizes, from a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JLNBW4/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">tiny six-pack chiller</a> to a full <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000Q754E4/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">45-quart party cooler</a>. We picked the P27 based on reputation among reviewers, and it didn&#8217;t disappoint. This cooler is an ideal size for family road trips, holding a two-liter bottle along with a few days&#8217; worth of snacks.</p>
<p>This cooler kept coldest on hot days during our test, but it&#8217;ll still allow the contents to get up around 50 degrees sitting outside on a 100-degree day. That&#8217;s fine for chilling drinks and a packed lunch you&#8217;re going to eat the same day, but if you&#8217;ve got your vehicle parked in the sun for any amount of time it won&#8217;t keep dairy products safe.</p>

<p>If you do want to keep food below 40 degrees in this cooler, there are a few essential tricks you&#8217;ll need to use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t leave the empty cooler in the car when it&#8217;s parked in the sun; take it with you so it starts out at room temperature rather than baking-hot.</li>
<li>Use frozen water bottles and gel packs whenever you can to help absorb heat on a hot day. Yes, that makes this a barely-upgraded ice chest, rather than a truly iceless cooler, but it will help keep your food safe. Don&#8217;t dump ice inside or get this cooler wet, though.</li>
<li>Make sure there&#8217;s some room for air to move inside the cooler and chill everything evenly. If you want to sort the items from most temperature sensitive to least sensitive, that will help too, but watch out for items sitting beside the chiller fan getting frozen.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&#8217;re just carrying lunch and a drink every day, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00009PGNS/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">18-quart Koolatron P-20</a> is a better buy, since it&#8217;s slim enough to fit between the front seats of a van or truck with bucket seats. But if you&#8217;ve got room for this bigger cube-shaped cooler, it&#8217;s more versatile.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking at buying anything bigger than the P27, you&#8217;ve got to seriously ask yourself if mediocre cooling performance will be worthwhile. Thermoelectric coolers are an excellent choice for drinks, but milk and other quick-spoiling food will need extra ice packs or some different kind of cooling solution.</p>
<p>One final note about quality: While we don&#8217;t have any complaints about the electronics or operation of this cooler, the Koolatron label was not applied carefully at the factory. Also, the plastic slide-lock is pretty stiff and flimsy. There was also tape residue on the side of the cooler we bought. This is a good cooler, but it&#8217;s not a shining example of quality control.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The size and performance of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001MQ7DQ/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koolatron &#8211; P27</a> is better than the other models we tested.</li>
<li>While the Koolatron is better at cooling than the others we tested, it&#8217;s still no match for a 100-degree heat wave even when plugged in.</li>
<li>This cube-shaped cooler can sit so the door opens to the side or from the top.</li>
<li>For taking drinks and food on a small picnic, this is excellent.</li>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a cooler that has a bit more room, the 45-quart  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072PRFQL3/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wagan &#8211; EL6244</a> has the right features and design to make the most of thermoelectric technology.</p>
<p>Compared to the size of the Koolatron &#8211; P27, the Wagan is just less than double the length. The lid opens in two sections, and you also get a set of wheels and an expanding handle to help cart all your drinks around.</p>
<p>With enough carrying capacity for two full 24-pack flats of beverage cans, this is a great cooler for tailgating. Note, however, that if you fill this cooler completely with warm beer or soda, it will probably never be able to cool them as well as it all off the way a refrigerator wcould. Always chill your food or drinks at home before you pack an electric cooler.</p>

With wheels, divider shelves, and a drain, this is one of the better-designed coolers we tested. Cooling performance was third-rate, though.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072PRFQL3/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Like every other model we tested, the temperature spikes we measured inside this cooler during the hottest parts of the day were extreme. On a 100-degree day, the thermoelectric components can only keep the contents of this cooler at 54 degrees.</p>
<p>If you just want to keep your beverages at a more refreshing temperature without dealing with ice, it&#8217;ll do just fine. If you want to pack this with food and take it to a party, make sure you carefully pack the most perishable items next to a frozen water bottle or ice pack.</p>

<p>Other extra features that make this cooler stand out are removable dividers and a drain plug. The drain probably hurts insulation a bit, but it&#8217;s very nice for easy clean-out after a longer trip. The dividers make all the difference when you&#8217;re trying to keep your perishable items close to the chiller unit and want to fill up empty space with heat-absorbing frozen water bottles.</p>
<p>Another perk is built-in storage for the power cord: Tthe standard arrangement on most models is a little pig-tail electrical cord sticking out the side or a flush-mount socket, but Wagan tucks all the connections inside a pop-open door on the lid. The lid itself might crack if you let this cooler roll around in the back of a truck, but it keeps electrical connections safe from damage and keeps your cord from getting lost.</p>
<p>Despite the bigger size and extra features, the Wagan usually sells for about $15 less than the half-size Koolatron. It&#8217;s tricky to suggest that this is going to be a better pick for most people, though, since it did get 6 degrees warmer on a hot day.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072PRFQL3/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wagan &#8211; EL6244</a> is a bigger, better-equipped 45- quart cooler.</li>
<li>The lower price of the Wagan reflects performance, cooling is in the middle of the pack.</li>
<li>Wheels will help you move food and drinks around when you reach your perfect picnic spot.</li>
<li>Internal dividers are great at keeping your food and drinks separate.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077HXJS6H/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dometic &#8211; TC35-DC-A</a> is a cooler with extra features that might justify its cost among a select group of buyers, but in terms of pure functionality it’s not doing much extra. The main feature to note is a thermostat, which will allow you to fine-tune the internal temperature and save power.</p>
<p>Dometic is well-known for their RV and trailer accessories: Ffrom fridges to air conditioners, Dometic products are all designed to make life on the road a little bit more luxurious. Compared to the full-power portable freezers Dometic sells, the TC35 is just not all that compelling despite the lower price.</p>
<p>The Dometic kept our lunches cooler than the Wagan, but not as cold as the Koolatron.</p>

<p>The one extra feature that separates it from the rest of this lineup is a digital thermostat: you can set a range of temperature controls to fine-tune the cold (or heat) from the thermoelectric plate.</p>
<p>With a seven-step range between freezing and 60 degrees Ffahrenheit when in cooling mode, this is the kind of control that might make the Dometic really useful when transporting something temperature-sensitive that can&#8217;t freeze and can&#8217;t get too hot.</p>
<p>That kind of control sounds great, but like a speedometer on your minivan that goes up to 300 miles per hour, it&#8217;s misleading. The ability of this cooler to hit anything below 50 degrees is dependent more on the outside temperature than on the controls.</p>

It was pretty good at keeping things cold, but not good enough to justify the price.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077HXJS6H/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The lid on the Dometic seals securely, which is great for insulation performance, but the spring latch is pretty stiff, and our tester accidentally left the lid cracked open during one afternoon of testing because he didn&#8217;t push down hard enough.</p>
<p>Dometic was the only manufacturer to include an AC 120-volt power adapter with their cooler. Cheap 5-amp adapters are easy to source, but it was a nice touch.</p>
<p>Dometic&#8217;s build quality is actually right in line with the higher price you&#8217;re paying, which is nice to see. Everything about this cooler is a little bit more rigid and carefully finished. Where other coolers feel like boxes of plastic with cooling modules glued to the side, this feels like a product someone set out to design.</p>
<p>That said, a nice-looking cooler that doesn&#8217;t keep your egg salad sandwich from spoiling on a hot day isn&#8217;t where we&#8217;d recommend spending extra money. The Wagan is just as nice to use, if you don&#8217;t need a thermostat to keep your cooler from freezing.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000Q754E4/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koolatron &#8211; P95</a> is a larger 45-quart version of our 29-quart top pick, and it has one nice feature that sets it apart: aA two-position shelf that keeps food and drinks organized in layers or sections for easier access. That&#8217;s especially handy if you&#8217;re using this cooler so the door opens sideways, like a fridge.</p>
<p>Unlike the P27, though, the P95 had terrible cooling performance. Given that it&#8217;s probably the same components in a larger box that shouldn&#8217;t be too surprising, but the other large coolers performed better.</p>

<p>With the smallest internal capacity and the lowest price, the Igloo &#8211; Iceless 28 Quart cooler was also able to get our test lunch to the lowest temperature on an overcast summer day. The Igloo was truly freezing cold at 25.9 degrees on a 65-degree afternoon.</p>
<p>That performance was followed up with a flop, though, as the Igloo failed to get below 64 degrees on the following 97-degree day.</p>
<p>The cooling element had built up some frost during the extra-cold day that we assumed might account for some of the poor performance. Even after the frost was thoroughly melted the next day it was clear that the Igloo just didn&#8217;t have the insulation to keep its cool.</p>
<p>If your requirements are flexible and you just want a cheap cooler, the Igloo is not a bad design overall, with a useful carry handle and a good-looking exterior. Don&#8217;t set anything heavy on the lid, though, or the head-dissipating fan inside will start to rub on the plastic shroud.</p>
<p>The Igloo is the only cooler that we tested which fits comfortably between the front seats of our tester&#8217;s minivan, but that&#8217;s not enough to make it a good buy. After thorough testing, we&#8217;d check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U6YTMRM/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">small coolers from Wagan</a> before we&#8217;d settle on the Igloo for this role.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After thoroughly testing these electric coolers side-by-side with our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-coolers/">best-in-class ice-filled cooler</a>, we&#8217;re fairly disappointed in all of them.</p>
<p>Despite claims that an electric cooler can get 40 degrees below ambient temperatures, we mostly saw temperatures that would quickly lead to spoiled food over the course of a long trip. You also need to supply 12-volt power constantly to keep things cold, or treat the electric cooler like a regular cooler and pack it with frozen items anyhow.</p>
<p>If you only need to keep pre-chilled food and drinks cold while you&#8217;re driving on long trips, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001MQ7DQ/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koolatron &#8211; P27 Voyager</a> is the top performer. This 29-quart model stayed coldest throughout our testing, and it&#8217;s a useful size for carrying picnic-sized meals.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for something a little bit bigger, the 46-quart <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072PRFQL3/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wagan &#8211; EL6244</a> has wheels, dividers and a drain feature that makes clean-up easier. It sacrifices cooling performance, but the price is also slightly lower.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent an entire summer prepping picnic lunches and transporting nine coolers to parks, pools, beaches and other destinations to find that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EY7HQ06/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Orca &#8211; 40 Quart Classic</a> is our top pick among the best coolers, including both rigid and soft style. The Orca kept ice the longest, has a lock-down lid and a simple design that allows for easy transportation and cleaning. For 10 quarts more capacity and a slightly higher price, the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G7KG5PA/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Pelican &#8211; Elite</a> is the largest we tested and comes with lockable lid and a beefy ruler on the lid for measuring that fresh catch.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>There are a ton of reviews on coolers, but we noticed a lack of focus on testing with practical foods so we made sure to give that a go. We read through some reputable reviews like Outdoor Gear Lab’s, as well as some from Outside Online and Wirecutter. We read about the basics of cooling and ice chests and then consulted a professional.</p>
<p>We spoke with Ray from REI, who, having worked there three years and camped and hiked for eight years,  knows his way around a cooler. When we asked Ray about the most important features, he said the most important thing for him is always insulation. Makes sense.</p>
<p>YETI has been making their roto-molded cooler since 2005, and when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPXhi7psQUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTubers start cutting these expensive products in half</a> you know it might be a big deal. Orca&#8217;s a newcomer that clearly aims to compete on this turf, and their insulation is thicker and their warranty is better than YETI&#8217;s. We&#8217;re not saying YETI coolers are bad, but between Orca and Pelican we&#8217;re confident that our bases are covered.</p>
<p>Our expert Ray personally uses the YETI but says that his friends own Orca and Pelican coolers and have had similar rave reviews. We asked Ray what really made a cooler stand out. “Function is what matters,&#8221; he told us. &#8220;Gear-nerds want everything like attachments and bottle openers, but all you need is a cooler that keeps the ice and can hold up outdoors.”</p>
<p>The durability and warranties alone tell you a story of quality, and that&#8217;s where we saw the biggest difference in the products we researched. The return procedure at a retailer like Amazon or REI is pretty generous if you find a flaw in a product right away, but that doesn&#8217;t help much if a hinge fails after a summer of light use.</p>
<p>We then scoured Amazon for customer reviews to further narrow our selection. We finalized our selection to five hard coolers and four soft coolers to give you the best nine coolers on the market.</p>

<h2 id="cooler-types">Types of coolers</h2>
<p>There are really only two types of coolers: hard and soft.</p>
<p>The hard cooler is the classic, usually made of plastic or steel, used for parties, boats and camping. They either have wheels or side handles. A hard cooler is the more durable, of course, if you&#8217;re throwing it in the back of a truck or the bottom of a boat.</p>
<p>Soft coolers are a good compromise for on-the-go activities like kayaking at the beach, or anytime that portability is more important than maintaining the ice-chest shape of a hard cooler. A shoulder strap makes a soft cooler easy for one person to carry, and you can collapse it after you&#8217;re done chilling down your food and ice.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Insulation: </b>The main function of a cooler is to keep drinks cold and food edible. For the best cold-retention, you’ll want to get a cooler with thick insulating walls and a tight seal. This means that for better performance you need to be prepared to store and transport a bigger cooler: Even though two coolers may both have an inside volume of 40 quarts, the one with thicker insulation will take up a lot more space in your car.</p>
<p>We checked inside volume against the outside measurements of all the coolers, and the best-performing models are nearly 70 percent devoted to insulation space, while the least-insulating cooler was only 36 percent. You can check out this chart below in the <a href="#how-we-tested">how we tested section</a>.</p>
<p><b>Carrying capacity:</b> What purpose do you want this cooler to serve? Is it a picnic-day cooler, a beach-day cooler, a multi-day camping cooler or another type of adventure cooler?</p>
<p>Generally speaking, you can fit about one-and-a-half 12-ounce cans and a good amount of ice in a quart of space. So, a giant 50-quart cooler like the Igloo &#8211; MaxCold will hold 72 drink cans for your next backyard gathering (where you can relax in comfort in a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-zero-gravity-chair/">zero gravity chair</a>). On the smaller side, then, the Arctic Zone &#8211; Titan&#8217;s 32-quart size should do the trick for 48 cans worth of a bonfire or half as much drink and a few days of perishable lunch ingredients.</p>
<p><b>Portability:</b> Here’s where the soft coolers take the cake (though the cake may get soggy in there). You only need one person to move a soft cooler because they are lightweight and come with shoulder straps. Unfortunately, the trend of coolers has been to lose the wheels, especially with the more high-end coolers (brands like Orca and Pelican). However, you can still buy Orca wheel add-ons and a Pelican cooler with wheels.</p>
<p>For handles, they can be swinging or stationary. For example, the Orca uses thick fabric, the Coleman &#8211; Steel-Belted Cooler uses metal swivels, and the Pelican uses plastic handles molded into the side. During our portability test, we found it is usually easier to carry coolers with swinging handles because it gives you some leeway when walking with another person.</p>
<p><b>Overall size:</b> If you can’t fit it in your car, what’s the point? There&#8217;s a trade-off between carrying capacity, insulation and how much space a cooler takes up.</p>
<p><b>Durability:</b> Hard coolers tend to be more durable than soft coolers, but the really cheap plastic can crack with rough use or storage in the sun.</p>
<p>The soft coolers we tested all used hardy materials like nylon and vinyl (though our consultant told us nylon is more durable). The AO Coolers &#8211; Vinyl Fishing Cooler claimed to be tear-resistant up to 375 pounds; we could only get 160 pounds into the cooler, but we were very satisfied it would take anything you can throw at it.</p>
<p>The top two coolers we tested, the Orca and the Pelican, both have holes for multiple padlocks so that bears can’t break in. Don’t believe us? Both are certified by conservationists!</p>
<p><b>Drainage:</b> All of the hard-side coolers we tested feature a drain except the Arctic Zone. It’s very handy to have a drainage system when going on longer trips so that you can replace ice as it melts.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13374" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/drain-spout.jpg" alt="spout of a cooler draining water" width="1904" height="1269" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/drain-spout.jpg 1904w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/drain-spout-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/drain-spout-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/drain-spout-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/drain-spout-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/drain-spout-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/drain-spout-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/drain-spout-1000x666.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/drain-spout-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/drain-spout-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/drain-spout-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/drain-spout-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>If you’re using the cooler for longer than a day and you can’t replace the ice that melts with your <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-portable-ice-maker/">portable ice maker</a>, the cold water can still keep your perishable food out of the danger zone. Until the water itself gets warmer than 40 °F, it&#8217;s still helping keep bacteria at bay by absorbing heat when you open the lid.</p>
<p><b>Dry storage</b>: If you’re transporting any food, there are only a couple options: Either get waterproof storage containers for the food or a dry storage container for the cooler.</p>
<p>The dry storage bin acts as a shelf to keep the top of the cooler dry. Note: You’ll have to keep the cooler level for this to be effective, so don’t expect dry food after you go 4-wheel-driving.</p>
<p>A couple little fun extras you can find in coolers are things like the big angler&#8217;s ruler on the surface of the Pelican. Having a bottle opener attached to the cooler proves to be very useful, since it&#8217;s not going to get lost in the dark. Cup holders are another classic feature that comes in handy on a boat.  Add-on wheels are another consideration</p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Before we got into the more scientific approach of testing insulation, we took each cooler to multiple locations including parks, beaches and barbeques. We used them with our families and friends to get a user’s more general opinion in addition to our own, plus the information from the expert on what to look for.</p>
<p>We carried them over rocky terrains, flat ground and sand and got input from those who helped us. These real-life evaluations made certain aspects of the coolers easy to spot. For instance, the narrow opening on the YETI &#8211; Hopper not only makes it really hard to pack but also difficult to reach in and quickly grab an item (though it will keep things colder).</p>
<p>We considered which coolers needed flat ground, those that could be put on uneven surfaces when you’re camping and those that could be used as a seat. We looked at how easily all of the coolers could be loaded up, carried and cleaned (nobody wants a smelly cooler). All of the everyday use and trip uses were looked at from many different people’s perspectives.</p>
<h3>Insulation tests</h3>
<p>As to the science, we conducted two different “ice tests” that measured the insulation abilities of each cooler in controlled but realistic scenarios.</p>
<p>In the first test, we loaded up each cooler with seven pounds of ice from our army of <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-portable-ice-maker/">ice makers</a> and a Bluetooth thermometer. Nothing else was put in, minimizing variables that might skew the test.</p>
<p>This was just to get a baseline for an idea of how the coolers compared to one another. It is just about as simple of a test as you can run; just ice and temperature. We found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EY7HQ06/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Orca &#8211; 40 Quart Classic</a> holds ice the best in this test, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010CRX6QK/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Igloo &#8211; MaxCold</a> did incredibly well when we look at performance-to-price ratio.</p>
<div id="visualizer-13084-1965325459" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-13084"></div>
<p>The next test we conducted was an attempt to see what would happen to real food in real-world conditions. We simulated a typical picnic and added some raw chicken to see how long that would keep fresh on a camping trip before it needed to be cooked.</p>
<p>Each cooler was filled with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>20 pounds of ice</li>
<li>Two 16.9 fluid ounce water bottles</li>
<li>Half a pound of cooked penne pasta and raw cherry tomatoes</li>
<li>Two grilled chicken breasts</li>
<li>One raw chicken breast</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the items’ temperatures were measured every few hours with an infrared surface thermometer until the ice was gone. We also had Bluetooth thermometers to measure the overall temperature inside the cooler to see how that compared to the temperature of the food and drink. (You can see the results in the graph below.)</p>
<div id="visualizer-13426-928629345" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-13426"></div>
<p>Note that the <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/ad74bb8d-1dab-49c1-b05e-390a74ba7471/Chicken_from_Farm_to_Table.pdf?MOD=AJPERES" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service</a> (USDA FSIS) mandates 40 °F as the maximum safe temperature for storage of perishable raw food like chicken and dairy. If your ice melts the cold water will still capture some heat for a while, but once you cross the 40 °F threshold you should cook the food within hours.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that the USDA FSIS safe food-handling guideline suggests keeping raw chicken in the refrigerator for only one to two days and cooked chicken for three to four days. Due to limited space in some of the coolers, the chicken was not always in the coldest spot, so it’s essential that you factor in a margin of safety for your camping trip cooking plans.</p>

Though we picked coolers with similar internal capacities, most between 40 and 50 quarts, the outer dimensions of the coolers varied quite a bit. For example, the Pelican was the biggest overall at over 9,500 cubic inches whereas the Igloo, rated for the same 50 quarts of carrying capacity, only takes up 6,700 cubic inches in your boat or trunk.</p>
<p>Note that the percentage of a cooler&#8217;s volume that&#8217;s devoted to insulation tracks very closely to insulation performance. There&#8217;s definitely more to insulation than just the thickness of a cooler&#8217;s walls, but fancy materials clearly don&#8217;t help the AcrticZone &#8211; Titan as much as the YETI &#8211; Hopper.</p>

<p>We measured both the interior and exterior dimensions with a standard measuring tape. And, just to make sure, we measured the volume in quarts by pouring water into each cooler until each was full. As you can see, the sizes and shapes vary quite a bit.</p>
<h3 id="portability-test">Portability</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13435" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cooler_charts_01-02_3.png" alt="Portability Comparison Chart" width="2000" height="1896" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cooler_charts_01-02_3.png 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cooler_charts_01-02_3-610x578.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cooler_charts_01-02_3-768x728.png 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cooler_charts_01-02_3-885x839.png 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cooler_charts_01-02_3-1500x1422.png 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cooler_charts_01-02_3-295x280.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cooler_charts_01-02_3-1000x948.png 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cooler_charts_01-02_3-360x341.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cooler_charts_01-02_3-375x356.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cooler_charts_01-02_3-414x392.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cooler_charts_01-02_3-320x303.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cooler_charts_01-02_3-885x839@2x.png 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
For portability tests, we loaded each cooler with 40 pounds to make it a realistic full weight. We then marked out a 500-foot test walk and (with a little help from our friends) we carried or wheeled each cooler to the point and back, which took about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>We did this with two people, both in-shape males in their mid 20s, as well as with just one person. After each carry, we rated how ergonomic the handles were. We could definitely feel the burn with the larger coolers (the Orca and Pelican) because they weigh about 25 and 30 pounds without any added weight.</p>
<p>The weight definitely plays a role in how portable a cooler is, but if you&#8217;re using a heavier cooler over a long weekend, hopefully you won&#8217;t have to move it once you make camp.</p>
<p>The only wheeled cooler we tested (the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00363RV32/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coleman &#8211; Performance Wheeled Cooler</a>) was incredibly easy to move on paved ground, so it is perfect for pool days and local events. But when we took it to the beach, the wheels did us no good, and the molded handles are just adequate.</p>
<h3>Cleanability</h3>

<p>We made sure to dirty up the coolers when taking them with us to our various locations. But the worst thing we did, at least in terms of smell, was leave all the food in the coolers for an extra week to make sure that they smelled terrible. What can you expect with gross raw chicken? We then threw away all the food and hosed them down, scrubbed them with dishwashing soap and used our nostrils to determine when they were finally clean (hesitantly). Other than the ribbed interior of the Pelican, we found the smooth surfaces of the hard coolers very easy to clean.</p>
<p>Some of the soft coolers had harder-to-reach spots on the interior, but the material from which they’re constructed made them a breeze to clean. All of the hard coolers were cleaned with a little scrubbing with a rough-sided sponge, soap and hose. They were all as easy to clean as you’d hope, and the smell was nowhere to be found!</p>
<p>One of the more time-consuming parts to clean was the cup holders, just because you can’t clean it in big swiping motions like you can the coolers without cup holders. Also, the Arctic Zone cooler took a bit longer to dry because it has the most fabric, which absorbs water; but we found that if you just leave it in the sun it’s fine. All of the coolers are waterproof, so that makes for great clean up.</p>
<h3>Packing and unpacking</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, the soft coolers are much harder to pack and unpack, especially the YETI as it has only one zipper down the middle, which only creates a small opening (about a fourth the size of the Orca).</p>
<p>The packability of most coolers was great. On the whole, the hard coolers scored beautifully, though the lid on the Coleman Wheeled had trouble staying open due to the plastic hinge. As far as soft coolers go, the AO and Polar Bear have large openings when they are not buckled down. The only real letdown here is the YETI; the zipper leaves little room to pack and unpack. If you’re just using it for drinks, then it’s a nonissue.</p>
<h2 id="top-pick">Top pick: Orca &#8211; 40 Quart Classic</h2>

<p>In days of yore, before glamping was even a thing, it used to be hard to find a cooler that could keep ice for five days in 90+ degree weather. Now we have amazing coolers like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EY7HQ06/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Orca &#8211; 40 Quart Classic</a>. This smooth, white 40-quart cooler has a prideful simplicity, and if your camping buddies razz you about not buying the more popular YETI, you can brag about the lifetime warranty and thicker insulation.</p>
<p>This cooler is chockfull of thoughtful features, like a very handy Velcro pouch in the back for dry storage (even the well-equipped Pelican lacked this feature).</p>
<p>Though there are plenty of add-ons you can buy, as you’ll see, the Orca concentrated their efforts on what really matters: keeping things cold. We expected the Orca and the Pelican to be very close in performance (especially given the price), but the Orca outperformed its rival in nearly every category, especially when it comes to portability.</p>

Twenty pounds of ice lasted five days in blistering heat upwards of 90 °F. On top of that, the drainage system gets rid of nearly every ounce of water to keep your food dry. Plus it's easy to clean and makes for a great bench.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EY7HQ06/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Orca also cleans incredibly well, with smooth surfaces all over. We didn’t have to use any special brush to reach the nooks and crannies as we did with the Pelican. At the end of the day, the less scrubbing we need to do, the happier we are.</p>
<p>The 24-pound Orca uses one-inch thick rubber swing-handles that hang eight inches on each side. We all know that coordinating with another person — even on something as simple as carrying a cooler — can be difficult at times (though we got the hang of it after the first few portability tests). We found that extra room between your hands and the side of the cooler to be very useful when going up stairs or across uneven terrain. Coordination is still required, but it’s much easier with good handles.</p>
<p>At about an inch in diameter, the handles have an ergonomic curvature to fit your hand when carrying. This thickness works well, because you can use different parts of your forearm muscle when holding it. In other words, it’s small enough to only use your fingertips, but large enough to allow for a full squeezing grip.</p>
<p>Note: If you really want, you can loop your arm through so the handle rests in between your forearm and bicep, using your other arm to hold your hand for double the strength.</p>
<p>So you’ve easily transported the Orca to your campsite, had a blast over the weekend, and it’s time to go, but there’s water in the cooler. Not to worry, the drainage system in the Orca requires no tilt, and empties pretty much every drop due to its miniature sump area at the bottom. Just unscrew the plug and voila, dry cooler for the car ride home.</p>
<p>As our REI expert shared with us, one of the points of durability to look for is the latch. At first glance, the rubber whale straps seem dinky, but after feeling them for ourselves and watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmjIti_Kblc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this video</a> of a bear going at it, our minds quickly changed. If they do break, however, Orca is the only company in this class that covers rubber parts under their warranty.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EY7HQ06/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Orca &#8211; 40 Quart Classic</a> holds ice longest in blistering heat: about four hours longer than the runner-up and 20 hours longer than our budget pick.</li>
<li>Orca provides you with sturdy-yet-flexible handles that make carrying a heavy load easier.</li>
<li>The tough roto-molded plastic has a clean design and is easy to maintain with a quick rinse and wipe-down.</li>
<li>The drainage system is also flawless. No tilt required, and the plug can also come all the way off for cleaning. Very simple.</li>

<p>Pelican is a well-known name for hard-sided storage cases: For everything from cameras to rifles, Pelican is the brand to beat. After using the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G7KG5PA/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican &#8211; Elite</a> for a few months, we love their coolers, too.</p>
<p>This 50-quart cooler is the biggest we tested and kept 20 pounds of ice for just five hours less than the 40-quart Orca&#8217;s 115-hour win. The Pelican is 10 quarts larger than the Orca, seven pounds heavier and $25 more expensive on average. Pelican also falls a bit short on warranty, specifically excluding rubber feet and drain components in their guarantee of excellence.</p>
<p>Pelican&#8217;s lid is sturdy enough to sit on, and it has four cup holders. There&#8217;s even an angler&#8217;s ruler and cutting board to measure that freshly caught salmon and clean it.</p>
<p>Pelican has you covered for campground security concerns: They’ve equipped it with not one, not two, but three holes for padlocks and lock-down cables. Bear-safe, guaranteed.</p>

Its huge carrying capacity, built-in ruler and full-width handles are evidence that this is the kind of cooler you take on all of your extreme outdoor endeavors.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G7KG5PA/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Okay, you’ve caught your fish, and now it’s time to head home, but you&#8217;ve still got the worst part of unpacking: cleaning the cooler. The Pelican cleans quite easily, but there are so many non-smooth surfaces that it takes more time to wash and dry every nook and cranny than the smooth finish on other coolers. We found using a brush with about two-inch bristles worked best — firm but flexible enough to get in the harder-to-reach spots.</p>
<p>Something that we noticed when performing one of our cleaning tests is that the Pelican is a bit top heavy when it’s empty. For example, if you shoot the hose at the open lid, the cooler will topple over. So we just put some soap and water in the bottom first. The drainage system is second only to the Orca, with just a few ounces of water sitting in the bottom after draining.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget that this is a heavy duty cooler: It weighs 35 pounds when empty. There are wide, firm handles to compensate for this, so more than two people can grab hold if need be. The handle is a two-inch thick, nine-inch-wide hunk of plastic; plenty of space for two hands on each side, but they don&#8217;t swing out like the Orca&#8217;s strap-handles.</p>
<p>The Pelican isn’t going to be the cooler that you take to a crowded beach or anywhere else that you can’t easily pull a car up to. You can’t buy add-on wheels from Pelican, but they do make a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XRSWXPS/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">wheeled version of the Elite</a> that gives up some space for that convenience. Definitely consider whether the wheels are a requirement before purchasing.</p>
<p>After all of our tests, we prefer the Orca for carrying long distances. We know that if you’re looking to buy this cooler you probably won’t be moving around a lot (more so in a truck or boat), but it’s just something to keep in mind.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G7KG5PA/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican &#8211; Elite</a> kept 20 pounds of ice cold for about 108 hours in 90+ degree weather.</li>
<li>This is the mountain cooler, the fishing cooler. Pretty much anytime you think you&#8217;ll test the durability of your cooler, Pelican should be at the top of your list.</li>
<li>Pelican has built in three padlock holes, an angler&#8217;s ruler and a bottle opener.</li>
<li>It’s a bit harder to clean when compared to the Orca, but it&#8217;s sturdy and has a lifetime warranty on the plastic body.</li>

<h2 id="soft-cooler-pick">Best soft cooler: Polar Bear &#8211; Solar Bear</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/polar-bear-conversion.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Usually when you think of a “soft” cooler you assume it will rip or tear easily: not the case with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072R14BQS/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Polar Bear &#8211; Solar Bear</a>. The amount of material used to keep this cooler cold and strong is pretty astonishing, and more than half of the total volume is insulation. Its double-coated 850-denier nylon is the same material used in backpacks, motorcycle jackets and boat skins, definitely outdoor-proof.</p>
<p>Thankfully all of the soft coolers we tested held up to their claims of being leak-proof and sweat-proof: Nobody wants to drive home from the mountains or beach with a soggy mess in the car. The Polar Bear gives you a huge opening for access, and then you can choose to buckle it down to squeeze out some air or leave it in a taller pouch shape.</p>

Although it can be buckled down to a box-like shape, we found it’s easiest to pack and unpack when unbuckled due to its huge opening.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072R14BQS/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>At first we kept it buckled, but after a few uses we preferred keeping it unbuckled for easier access to the items inside. The shoulder strap on this bag is nowhere near the quality of the YETI, but for a third of the price, we’re okay with that. It’s still decently comfortable, and we had no problems carrying this bag on short hikes.</p>
<p>Something you’ll definitely want to look at if comparing the Polar Bear to the AO Fishing Cooler is the dry storage. The Polar Bear only has a small pocket, compared to about half a side of the AO.</p>
<p>Another bonus is that Polar Bear lets you order a customized cooler from <a href="http://www.polarbearcoolers.com/custom-cooler-shop.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their custom embroidery shop</a>.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>If you want durability and ice-retention, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072R14BQS/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Polar Bear &#8211; Solar Bear</a> is a great soft cooler for around 100 bucks.</li>
<li>Its 840-denier nylon and YKK buckles and zippers should make this a very tough bag, with tie-downs for rigging to your boat or bike.</li>
<li>Thick insulation holds the cold for over 75 hours, about 10 hours less than the Yeti.</li>
<li>When unbuckled, its huge opening allows generous access, and the Solar Bear can be flattened down for easier packing.</li>
<li>Also, the Polar Bear can be customized with a logo of your business or a family name so you never have to worry about whose cooler is whose.</li>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010CRX6QK/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Igloo &#8211; MaxCold</a> came in third place for insulation performance, with thick walls that kept food cold for about 90 hours with 20 pounds of ice in our test. That&#8217;s not as impressive as our other top picks, but the price is only 20% of those super-coolers.</p>
<p>We bumped it, dropped it, slid it, and haven&#8217;t seen any damage from the wear. The polyethylene Igloo hides scratches well, and in their earlier days Igloo would test ice chest designs by lowering jeeps onto them. Igloo makes a simple cooler for a good price, nice to bring to a beach and easy to carry around.</p>

We treated this cooler with a throw-around mentality, and it took the beating like a champ.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010CRX6QK/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Because the handles swivel about five inches on each side, this gives you about 10 inches of wiggle-room when transporting the cooler. So whether you’re going to the beach for a bonfire or the park for a picnic, this cooler provides great cold for its weight, is very portable and provides a great seat.</p>
<p>There is a strong plastic band that holds the top of the cooler from going back too far, which helps keep the hinges from taking the brunt of the weight. This, of course, is done to ensure a longer life of the hinges.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you must tilt this behemoth to drain it properly, because the plug sticks out about an inch into the cooler, rather than sitting flush with the wall or bottom. That said, it still drains adequately and will do a great job for the price.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>For a classic plastic cooler, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010CRX6QK/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Igloo &#8211; MaxCold</a> is big, durable and allows for easy transportation with its well-designed handles.</li>
<li>This is rugged enough to toss in the truck, and it kept ice for almost four whole days!</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re looking for function over features, and you don’t want to spend hundreds on a cooler, then this is a great pick.</li>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-13380 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/yeti-hopper-cooler.jpg" alt="the Yeti - Hopper cooler" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/yeti-hopper-cooler.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/yeti-hopper-cooler-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/yeti-hopper-cooler-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/yeti-hopper-cooler-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/yeti-hopper-cooler-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/yeti-hopper-cooler-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/yeti-hopper-cooler-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/yeti-hopper-cooler-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/yeti-hopper-cooler-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/yeti-hopper-cooler-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/yeti-hopper-cooler-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/yeti-hopper-cooler-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0175L8DDM/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YETI &#8211; Hopper</a> is a great-looking cooler, with hard-won brand recognition among those ruggedly stylish ‘luxury camping’ people on Instagram who do yoga on top of mountains.</p>
<p>The strap alone feels so good in your hand and over your shoulder that you might not even care how well it keeps your ice. (that may be an exaggeration, but it did hold 20 pounds of ice for four days — about 10 hours longer than other soft coolers we tested.)</p>
<p>The reasons we didn&#8217;t deem the YETI &#8211; Hopper as best soft cooler were the way its zipper runs down the middle and its lack of flexibility at the opening of the cooler, which makes it difficult to pack and unpack. It’s easy enough to grab a drink, but if you’re trying to find an ingredient for your mountaintop raw-cheese avocado toast, bring a flashlight and a wish.</p>
<p>All soft coolers have the same problem when it comes to keeping food: The sides squeeze everything inside, so you need Tupperware to keep your food from getting squashed. If you&#8217;re really good at packing the most delicate food on top, and are extremely careful when you&#8217;re transporting the cooler, you can get by. If you’re not — as we unfortunately found out on our way to a barbecue— the shaking can turn your sandwiches soggy.</p>
<p>If you’re a “gear nerd,” as our consultant from REI so eloquently put it, and are sad that the YETI doesn’t have a bottle opener on the zipper pull like the Polar Bear, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B016CI2B5A/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here’s a YETI bottle opener</a> that attaches to the YETI’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOLLE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MOLLE</a>-compatible &#8220;hitchpoint grid.&#8221; The grid is actually incredibly useful as it allows you to attach carabiners, ropes and a ton of other compatible gear directly to your cooler.</p>
<p>On top of that there are multiple ways to strap this bad boy down with six D-ring tie-down points. And you can always loop through the handles, from which there are four to choose as well as a shoulder strap.</p>
<p>The Hopper is a cool bag, but it&#8217;s the most expensive cooler we tested. The insulation performance is impressive given the size of the bag, but if it&#8217;s mostly going to be a lunch bag (and not especially convenient to use), then we really don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth the price.</p>
<h3>Coleman &#8211; Steel-Belted Cooler</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-13381 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-steel-belted-cooler.jpg" alt="a red Coleman - Steel-belted cooler" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-steel-belted-cooler.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-steel-belted-cooler-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-steel-belted-cooler-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-steel-belted-cooler-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-steel-belted-cooler-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-steel-belted-cooler-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-steel-belted-cooler-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-steel-belted-cooler-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-steel-belted-cooler-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-steel-belted-cooler-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-steel-belted-cooler-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-steel-belted-cooler-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Warning: If you were alive in the 70s the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009PURKE/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coleman &#8211; Steel-Belted Cooler</a> may elicit nostalgia. This throwback not only brings back that classic look, it can hold the cold! For four days it held the ice intact in some pretty blistering sun (hovering around 90 °F). Total time at below 40 °F is just shy of the Igloo at 80 hours. Not too shabby, Coleman.</p>
<p>So, it looks good, it holds the ice well &#8230; What’s the catch? Well, there’s no real catch per se, but the paint coating on the surface is pretty easily scratched. It&#8217;s also eight pounds heavier than the Igloo, so you&#8217;ll have to really love the retro style to make this worth your while.</p>
<p>This Coleman has a nice drain channel so that you don’t have to tilt it to empty the water. The channel is only about a quarter-inch deep though, as compared to the Orca and Pelican where drain channels are a few times as deep. But, like the Orca, the Coleman is smooth all over so all it took to clean was a spray-down and a little scrubbing. Let it air dry or wipe its surfaces with a towel, and you&#8217;re good until next year.</p>
<p>The metal swivel handles are a good try, giving you an extra two inches on each side to work with. However, the handles are only about three-quarters of an inch thick, which is a bit too small for a comfortable carry. You basically have to put the cooler in your fingertips and can’t really utilize your handy-dandy opposable thumbs for grip.</p>
<p>Coleman backs up this cooler with a six-year limited warranty, which is pretty good for hard coolers in this price range. That said, if you leave a steel cooler rusting in a boat for six years, you&#8217;re not really covered under the &#8220;defects in materials or workmanship&#8221; terms of the warranty.</p>
<p>Here’s something you may want to take notice of when thinking about its size and how it will fit in your trunk. <b>The dimensions on Amazon are wrong: Instead of 25.1 x 17.5 x 17.2 inches, it&#8217;s actually 22.5 x 14.5 x 16.2 inches. </b>So, it’s smaller in every conceivable way, which makes it easier to pack.</p>
<h3>AO Coolers &#8211; Vinyl Fishing Cooler</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-13382 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AO-coolers-soft.jpg" alt="gray AO Coolers - soft cooler" width="2048" height="1365" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AO-coolers-soft.jpg 2048w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AO-coolers-soft-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AO-coolers-soft-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AO-coolers-soft-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AO-coolers-soft-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AO-coolers-soft-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AO-coolers-soft-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AO-coolers-soft-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AO-coolers-soft-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AO-coolers-soft-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AO-coolers-soft-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AO-coolers-soft-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00329NRH4/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AO Coolers &#8211; Vinyl Fishing Cooler</a> is like a vinyl half-brother to the nylon Polar Bear. The vinyl is not quite as tough as the nylon, but it never gave us pause during our testing. And, although it has less insulation that the Polar Bear, it retained the ice for almost three full days, just falling a couple hours shy of the mark at 67 hours.</p>
<p>The Fishing Cooler really bests its counterpart with dry storage: There is a full horizontal zipper that goes halfway up and runs across one whole side of the cooler.</p>
<p>We drove it to the beach for the day and back, and it neither sweated nor leaked, meaning our seats stayed dry. And on top of that, the foods we kept in the pocket stayed entirely dry as well.</p>
<p>There is no little bottle opener on the zipper, but it does open up a bit nicer than the Polar Bear. Another way it beats the Polar bear is that it is able to fold up smaller, about four inches thick. This makes it very easy to tuck away while it’s not in use or after all the food and beverages have been consumed.</p>
<p>All things considered, this is a nice soft cooler that just doesn&#8217;t quite keep up with the Polar Bear for insulation or ruggedness. At nearly the same price, we&#8217;d say the best reason to buy this is if you need it to sit in the bottom of a fishing boat for days. (The nylon used on the outside of the YETI and Polar Bear designs will absorb a little bit of water, even though the coating on the inside of the fabric will keep them from leaking.)</p>
<h3>Coleman &#8211; Performance Wheeled Cooler</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-13383 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-wheeled-cooler.jpg" alt="a red Coleman - wheeled cooler" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-wheeled-cooler.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-wheeled-cooler-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-wheeled-cooler-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-wheeled-cooler-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-wheeled-cooler-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-wheeled-cooler-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-wheeled-cooler-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-wheeled-cooler-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-wheeled-cooler-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-wheeled-cooler-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-wheeled-cooler-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coleman-wheeled-cooler-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00363RV32/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coleman &#8211; Performance Wheeled Cooler</a> is that generic cooler you see everywhere: tell-tale red base, white top, wheels and big handle. It&#8217;s the one everybody seems to bring to pool parties and for good reason: It works well, and it&#8217;s less than 50 bucks. It held ice and food below 40 °F for 85 hours in 90+ °F weather. What more do you want?</p>
<p>Its good performance in ice-retention (fourth place) is due to its thickness (no surprise, fourth-thickest insulation). On top of the quality cold-retention, it has four drink holders molded into the plastic on the top of the lid (just like the Pelican).</p>

It was easily the most portable cooler we tested and is incredibly affordable.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00363RV32/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>This was the only cooler we tested that came with wheels (and our forearms were thankful for a break during our portability test). The wheeled Coleman was by far the easiest to transport for this reason, and you only need one person to move between picnic spots. If you do need to carry it over a rock or ravine, it has handles molded into the plastic on each side.</p>
<p>The handles, though, require a lot of finger strength and don’t allow for a good grip, but they are seldom needed. Even so, the good price does come at a cost: The top doesn’t stay open easily (and you feel like you’re going to break it if you push it back too far). Now, this is good for keeping in the cold (it&#8217;s hard to leave open by accident), but it makes it pretty annoying if you&#8217;re rummaging for ingredients to make a more complex meal.</p>
<p>It has an okay drainage system, but you still need to tip the cooler to get all the water out. Also, Coleman support reps told us on the phone that they don&#8217;t technically have any warranty for this model, though they&#8217;ll often do a &#8220;courtesy replacement&#8221; in the first year of ownership. But hey, it&#8217;s only $35.</p>
<h3>Arctic Zone &#8211; Titan</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-13384 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/arctic-zone-titan.jpg" alt="the white Arctic Zone - Titan cooler" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/arctic-zone-titan.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/arctic-zone-titan-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/arctic-zone-titan-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/arctic-zone-titan-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/arctic-zone-titan-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/arctic-zone-titan-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/arctic-zone-titan-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/arctic-zone-titan-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/arctic-zone-titan-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/arctic-zone-titan-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/arctic-zone-titan-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/arctic-zone-titan-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ALB98IM/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Arctic Zone &#8211; Titan</a> is definitely a picnic-type cooler. It has the most uninsulated dry-storage pockets of any cooler we tested: five pockets if you count the two separate zippers in the front. It comes with a shelf that keeps things out of the ice, too. (Note that this will definitely mean your food heats up more than it would if it were submerged during a days-long trip.)</p>
<p>All of our dry food stayed dry during a day trip to the pool. It was refreshing to have a cooler that came with a dry shelf after our soggy sandwich incident. However, we noticed the dry storage on the outside wasn’t completely waterproof when we brought out the hose for cleaning. So, it’s “waterproof” as long as you don’t absolutely soak it. Thankfully, the shelf insert doesn&#8217;t prevent you from cooling a certain kind of 12-ounce bottle standing upright.</p>
<p>Okay, so great dry storage, but what about the cold-retention? It performed the poorest out of all the coolers we tested, but that’s some stiff competition! It still had ice after 69 hours in some hot, hot sun, which is more than enough cold-retention for a day-cooler. Note, however, that if you keep something like raw chicken on the dry shelf instead of submerged in your ice, it might spend a whole day above the 40-degree safe zone before it finally gets cooled down enough.</p>
<p>The shoulder strap is attached at a nice angle that makes for carrying it a bit easier. But, especially when compared to the strap of the YETI, it is not exactly comfortable with a heavy load. Also, there is no drainage system; you’re going to have to empty it the old-fashioned way.</p>
<p>Also, we noted that during our summer of tests the sun faded the black fabric. So, if you’re someone who doesn’t like the look of wear-and-tear, then we suggest going with a more UV-resistant option, like the Polar Bear.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Whether gearing up for a weekend trip or a casual outing to the park, you want a cooler that can keep the ice cold and that’s easy to transport. We chose the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EY7HQ06/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Orca &#8211; 40 Quart Classic</a> as the top cooler, because it maintained ice for more than 110 hours, was one of the easiest coolers to clean and provided the best handles for carrying.</p>
<p>If you’re heading to bear country or salmon streams, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G7KG5PA/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican &#8211; Elite</a> will satisfy all your outdoor needs with its durable materials, built-in ruler and triple-locking lid. Fifty quarts of capacity also means you could put even more ice in there to get better than our tested 108 hours of raw-chicken-safe cooling.</p>
<p>If you’re going for cost effectiveness, then the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010CRX6QK/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Igloo &#8211; MaxCold</a> can fulfill your quest as it performs nearly as well as the coolers in the couple-hundred-dollar range. Fifty-quart capacity, 90 hours of ice, and it’s only about 60 bucks.</p>
<p>Soft coolers are great for the more adventurous outings, as they can be packed down very compactly once they’ve finished their job. With 48 quarts of capacity and almost 75 hours worth of ice-keeping insulation, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072R14BQS/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Polar Bear &#8211; Solar Bear</a> came out on top in this category, mostly because of better zipper design and a much better price than the big-name competition.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent more than 35 hours researching and testing 14 top-rated products at our local beach to find the best beach umbrella, best beach tent and best beach chair. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002CLQ1Q2/?tag=ybdbch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sport-brella</a> earned the title as best umbrella; its steel ribs and stakes made it feel durable and secure, while its two side vents allowed for great air flow. If you’re looking for a tent instead of an umbrella, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005LGV2PA/?tag=ybdbch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lightspeed Outdoors &#8211; Quick Cabana</a> is our top choice beach tent due to its ease of setup, ventilation and ability to comfortably fit either couples or families (four to five people). For lounging, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000A073BE/?tag=ybdbch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tommy Bahama &#8211; Backpack Cooler Chair&#8217;s</a> adjustability, versatility, comfort and moderate price made it our go-to beach chair.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>As Southern California natives who live blocks from the beach, we know a thing or two about what product features to look for in beach accessories. To confirm the features we deemed important, we scoured Amazon to find beach umbrellas, tents and chairs with an average rating of four or above. Then, we dug into the reviews to see what features people enjoyed or disliked in their beach products.</p>
<p>We also read through articles from sites like <a href="http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/topics/camping-and-hiking/best-beach-canopy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OutdoorGearLab</a> and <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-beach-umbrellas-chairs-and-accessories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wirecutter</a> to help narrow down our list of brands and products to test, and the features they should have. Though OutdoorGearLab was helpful in determining some of the top beach brands, they chose larger beach tents with $100+ price point. We opted to test more moderately priced, lighter beach tents since those are more convenient to the average beach-goer.</p>
<p>We tested some of the same models as The Wirecutter, and came to similar conclusions about the best umbrellas. However, we tested a wider variety of beach tents. Most of the beach tents we tested were on the larger side (typically seven to eight feet wide and just over four feet deep), while still a manageable weight, for those interested in sharing the tent with babies, children or furry friends.</p>
<p>Across the board, it is important to look for ease of transport and setup, weight, size, breathability, and durability in your beach accessories.</p>
<p>In an umbrella, you should also consider stability and size, as well as if it has a built-in sand anchor, telescoping feature, tilt mechanism and UV protection. In a beach tent it’s important to think about if you need an extended floormat. Finally, for a beach chair you should consider the weight capacity and if bonus features, like cupholders and pillows, are important to you.</p>
<p>When vetting beach chairs we also considered alternative seating methods like adjustable beach mats and inflatable lounge chairs, but opted against them as they didn’t provide the same level of support as traditional beach chairs.</p>
<p>After taking all of the above into consideration, here are the umbrellas, tents and chairs that made the cut.</p>

<h3>Beach umbrellas versus beach tents</h3>
<p>Both beach umbrellas and beach tents provide shade, so what’s the difference? Well, beach umbrellas are upright or semi-upright (in the case of the Sport-brella) canopies supported by (most commonly) an aluminum and plexiglass frame.</p>
<p>Beach tents are more enclosed structures with an open front. In beach tents you sit on fabric rather than directly in the sand. They are a bit more sheltered from the elements and, without good ventilation, can get a bit stuffy. However, beach tents are a more stable, easier to put up and lighter than beach umbrellas. Beach umbrellas offer shade, but are less of a shelter than beach tents. One isn’t necessarily better than the other ‒ it’s just a matter of personal preference.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested-umbrellas">How we tested beach umbrellas</h2>
<p><strong>Test 1: Convenience</strong></p>
<p>Stability is one of the most important factors when choosing an umbrella. After all, you don’t want to be that person chasing their umbrella down the beach. We found the Sport-brella to be the most stable as it laid down and was anchored to the ground similar to a beach tent.</p>
<p>In addition to stability, you’ll also want to consider weight. The Tommy Bahama, Coolibar, EasyGo, and Sport-brella weighed 4 pounds, 4.6 pounds, 6.8 pounds and eight pounds respectively. Though the Coolibar was the second lightest, it was the most compact measuring only 47 inches. The next shortest was the Tommy Bahama at 50 inches. The longest was the Sport-brella at 58 inches.</p>
<p>The Tommy Bahama &#8211; Sand Anchor Umbrella has many convenient features, including an 8.5 inch built-in sand anchor. However, like many Amazon reviews noted, it isn’t the best quality. The first umbrella we ordered came with a warped top pole, which was unable to fit into the bottom section. The next umbrella came intact and was easy to install because of the sand anchor, but felt flimsier than other models, which could explain why it was the lightest of the bunch at only 4 pounds.</p>
<p>If you’re going to put a lot of wear and tear on your umbrella, we suggest purchasing a slightly more expensive, but higher quality model.</p>
<p>The EasyGo Umbrella also had a sand anchor, though it was only three inches long, making it harder to insert into the sand than the Tommy Bahama umbrella. However, the umbrella itself was much sturdier.</p>

<p>For umbrellas like the Coolibar Umbrella that don’t come with a sand anchor built-in, you’ll want to buy a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beachr-Beach-Umbrella-Anchor-Strong/dp/B014RQZZC0/ref=sr_1_5?s=lawn-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503981685&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=sand+anchor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">sand anchor</a> separately. It will make the umbrella easiest to install and stay put, but is an added cost.</p>
<p><strong>Test 2: Size</strong></p>
<p>The coverage of your umbrella also matters, especially if you have a large group. The largest umbrella is the EasyGo, topping out at eight feet in diameter. The smallest is the Coolibar measuring six feet in diameter. The other two umbrellas were seven feet. Every umbrella, with the exception of the Sport-brella, stood between seven and seven and a half feet tall.</p>
<p><strong>Test 3: Materials</strong></p>
<p>The majority of umbrellas are made with fiberglass ribs, an aluminum pole, polyester canopy and a handful of plastic pieces. The EasyGo and Tommy Bahama umbrellas are no exception. Though the Tommy Bahama does have the superior built-in sand anchor, the EasyGo felt sturdier overall when testing. The Sport-brella had steel ribs instead of fiberglass ribs, contributing to how sturdy it felt.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0023TQ9JM/?tag=ybdbch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coolibar</a> is unique in that the canopy is made from nylon &#8212; not just any nylon, but silver nylon that reflects the sun on the outside and blue nylon that absorbs remaining rays on the inside. This was effective for keeping the area underneath the umbrella cool and comfortable. The umbrella did smell strongly when it arrived, which we attribute to this material, but the smell will likely wear off over time.</p>
<p>Each of the umbrellas have UPF 50+ protection.</p>

That also means you don't have to dig a deep hole like with other umbrellas. And for extra durability, the Sport-brella features steel ribs rather than flimsy plastic that can degrade over time.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002CLQ1Q2/?tag=ybdbch-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If you don’t mind an untraditional beach umbrella, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002CLQ1Q2/?tag=ybdbch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sport-brella</a> is a great choice! Rather than standing up like a typical umbrella, it sits propped on the sand by two side flaps that descend from the umbrella body. The Sport-brella has two large wind flaps on either side for ventilation and includes stakes and tie-down cords for extra security.</p>
<p>The Sport-brella is easy to put up and is extremely sturdy. It’s also made of quality materials including steel ribs and polyester fabric. The only negative is its weight (eight pounds), but if you’re not planning on lugging it long distances or have a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-folding-wagon/" rel="noopener">folding wagon</a>, that shouldn’t deter you from choosing this umbrella.</p>
<p>If you’re trying to decide between a beach umbrella and a beach tent, this is a good hybrid option that provides a bit more ventilation than the latter.</p>

<p>Though the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0023TQ9JM/?tag=ybdbch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coolibar</a> was on the high end of the umbrella price range, if you’re willing to spend close to $90 on an umbrella instead of around $50, this is a quality investment. It’s light and compact, making it easy to transport.</p>
<p>Plus, its heavy canopy material, which is silver on the outside to reflect the sun and blue on the inside to absorb it, coupled with its dual-layer structure for ventilation, will keep you cool. Just remember, this umbrella is only six feet in diameter so it’s better for smaller groups.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested-tents">How we tested beach tents</h2>
<p><strong>Test 1: Convenience</strong></p>
<p>Beach tents are a great shelter if you plan on being in the sun for hours on end. However, we know they’re not the only thing you’ll be bringing to the beach. If you have a child or furry friend in tow, you’ll likely be lugging toys, food, water and towels with you as well. That’s why a beach tent must be light and easy to transport. We measured the weight of each item with a luggage scale and found that all the tents we tested were relatively light, between 4.2 and 6.2 pounds.</p>
<p>To test the ease of use, we set up and took down each tent multiple times and found the average setup time. We discluded the first set up, as this was a practice round to get familiar with each tent.</p>
<p>Each of the beach tents below, with the exception of the Coleman Daytripper, had a snap-up frame which made them quick to assemble — just be careful of smashing your fingers or getting hit in the face from the recoil (both of which may or may have not happened to us). The Coleman Daytripper had collapsible poles and was pitched more like a traditional tent, making set up and take down much more difficult.</p>
<p>The tents had stakes to attach them to the ground and either sand bags or pockets for extra weight. If you store your bags and other items in the tents in addition to using the stakes and sandbags, the tents should be tethered to the ground pretty securely.</p>
<p><strong>Test 2: Size</strong></p>
<p>Other than convenience, size is an important factor in determining which beach tent is right for you. The two biggest tents we tested were the Lightspeed and the Coleman. Both had floormats extend past the tent opening, though, as mentioned above, the Coleman required more assembly.</p>
<p>Though the Coleman and Lightspeed were measurably bigger tents, each of the tents we tested could only fit two beach chairs comfortably because of their shapes. The Coleman and Lightspeed both tapered off near the back. The Lightspeed could fit three (cramped) beach towels and the Genji could also fit three vertically, with the users’ legs sticking out.</p>
<p>Since chair and towel capacity didn’t vary much between tents, what it came down to was the number of people each could hold. The Genji Sports tent fit two to three people, the Pacific Breeze and Lightspeed fit three to four people and the Coleman fit four to five.</p>
<p><strong>Test 3: Comfort and features</strong></p>
<p>A tent with limited ventilation can restrict the ocean breeze and make your tent feel like it’s full of canned heat. That’s why we made sure to take into account how many windows or vents each tent had and where they were placed. As each of the windows was relatively large, we did not make the size of the windows a deciding factor. We also took into consideration the number of pocket flaps for easy storage of small items. All the tents we tested had fabric rated UPF 50+, so they were all even in that sense.</p>
<p>The Lightspeed had three windows, one on each side, to keep air circulating. That said, it did get a little warm inside on a hot day with little breeze ‒ this was true for all beach tents, and was the only thing slightly inconvenient about the Lightspeed. The Lightspeed tent also had two pockets inside to hold small valuables like keys or phones.</p>
<p>The Coleman was unique in that it has one very large window in the back, with a zipper that spanned three of the four sides. This allowed it to double as a door. The floormat could also be folded and zipped up like a secondary door, enclosing the tent completely. The Coleman also had four pockets. The Pacific Breeze had two windows on either side and one pocket.</p>
<p>The Genji Sports tent was the only option to have not only a large window, but mesh insets on the bottom of either side, allowing for ventilation from multiple levels. This is a nice addition for anyone who likes to lay down at the beach, as it helped provide all-around airflow from the bottom up.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a tent that can fit the average family (two adults and two to three children), the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005LGV2PA/?tag=ybdbch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lightspeed Outdoors &#8211; Quick Cabana</a> is the one for you! Its extended floormat provides four extra feet of (unsheltered) sand coverage for kids and adults to spread out, making this a great choice for larger families as it can fit around three to four people, and its three windows provide decent ventilation. If you have small children, this likely could squeeze two adults and two to three small children.</p>

<p>It’s setup and takedown time was on par with the other contestants, ranging from one and a half to three minutes. However, its snap-up technology had more tension than the others, causing this tent’s setup to require a bit more muscle. The average person can set up this tent alone, but the recoil is more intense than the other brands, so make sure it locks before you let it go and be careful it’s pointed away from you when unlocking to avoid getting hit by the mechanism. Our only other complaint is that it was slightly more difficult to get back in the bag compared to the other tents.</p>
<p>In the end the Lightspeed is worth it if you have a group to shade and want that extra floormat space.</p>

We appreciated that it maintains a wide footprint toward the back for a comfortable two-person capacity.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CDFVK0O/?tag=ybdbch-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The lightest tent of the bunch, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CDFVK0O/?tag=ybdbch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genji Sports</a> tent is beautiful in its simplicity. It was the easiest to put up as it uncoiled evenly and the frame didn’t get caught on the fabric like some of the other options. The Genji Sports tent also had two mesh insets on either side, plus a window in the back for solid ventilation.</p>
<p>Unlike the other tents, it was equally wide in the front and the back, rather than tapering off towards the back. This allowed two people to be able to lay horizontally and be fully protected from the sun or vertically if they wanted to be in partial sunlight. Though it was shallower than some if its competitors, it didn’t make it feel small or cramped because though it was more shallow it wasn’t tapered off towards the back.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested-chairs">How we tested beach chairs</h2>
<p><strong>Types of beach chairs</strong></p>
<p>Beach chairs add comfort to your trip and can be tailored to fit any beach activity. Although both are suited for outdoors, leave your heavy, but comfortable <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-zero-gravity-chair/">zero gravity chair</a> at home. If you’re aiming for a relaxing day at the beach, a backpack chair may be fitting. If you want extra sun protection without an umbrella, try a canopy chair. And finally, if you’re looking for something light and practical try a compact chair; it’s also great for sitting around a bonfire!</p>
<p>Unlike a towel or blanket, beach chairs are typically water repellent and dry quickly. They’re also easy to brush sand off of, so you won’t end up with a soggy, sandy towel (and a very sandy car) at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Additionally, beach chairs with secure pockets will put you at ease since you’ll know that your valuables are safely tucked away and not at risk of falling out of a pocket or purse.</p>
<p>Learn more about the three beach chair categories we tested below:</p>
<p><strong>Backpack chairs:</strong> These chairs have a stiff rectangular frame with two straps, so you can throw them on like a backpack. They have higher backs so you can rest your head on the backrest or built-in pillow, and are also low enough to the sand to comfortably straighten out your legs. You can also adjust your seat to recline or sit up straight and enjoy a view of the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>Canopy chairs:</strong> If shade is important to you, canopy chairs come with a built-in canopy so you don’t need an additional umbrella or tent. However, they are larger and heavier than the other types of chairs.</p>
<p><strong>Compact chairs:</strong> No frills, these chairs are light, easy to transport and get the job done. If you’re just looking to get off the sand these are a great choice, but lack extra features like cup holders. These chairs are more commonly used for camping or backpacking.</p>
<p><strong>Test 1: Convenience</strong></p>
<p>Two major tests of convenience for beach chairs are how easy they are to set up and how easy they are to transport. Setup was relatively fast and simple across the board, with the exception of the Big Agnes, which required minor assembly.</p>
<p>Since the assembly time was relatively equal, we focused on weight and carrying method. Four out of six chairs averaged seven to nine pounds — a manageable weight — and had a convenient carrying method.</p>
<p>The two outliers were the Big Agnes and the Kelsyus &#8211; Canopy Chair. The Big Agnes was only 1.9 pounds and also had the highest weight capacity of an impressive 320 pounds, making it easy to transport and ideal for backpacking trips. However, its small size and bowl shape made it a less candidate for lounging on the beach. The Kelsyus was the heaviest at nearly 12 pounds, making it less desirable to lug from the parking lot to the shore.</p>
<p><strong>Test 2: Size</strong></p>
<p>Beyond the size of the folded chairs, the seat size is important. We measured the depth and back height of each chair, and the width from side-to-side or armrest-to-armrest at their widest point.</p>
<p>The Tommy Bahama &#8211; Cooler Beach Chair and Rio &#8211; Backpack Chair had the highest backs, 24.5 and 27.5 inches respectively. This, coupled with their sturdy frame and pillow, provided relaxing neck support. These two chairs were also a medium level from the ground, nine inches and 13 inches, which created a barrier from the sand while still allowing us to be close enough to have the full beach experience.</p>
<p>Though the measurements of the two compact chairs, the Big Agnes &#8211; Helinox and ALPS Mountaineering were similar, the shape of the ALPS chair was much more conducive to a beach environment. Its padded armrests and moderate price makes it a solid option if you’re looking for a minimalistic chair that could also be used for camping.</p>
<p>The larger sizes of the Rio &#8211; Big Guy Backpack Chair and Kelsyus &#8211; Canopy Chair, make these two good options for people taller than the average person. But, as mentioned, they’re also heavier than other options.</p>
<p><strong>Test 3: Comfort</strong></p>
<p>At the beach you want to be able to lean back and enjoy the sound of the crashing waves. Only two chairs allowed you to do that — the Tommy Bahama &#8211; Cooler Beach Chair and the Rio &#8211; Backpack Chair. Both provided neck support, a pillow and an adjustable back for ultimate comfort.</p>
<p>The rest of the chairs, though not as supportive, were relatively comfortable, with the exception of the Kelsyus &#8211; Canopy Chair. The bottom of that chair sagged and caused us to sink into it, making for a less pleasant seating experience than the rest.</p>
<p>The Big Agnes &#8211; Helinox, though comfortable in its own way, was not the relaxing comfort you look for at the beach. As it is made for backpacking and camping, it is small and light but lacks armrests. If you’re looking to invest in a backpacking chair, we highly recommend it, but for the beach it’s best to stick with something a bit larger and with more features.</p>

The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000A073BE/?tag=ybdbch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tommy Bahama &#8211; Backpack Cooler Beach Chair</a> came in first for its comfort and versatility.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>In deciding which metal detectors to test, we did online research and found out what people are normally using metal detectors for. In particular, we combed through metal detecting subreddits to see what people are concerned with, read articles to learn from more experienced detectorists such as Michael and Daniel Bernzweig and also drew from other ‘real testing’ review sites.</p>
<p>We found that the top uses for metal detectors are coin shooting, relic hunting and gold prospecting, which we will describe below. We also found that the top areas people are concerned about while doing their detecting are beaches and water. We therefore looked for metal detectors that specialize in these areas.</p>
<p>Keeping this information in mind, we then went to Amazon and other online retailers, such as Walmart and The Home Depot, in order to find which metal detectors not only met the above criteria but were also reviewed positively by consumers. Of course, the more reviews each metal detector has, the more reliable the information will be. Because of this, we only tested those metal detectors that had a large number of reviews and a positive customer review rating.</p>
<p>Once our seven metal detectors arrived we headed off to the beach in order to begin our hands-on testing. Based on our research of what consumers are most interested in and concerned about, we tailored our tests accordingly. We engaged all seven metal detectors in five tests: a general detection test, a discrimination test, a depth test, an underwater test and an ergonomics test.</p>

<h2>What is a metal detector used for?</h2>
<p><strong>Coin shooting:</strong> The most common activity metal detectors are used for is searching for coins or ‘coin shooting.’ It is often mentioned that coin shooting, while fun in its own right, will also pay for your metal detector within several months of detecting. If you go to popular places, such as the beach, you are sure to find quarters, nickels, dimes and even one dollar coins. On the other hand, you can also go searching for more valuable vintage coins. If you would like to search for these, it is recommended to go coin shooting in less frequented places.</p>
<p><strong>Relic hunting:</strong> Relic hunting, or searching for treasures from a bygone era, is another popular activity you can do with a metal detector. Not only can relics be valuable antiques, but they are also interesting in that they provide insights into past times. When searching for a relic you need to consider the type of ground that you will be searching in. Often times, you will be searching in heavily mineralized areas, and so you want a detector that can filter out the minerals while searching.</p>
<p><strong>Gold prospecting:</strong> Many people get into the hobby of metal detecting with the dreams of finding a big gold nugget. Searching for gold nuggets or flakes is called gold prospecting.  Enthusiasm for the gold rush is still alive and well for some people, and if this is true for you,  then you want a detector that is especially well adept at locating gold.</p>
<p>It seems that gold prospecting is the most difficult of all types of detecting and experienced detectorists suggest that you master coin shooting before searching for gold. From our tests, we found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00095ODBI/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Garrett &#8211; Ace 250</a> was best at locating gold, while the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005A3L1/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bounty Hunter &#8211; Tracker IV</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002J1LNO/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bounty Hunter &#8211; Gold Digger</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000WO7L3S/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Treasure Cove &#8211; TC-3020</a> all tied for a close second place.</p>
<p><strong>Beach and water hunting:</strong> While coin shooting, relic hunting and gold prospecting are the most popular activities for metal detectorists, the beach and ocean are the most popular locations for detecting. There are two main terrains to consider here: the sand and underwater.</p>
<p>Of course, you can expect to find valuables left behind by beachgoers on the sand, but don’t forget that there will be things in the water too. If you plan on using your detector underwater, the coil needs to be waterproof. We made sure that all of the models we tested were advertised as having waterproof coils.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Calibration:</strong> Often, you will be using your metal detector in soil full of metallic minerals. When this is the case, you are going to want a good calibration feature, also known as a ground-balancing feature, on your metal detector.</p>
<p>The ground-balancing feature is responsible for sensing the various metallic minerals in the soil and, in turn, clearing out any possible interference from these. If the calibration strength is too low on your metal detector, you may experience frustrating interference from the minerals in the soil.</p>
<p>There are three different types of calibration features that each metal detector may have, including preset, automatic or manual:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your detector has a <strong>preset calibration</strong>, it has been set to a particular range and will not change.</li>
<li>Detectors with <strong>auto-calibration</strong> automatically adjust their sensors as they read the minerals in the ground.</li>
<li>Detectors with <strong>manual calibration</strong> allow the user to adjust their ground balancing setting as they choose.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Coil:</strong> The coil is the flat sphere at the end of the detector that you hold above the ground. It comes in many different styles and shapes, including the double-D, concentric and spider designs. Each type of coil excels at certain things and struggles with others, so be sure to think about what you will be using your detector for before choosing your coil.</p>
<p>Double-D coils have an excellent range of coverage but cannot read objects buried very deep. Concentric coils, on the other hand, do not have as good of a range, but read buried objects better. Spider coils are the most consistent of all coil shapes and can be used amid bushes and grass.</p>
<p><strong>Depth indicator:</strong> The depth indicator is a rare feature on metal detectors. However, this feature is handy. It will let you know how deep you need to dig in order to pull up your object from the ground. Normally, depth indicators will display how deep the object is on the LCD screen, giving you a range from anywhere between one and 12 inches.</p>
<p><strong>Discrimination:</strong> The discrimination feature on metal detectors is used to specify what objects you do and do not want your detector to locate. Most detectors will have this feature, but the options of this mode will vary greatly.</p>
<p>Different types of metal produce different types of magnetic responses and the discrimination feature on detectors is able to hone in on only those magnetic responses which you choose. This allows you not only to search for the types of metals you are after, but it also allows you to ignore other types of trash metals.</p>
<p><strong>Pinpoint mode:</strong> Pinpoint mode is an option found on a few metal detectors. It is used to help hone in on the object you are detecting. Whereas all detectors give you a rough idea where the object is to be found, the pinpoint mode helps you determine its exact location. The sensor is placed at the center of the coil, while the button to activate the mode is normally up by the hand. Once you know there is an object in the vicinity, push the pinpoint button, and you should be able to precisely locate the object.</p>
<p><strong>Radar type:</strong> While many metal detectors come with a radar that can penetrate the ground, the quality of the radar can vary. Indeed, the quality of the radar technology has a large impact on the total cost of the unit, so if you want high-end technology here, expect to pay top dollar for your metal detector. The better radars can read the density and size of the buried object accurately, so if this concerns you, be sure to get a detector with a high-quality radar.</p>
<p><strong>Sensitivity meter:</strong> The sensitivity feature on a metal detector is used for two different reasons: first, to find objects of varying sizes. When the sensitivity is set to high, you will be able to find smaller metal items; when it&#8217;s set to low, you will be able to find larger items.</p>
<p>Second, the sensitivity feature is used to find objects buried at varying depths. Setting the sensitivity to high will allow you to find objects toward the top of the ground, and setting it to low will help you find objects that are buried deeper. While nearly all metal detectors have an adjustable sensitivity meter, the sensitivity range of each detector will vary.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>The most popular location for metal detecting is the beach, where we tested our seven finalists with five tests. First, we set up a general detection test in which we searched for relics, coins and gold that we scattered on the sand. Second, we did a similar test in which we scattered metallic trash around our test items to see if that trash would confuse the detector.</p>
<p>Third, we performed a depth test in which we buried the coins, relics and gold several inches deep and then tested how well the detectors sensed them. Fourth, we submitted each detector to an underwater test in which we tested how well the detectors sensed the coins, relics and gold when they were submerged several inches. Finally, while doing all of the above tests, we also considered the ergonomic look and feel of each metal detector.</p>

<p>For the general detection test, we scattered 12 different objects on top of the sand, separated from one another by several feet. Here, we wanted to test the ability of each detector to find all types of metal. So, we used a wide variety of coins, relics and gold. In total, we used one yellow-gold ring, two white-gold rings, a silver bracelet relic, a silver belt buckle relic, a silver pocket watch relic, three one dollar coins and three quarters.</p>
<p>Once the objects were placed in the sand, we then tested each detector by walking steadily forward, sweeping the detector back and forth over each object one time. We wanted this test to capture realistic results, so we did not pause over any object. Instead, we simply passed over each one time, testing if the detector would alert us to its presence.</p>
<p>All of the finalists had good results for this test, and a few of them had excellent results.

<h3>Discrimination test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-7537 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/trash-for-discrimination-test.jpg" alt="trash for discrimination test" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/trash-for-discrimination-test.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/trash-for-discrimination-test-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/trash-for-discrimination-test-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/trash-for-discrimination-test-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/trash-for-discrimination-test-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/trash-for-discrimination-test-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/trash-for-discrimination-test-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/trash-for-discrimination-test-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/trash-for-discrimination-test-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/trash-for-discrimination-test-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/trash-for-discrimination-test-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/trash-for-discrimination-test-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Next, we wanted to test the discrimination ability of each of the metal detectors — that is, we wanted to test how well each detector can filter out metallic trash while still being able to locate coins, relics and gold.</p>
<p>For the discrimination test, we used the above-mentioned general detection test, but first we scattered several nails and soda can pull tabs throughout the area. We chose these trash items because they seem to be the most common to confuse detectors. We placed these trash objects both next to several of the coins, relics and gold and in the spaces between them.</p>
<p>We wanted to determine whether each detector was able to accurately locate the coins, relics and gold, even when metal trash was next to them. Moreover, we wanted to ensure that the detectors would not erroneously pick up a trash item by itself as if it were one of the coins, relics or gold. As we did with the general detection test, for this test we simply walked forward in a steady motion, sweeping each detector back and forth.</p>
<p>All of the detectors that we tested had an adjustable discrimination feature, which we set according to their respective manuals. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the results of this test were very similar to the above general detection test. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00095ODBI/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Garrett &#8211; Ace 250</a> had the highest score, failing to find only one object. The Ground EFX &#8211; MC1 Youth had the lowest score, failing to find several objects and actually erroneously alerting us of one trash item.</p>

<h3>Depth test</h3>

<p>For the depth test we wanted to test how accurately each detector could locate coins, relics and gold that were buried under the sand from between four and six inches deep. We chose this range since we learned that under normal conditions you can expect your detector to read objects with consistency up to six inches underground.</p>
<p>Here we dug six holes, each one between four and six inches. Then, we buried the six following items: a yellow-gold ring, a white-gold ring, a silver bracelet relic, a silver belt buckle relic, a one dollar coin and a quarter. We then filled each of the holes with sand. Once all of the items were buried, we scanned the area with each detector, just as we did in the first two tests: walking steadily forward, sweeping the detector back and forth</p>
<p>Again, the results were very similar to the first two tests, so we knew that a pattern was forming. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00095ODBI/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Garrett &#8211; Ace 250</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005A3L1/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bounty Hunter &#8211; Tracker IV</a> each achieved a perfect score by locating all six of the items that we buried. Meanwhile, the Ground EFX &#8211; MC1 Youth earned the worst score with a three out of six.</p>
<p>In general, we found that the rings were the hardest for the detectors to locate, which makes sense considering how small they are. Also, we noted that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00095ODBI/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Garrett &#8211; Ace 250</a> not only achieved the highest score here, but that it was also the most intuitive. It clearly and accurately marked on its LCD screen the depth of each object that it located.</p>

<h3>Underwater test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7539" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/underwater-test.jpg" alt="testing a metal detector under water" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/underwater-test.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/underwater-test-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/underwater-test-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/underwater-test-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/underwater-test-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/underwater-test-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/underwater-test-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/underwater-test-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/underwater-test-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/underwater-test-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/underwater-test-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/underwater-test-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Next, we tested how well each metal detector worked when attempting to locate an object that was submerged in water. Here we placed various coins, relics and gold underwater, each one submerged anywhere from four to 12 inches deep. We chose this range in an attempt to mimic what you would normally experience while detecting in the shallow water at the beach.</p>
<p>In total we placed six objects underwater, the same ones we used during the depth test: a yellow-gold ring, a white-gold ring, a silver bracelet relic, a silver belt buckle relic, a one dollar coin, and a quarter. We then tested each of the metal detectors by submerging their coils under the water and moving steadily forward over each object one time.</p>
<p>We should note here that all seven of the metal detectors are advertised as having waterproof coils, and indeed, we did not have any problems in this regard. However, you should note that some consumers have had their units malfunction when placed in water. Notably, consumers have complained that both of the Bounty Hunters on this list, as well as the BARSKA, have malfunctioned when submerged. We did not have this problem with any of the units.</p>
<p>Once again, in line with our above tests, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00095ODBI/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Garrett &#8211; Ace 250</a> had the best score in the underwater test, locating with perfect accuracy all six of the underwater items. Surprisingly, here the Ground EFX &#8211; MC1 Youth did not score the lowest. Instead, the Treasure Cove &#8211; TC-3020, New Home Innovations &#8211; Starter Kit and BARSKA &#8211; Winbest Pro Edition all tied for the worst score, locating four out of the six underwater items.</p>

<p>While testing, we also took notes on each detector&#8217;s ergonomics. We considered the feel and function of each detector in our hands, along with the quality of the display for each unit.</p>
<p>We found that when the different components on a detector snapped together, this provided a sturdier frame than those that were screwed together. Also, the component of the metal detector that rests on your forearm should be large and comfortable, as we found that much of the weight of the detector rests on this spot. Detectors that had a small forearm rest often slipped off our arm and were harder to control.</p>
<p>The displays of metal detectors come in a wide array of options, some better than others. In general, an LCD display is preferable over the old knobs and meter layout, as it gives much more information along with more options for customization.</p>

<p>Keeping the above pointers in mind, we found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00095ODBI/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Garrett &#8211; Ace 250</a> had the best ergonomics. The thick padding all over the detector, the secure forearm rest with a Velcro strap and the fact that the different parts of the shaft connected by clicking together in pre-made grooves, made this Garrett the most comfortable unit. This model also had the best display of any of the detectors. The LCD display on this unit was easy to read and had the most buttons, options and customization of all the units.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000WO7L3S/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Treasure Cove &#8211; TC-3020</a> was a close second place, as it is sturdily  and also has an excellent LCD display. We found the BARSKA &#8211; Winbest Pro Edition to have the worst ergonomics. Not only was the forearm rest on the BARSKA small and flimsy, but the unit itself kept falling apart due its weak screw support.</p>
<h2 id="top-pick">Best overall: Garrett &#8211; Ace 250</h2>

<p>After we completed testing, a clear winner emerged: the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00095ODBI/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Garrett &#8211; Ace 250</a>, which received perfect scores in four of our five tests.</p>
<p>The Garrett’s automatic ground-balancing feature adjusted itself to the mineral content and found every coin, relic and piece of gold — in sand, underwater and even buried a few inches deep. It only missed one item during the discrimination test, so it is safe to say that this metal detector is your best bet when it comes to finding those treasures.</p>
<p>As far as the ergonomics on this unit go, it was definitely the most comfortable of any of the detectors. The model is solidly built and sturdy. The foam on the handle and arm rest, along with the Velcro strap on the armrest, provide a very secure feel.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00095ODBI/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/garrett-ace-250-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/garrett-ace-250-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/garrett-ace-250-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/garrett-ace-250-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/garrett-ace-250-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/garrett-ace-250-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/garrett-ace-250-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/garrett-ace-250-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/garrett-ace-250.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Top Pick: Garrett - Ace 250</h3><p>The Garrett - Ace 250 is on the pricey side, but it's packed with features and it outperformed every other unit we tested.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00095ODBI/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>The LCD display is also in a class of its own. Along with the standard discrimination, sensitivity features and headphone jack, this unit comes with a pinpoint feature (which is also found on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B019INJAH8/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">New Home Innovations &#8211; Starter Kit</a>) and many other pre-programmed modes for searching for different types of metals. The screen is easy to read and also displays the estimated depth of the metal it finds. No other detector can compare to this Garrett &#8211; Ace 250 in terms of ergonomics.</p>
<p>The only downside to this unit is the relatively high price tag. While there are much more expensive models out there, this one does cost the most of the seven we’ve tested.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Garrett &#8211; Ace 250 is the most reliable metal detector when it comes to locating coins, relics and gold.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s solid frame, padded handle and Velcro-strapped forearm rest make this metal detector the most comfortable model.</li>
<li>The LCD screen is top of the line, clearly displaying a wide range of options and data.</li>
<li>With a depth meter, pinpoint feature and various other features, the Garrett &#8211; Ace 250 has the widest variety of modes.</li>

<p>Coming in second place is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005A3L1/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bounty Hunter &#8211; Tracker IV</a> metal detector. In two of our tests, this metal detector actually tied with the Garrett &#8211; Ace 250 for top place. That is, in both the general detection test and the depth test the Bounty Hunter &#8211; Tracker IV found every single item. As for the discrimination test and underwater test, this metal detector came up only behind the Garrett. Perhaps it is for this reason that the Tracker IV has also been voted as one of the best beginner metal detectors on some other review sites.</p>
<p>We would definitely recommend this unit to anyone looking for an excellent all-around unit that is inexpensive. Like the Garrett, the calibration feature on this model is automatic, and it had no problems adjusting itself to the soil we were searching. Bounty Hunter is perhaps the most trusted name in the business when it comes to metal detectors, and this Tracker IV is our pick for their best model.</p>
<p>If you are deliberating between getting this model or the Garrett &#8211; Ace 250, there are two main points you should consider. On one hand, the price of the Bounty Hunter &#8211; Tracker IV is much lower than the Garrett: around 50% cheaper. On the other hand, this Bounty Hunter &#8211; Tracker IV does not compete with the Garrett when it comes to ergonomics.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005A3L1/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bounty-hunter-tracker-iv-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bounty-hunter-tracker-iv-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bounty-hunter-tracker-iv-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bounty-hunter-tracker-iv-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bounty-hunter-tracker-iv-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bounty-hunter-tracker-iv-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bounty-hunter-tracker-iv-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bounty-hunter-tracker-iv-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bounty-hunter-tracker-iv.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Runner-up: Bounty Hunter - Tracker IV</h3><p>The Tracker IV is one of the best when it comes to locating treasures, both on the surface and buried several inches deep.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005A3L1/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>The sensitivity feature, discrimination feature, headphone jack, target indicator and three-position toggle on this Tracker IV are more than enough to detect most items. However, the lack of an LCD screen is worth noting. We think that the variety of extra options that come with an LCD screen would have helped this Tracker IV in the trickier underwater and discrimination tests.</p>
<p>If you plan on detecting in places where there will be metallic trash that might interfere, or you plan on searching for items underwater and you want the absolute best performance under these conditions, you may want to spend the extra cash and go with the Garrett.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Bounty Hunter &#8211; Tracker IV received our top score for finding metals, both on the surface and buried.</li>
<li>It was second best when testing amid metallic trash and underwater, only to be beat out by the Garrett.</li>
<li>Considering how well it functions, the price tag for the Tracker is relatively low.</li>
<li>The four adjustable modes on its display are enough to suit any type of treasure hunting you might engage in.</li>

<p>If you are more budget-minded and are still looking for an excellent metal detector, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002J1LNO/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bounty Hunter &#8211; Gold Digger</a> is a good option. Bounty Hunter is a quality product that dominates the market of metal detectors. While other review sites picked the Bounty Hunter &#8211; Tracker IV as their top budget pick, we think the Gold Digger deserves this honor, as it is priced lower than the Tracker IV and functions almost as well.</p>
<p>In our general detection test, the Gold Digger missed only one item. Likewise, in the depth test and underwater test this detector failed to locate only one item per test. This Gold Digger is therefore very reliable when it comes to locating treasures &#8211; both above ground as well as underground and underwater.</p>
<p>Like the top two detectors, the Gold Digger’s calibration feature is automatic and self-adjusted as needed. Also, this detector comes with a pair of headphones that can be plugged into the jack, but we must note that they are on the small side and the quality is not great.</p>

<p>We were pleasantly surprised to find that, overall, the Bounty Hunter &#8211; Gold Digger came in third place in our test results, and yet it is the second cheapest model out of all seven detectors we tested. We admit that this detector does not look special (with only a power level, trash eliminator and sensitivity meter on the display), but it gets the job done. When all features are adjusted properly, this budget unit finds treasures with the best of them.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002J1LNO/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bounty Hunter &#8211; Gold Digger</a> received an overall third place score on our five tests and can reliably find treasures in most conditions.</li>
<li>Though it excelled on our tests, this metal detector is actually the second cheapest model that we tested.</li>
<li>Power level, trash eliminator and sensitivity meter features work very well together on the Gold Digger, and it was the only one to come with headphones.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Treasure Cove &#8211; TC-3020</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000WO7L3S/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Treasure Cove &#8211; TC-3020</a> had an all-around good score on our five tests, making it worth considering. When we first got our hands on this unit we were excited about the sheer number of options and features on the LCD display. We have to note that this is the second best display of all our seven models, only behind the Garrett &#8211; Ace 250.</p>
<p>The options on the LCD screen include a sensitivity meter, discrimination meter, notch adjuster and metal adjuster. Besides these, the display also has a meter displaying what type of metal it has found (such as gold or silver) and even attempts to specify what it is that it has located (such as a nickel, quarter or trash). It is also noteworthy that this metal detector came with high-quality headphones to plug into the jack.</p>
<p>Because this detector came with such an excellent range of options and features on the display, we were disappointed that it did not score more highly on some of our tests. In particular, this Treasure Cove struggled a bit on our depth and underwater test, so it might not be the greatest at finding metals that are several inches below the surface.</p>
<h3>New Home Innovations &#8211; Starter Kit</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B019INJAH8/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">New Home Innovations &#8211; Starter Kit</a> metal detector was a bit low on the overall score for our tests, but the cheap price tag on this unit somewhat offsets that. If you are looking for a budget metal detector outside of the Bounty Hunter name brand, this one will treat you well. There were no glaring defects on this metal detector; on the other hand, there were no amazing qualities about it either.</p>
<p>Overall, we consider this a nice middle of the road unit. It scored somewhere near the mid-range in most of our tests. This means that while using this detector you will be able to find most treasures, including those buried underwater and amid trash, but will likely miss out on a few that other higher-rated detectors would find.</p>
<p>The features on the display include the standard discrimination, sensitivity and target indicator, along with a headphone jack. Beyond this, the display also includes a pinpoint feature, which is a nice touch on such a budget friendly model. We do have to note that ergonomically this unit feels a bit on the cheap side due to its weak build and the flimsy forearm rest.</p>
<h3>BARSKA &#8211; Winbest Pro</h3>
<p>As far as functionality goes, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005MVF0K2/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BARSKA &#8211; Winbest Pro</a> metal detector operated about on par with the New Home Innovations. In our tests to locate metals, this unit scored around the middle of the road, not doing too poorly or too well on any test. It is comparable to the New Home Innovations in this regard: It will find most treasures, but will miss out on a few that other higher rated detectors would have located. Therefore, if your only concern is finding a decent amount of treasures, this unit will be alright and will save you a bit of cash as well.</p>
<p>Again, as far as ergonomics go, this metal detector did struggle. The display only includes a discrimination feature, sensitivity feature, headphone jack and target indicator — leaving a bit to be desired here. Moreover, the feel of the unit was below our expectations. The forearm rest is small and flimsy, making it feel loose in the hands. The unit itself would also fall apart on us during testing, since it did not screw together very securely.</p>
<h3>Ground EFX &#8211; MC1 Youth</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007MX0SXM/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ground EFX &#8211; MC1 Youth</a> metal detector is made specifically for children, so it&#8217;s shorter and lighter than the other detectors we tested, weighing only two pounds with an adjustable length between 26 and 36 inches.</p>
<p>While the Ground EFX does have the weight and length to match a child treasure-seeker, the functionality of this unit was poor, scoring last on four of our tests. In the general detection test, discrimination test and depth test this metal detector had the poorest performance, which suggests that it just cannot find those relics, coins and gold with any consistency.</p>
<p>Its display only offers the most basic features: a power knob, eliminator knob and target indicator meter. Also, there does not seem to be a headphone jack, while all of our other detectors had the option to plug in headphones. Moreover, we were not able to verify whether the calibration feature on this unit was automatic, but we suspect that it comes preset, which might explain why it was not able to locate treasures very well.</p>
<p>If your child is very small, then this metal detector may be the only one to fit them, but you might want to consider looking for a non-youth unit that is lightweight and can be shortened down to size. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005MVF0K2/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BARSKA &#8211; Winbest Pro</a> will be your best bet here, as this detector weighs only two and a half pounds and can be adjusted to be as short as the Ground EFX.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>

<p>Treasure hunters out there know that those coins, relics and gold can be hiding in a wide variety of places: in the sand, buried several inches, in the water or hidden alongside trash. Finding that treasure or passing it over may very well depend on the model of the metal detector that you are using.</p>
<p>We subjected the seven best metal detectors to five detailed tests and found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00095ODBI/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Garrett &#8211; Ace 250</a> is the king of detectors. Not only did this model come in first place in all five of our tests, but its bright LCD screen also boasts a wide array of features and options. In terms of performance, the Garrett &#8211; Ace 250 simply cannot be beat.</p>
<p>The only downside to the Garrett is the relatively high price tag and so our runner up, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005A3L1/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bounty Hunter &#8211; Tracker IV</a>, is also worth considering. Coming in at about half the cost as the Garrett, we found that the Bounty Hunter &#8211; Tracker IV works almost as well, making it a great option.</p>
<p>But if you want to save as much money as possible while still making sure that you get a great unit, we found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002J1LNO/?tag=ybdmetl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bounty Hunter &#8211; Gold Digger</a> is the way to go. With great performance, a very low price tag and the Bounty Hunter name, the Gold Digger is our top budget pick.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After a month of testing the most popular folding wagons on the market, we determined that the Mac Sports Heavy Duty wagon was the best overall.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e took six top competitors over sandy beaches and rocky hills to determine that the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KQH575E/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty Collapsible Wagon</a> is the best folding wagon. Its durability and solid construction, combined with oversize wheels that allow it to easily handle tricky terrain, make the “heavy duty” description well-deserved. The runner-up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BUUUIGK/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac Sports &#8211; Utility Wagon</a> comes at a lower price and is suited for light-duty uses like grocery shopping, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CTUGC5K/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Radio Flyer &#8211; EZ Fold with Canopy</a> is our top pick for pulling around your kids.</p>

<p>Unlike many of the other products we test at Your Best Digs, there was very little information available online regarding folding wagons. In addition, there are very few established brands that we could use as a reference point.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we dug deep into the Amazon reviews of the most popular folding wagons and read through blog posts and articles that mentioned specific folding wagons as standout options for consumers.</p>
<p>From there, we narrowed our list of products to those that could comfortably carry enough cargo for a day at the beach or for a group of tailgaters.</p>
<p>This left us with a list of five finalists. We ordered the finalists and tested them extensively over the course of one month.</p>
<h2 id="the-five-best">Compare the best folding wagons</h2>
[table id=15 /]
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested the wagons</h2>
<p>We used each of the outdoor utility wagons in a series of everyday situations. These included walking to and from our downtown office to the car, as well as carrying cargo at the beach, along gravel and dirt roads, and up and down hills.</p>
<p>In addition to real-world testing, we looked at several different features and metrics to compare each of the finalists against one another.</p>
<p>Folding wagons are used to carry anything from tailgating gear (some will fit your favorite <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-coolers/">cooler</a>!), to <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-pet-insurance/">pets</a>, and sometimes even your little ones. This means that one of the most important aspects of any wagon is the quality of materials used and sturdy construction.</p>
<p>For each of the five finalists, we looked at how sturdy they were, how easily the material stretched and ripped, and whether there were any early signs of wear and tear that could indicate problems down the line.</p>
<p>We also looked at the general stability of each wagon, including how easy or difficult it was to expand and collapse.</p>

    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/folding-motion.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The size and type of wheels used by each folding wagon were considered as well. Our top pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KQH575E/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty</a>, has oversized wheels that made movement over tough terrain significantly easier.</p>
<p>Next, we measured how much weight each wagon could comfortably hold. While each of the wagons had a recommended “maximum weight”, we were more interested in practical weight limits, not “technical maximums”.</p>
<p>Put another way, we wanted to know how much weight each wagon could reliably carry without tipping or otherwise becoming cumbersome to use. We also measured the volume inside each wagon (length x width x height).</p>
<p>We also tested each wagon to see how easy or difficult it was to tip over. We tested this by turning the wheels at a 90-degree angle and pulling sharply. This process was repeated with the wagons empty, with 20 pounds of cargo, and at each of their maximum weights.</p>
<h2 id="uses">Uses for folding wagons</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >

<p>If you ever had (or saw) one of the red Radio Flyer wagons as a child, you understand how useful (and fun!) having a wagon can be. Folding wagons incorporate many of the benefits of a wagon like the Radio Flyer while also being lighter, more portable, and capable of reliably carrying more cargo.</p>
<p>If you enjoy tailgating, or simply need a way to transport supplies to and from the beach, lake, etc, a folding wagon can simplify the process significantly.</p>
<p>Wagons are great for running errands as well. Whether you’re bringing groceries into the house or starting a gardening project in your backyard, a folding wagon can help get everything from the car to wherever it needs to be.</p>
<p>A reliable wagon can help ensure that all of your food, drinks and anything else you need get from point A to point B gets there safely, and without anyone needing to carry everything in your arms.</p>
<p>If you have tired children (or pets) that need a break from walking, putting them in a folding wagon is a fun way to bring them along for the ride – just make sure to pay attention to weight maximums.</p>
<h2>Folding wagons vs strollers</h2>
<p>In 2019 we compared the best double strollers with wagons. There are a few advantages wagons have over strollers.</p>
<p>For one, wagons fold flatter, so they&#8217;re easier to store and transport in your car. Folding and unfolding is also easier than on most strollers.</p>
<p>Another perk is room: a collapsible wagon for kids is basically a small playpen on wheels. You can even get oversized four-seat wagons like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMD77BS/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Wonder Fold XXL</a> that carry more kids than any stroller we&#8217;ve seen. Even strollers with lay-flat seats or bassinet attachments don&#8217;t have as much extra room as a wagon.</p>
<p>The sacrifices you&#8217;ll make moving from a stroller to a wagon are fairly serious, though. For one thing, sitting in a wagon with your legs stretched out isn&#8217;t very comfortable, so most kids will prefer riding around for hours in a sit-up stroller seat.</p>
<p>Car seat adapters are also tricky: yes, you can pull a carseat around loose in a wagon, but it&#8217;s not secure. Think very carefully about how you intend to use a wagon with a small infant in it. The best infant carseats like the group we reviewed are all designed to be safe when secured to a stroller, and manufacturers will issue recalls if they find out about ways infants might be in danger. With a wagon, you&#8217;re on your own to make sure that a car seat doesn&#8217;t roll around.</p>
<p>Wagons are also far less maneuverable than strollers. You can still get them most places if you&#8217;re careful, but it&#8217;s like trading a minivan for an 18-wheeler. Since the beginning of 2019, a Walt Disney World and Disneyland wagon ban explicitly prohibits bringing a wagon into the parks to prevent traffic jams; most double strollers are still within the new size limits. Other parks and malls still allow wagons, but it&#8217;s not hard to see how hundreds of them in the same footpath have caused problems.</p>
<p>On the whole, if you have multiple kids but don&#8217;t need a double stroller every day, a wagon is a cost-effective and versatile way to let your older child take a break on your longer mall trips. It&#8217;ll also help you carry your shopping.</p>
<h2 id="think-about">Important features to consider</h2>

<p>The first thing you’ll want to think about is what the wagon will be used for. If you frequently go to the beach, you’ll want to make sure that the wagon you choose can handle sandy (or other rough) terrain. If, on the other hand, you are using the wagon in tight hallways or other areas where there isn’t much room to maneuver, it will be useful to have a wagon with a smaller turn radius, which is where the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KQH575E/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty Wagon</a> is without question the leader.</p>
<p>It’s also worth considering how much cargo space you’ll need. If you’re just transporting some groceries, a smaller wagon is probably enough. If, on the other hand, you plan on transporting a child (or pet), or if you need to carry a lot of cargo, a larger wagon makes more sense.</p>
<p>The terrain your wagon will traverse is important to think about as well. If your wagon will be rolling over sidewalks and driveways for the most part, smaller and thinner wheels &#8212; like the wheels on the smaller <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BUUUIGK/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac Sports &#8211; Utility Wagon</a> &#8212; can be easier and more efficient.</p>
<p>If you plan on going over gravel, sand or anything else difficult to traverse, a more rugged wheel will get the job done, while still being easy enough to use on flatter terrain as well.</p>
<p>Finally, consider the amount of easy storage space you have available for your wagon. One of the most significant advantages of using a folding wagon is that it takes up less space when it is not in use. Folding wagons also fit more easily into smaller vehicles, so getting them to and from wherever you plan to use this is more practical than a “fixed” wagon.</p>
<p>If you have limited storage space (e.g. you live in an apartment), a folding wagon that folds significantly smaller than its unfolded size is particularly useful as well.</p>

<p>After using all of the wagons extensively over a one-month period, we determined that the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KQH575E/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty Collapsible Wagon</a> was the best among our finalists for use on mud and sand. If you&#8217;re moving it over tougher terrain or carrying bigger loads it&#8217;ll meet your demands without complaints.</p>
<p>While all five of our finalists worked fairly well in our more general tests, The Mac Sports wagon also stood out as an overall winner because it combined durability and weight capacity with a tight turn radius and general ease of use.</p>
<p>Before we even started testing the wagons, the Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty stood out as a premium product. Both the metal frame and the fabric are sturdy and capable of handling more than 100 pounds of cargo. In our month of heavy testing, we saw no signs of wear and tear, which indicates that the wagon should last for years without any issues.</p>
<h3>Best beach wagon</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3979 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03.jpg" alt="mac sports heavy duty" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>While there was plenty to like about the Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty, one thing that quickly stood out from the rest of the field was dramatically-better steering, courtesy of the large wheels and sharp turn radius this wagon is capable of.</p>
<p>The more we tested the five finalists, the more we came to appreciate just how much better the steering is on the Mac Sports wagon. While it might seem like having four wheels in each corner would be more efficient, our testing found that having the two front wheels close to each other and, most importantly, directly connected to the steering handle, worked significantly better than the alternatives.</p>
<p>The width of the wheels was noteworthy as well. The wheels are significantly wider than they were on the other wagons, which made them far more capable of traversing sandy beaches and other rough and uneven terrains.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s even more important if you&#8217;re carrying anything heavy. Even if you&#8217;re only weighed down with a couple of big kids, wide wheels won&#8217;t sink as quickly in sand or mud.</p>
<p>The thing we liked most about the wheels, however, was the sharp turn radius they offered. Unlike the other four collapsible wagons we tested, the handle of the Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty wagon is directly attached to the wheels themselves, giving the user direct control over the direction without needing to pull the wagon itself.</p>

    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/wagon-turning.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Finally, the oversized plastic wheels were also easier to clean than the other finalists. While rubber might seem like a more durable choice, the sturdy plastic used by the Mac Sports wagon showed essentially zero damage during our testing, and was also significantly easier to clean – a major plus for those who’d rather not track mud and dirt through their home.</p>
<h3>Handle</h3>
<p>The telescopic handle, while featured to some extent on all of our finalists, was best executed on the Mac Sports wagon. The telescoping handle was flexible enough for both a 5-foot-2-inch individual and a six-foot individual, and the handle itself is easy to pull, turn, and maneuver.</p>

<p>In addition, the handle fits into a “dock” when not in use so that you don’t have to pick it up from the ground, or snap it into place every time (as was the case with other finalists).</p>
<h3>Design and ergonomics</h3>
<p>One of the added benefits of having two of the wheels front and center came when folding the wagon for storage and transportation. The wheels are able to line up with the outer wheels, reducing the folded footprint and making it easier to pull the wagon even when folded.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3980 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded.jpg" alt="mac sports folded" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The volume, or capacity, of the Mac Sports wagon cart was solid as well – however all of our finalists were able to carry considerable cargo, so if this is the <em>only</em> factor you&#8217;re considering, the less expensive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BUUUIGK/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac Sports &#8211; Utility Wagon</a> might be a better option.</p>
<p>Finally, the two mesh cup holders make the Mac Sports wagon just a bit more useful, both for tailgating and going to the beach – as well as any other situation where you might want a place to put your beverages.</p>
<h3>Weight capacity</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3978 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled.jpg" alt="mac sports heavy duty filled with cargo" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Mac Sports claims that their wagon can carry up to 150 pounds of cargo. We put that weight to the test, and found that the wagon didn’t start groaning under the pressure until there was about 170 pounds of cargo inside.</p>
<p>That being said, in practice you should be carrying less than the maximum weight in this wagon. We found that up to about 80 pounds was very easy to carry, but there started to be minor maneuverability issues around 130 pounds. While you could technically carry 150 pounds in this wagon (and we did) we don’t recommend it.</p>
<h3>Some minor issues</h3>
<p>There was plenty to like about the Mac Sports wagon. However, there were a couple of issues we noticed during testing.</p>
<p>The first and most significant issue is the tipping risk we noticed when carrying heavy loads, and loads that went more than two feet over the top of the wagon. More specifically, we found that the Mac Sports wagon would tip if we turned the wheels to a 90-degree angle and pulled moderately hard on the handle.</p>
<p>While not ideal, the solution to this is to simply be careful when carrying large loads in the wagon. The tipping risk is essentially non-existent when carrying lighter loads, and was only an issue when turning tight corners quickly. Our final assessment was that this is a minor issue and a fair trade-off for the improved turn radius of the wagon.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty Folding Wagon is a durable and versatile wagon that is both easy to use and efficient.</li>
<li>Large wheel treads make this the best beach wagon for pulling through sand and mud.</li>
<li>The design of the front wheels gives the wagon an exceptional turn radius while also somewhat reducing stability on sharp turns.</li>
<li>The wagon offers an excellent ratio of cargo capacity to folded size.</li>
</ul>

<p>When we started researching folding wagons, we weren’t aware of any brand that was synonymous with this particular niche market. While we still wouldn’t say that there is an overwhelming dominant brand for folding wagons, it became clear through our testing that Mac Sports knows what they are doing.</p>
<p>While the Mac Sports Heavy Duty Wagon was our top pick overall, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BUUUIGK/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac Sports &#8211; Utility Wagon</a> was a respectable runner-up for garden wagon use. While it doesn’t have the versatility of the heavy-duty variant, this wagon is a strong option for those who aren’t planning to travel over rougher terrain. That, in conjunction with a considerably lower price point, makes the Mac Sports Utility Wagon a strong contender for second place.</p>
<h3>Things we liked</h3>
<p>Many of the things we liked about the Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty are also present in this utility wagon. The durability was the most readily apparent of these, along with the telescoping handle. The cargo capacity for the Mac Sports wagon was impressive as well, with 3.62 cubic feet of cargo space inside the compartment itself (not including anything stacked above).</p>

Great for grocery shopping, tailgating and other light uses.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KQH575E/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>This wagon was also very easy to fold and unfold – much like its “big brother”.</p>
<p>The price was a significant factor as well. At the time of publishing this article, this wagon was about half the cost of the Heavy Duty variant (about $60 versus about $120). This is a significant difference, and those who are looking to save some money should absolutely consider this version before going for the heavy-duty variant.</p>
<h3>What we didn’t like</h3>
<p>Overall, this version of the Mac Sports wagon is worthy of serious consideration. However, the wheels are significantly less versatile when compared to our top pick. In addition, while Mac Sports does claim that the maximum weight is 150 pounds, we found that the wagon became fairly difficult to maneuver with about 80 pounds of cargo.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3991" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison.jpg" alt="wheel comparison" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Realistically, we wouldn’t want to transport more than 50 or 60 pounds in this wagon – except for short distances or when absolutely necessary. It will work with 100+ pounds of cargo, but it really shines at lower weights.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Mac Sports &#8211; Utility Wagon is a less expensive alternative to our top pick, the Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty Wagon.</li>
<li>The maximum useful weight capacity caps out at around 60 to 70 pounds.</li>
<li>This wagon is best suited for lighter functions, such as transporting groceries or as a garden wagon.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CTUGC5K/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Radio Flyer &#8211; 3-in-1 EZ Fold Wagon with Canopy</a> is the best wagon for big kids and littles spending a day at the park or at the mall. It doesn&#8217;t have all the rugged features of our other top picks, but the canopy and seat belts make it an easy win for parents.</p>
<p>Radio Flyer is an iconic brand in the world of wagons, so a successful new fold up wagon design needed to pass all our major tests in order to be worthy of the name. Fortunately, this is a great folding wagon for kids.</p>
<p>The 3-in-1 EZ Fold version of the folding Radio Flyer wagon comes with and without a canopy, or in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OD3EVDW/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">an &#8220;ultimate&#8221; model</a> with elevated seats to make long rides slightly more comfortable for kids older than two. The bigger seats make the bed of the wagon less versatile, though, and there&#8217;s a hefty price premium for a pretty limited improvement in comfort.</p>
<p>The lap belt restraints were just enough to keep our tester&#8217;s nine-month-old baby and three-year-old child seated on walks. It&#8217;s not a five-point harness, and if you&#8217;ve got a car seat around that will fit inside (like our top pick for <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-infant-car-seat/">best infant car seat</a>) that&#8217;s the best way to keep a curious baby from climbing out.</p>
<p>This was the only folding wagon we tested with a canopy, and it makes all the difference on a sunny summer day. When we tested during a 4th of July parade, we quickly found nearby friends scooting their folding chairs closer to take advantage of the shade.</p>

This wagon isn't quite as rugged as our top pick, but it's perfect for moving your kids and their stuff around.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CTUGC5K/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The canopy supports slide into the four corners of the wagon for folding or when you don&#8217;t want the obstruction, and the canopy itself neatly packs into a pocket on the back of the wagon. The folded size is about the same as other models we tested, quite a bit smaller and easier to pack in the car or van than a folded stroller.</p>
<p>Another unique attribute is that one side of the wagon bed unzips, turning your wagon into a bench. You wouldn&#8217;t want to pull it around with legs dangling, but if you&#8217;re parked (as we did at a parade) the bench mode is quite comfortable for three bigger kids who just need a place to sit.</p>

<p>The Radio Flyer isn&#8217;t as easy to roll around when folded as our top pick. And despite the advantages of a built-in canopy on a sunny day, we still prefer the Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty if you want to have your kids in the wagon while it&#8217;s going over surfaces that aren&#8217;t paved.</p>
<p>That said, the corner-mounted wheels on the Radio Flyer are more stable if you make a sharp turn while you&#8217;re moving quickly. That&#8217;s a safety benefit most parents will probably want to take.</p>
<p>If you really want to go all-in on a folding wagon for your kids, there are premium options available from companies like Keenz and Veer, but at prices around $400 or $600 these wagons aren&#8217;t offering much more than the Radio Flyer or the Mac Sports wagons. We&#8217;ve also tested the best double strollers, and they&#8217;re more economical and far more comfortable for everyone involved, though it is wider.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Radio Flyer lives up to the legacy of classic kid wagons with the two-seater <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CTUGC5K/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EZ Fold 3-in-1 with Canopy</a>.</li>
<li>A built-in canopy is quick to attach and provides great shade for summertime walks.</li>
<li>Maneuverability under load isn&#8217;t as good as the Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty.</li>
<li>The price is about the same as our beach wagon pick, so you&#8217;re trading big wheels for seatbelts and shade.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-others">Other finalists we tested</h2>
<p>The other three wagons performed the basic functions reasonable well. However, all three were the same price or more when compared to the Mac Sports duo – while also being less effective.</p>
<h3>Seina &#8211; Collapsible Folding Utility Wagon</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VPJLKXQ/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Seina</a> wagon is more or less comparable to the Mac Sports Utility Wagon, both in terms of size and wheel type. However, we found the material to feel notably less “premium”, and in fact the material started to fray a bit towards the end of our testing period.</p>
<p>At the time this article was published, the price of the Seina was about the same as the Mac Sports Utility Wagon, so if that’s your budget we think you’re better off with the Mac Sports wagon.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B011Q0CN48/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Creative Outdoors Wagon</a> is made from a durable fabric that is comparable to both versions of the Mac Sports Wagon. In addition, the heavy duty wheels were able to traverse sand and other rough terrain easily.</p>
<p>However, the maneuverability of this wagon was challenging, particularly when going up and down hills. At the time this article was published, the Creative Outdoor wagon was slightly more expensive than the Heavy Duty Mac Sports wagon. For the price, you’re much better off going with the Mac Sports version.</p>

<p>Since publishing our post, EasyGoProducts has released the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LR6G9KK/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EasyGoWagon 2.0</a> (which we did not test) and completely removed traces of their old wagon we tested from Amazon, but we&#8217;ll leave our notes below so you have an idea of our test results on version 1.0.</p>
<p>The EasyGoWagon 1.0 was the most expensive wagon we tested, and the most disappointing. The wheels on the EasyGoWagon made it difficult to traverse any terrain other than sidewalks and streets, and the material started to wear out about halfway through our testing period.</p>
<p>This wagon is stable, and the metal frame is certainly durable, but the overall experience of using this wagon simply did not justify the price – especially when there are better options for less money.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>

<p>Folding wagons are incredibly useful in a number of situations (they&#8217;re perfect for nearly all outdoor activities — some even like to use them as garden carts!), most will fit in the trunk of your car, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KQH575E/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty Wagon</a> is the best we tested. The durable materials used and the wide range of situations this wagon is capable of taking on makes its price point well-worth it in our opinion.</p>
<p>However, if you only need a lighter-duty wagon, the less expensive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BUUUIGK/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac Sports &#8211; Utility Wagon</a> can save you some money for a quick beach trip or picnic.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re a parent, the best wagon for kids (or pets!) is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CTUGC5K/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Radio Flyer – 3-in-1 EZ Fold Wagon with Canopy</a>. The canopy makes all the difference, whether you&#8217;re facing a blazing hot afternoon at the beach or a long walk in the rain.</p>
