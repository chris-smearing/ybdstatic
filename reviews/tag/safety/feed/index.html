				<description><![CDATA[After a month of research and four months of in-depth tests, we've picked the Contours - Options Elite as the best double stroller.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent a month researching and scoping out the best double strollers, personally inspecting more than 15 different models before picking our top three. After testing those three finalists for four months at parks, malls and on downtown walks, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J889IBQ/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contours &#8211; Options Elite</a> is our pick for a versatile stroller that can carry car seats and toddlers in style. There are reasons to consider the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06VWS5C94/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Britax &#8211; B-Agile</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N15BCSV/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Joovy &#8211; Caboose Too</a> as well, so check out the details below.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>Double strollers are a tricky category since the different types of strollers available have very different strengths and weaknesses. We spent a week searching forum posts, watching YouTube videos, and listening to podcasts to figure out what other parents love and hate about double strollers. We paid close attention to top picks from review sites like Baby Gear Lab, Wirecutter and Lucie’s List, and we hunted for negative reviews and accounts of long-term pain points.</p>
<p>By the end of our research, we had seventeen potential picks and we worked for another two weeks narrowing down the list. After looking at the core criteria, we settled on some <span style="font-weight: 400;">main features</span>.</p>
<h3>Compact folded size</h3>
<p>Many people who use doubles every day love jogging strollers because they&#8217;re easier to push and offer rugged durability. Popular joggers like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BSPDOQM/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">B.O.B. &#8211; Revolution</a> aren&#8217;t easy to fold and store, though, and right off the bat we eliminated any stroller that wouldn’t fit in the back of our tester&#8217;s compact car — a Toyota Corolla. If you&#8217;re driving something bigger maybe that isn&#8217;t as much of a concern, but if you&#8217;re driving around with two or more kids, you probably need all the cargo space you can get.</p>
<h3>Options for infants</h3>
<p>Umbrella strollers are compact when folded, but even the well-reviewed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0786PC3M5/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zoe XL2 double umbrella</a> (which we nearly tested) doesn&#8217;t recline far enough for infants. We did test one stroller that doesn&#8217;t have attachment options for carrying an infant car seat, but that model folds down to a very low angle to protect infant necks from flopping around. Umbrella strollers are also hard to push around and fold.</p>
<h3>Comfortable seating positions</h3>
<p>We settled on two tandem strollers and one side-by-side design for our testing group. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F5VQIE0/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">phil&amp;teds &#8211; Sport</a> (with an added second seat) is a well-reviewed stroller at a moderate price, but nobody we talked to actually liked using a stroller with the second seat so low to the ground.</p>
<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>This is where picking a &#8220;best&#8221; product gets tricky. Some will insist that the premium materials used on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KMYK367/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">UPPAbaby</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WLQG96K/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mountain Buggy</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073RZZ814/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bugaboo</a> strollers are well worth the price, but when we looked at the features we really needed and compared the strollers in person, we settled on a budget more of us can afford.</p>
<h3>Sensible design features</h3>
<p><b>We also paid close attention to tell-tale factors like weight ratings.</b> Many strollers give a weight rating for each seat, but on a side-by-side model, that&#8217;s really just half of the limit of the whole stroller&#8217;s weight capacity. The exceptions are strollers like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KMYK367/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">UPPAbaby &#8211; Vista</a>, which has a low limit in the front seat because all the weight is directly over the small front wheels (which have trouble swivelling with a bigger child in that seat). We also looked for comfort perks like adjustable handlebars and flip-flop-friendly brake releases.</p>
<p>After all that research, we sent our expecting double-dad with his three-year old and pregnant wife to local retailers to try every prospective stroller he could get his hands on (and to interrogate the staff about returns and warranties). After exhaustively comparing all the relevant stats, we settled on three top-ranked strollers that get you the features you need without breaking the bank.</p>
<h2 id="lineup">Compare the best double strollers</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20705" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/lineup.jpg" alt="Lineup of products" width="2000" height="1333" /><br />
[table id=221 /]
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Stroller width: </b>This measurement is a catch-22. Wider strollers are easier to turn, but they also may not fit through some passages or doors.</p>
<p><b>Folded size:</b> It&#8217;s important that you can actually take your stroller where you need it. If you haven&#8217;t bought a minivan yet, trunk space can get tight.</p>
<p><b>Wheel size:</b> A larger wheel rolls and swivels more easily, plus handles bumps better. They also make the stroller bulkier when folded.</p>
<p><b>Recline angle:</b> A stroller seat that reclines far enough can safely carry a newborn. Sources we checked list 30 to 45 degrees from horizontal as the maximum angle you should have your newborn sitting up.</p>
<p><b>Car carrier compatibility:</b> Not all car seats are compatible with all strollers. Generally speaking, if you&#8217;re buying from one of the bigger car seat manufacturers that also makes popular strollers, you don&#8217;t get any options for carrying other brands. Two of our picks have universal compatibility options.</p>
<p><b>Disney park stroller and wagon restrictions:</b> Since the spring of 2019, <a href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com/faq/parks/strollers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Disneyland and Disney World have specifically banned strollers bigger than 31 inches (79 cm) by 52 inches (132 cm)</a>. What&#8217;s more, no wagons or stroller wagons are permitted, even if they&#8217;re well within that size. </p>
<p>All the double strollers we&#8217;ve tested are technically approved, though the Britax B-Agile just barely squeaks through a 31-inch doorway; lots of reports say that it&#8217;s accepted by Disneyland staff, but it&#8217;s the tightest fit of the models we tested.</p>

<p><b>Stand-up fold position:</b> Some strollers will stand on their own when folded, which makes them less likely to fall over in front of your car when you&#8217;re parking in a small garage. Toddlers love climbing on parked strollers even when they&#8217;re folded, so storage hooks for hanging are still a good idea.</p>
<p><b>Flip-flop-friendly brakes:</b> This design allows you to both engage and disengage the parking brake lever with the downward motion of your foot, so you don&#8217;t have to use your toenails to take the brake off.</p>
<p><b>Strollers for toddler and infant</b><b>:</b> There are a few ways to optimize a stroller for tinies and bigs at the same time. All of our strollers feature dual full-sized seats, so two kids get the full stroller experience. Two of our picks also carry infant car seats. Other options when one of your kids gets bigger include a sit-and-stand or rear-facing bench configuration, where a bigger kid can ride in the back without needing to be lifted in and out of the seat for every single ride.</p>
<h2 id="stroller-types">Types of double strollers</h2>
<p><b>Tandem strollers: </b>Arrange the seats one behind the other. The biggest benefit to a tandem stroller is that it can be just as narrow as a single stroller: you can still fit through nearly all doorways and between parked cars. The downside, of course, is that they&#8217;re long. This makes the stroller more difficult to steer, and can even make turning some corners quite difficult. You won&#8217;t have as much trouble fitting down the aisle at the pharmacy, but you may not be able to make the turn at the end.</p>
<p><b>Side-by-side strollers: </b>This style has seats arranged next to each other, so they&#8217;re as short in wheelbase as a single stroller but much wider. The big benefit to this arrangement is that they&#8217;re easy to turn: our side-by-side pick can be spun in a circle with one hand. The wide wheelbase means that you may have trouble fitting through some doors or walkways, though.</p>
<p><b>Double jogging strollers: </b>This is a specialized variety of the side-by-side type. Jogging doubles have big bicycle-style wheels, locking front steering wheels for coasting without wobbles, and safety brakes that activate automatically if you let go of the stroller. The big wheels are a benefit any time you&#8217;re pushing, especially on rough terrain, but these strollers are harder to fold and transport in a car (they don&#8217;t even fit in some SUV hatchbacks). We didn&#8217;t test any jogging strollers, though many of our friends are &#8220;B.O.B. snobs&#8221; who wouldn&#8217;t go back to a regular stroller unless you forced them.</p>
<h2>Strollers vs. wagons</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re in the market for a double stroller because you have too much stuff to carry, you should also check out our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-folding-wagon/">review of the best folding wagons</a>. We&#8217;ve compared the popular models that come in at less than $400 (sorry, Keenz and Veer fans) and found that they&#8217;re good at different things than a stroller is.</p>
<p>The big question when comparing a wagon and a stroller is how long your kids will be riding at a time. If you just need to get your kids (and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-diaper-bags/">a diaper bag</a>, and a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-beach-umbrella-chair-tent/">beach chair and pop-up shelter</a> and a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-lunch-box/">small cooler</a> on top of all that) down to the beach, wagons are amazing. Wagons are less helpful if you want to quickly click in an <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-infant-car-seat/">infant car seat</a> and walk around the mall for an hour or more.</p>

This wagon isn't as maneuverable as a stroller, but it's perfect for hauling extra stuff around.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CTUGC5K/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Comfort is also a trade-off: Strollers are unquestionably more comfortable for kids to sit in for a long period of time when they&#8217;re strapped in and you&#8217;re walking, but kids have less room to wiggle or lie down. A wagon like the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CTUGC5K/?tag=ybdwagn-20">Radio Flyer &#8211; 3-in-1</a> is like a combination between a bassinet and a rolling bench, and it folds to a more compact size than even a single stroller.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Our lead tester cycled through these strollers for four months of day-to-day use with his three-year-old and newborn. Each stroller went to parks, festivals, on walks to the library, and car trips out of town. We tried to find the worst situations for each stroller, and we also consulted with other testers who owned the same strollers or similar strollers to find long-term pain points.</p>
<h3>Mobility and accessibility</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Britax-turningloop.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We wheeled these strollers over all kinds of urban terrain, from muddy parks to busy malls. Broken sidewalks, cobbles and curbs all revealed the difference in ride quality you get with larger wheels and spring suspension.</p>
<p>It quickly became clear, once we had walked the strollers on the same paths, that wider wheels make for better maneuverability. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06VWS5C94/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Britax &#8211; B-Agile Double Stroller</a> is so easy to turn, it&#8217;s almost a game. The weight is evenly balanced over the wheels, and the adjustable handlebar means short or tall parents don&#8217;t have to hunch or curl their arms awkwardly.</p>
<p>In comparison, the tandem-configuration strollers we tried became more difficult to steer the narrower they got. The biggest difference with a narrow stroller is a feeling of instability, like you&#8217;re going to push the stroller over instead of making a tight turn.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a trade-off to make, of course. <b>A wider stroller won&#8217;t always fit where you need to go.</b> If you arrive at a hotel room with two screaming kids and your stroller doesn&#8217;t fit through the door until you unload everything and fold it, you might start crying, too.</p>
<h3>Kid comfort</h3>
<p>The biggest impact on kid comfort in a stroller is definitely personal space. If you&#8217;re looking for a narrow tandem-style design so you can fit through tight doorways, you&#8217;re turning your stroller into a tiny two-seat version of an airplane cabin. If the front seat reclines, the kid in the back will feel it. That said, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J889IBQ/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contours &#8211; Options Elite</a> gives a good amount of legroom for a tandem, and its seats give more headroom for taller kids than the Britax does.</p>
<h3>Folding and storage</h3>

<p>Not everyone who needs a double stroller will need to fit it in the back of a small car, but many of us do. Even if you&#8217;re driving a minivan while sightseeing on a road trip, a compact fold can be the difference between enjoying your stroller and wishing you&#8217;d left it at home.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N15BCSV/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Joovy &#8211; Caboose Too Ultralight</a> is a long, skinny, flat package when folded, and technically takes up the least volume. The Britax scores points here, though, because while it takes up more height and depth there&#8217;s room to slide a carry-on suitcase beside the folded stroller.</p>
<p>Folding the Contours (pictured above in the trunk of a Toyota Corolla) you have a similar footprint to the Joovy, but in some configurations you&#8217;ll have to take one seat off before you load it in a small trunk so you don&#8217;t run out of height.<br />
[table id=222 /]
<h3>Versatility</h3>
<p>All of these strollers offer various options. If one of your babies is already three years old and you have a newborn on the way, you may not need a seat for your oldest very often. A stroller like the Joovy &#8211; Caboose Too is perfect for this scenario, with any combination of a car seat cradle, two forward-facing seats, a bench seat, and standing platform.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got two infants of the same size and want to keep them both in car seat carriers while you go for a stroll, Contours easily wins this category. Joovy only handles one car seat with the Caboose platform, and Britax has discontinued car seat adapters altogether. Contours also allows you to re-orient the seats to face any way you want.<br />

<p>The flexibility of its seating positions makes the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J889IBQ/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contours &#8211; Options Elite</a> the best double stroller for twins. It handles beautifully compared to other tandem strollers in this price range, with bigger wheels and a wide wheelbase to make rolling and turning easier.</p>
<p>Unlike other strollers that prioritize one seat over the other, the Options Elite uses identical seats in both positions. You can also add car seat adapters in either position, with click-in adapters available for all of the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-infant-car-seat/">best infant car seats we tested</a>. Note that because of seat size, some pairs of car seats may only fit in certain orientations.</p>
<p>The fact that these seats can be installed to face each other was a huge highlight of our testing time. There&#8217;s opportunity for fighting siblings to torment each other this way, of course, but changing to facing-away mode is just as quick and simple.</p>

The seats can dock in any position, and the quality is great for the price. Bigger wheels make the ride quality good, too, though this stroller is slightly trickier to fit in a small trunk.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J889IBQ/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Everything about the Contours stroller is a little bit nicer than the other models we tested, but list price is $399, only a third the cost of a premium stroller like the UPPAbaby &#8211; Vista.</p>
<p>The wheels on the Contours are already quite large for its class, which is part of what makes this stroller roll smoothly. Unfortunately, those 10-inch baller rims also make this stroller tricky to fit in your trunk. The seats also won&#8217;t let you fully fold this stroller if you have them in certain positions or recline angles.</p>
<p>You can easily pop the wheels and seats off if needed, and we could usually figure out a way to adjust the seats or wheels to make this stroller still fit in our tester&#8217;s Corolla with everything attached. Forget about fitting anything else bulky in the trunk at the same time, though.</p>
<p>The one other caveat with wheels is that the rear wheels stick out wider than the rest of the stroller. If you&#8217;ve ever owned a stroller with this design feature, you&#8217;ve probably got the rear wheel stuck on a tight doorway. It&#8217;s a minor complaint, since the wider wheelbase goes a long way to making turning more stable, but it&#8217;s something you should be aware of when comparing strollers.</p>

<p>The other minor sticking point on this stroller is the fold-release lock. While the folding action is smooth and works well, the multitude of possible seat positions means the lock that keeps the stroller folded isn&#8217;t a tight fit the way the locks on the other two strollers are. The amount of wiggle room makes it slightly more difficult to disengage the lock while you&#8217;re unfolding, and if you try to pull the stroller apart after the lock accidentally re-engages enough times, you could break it.</p>

<p>Unlike the Joovy, the Contours doesn&#8217;t come with a snack tray. If you want to buy accessories, though, you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GP8ZZF2/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">add a tray to both seats</a>, unlike the Joovy which doesn&#8217;t have an option for the rear seat.</p>
<p>The seats themselves are also loaded with features. The recline mechanism allows each seat to go all the way down to 25 degrees above flat — not as far as the Britax, but lower than the recline of most car seats. The leg rests are also adjustable and the built-in canopies are bigger than average. The zip-open mesh &#8220;peekaboo&#8221; panel on the canopy is a nice touch, too.</p>
<p>Another great feature of the Contours is the storage basket. It&#8217;s big and easy to get into in most configurations. Even if you&#8217;ve got a kid&#8217;s legs obstructing your access from the back, there&#8217;s a side access option.</p>
<p><b>When you&#8217;ve got the stroller unfolded and ready to go, this is a dream ride compared to the Joovy.</b> It rolls and turns more easily because of the wide wheelbase and the more balanced weight distribution — not as easy to turn as the Britax side-by-side, but it&#8217;s good for a tandem stroller.</p>
<p>The most obvious reason to pick this stroller is if you want to use two car seats at once. Even if you just want to use one car seat, click-in adapters for all the different car seat brands make this stroller nicer to use than the Joovy.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Contours &#8211; Options Elite gives you more seating options: each seat can be mounted forward or rear-facing.</li>
<li>Adapters available to click-in most car seats in either position.</li>
<li>This tandem design makes a good compromise between easy pushing and narrow width.</li>
<li>This is the biggest stroller we tested when folded, but it still fits in a compact car trunk.</li>
<li>Full-featured reclining seats with room to grow.</li>
<li>More expensive than our other picks, though still very competitive with other brands offering the same features.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Joovy &#8211; Caboose Too Ultralight is based on the popular Joovy Caboose sit-and-stand stroller, with the addition of a snap-in extra rear seat. It&#8217;s a very popular stroller in either configuration. <b>The flexibility and value are the real stand-out selling points: if your babies are spaced more than a year apart, this stroller will grow with them.</b></p>
<p>For mounting a carrier like the ones we tested in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-infant-car-seat/">car seat review</a>, Joovy&#8217;s built-in system uses the side-rails and a front-mounted neoprene cradle for the front of the car seat. There are two straps stored permanently in side pockets so you can cinch the car seat down tight. The way the strap is attached to the buckle makes finding the right length more difficult than it could have been, but it won&#8217;t loosen accidentally.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve got twins, the Joovy is a great stroller as soon as they can sit up. Even with older twins, the bench configuration offers enough leg room to get a year or two more of use when the rear forward-facing seat is too cramped.</p>
<p>With an older toddler and a baby sibling, the space offered in the forward-facing back seat is just big enough for a three-year-old like E.J., the blondie in our pictures. <b>Joovy designed this stroller so you&#8217;ll probably hit the 80-pound weight limit before they outgrow the legroom.</b> The canopy is taller than most, too, at more than 24 inches above the base of the front seat.</p>
<p>Unlike taller convertible tandems like the Contours, the Joovy lets you move a heavier child to the rear seat (so you can still steer the front wheels) without having to lift them so high off the ground.</p>

<p>This stroller is identical to the regular <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BMAW0M2/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Joovy &#8211; Caboose Ultralight</a> except for the addition of the snap-in rear seat. Once your oldest is too big for the constraints of the rear seat, converting to Joovy&#8217;s signature rear-facing bench seat is simple. <b>In a few more years, it&#8217;s just as easy to slide the bench forward so an older kid (or two, if they&#8217;re light enough) can hitch a ride by standing on the platform.</b></p>
<p>The flexibility of the Caboose Too is its strongest suit. Long after other doubles are uselessly small, you&#8217;ll still be able to throw your library books or groceries in the basket and give a seven-year-old an occasional break from walking while a four-year-old naps in the front.</p>

<p>Folding and unfolding the Joovy is very similar to other tandem strollers. The trickiest part is figuring out how to stand so you can pull the outside pieces of the frame together; if your arms are long enough, you can stand at the back and grab the front tray or seat and just pull it toward you.</p>
<p>Fitting this stroller into storage or the back of a compact car is a cinch. <b>We looked long and hard to find another tandem that&#8217;s as compact, and we have yet to find one.</b> The Joovy lies flat in your trunk so you can fit groceries and backpacks on top, but it will take up most of the width.</p>
<p>That said, if you&#8217;d rather have a stroller take up nearly the full height of two-thirds of your trunk but still have room for a carry-on suitcase beside it, the Britax side-by-side is what you want.</p>
<p>When it&#8217;s folded, the Joovy doesn&#8217;t stand on its own. With the brake on it&#8217;s stable leaning against a wall, and you can also wheel it around in the folded configuration if you leave the brake off. It&#8217;s also the lightest full-function stroller we found and you may prefer to carry it around.</p>

It's a real upgrade over other budget tandems, but it's still affordable. The light frame and narrow wheelbase make this easy to handle and store when folded, but it's also more robust and versatile than an umbrella-fold double. If your kids are three years apart, the modes on offer here are practically perfect.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N15BCSV/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>For twins, there&#8217;s no way to attach two infant car seats to this stroller or fully recline both seats. You could still use the front position with a carrier in the universal-fit cradle while you carry a twin in a baby carrier, but if you&#8217;re expecting twins that&#8217;s probably not what you had in mind from a double stroller. Contours and Britax are both much better choices if you&#8217;ve got two babies who can&#8217;t sit up yet.</p>
<p>Our long-term tester, A.A., says maneuverability is her biggest complaint. You can&#8217;t steer this stroller with one hand, and it&#8217;s tricky with tight corners. &#8220;I knew this going in,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and as much as it bothers me from time to time, I put up with it to have a relatively small double stroller.&#8221;</p>
<p>The four-wheel suspension doesn&#8217;t work nearly as well as Joovy would like you to think. When you roll over cobblestones or uneven sidewalks, you&#8217;ll definitely feel it. It&#8217;s better than some umbrella strollers, but doesn&#8217;t compare well to the suspension systems used by bigger strollers we tested.</p>
<p>A.A. also notes that the open-cell foam used for padding the handle does pick up perfumed scents from the hands of anyone who uses the stroller.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Joovy &#8211; Caboose Too Ultralight is a flexible and affordable double stroller.</li>
<li>When folded, this is a very light and compact package.</li>
<li>A stroller that grows with your family, from the birth of your second child until you don&#8217;t need a stroller anymore.</li>
<li>The front seat reclines down low, though it gets into the space of the back seat.</li>
<li>This isn&#8217;t an option for infant twins, since the back seat has limited recline.</li>
<li>With a long, skinny wheelbase, this is not a maneuverable stroller.</li>
<li>If your kids are spaced further apart than three years, skip the second seat and just get the regular Caboose Ultralight.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-side-by-side">Best side-by-side: Britax &#8211; B-Agile</h2>
<p>The Britax &#8211; B-Agile Double is a classic take on a side-by-side design. It&#8217;s light, easy to fold and pack, and easy to maneuver. If you can manage your infant (or twins) without a travel-system attachment for your car seat, this our pick for best side-by-side double stroller.</p>
<p>The Britax is the easiest to maneuver out of our three picks. The handlebar height quickly adjusts to make things easier for parents who are shorter or taller than the average, and you can turn this stroller on a dime. It also has a 100-pound weight limit, 20 than most strollers in this price bracket.</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Britax-Folding.mov" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The only downside to the short wheelbase is that this stroller is wide. It&#8217;s one of the narrower side-by-side designs we looked at, at only 31 inches, so it&#8217;ll fit through any doorway that complies with the 32-inch Americans with Disabilities Act standard for accessible design. That&#8217;s not every door everywhere, but it&#8217;s most of them. We ran into trouble at a hotel in San Diego when we found out that our room had a 29-inch doorway.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a full 10 inches wider than the Joovy, so on a narrow sidewalk or in a crowded store aisle you could find yourself obstructing other people, but at least you&#8217;ll be able to turn around easily if you get stuck.</p>
<p>Reclining the Britax means loosening the support strap that holds up the backrest, like on many strollers. The Britax uses two straps, which probably makes the seat stronger than the seats which use plastic gears at the attachment point, but you have to hook your finger through two loops when you&#8217;re pulling. It&#8217;s not a bad seat design, but the other seats are quicker to adjust with one hand.</p>

It's wider than our other picks, but the great features make this an amazing value. If there were still car seat adapters available, this stroller would be nearly perfect. Don't worry, the seats recline very low so you can still stroll with a newborn.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06VWS5C94/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<h3>Car seat adapters and recalls</h3>
<p>The elephant in the room with this stroller is the car seat adapter. Britax used to make one that works as a click-in docking system with their own car seats, and also a universal strap-down cradle. Then there was a recall.</p>
<p>The recall reports are pretty shocking: The car seat attachment adapters were totally exposed and sticking out when the stroller is folded, and became unreliable after they were damaged by dropping or sliding around in car trunks. Car seats fell off of strollers.</p>
<p><b>Britax issued a replacement part with a safety strap that should prevent them from detaching, but you can&#8217;t buy any of these parts in North America.</b> The attachment point is still part of the frame, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00QCCG2UW/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EU version of the B-Agile adapter</a> is still sold over there. Britax HQ says that the <a href="https://www.britax-roemer.com/safetynotice-clickgo-adapters/SafetyNotice-ClickGo-Adapters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">car seats used in the EU are &#8220;totally different,&#8221;</a> and they aren&#8217;t concerned.</p>
<p>If you really want to attach a car seat to a side-by-side stroller like this, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019W8W8KA/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baby Jogger &#8211; City Mini Double</a> works the same way the old Britax system did. Baby Jogger has also <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2013/Baby-Jogger-Recalls-Car-Seat-Adaptors-for-Strollers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recalled some of their strollers and car seat adapters</a> over unrelated issues, though you can buy the replacement versions.</p>
<p>If you can find the safe updated version of the Britax adapter, or you decide to shell out the extra cash to buy the Baby Jogger and get more car seat compatibility (for Graco, Cybex, and Maxi Cozi car seats), think twice before resting a Costco box on top of them in your trunk. These bits of plastic are going to bear the entire weight of your child and car seat.</p>
<h3>Other features</h3>
<p>The adjustable handlebar on the Britax is a pretty great perk that even the Baby Jogger &#8211; City Mini Double doesn&#8217;t have. In addition to more comfort for short or tall parents when strolling, it also allows you to position the handlebar so that the stroller can stand up when it&#8217;s folded. That makes this the only free-stander from our top picks.</p>
<p>The brake release on the Britax doesn&#8217;t really qualify as flip-flop-friendly, but it&#8217;s close. The pedal is large and easy to release. There aren&#8217;t sharp edges, either, so our testers didn&#8217;t feel like it was a problem when wearing sandals.</p>
<p>The mesh panel windows with cover flaps are a great way to keep an eye on what&#8217;s happening down below the canopy, and make it easy to take a peek when your baby is taking a nap inside the snug little cave created by the fully reclined seat.</p>
<p>These seats are very nice and roomy, right up until your child is too tall. The back measures 18 inches from seat to the start of the canopy: an older kid (like O.M. in the image above) can still ride on the stroller, but leaning against the edge of the canopy is barely more comfortable than the bench seat on the Joovy.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06VWS5C94/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Britax &#8211; B-Agile Double Stroller</a> lives up to its name, and is the easiest stroller to push without spending more than $400.</li>
<li>This side-by-side design won&#8217;t fit through 30-inch doorways, but otherwise it&#8217;s good to go.</li>
<li>A square-ish folded shape makes this even easier to fit in a trunk than a long-but-narrow tandem.</li>
<li>The Britax is 20% lighter than the closest competing side-by-side, and half the price.</li>
<li>The seats are shorter, but this stroller easily carries more weight than the others we tested.</li>
<li>An adjustable handlebar makes this great for parents who fight over how tall things should be.</li>
<li>Recline angle goes very low for newborns, but Britax has discontinued all car seat attachments for this model.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>We researched dozens of strollers and spent four months testing our top picks, and it&#8217;s tricky to say that any one stroller is going to be the very best for everybody. But we&#8217;ve got three great strollers that are a good value and have specific perks that could make them the best stroller for you.</p>
<p>The Contours &#8211; Options Elite gives you, like the name says, options. You can get this much seating flexibility in other convertible strollers that cost more, but we like that Contours has balanced the seat placement specifically to make it a good double stroller. The wheels are big enough to give a smooth ride, but they don&#8217;t stop you from fitting the folded stroller in your trunk.</p>
<p>If you have an older child and a baby, the Joovy &#8211; Caboose Too Ultralight will synchronize better with your needs than nearly any other stroller. Even after your older child is too big for the removable rear seat, Joovy has you covered with a bench seat and a running board. Joovy&#8217;s strap-down car seat cradle system doesn&#8217;t give you snap-in compatibility, but you won&#8217;t have to worry about finding adapters.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t care about car seats at all, Britax has you covered with the truly easy-to-push B-Agile Double. Extra perks like low-recline seats and adjustable handlebar height make this a very tough competitor to beat. It&#8217;s also the most compact double stroller in the trunk, and very light if you need to carry it.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e took four top-rated car seats and asked six experienced parents to size them up. After two months of testing and a thorough debrief, our team picked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BRQWV8H/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Britax &#8211; B-Safe Ultra</a> as the best infant car seat. Easy-to-use installation and harness adjustment features make this a great seat to work with and you get extra installation flexibility with European-style shoulder belt routing. If you&#8217;re looking for advanced crash protection features, the Britax is no slouch, but we also like the compact <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VHVID1O/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cybex &#8211; Aton2</a> for its extra features.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Shopping for car seats can be a nightmare. The number of brands is staggering and they all seem to be offering different approaches to keep your baby safe.</p>
<p>We spent three weeks checking reviews from the top baby product test websites, like Wirecutter, Consumer Reports and BabyGearLab. Some of the models mentioned in those reviews have been replaced with new designs, so we talked to retail associates at two local BuyBuyBaby stores and looked at video coverage from baby product trade shows.</p>
<p><strong>We honed in on the $200 price bracket as the best value.</strong> If you spend $180–230 you can get some premium features that trickle down from more expensive seats. Spending more than that doesn&#8217;t seem to get you more features than the Britax has, while the sacrifices you make at a lower price point are pretty big losses in convenience.</p>
<p>The features we prioritized when shopping were all related to daily use: adjusting the fit of the harness, moving the seat from one car to another, and using the seat &#8220;bucket&#8221; without its base (like you would in a taxi or Uber).</p>
<p>We compiled a list of 15 car seats and inspected them in-store before purchasing our test lineup. We also checked Amazon buyer reviews and looked for recall notices.</p>
<h2 id="lineup">Compare the best infant car seats</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20460" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Lineup.jpg" alt="lineup of seats" width="2000" height="1333" /><br />
[table id=217 /]
<h2 id="who-needs-this">Who needs an infant car seat?</h2>
<p>Put simply, if you want to move a baby in a car, you need a purpose-built car seat. <strong>If you&#8217;ve done your planning for delivery day, you&#8217;ve probably already found out that hospitals and birth centers won&#8217;t let you take a baby home unless you have an approved infant car seat.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to plan ahead and make sure you buy and know how to install your car seat a few months before your due date. You don&#8217;t want to be caught off guard if baby arrives early!</p>
<p>There are two main qualifications for a seat that will protect a newborn. First, the car seat has to be rear-facing (and in the back seat). In a crash, the force of baby&#8217;s weight has to be spread out along the padded back of the seat, not just into the straps. Most states require rear-facing seats for the first two years, and many safety experts advise keeping your kids rear-facing for as long as possible.</p>
<p>Second, the seat has to recline quite low, but not too low. Official specs range from 35 to 40 degrees incline. Recline is necessary so a newborn’s head won&#8217;t just flop down onto their chest, but if it’s too low the momentum in a crash would just go into the shoulder straps instead of the back of the seat.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible to move your baby to a less-reclined seat once they have enough neck strength, but typically a baby won&#8217;t be able to sleep comfortably sitting up — most people keep the reclined position until their baby is too big for an infant car seat.</p>

<strong>Extra crash-protection features:</strong> Most car seats will make claims about design considerations that specifically go above and beyond the baseline crash test performance allowed under federal regulations. Sorting through these claims, and linking up claims with tested results, is tricky at best.</p>
<p><strong>Installation aids:</strong> The more readily apparent benefits come from systems that make securing your car seat to the anchors in your car quick and simple. Clips and belt-paths are color coded, and safety labels point out exactly what to do for an installation. Most seats in the same price bracket have comparable features, but not all are created equal.</p>
<p><strong>Options for no-base installs:</strong> If you find yourself taking a car seat in a taxi, Uber or your mom&#8217;s car, will you be able to secure the carrier without the base? European standards include the option to wrap the shoulder belt around the front of the carrier for easier and more secure installs — you never know when you may need it.</p>
<p><strong>Seat size and adjustment:</strong> Most parents don&#8217;t know exactly how big their baby is when they buy a car seat, so it&#8217;s important to have a seat that can fit a range of heights. It should also be easy to adjust the seat straps to grow with your baby.</p>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> If you leave the car seat installed in a car all the time, this may not be a critical feature. But if you&#8217;re lugging one of these carriers around for extended periods of time, you may appreciate saving a few pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Materials:</strong> All the big car seat manufacturers target parents with exclusive materials and patterns. We didn&#8217;t find anything ultra-luxe like flame-retardant-free wool in the $200 price bracket we tested.</p>
<h2 id="crash-testing">A word about crash tests</h2>
<p>Crash test results are an interesting wrinkle in car seat safety. The National Highway Transportation Safety Agency (NHTSA) has rules about minimum car seat protection and they test car seats extensively to help make every seat on the road safe, but many car seat manufacturers claim safety features that aren&#8217;t related to the core set of crash test measurements.</p>
<p>After running a four-year pilot study, the NHTSA determined that &#8220;<a href="https://one.nhtsa.gov/Laws-&amp;-Regulations/Child-Passenger-Safety/Regulations-Safety-Standards-and-Safety-Rating-Program-for-Child-Restraint-Systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a rating program based on simulated crashes would not provide practicable, readily understandable, or meaningful information to consumers.</a>&#8221; Thus, if you see a safety &#8220;rating&#8221; on a car seat at a retailer or in a review, it&#8217;s not based on a standardized test that&#8217;s recognized by the NHTSA.</p>
<p>Review publications like Consumer Reports have chosen to run crash tests themselves. These tests are looking at factors outside the scope of federal regulations to see if they can find differences between car seats. An example is side-impact testing: some review tests are designed to show an absolute worst-case scenario of a vehicle sliding sideways at 30 miles per hour and colliding with a stationary object exactly on the door next to a car seat installed in a side seat.</p>
<p>Nobody&#8217;s saying that side-impact performance isn&#8217;t something worth paying attention to, but you should spend more time reading an instruction manual and finding a way to install your car seat in a center seat than you do combing through crash test results.</p>
<p><strong>Learn about how the anchors in your car and attachment systems on your car seat work together to make a tight, secure installation.</strong> That, and driving safely, are the best things you can do to protect your children.</p>
<p>The NHTSA does <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/car-seats-and-booster-seats/clasificaciones-de-facilidad-de-uso" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provide a rating on how easy a car seat is to use</a>. They look at instruction manuals, installation features, labels and harness restraints. We tested four car seats for ourselves, and the official scores line up closely with our assessment.</p>
<h2 id="convertible-car-seats">What about a convertible car seat?</h2>
<p>A convertible car seat makes sense in a lot of ways. You buy just one seat and can use it in different positions for years — maybe even until your child is tall enough to use a seat belt without a booster.</p>
<p>A convertible can replace three different car seats and that&#8217;s a big money saver. You also get all the safety benefits of a larger seat, and if you want to spend money on premium features you only have to spend it once.</p>

<p><strong>The downside, though, is literally huge.</strong> The back of a convertible is so tall that when it&#8217;s reclined in rear-facing mode for an infant, it takes up a lot of extra room. In anything but a minivan, it&#8217;s a tricky fit.</p>
<p>In our experience, this even makes it difficult to get convertibles to recline far enough for use with newborns. Unless your vehicle has legroom to spare, a dedicated infant car seat makes far more sense for the first year.</p>
<p>Once your baby is big enough to sit in a more upright rear-facing position that won&#8217;t take up all your legroom, these tall-back designs make a lot more sense. You&#8217;re usually ready for this shift when your baby is one year old, but follow manufacturer instructions about height and weight limits.</p>
<p>If your family is continuing to grow, separate infant, toddler and booster seats can be a good way to get the most value out of your purchases. <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-booster-car-seat/">Check out our review of forward-facing booster seats for big kids here</a>.</p>

<p>We asked a team of five moms and one dad to try out these car seats. They compared ease of installation and fit with their babies, plus we tested each of these car seats with our universally-compatible double strollers.</p>
<p>We installed the carriers in cars with and without bases, and our lead tester&#8217;s family used them all to carry B.J. — a chunky-monkey little newborn — during shopping trips and outings for two months.</p>
<h3>Installation of the car seats</h3>
<h3>[table id=216 /]</h3>
<p>For testing, we installed car seats in four different vehicles: a compact sedan, minivan and two SUVs. Obviously, the more space between the seats, the easier installation was. The &#8220;Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children&#8221; (LATCH) system is a nearly universal standard that makes attaching seats pretty similar across vehicles.</p>
<p>There are some perks and quirks that differentiate each system, but our biggest takeaway is that you should get a car seat with some easy-to-use tension aid for secure installation. The Cybex is a good example, with a giant tensioning lever that makes sure the belt or latch strap is extra tight without all the knee-on-seat gymnastics you&#8217;d need to get the same results with some other systems.</p>
<p><strong>In comparison, the basic strap-mounted tensioner that Graco uses on all their seats requires too much work to get tight, and even more work to remove.</strong> Our lead tester has used that system on four different infant seats and convertibles, and he&#8217;s ready for this bare-bones style of LATCH strap to just disappear.</p>
<p>All the car seats we checked provide a mechanism for leveling out the base when on an angled car seat, and they all provided a nearly identical degree of adjustment. Sadly, many cars have seat padding that&#8217;s even more dramatic than these systems account for and you may still find yourself adding rolled up receiving blankets, towels or pieces of pool noodle under the car seat base to help level it out.</p>
<h3>Length and leg room</h3>

Installing a car seat in the back also often means losing some leg room in the front; about the only way to get around that is to drive a minivan. We checked the length of the seats in a few different positions, and found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VHVID1O/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cybex &#8211; Aton2</a> gives you the most space.<br />
When resting on level ground as in the photo above, the Britax has a slight edge over the Chicco, but if you adjust the recline angle for a newborn the difference basically disappears.</p>
<h3>Installation without a base</h3>
<p>This is where the better seats start to distinguish themselves. Britax and Cybex both provide a &#8220;euro-style&#8221; belt path. This means that if you&#8217;re installing the car seat with a three-point retractable shoulder belt, you can actually wrap the shoulder belt around the front of the seat and use the retracting mechanism to make it more secure.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in a situation where you have the car seat and not the base, this extra level of security is a big deal. H-clip accessories (provided with the Chicco and Graco) can help make a conventional belt path more secure, but most of us will struggle holding everything in place to get the belt tight. The wrap-around installation is even more secure and much easier to do by yourself.</p>
<h3>Fit and tension of harness</h3>
<h3>[table id=215 /]</h3>
<p>All of the models we tested except for the older Graco have a front-adjusting harnesses. On basic models like the Graco &#8211; Snugride 30, you have to adjust the fit of the harness from the underside of the seat, which is awkward at best. Graco has addressed this with a front adjustment on the Snuglock 30.</p>
<p>Once you move up to a quick-release tension system with an adjustment strap in the front, it&#8217;s easy to tighten and loosen the harness every time you take baby in the car. Just pull the &#8220;tail&#8221; of the harness with one hand while you check for fit with your other hand. Releasing tension to make unbuckling easier was simple for all of these systems.</p>
<p>The other adjustment that you&#8217;ll need to make periodically, though, is harness height. Straps should always start at a level just below your baby&#8217;s shoulders to pull them down into the bottom of the seat.</p>

<p><strong>Britax is the only manufacturer we found that sells a seat with a no-rethread harness in this price bracket.</strong> When your baby hits a growth spurt, that lets you quickly and easily adjust shoulder harness height without having to take apart the seat.</p>
<p>Rethreading isn&#8217;t very difficult if you read the directions carefully and pay attention to which slot you&#8217;re coming from and which slot you&#8217;re moving to — but it takes time and you have to take your baby out of the carseat. Any feature that helps you keep up and stay sane is well worth considering.</p>
<h3>Weight and age range</h3>
<p>How do you know when your baby is too big for a car seat? This is one of the tricky parts of purchasing your car seat: you may not even know your baby&#8217;s sex when you purchase a car seat, let alone how tall they&#8217;ll be at six months of age.</p>
<p>Weight and height ranges are prominent in the specs for these car seats, but in almost every case you&#8217;ll find that the reason you have to stop using a carseat is that your child&#8217;s torso is too tall, regardless of how short their legs may be.</p>
<p>We checked the car seats for &#8220;seat back length&#8221; in the chart above by measuring along the back-board where your baby&#8217;s spine rests, from the bottom of the seat to the rim of the seat. Note that manufacturers typically consider a seat too small when your baby&#8217;s head comes up to an inch before the head comes up to the top of the back-board part of the seat.</p>
<p>Legs can stick out of a carseat without any issues, but if the head is within an inch of the top level of the carseat, your baby is growing up fast and ready for a bigger car seat.</p>
<p>The other factor to consider is the width of the cushions included. The Cybex &#8211; Aton2 has the biggest, fluffiest cushions and the second-narrowest &#8220;bucket,&#8221; which makes it the best fit for tiny babies. One of our testers, A.M., seemed entirely too small in the Graco and Chicco.</p>
<h3>Stroller compatibility</h3>
<p>Sadly, this is an area where combinations of strollers and car seats are either fine or not good at all.</p>
<p>We looked at compatibility across all the major stroller and car seat brands, and there&#8217;s a pattern: the strollers from big-name manufacturers like Britax, Graco and Chicco just don&#8217;t work with other car seat brands.</p>
<p><strong>If you want compatibility with a stroller that doesn&#8217;t come from your car seat manufacturer, there are still options.</strong> A few third-party stroller manufacturers like Joovy and Contours have done a good job of providing universal fit adapters: this means you can put nearly any car seat into a cradle and strap it down securely.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers also provide click-in compatibility with adapters for a wide range of brand compatibility. It&#8217;s not free, but it gives you all the convenience of a made-to-fit travel system. One of the top picks in our review of the best double strollers, the Contours &#8211; Options Elite, makes adapters to fit all major car seats.</p>

<p>Picking a winner from this group of award-winning car seats was actually easier than we thought it would be. After comparing all of the features and using the car seats, our testers nearly all said the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BRQWV8H/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Britax &#8211; B-Safe Ultra</a> is the car seat they&#8217;d choose to take home.</p>
<p>The Britax is a bit bigger than the others we tested. At 11.5 pounds, it&#8217;s the heaviest, and at 26.5 inches it&#8217;s the longest carrier front to back. We didn&#8217;t have trouble fitting it in our tester&#8217;s Corolla, though, even in a side seat behind the driver. Yes, there was more leg room with the Cybex, but when it&#8217;s in the base the Britax is slightly shorter than the Chicco despite giving more room to grow.</p>
<p>The Britax seat is also the deepest when measured from the bottom to top where your baby&#8217;s back will rest, so there&#8217;s more room to grow before you need to move up to a bigger seat.</p>
<p>Installing the B-Safe base is a breeze. Coming from three years of using various Graco seats with fiddly strap-mounted tensioners, one tester admired the way Britax lets you pull on two independant LATCH straps directly. This gives a little bit more control and feedback than tying them together in a single pull-strap, like Chicco does, or forcing you to rely on a lever, as Cybex does.</p>
<p><strong>The NHTSA rates this a 24 out of 25 for ease of use — and an easy-to-use car seat is a safe car seat.</strong> Labels are clear, instructions are well-written, and the important installation and adjustment components are color coded and easy to use.</p>

The B-Safe Ultra has easier strap adjustment, better options for temporary installation in Grandma's car or an Uber, and a great look and feel. This isn't a compact or lightweight car seat, but it's top-rated for easy installation and adjustment.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BRQWV8H/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Britax provides two key features on this model that are still rare at this competitive price point.</p>
<p>The first is an adjustable-height harness system. Instead of taking your car seat apart after every growth spurt, you can just slide the adjuster up and down to one of six positions. No complicated buckles, no forgetting to thread the straps through the head rest pad, no excuses. The Britax is the only car seat we found in this price bracket with a no-rethread harness.</p>
<p>The second distinct feature is the European-style belt path for installing without the base. If you only ever use your car seat in one car, maybe you&#8217;ll never use this feature. But that one time your spouse leaves you at home to spend the afternoon with Grandma and the base is still in the minivan, you&#8217;ll be thankful for the option.</p>
<p>There are other safe ways to install a car seat without a base (always check the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions to see your options). But wrapping the shoulder belt around the front of a car carrier is so much quicker, easier and more secure it&#8217;s hard to believe this isn&#8217;t a standard feature for every car seat.</p>
<p>Both of these features are missing from the base-model B-Safe 35, and the better seat belt path option is still missing on the Elite, so we&#8217;d definitely recommend spending the $30 or so to upgrade to the Ultra.</p>
<p>The padding inside this top model of the B-Safe line is plush and smooth. In our tests, we didn&#8217;t have any difficulty wiping off spit-up and snacks, but it&#8217;s also easy to remove the cover for washing. We liked the shoulder strap pads better than most, since they don&#8217;t have exposed snaps, seams or velcro to leave an impression on baby&#8217;s neck.<br />

<p>The flip-up sun shade feels just a little bit more luxurious, and it offers better coverage than any other shade except Chicco&#8217;s zip-on accessory extension.</p>
<p>If you want a little bit more in the way of safety-conscious design, the Britax &#8211; Endeavours is the same as the B-Safe, but the base has an anti-rebound bar bolted on for about $60. (Yes, it&#8217;s literally the same base with an added part. No, you can&#8217;t buy the bar separately.)</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Britax &#8211; B Safe Ultra packs in nearly every convenience feature for a reasonable price.</li>
<li>With no-rethread adjustment, you have no excuse not to keep shoulder straps at the correct level as your baby grows.</li>
<li>This base is easy to install: the carrier connects and disconnects easily.</li>
<li>A European-style shoulder belt path makes this carrier easier to install securely, even without the base.</li>
<li>The sun visor provides ample shade.</li>
<li>This is a bigger, heavier car seat, which is a good thing for safety.</li>
<li>Gets a near-perfect score for ease of use from the NHTSA and from our testers.</li>

<p>For something a little different, we looked to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VHVID1O/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cybex &#8211; Aton2</a>. This dark horse contender comes from Germany, and it comes with distinctive features that set it apart. It wasn&#8217;t the most convenient to use every day, so it narrowly missed top spot, but it&#8217;s still a car seat we like.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about how compact this car seat is: at just less than nine pounds, it&#8217;s not the lightest seat we tested, but it&#8217;s close. It&#8217;s definitely the easiest to fit in a compact car, though, with a design that maximizes the amount of space you have between seats.</p>
<p>The Aton line also has a base that&#8217;s easy to install, with a large flip-up lever that presses down on your LATCH straps to suck the base tight into your seat. You can get the same effect by pushing down on a base and pulling hard, but some people will prefer this mechanical advantage. The NHTSA gave this car seat full marks for installation.</p>
<h3>Extra safety features</h3>
<p>Cybex includes two features that are rarely seen in the U.S. market at any price. The first is a &#8220;load leg&#8221; feature that sticks out from the base. This leg is designed to absorb forward inertia in case of a head-on crash. The LATCH tethers will do a great job of preventing a car seat from flying forward, but as the seat cushion underneath compresses there&#8217;s still room for momentum to rock the seat forward, then rebound.</p>

<p>The other unique feature is a &#8220;linear side-impact protection&#8221; (LSP) system. These are two plastic wings that snap out, only for use when you install the Cybex in a side position next to a door or panel — never when seated beside a person or another car seat. The LSP is designed to absorb side impact energy which would otherwise cause the seat to bounce off the car door or other side panel.</p>

<p>Videos of European <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLUU4CcuyAY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crash tests like this one</a> are pretty convincing. That said, you can still have a safe car seat without these features and U.S. safety agencies aren&#8217;t currently testing them: The Cybex is tested and approved with these two features folded in, and U.S. standards don&#8217;t currently test side impacts.</p>
<h3>Also best for smaller babies</h3>
<p>The Cybex &#8211; Aton2 is also slightly better for the tiny infants like A.M. who get lost in bigger car seats. The seat bottom was the second-narrowest we tested and has a nice fluffy insert to help keep baby in place.</p>
<p>Cybex also gives you a &#8220;newborn insert&#8221; that fills in some space in the bottom of the seat. This helps the harness fit small infants better and makes the angle of your baby&#8217;s body a little bit flatter to help out baby&#8217;s developing neck.</p>
<p>You should never deliberately recline a seat past the level indicator on the base since that changes the way the harness and seat can absorb weight in case of a crash. This car seat was designed with the newborn insert in mind, so you can rest easy.</p>
<h3>The drawbacks</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cybexdock.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
There were a few things that kept this car seat from taking top spot.</p>
<p>The mechanism that keeps this car seat locked in the base is a bit tricky to work with. There&#8217;s a two-step removal procedure, where you have to lift the foot end of the carrier out of the base before the head latch will unlock. It isn&#8217;t that hard to repeat once you learn the feel of it, but four of our testers said it was a deal-breaker after seeing a demonstration.</p>
<p>The harness on the Aton2 requires you to re-thread the shoulder straps as your baby grows. That&#8217;s not unusual, especially at this price point, but the fact that the Britax manages to provide a non-rethread harness at a similar price is a real bonus.</p>
<p>Also, the sun visor on the Cybex is fairly small and doesn&#8217;t extend far enough to prevent low-angle sunset glare when used in a stroller. This isn&#8217;t a dealbreaker, and many parents will use a blanket or stroller canopy when the carrier isn&#8217;t in the car, but it&#8217;s annoying that you can&#8217;t get just a few more degrees of rotation out of the shade.<br />

You don't need all these extra features to have a safe car seat, but it sure can't hurt. The infant insert is also great for smaller babies and this takes up less of your front row legroom than any other seat available in the U.S.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VHVID1O/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
All things considered, this is a quirky little car seat that has a lot to offer at a competitive price. If you can afford to spend a little more, the Aton Q adds a bigger sun canopy and non-rethread harness adjustment, but the tricky carrier release latch is still the same. The Aton2 is a great car seat for those with small cars, small babies, or who want the peace of mind that comes with buying the latest safety features.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re looking for cutting-edge safety features, the Cybex &#8211; Aton2 has extra protection at a reasonable price.</li>
<li>This is also the best fit for cars without legroom to spare.</li>
<li>The base is easy to install with a nifty strap-tensioning lever system.</li>
<li>Sadly, you&#8217;ll still have to re-thread the shoulder harness as baby grows.</li>
<li>An infant insert may help smaller babies ride more comfortably.</li>
<li>This is also one of the lighter car seats we found, less than nine pounds.</li>
</ul>

Chicco&#8217;s car seats are great and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B078T4LL67/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KeyFit 30 Zip</a> is no exception. We don&#8217;t want the ranking in this review to be overstated: if it weren&#8217;t for a few features that made other car seats easier to use in specific cases, this car seat would have been very close to the top pick.</p>
<p><strong>The biggest point holding back the Chicco from ranking higher is the lack of a better option for seat belt routing when you don&#8217;t have the base with you.</strong> The fact that you get the European-standard belt-path feature along with a no-rethread harness adjustment on the Britax makes it just that much better.</p>
<p>The Chicco is the shallowest seat we measured measured along the back-board part of the seat, with 17.5 inches of room for your baby&#8217;s torso to grow compared to Britax&#8217;s 19.6.</p>
<p>Many reviewers give this car seat top marks, but all of our testers preferred the installation and safety features of other seats. The NHTSA rates this car seat a 19 out of 25, docking points for label clarity and the harness system.</p>

We tested the upgraded Zip model so we could see what the premium features are like to use, and the additional foot cover and visor extension are nice to have on chilly days. If you&#8217;re just going to buy some other privacy or cold-weather cover, there&#8217;s not much reason to spend extra on this upgrade, but child passenger safety technicians will give you bonus points for sticking with factory-designed accessories that have been fully tested.</p>

The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D7DGNSC/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Graco &#8211; Snuglock 30</a> is a budget-friendly, lightweight car seat that will keep your baby safe. This is a minor update of the seat our lead tester had been using for his two children and there&#8217;s really nothing about this car seat that was missed. The extra couple of pounds you&#8217;ll have to carry with a Cybex are well worth it when it comes to plush materials, easy installation and other quality-of-life improvements.</p>

Buying a car seat is intimidating. It&#8217;s hard to know which features are most important and which features are going to come in handy unexpectedly. When you&#8217;re buying, you probably don&#8217;t even know how big your baby will be yet.</p>
<p><strong>Five out of our six testers picked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BRQWV8H/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Britax &#8211; B-Safe Ultra</a> as their favorite car seat.</strong> Britax brings features you&#8217;d usually only see on $300 or $400 car seats down to an affordable price, and it&#8217;s one of the easiest seats to work with.</p>
<p>For a runner-up, we also like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VHVID1O/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cybex &#8211; Aton2</a>. This seat doesn&#8217;t have all the convenience features of the Britax, but it makes up for it with two innovative crash-protection features that are rarely seen in the U.S. car seat market. Cybex also made their car seat light and compact, which could be a real plus for those with small cars to squeeze in and out of. The Aton2 base takes some practice to get used to, but if you want these features it might be worth the learning curve.</p>

<h2 id="why-you-need">Why do you need a home security camera system?</h2>
<p>One of the main benefits of having an outdoor camera is safety and peace of mind. Capturing images and videos of an intrusion or disaster can save time and money, especially in the unfortunate case that something happens to your home. Having such footage can provide real evidence to the police, insurance companies or even the wrongfully accused neighbor of not cleaning up after their dog (true story).</p>
<p>During our testing we discovered a more heartwarming and entertaining reason for outdoor cameras: to capture and relive life&#8217;s little moments. We especially appreciated being able to check up on our kids and pets as often as we’d like.</p>
<p>The internet is full of moments captured on outdoor security cameras, some encouraging and others that tell a cautionary tale. We also had our fair share of these moments. The most shocking moment was being able to catch an intoxicated person trying to enter the wrong house, our house! In only a few short minutes, we realized that even in no real danger it is worth every penny to have a camera rolling for peace of mind.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a sped up clip we caught of an inebriated stranger mistakenly trying to access our residence:</p>

<h2 id="how-different">How are self-monitoring systems different?</h2>
<p>There are three major differences between a self-monitoring system and a monitored security system, and it’s important to consider what is best for you and your family.</p>
<p>The first difference is that a traditional monitored system has alarms and signals that will alert the authorities if something happens. On a self-monitored system, no one else is watching your cameras, and the police or fire department are not alerted if something happens when you’re not paying attention to notifications.</p>
<p>The second difference between the two will be the hardware included. Self-monitored systems all watch for motion, but monitored systems typically come with special smoke detectors, open-door alarms, window-opening alerts and a siren. You can assemble similar functionality with a DIY self-monitored system, but making sure it all works together is on you.</p>
<p>Finally, a monitored system will almost always use a telephone hard line or cell phone tower to communicate with a security company, while self-monitored systems rely on your home internet connection and Wi-Fi to update you if something happens. If your Wi-Fi is on the fritz, a self-monitoring wireless camera won’t work. Here’s a quick summary.</p>
<p><b>Monitored security system:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Connected to a police station and fire department</li>
<li>Special hardware for smoke and carbon dioxide detectors</li>
<li>Open window alarms</li>
<li>Hub station with an alarm</li>
<li>Professional installation</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Self-monitored system:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Connects to your smartphone and computer</li>
<li>Alerts you only to motion per your custom settings</li>
<li>Adding other alert hardware can be tricky</li>
<li>Relies on your home internet connection</li>
<li>Subscription fees still a thing, but with different features for your money</li>
</ul>
<p>A great option for renters or an alternative for homeowners is self-monitored systems. Self-monitored cameras still come with motion alerts, link normally to your phone and send messages based on your preferences. As you will find out below, not all cameras are created equal, and some offer options that add to the protection of your home.</p>
<h3>How do self-monitoring home security cameras work?</h3>
<p>Self-monitoring security cameras are connected to your home&#8217;s WiFi router and allow you to monitor a selected space via your smartphone or computer. Installation can be done in less than 30 minutes, including installing the camera in its place and installing the corresponding app on your phone. Once up, it will take a few minutes to get the cameras set just right to include a level of customization that fits your needs.</p>
<p>The next step is to set up notifications that will be sent based on your preferences. Alerts or notifications are sent three ways: via email, text message or push notification. During our testing, we discovered that all three notifications went out at the same time for all cameras. We also found that push notifications were most convenient, as emails and text messages can go unnoticed.</p>

<p><b>Weatherproof: </b>If the goal is to keep a camera outdoors at all times, it needs to be able to do so in all weather and all seasons. For this test, we chose cameras that are waterproof and can function in severe conditions from -4 °F to 130 °F.</p>
<p><b>Motion detection</b><strong>:</strong> It is unlikely that the average person has the time to rewatch videos daily to look for activity. Self-monitoring systems send alarms based on ranges of motion and alert you right away of any activity.</p>
<p><b>Field of view:</b> You will want a camera to be able to capture it all in one frame. You should consider the camera’s degree of view before starting your search. Installing a camera higher to get a wider viewpoint might decrease the clarity of the picture. All cameras we tested have at least a 100-degree field of view.</p>
<p><b>Resolution and zoom</b><strong>:</strong> Resolution is the measurement of pixels of a picture or basically how clear your image will be. Typical resolutions for self-monitored cameras are between 702p and 1080p. It is important to note that when you zoom, you will always lose some quality, but starting with a higher resolution will result in a clearer zoomed shot.</p>
<p><b>Night vision</b><strong>:</strong> Cameras should work for you 24/7 and not just when the sun is out. You will want to make sure your self-monitored camera has a high-resolution <i>night vision</i> camera in addition to the day time camera. For this article, we tested only high-resolution day and night cameras.</p>
<p><b>Audio:</b> Ideally your self-monitored system will have the ability for you to see <i>and </i>listen to what is happening. Some cameras even allow you to talk through the app on your smartphone and be broadcast through the camera.</p>
<p><b>Look and feel</b><strong>:</strong> No one wants their camera to be an eyesore or blatantly obvious. Some are designed with aesthetics in mind. Some people will hide their cameras to capture any unwanted activity around the home, but occasionally just the sight of a camera will deter vandals.</p>
<p><b>Cost: </b>In our testing, we found more expensive doesn’t necessarily mean better. It is important to consider the features you need vs. purchasing based on price.</p>
<h3 id="important-software-features">Software</h3>
<p><b>Mobile app</b><strong>:</strong> Smartphones have become an integral part of our daily lives; it’s part of the reason why self-monitored outdoor cameras work so well. Each camera we tested had its own secure app for easy customization, notifications and to view the live video feed. Not to discount the web access, but we found the app was more user-friendly, customizable and accessible.</p>
<p><b>Power and Wi-Fi:</b> Most home Wi-Fi routers can send a signal through the average 2000-square-foot home while being strong enough to connect a handful of devices. For the camera to run 24/7, it needs to stay charged and have a steady Wi-Fi signal.</p>
<p>When looking at a power source, consider what works better for you: A battery-powered camera that can easily be removed and charged, or a plug-in system to set and forget? Is it easy to find a plug where you want to install the camera? What would happen to the camera if you should ever lose power or a Wi-Fi signal?</p>
<p><b>Cloud or app storage</b><strong>:</strong> Cloud storage will keep all of your data online and let you safely access it a few different ways. App storage will keep data directly on your phone. Storage options will vary depending on the camera and app you choose. The preferred method is cloud storage so you can store as much as necessary.</p>
<p><b>Monthly fee</b><strong>:</strong> Most cameras come with limited storage for free, ranging from a few hours to a few days. Some self-monitoring systems allow you to upgrade your storage or monitoring plan for an additional cost.</p>
<h2 id="how-secure">How secure are outdoor cameras?</h2>
<p>In today’s world, cybersecurity is a hot topic. Most home Wi-Fi networks are password protected with additional firewalls for safety. For most homeowners, maintaining a secure Wi-Fi password that is not kid/petname123 is the best way to keep your cameras secured. It is always good to remember to use <a href="https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/home-wireless-network-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best practices</a> for Wi-Fi; it will ensure your self-monitored systems are safe and secure.</p>
<p>Security concerns don’t stop with your Wi-Fi, though. Internet-connected cameras are always on and always transmitting, so in the past, they’ve been prime targets for botnet attacks that hijack common devices and use them to overload web servers. Even Wi-Fi itself was shaken to the core last year when security researchers demonstrated the <a href="https://www.krackattacks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“KRACK” vulnerability</a> that gave access to encrypted data sent over Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>We don’t want our cameras to fall into the wrong hands, but there’s really nothing we can do ourselves to check for vulnerabilities in the camera, website or app programming. Buying a web-connected device, we have to trust that the engineers at the manufacturer or service provider are doing what they can to track down and fix vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Each camera we tested came with additional paperwork informing us of safety and security features that the camera, app or software provided. Software updates were sent out at least once for each camera that we tested. It was important to see that security was one of the top things on each companies lists, as it was for us when testing.</p>
<p>Beyond the security of the website and camera, you also need to think about the security of devices you allow to access your footage and notifications.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075P84FH2/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Arlo &#8211; Pro 2</b></a> allows for only one user to be on the app at once, and further protects it by requiring a fingerprint authentication before continuing. This means that users must have the latest version of smartphones. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I01QLTE/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Amcrest &#8211; ProHD</b></a> only allowed for one device to have access to the live feed at a time, and the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077FXPJJG/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vimtag &#8211; B3-S Outdoor Camera</a></strong> stores all footage on an included SD card, not on your phone or in the cloud, so you must have access to the camera to view previous footage.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Camera location</h3>
<p>First, we scoped out the best location for our outdoor cameras. Where was all the action happening, what do we want to monitor, where could we get the best view, and where is the best location aesthetically?</p>
<p>For the front of the house, we picked the corner of the porch to be able to see the front door, the driveway, the sidewalk and street in front of the house. We chose this area because it was the best position to see the direction someone was able to enter and exit the property.</p>
<p>For the backyard, we picked both central and corner areas over the patio/balcony that would best see where and how people would enter the property. It was also set with the intention to monitor our kids and pets activities as well as any potential wildlife that cruised through the backyard. The easiest setup spot was for the garage, set to view who came in and out.</p>

<h3>Software setup</h3>
<p>It is important to note that you <strong>must</strong> set up the phone app before installing<b>.</b> Another pro-tip: have your smartphone already connected to your home Wi-Fi router. We discovered that this small task will make your life a lot easier during the install phase.</p>
<p>All smartphone applications were the same name brand as the camera itself. We headed over to the Google Play store and iTunes to download the apps. Once fully installed, the app will walk you through the remaining setup steps.</p>

Standard Blink batteries boast a two-year battery life, making this the best option for a wire- and worry-free system.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XZWHBJ4/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>All cameras had a printed QR code and serial number on the device. Using your smartphone camera, you slowly roll over the code to pick up the device’s unique signal. This was the longest step in the setup process; it took us two or three attempts for most cameras to successfully connect to the app and start syncing. Once connected, our live feed began. Our top performing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I3I9L8M/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nest &#8211; Cam Outdoor</a>, Ring &#8211; Spotlight Cam and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XZWHBJ4/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blink &#8211; XT Home Security Camera</a> all connected in under 20 seconds once scanned, unlike the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077FXPJJG/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vimtag &#8211; B3-S Outdoor Camera</a> (we actually tested the BS-1 model, per note in &#8220;Other finalists&#8221; section below) which sent out a signal and took nearly five minutes before we could move onto the next step.</p>
<p>Now that our self-monitored camera system has started running, it is time to install the cameras. We finished the software setup after the physical cameras are installed, which includes the customization of the feed and best picture angle.</p>

<p>Every camera came with all essential supplies: wall mounts, screws and drywall screws to make installation easy. The only at home supplies used to install the cameras were a power drill, ladder and extension cord. While some bases such as the Vimtag and Amcrest needed more than two hands to help hold the base in place so the camera doesn’t hang and bang around during install, we loved the Nest and the Arlo’s magnetic base that made it easy to install prior to camera setup and then adjust with only one person.</p>
<p>It is important to note the length of the power cord for plug-in cameras for your self-monitoring system, if any, when considering a location. Knowing the distance helped us find the best place to plug the cameras in and then buy any additional supplies needed to hide the cords of the camera. We used a plastic wire hider or command hooks. If you don’t like the idea or look of camera or extension cords we recommend going with the wireless Arlo or Blink cameras.</p>
<h3>Motion activity and sensitivity</h3>
<p>Once the camera and notifications were set, it was time to set off the alarms. We walked, skipped and ran past each camera, timing with a stopwatch how long it took notifications to be sent to our phones. Most notifications were sent within seconds with the Nest, Arlo, Ring and Blink coming nearly instantaneously.</p>
<p>The true test was when the cameras sensed motion at a point when we were not ready and waiting for them. Whether it was a postal delivery, a neighbor walking by or an animal wandering through, we jumped on the live feed once a notification was received to see what it was for and how delayed it was in sending. The best night view came from the Ring; as soon as motion was detected, two powerful lights came on to enhance the video and scare off any unwanted guest.</p>
<p>Each camera performed well, but some a bit too well. We had to adjust our notifications so we didn’t see every bird fly by or leaf fall from the tree. One of our favorite features was the “Anti-Dither” featured on the Amcrest; this allows you to specify how long you want something to move before sending out alerts.</p>
<p>Most apps had these custom settings to allow us to do so. Another benefit of some self-monitored systems is that they allow for the user to set “motion zones,” or specific areas in the field of view for which to receive notifications. We set these for the top of a door or sidewalk to avoid smaller movement.</p>
<h3>Wi-Fi and self-monitored systems</h3>
<p>A live feed and notification is only as good as how accurately and quickly they are received. All cameras we tested had a live feed delay of 5 seconds or less and notifications came within 10 seconds, but there are a few factors that could delay or change the delay time.</p>

<p>If you have a large home or are running cameras far away from your Wi-Fi router, that creates a laggy feed, so a simple addition to your home may be installing a plugin Wi-Fi extender. This will boost the signal another few hundred to thousand feet depending on the brand and device you choose. A good rule of thumb is that if your phone can pick up Wi-Fi, so can your camera. Both the Blink and Arlo came with their own base extender to allow you to install your cameras in even the outermost reaches of your home.</p>
<h3>Ease of use</h3>
<p>We had two vastly different personalities testing the self-monitored camera systems, one who was very tech savvy and another who “just needs it to work the first time.” Our results showed that if you can follow the instructions provided, and have a little patience, a self-monitoring system can easily be set up in your home by any level of a tech expert.</p>
<p>Just in case, we went to each company’s FAQ page to see how accessible help would be if needed. These camera companies have plenty of resources on their websites and help pages so you can become your own home security expert without having to pay a professional. We used the “tips and tricks” to help us further customize our feed and app, and we found it especially helpful for setting motion zones.</p>
<p>If it’s just not working out for you, you can pay a professional installer. Nest has a <a href="https://nest.com/nest-pro-installation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">professional installer locator</a>, and there’s a service on Amazon you can order for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N6ZOREJ/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ring-specific installation</a>. If a brand you go with doesn’t have a resource for a pro install, you may be able to get by with <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/geek-squad/pcmcat138100050018.c?id=pcmcat138100050018" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Geek Squad</a> or an equivalent since these installs require relatively basic handyman skills for hardware install and basic networking and app setup.</p>

<p>The Nest system is probably the most recognized name in both indoor and outdoor home security cameras, and in our testing of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I3I9L8M/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nest &#8211; Cam Outdoor</a> we found out why they are such a powerhouse. Continuous 24/7 recording with a great app interface that highlights “footage activity points” proved its worth. Instant motion alerts via phone or email put our minds at ease too.</p>
<p>The Nest walks you through each step from unboxing to install. The camera comes with a powerful magnetic base that secures with concealed screws. Once set, the camera snaps into the base. We loved that it can be moved with a 360-degree swivel and no hindrance on angles of view. Its cord is 25-feet-long, the longest of all we tested, allowing more flexibility in reaching the furthest corners of your home..</p>
<p>The Nest app offers the most options for notifications, whereas other systems tended to be push notification only<strong>.</strong> Alerts for the push notification were instant, with the text and email following up shortly. A family-friendly feature of the Nest is that access can be shared so more than one person is notified.</p>

Nest lives up to its reputation as the best option for easy-to-use outdoor security cameras with simple setup, 24/7 live feed and an intuitive phone application.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I3I9L8M/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Our favorite option that set the Nest self-monitoring system above the others was the free live-feed scroll feature. The Nest was the only camera that provided this along with 24/7 recording. With just the touch of your finger, you are able to scroll through recordings to create time-lapse videos of your day, extract clips, and grab screenshot images. Segments with activity are highlighted using dots to help you find the action.</p>
<p>At first, having the 24-hour feed to scroll through seemed like overkill. Other apps organize “areas of motion” better by simply filing those videos in order of timestamps. But the Nest is the only camera that lets you easily scroll through a full day’s worth of video. We found that ability frequently comes in handy.</p>
<p>When viewing the feed, the Nest had the clearest picture of any camera during both day and night. The app’s 8x zoom lets you inspect detail the Nest already captures that you don’t see on your phone at the standard image size. The image enhancement feature helps with otherwise grainy images. As shown in the image below, the cat is a zoomed-in detail from the original feed in the upper right corner.</p>

<p>The Nest camera is fully customizable on the phone app. You are able to set times to record or pair it with your smartphone GPS. You can set it to not record or notify when you are at home, a feature that might be more useful for an indoor camera. When creating motion zones, you can set more than one zone per camera.</p>
<p>A great safety feature of most self-monitored systems is the ability to talk back through the cameras. The Nest two-way talk was the loudest of any camera we tested.</p>
<p>If the power goes out at your house, your Wi-Fi disconnects or the cord is cut, you will immediately get a push notification on your phone. It will let you know the camera has lost connection and attach the “last image recorded”. This is a great built-in security feature that no other self-monitoring system offered.</p>

<p>The Nest system has the most diverse product lineup if you’re looking to set up a connected smart home. They also make video doorbells, keyless entryways, thermostats, security alarm system, smoke and carbon monoxide sensors and temperature sensors.</p>
<p>Overall, we found that the Nest &#8211; Cam Outdoor is an industry leader for a reason This user-friendly system records 24/7, alerts you when and how you want it to and records extra detail so you can zoom in when reviewing. The Nest has basically perfected the self-monitoring setup to ensure that you see the moments you need to see at the right moment.</p>

<p>Coming in a very close second to the Nest camera, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075P84FH2/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Arlo &#8211; Pro 2</a> is a great choice for your self-monitored security system. This battery-powered self-monitored camera definitely packs a punch with its fully customizable setup. With options for motion zones, picture quality, times to record and alerts, you can set up the Arlo to best fit your needs.</p>
<p>To start the setup, we connected the hub to our home router via an ethernet cable. You then need to sync the cameras with the hub by pushing a sync button on both units. Setup was the easiest out of any cameras tested and did not require any scanning.</p>
<p>Like the Nest cams, the Arlo has a magnetic base so the cameras can be easily removed and repositioned. While repositioning was easy, the design of the base limits the range of positioning angles compared to the Nest, but it was not a dealbreaker. Both cameras allow the feed to be flipped if it is a better placement for the cameras to sit upside down.</p>

<p><strong>One unique feature that the Arlo &#8211; Pro 2 has is complete wireless freedom.</strong> The camera batteries come fully charged from the factory, and last up to three months at the lowest picture quality. Batteries on best video quality ran down much quicker, only lasting a few weeks, but fully charged back up within an hour. To charge the batteries simply remove the camera and open the back, no screwdrivers or tools needed.</p>
<p>To save storage space, the Arlo does not constantly record unless you have an upgraded CVR (continuous video recording) plan. The camera only records when it senses movement and puts the video into files on the phone app organized by day. CVR prices start at $99 per year for CVR of 14 days, or $199 per year for 30 days of saved feed. Since CVR is an additional cost to the 30-60 days of storage for the standard plan, we qualified it as a “hidden fee.”</p>
<p>If you’re not inclined to pay extra for the CVR upgrade, there is a free plan that records only motion, then stores it on the cloud for seven days. For most people, this free plan is more than sufficient and makes the Arlo a more attractive choice if you just download any motion you want to save within a few days.</p>

The Arlo was no different from other cameras we tested when it came to motion alerts as push notifications came within seconds of testing. The Arlo can be fully customized to fit your needs, though the options were overwhelming at times. With the factory settings, this can be a set-up-and-go system but plan to spend some time getting used to all the settings.</p>
<p>Like other cameras, you can set up motion zones and times to record. From the home screen, you can see the battery life, adjust the picture and view recent videos. But again, Arlo’s interface felt a bit too busy to quickly find the desired setting.</p>
<p>The 100-decibel siren, which broadcasts from the base hub, is a nice perk to the Arlo. It’s loud enough to draw attention from neighbors and was sharp enough to make our testers jump — even when they knew it was coming.</p>

The Arlo's 100-decibel siren is a convenient way to scare off intruders.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075P84FH2/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The siren can be set off a few different ways. You can manually trigger it from the app after receiving a motion notification. Or you can program an alarm to be triggered by certain levels of motion, based on rules that you set in the app. There are also different options for the siren duration and noise levels.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, if the siren isn’t for your household it can easily be switched off with the touch of a button or disabled completely. Since the siren broadcasts from the hub, you will want to ensure the hub is near a window to draw attention from neighbors.</p>
<p>You can easily customize your home-security setup by connecting other Arlo products to your hub, such as extra security cameras, baby monitors and even camera-controlled security lights.</p>
<p>Overall, the Arlo &#8211; Pro 2 is a respectable camera and nice addition to your self-monitored security system. It may come down to personal preference, but the free 24/7 recording and simple set up and scroll feature on the Nest just barely edged the Arlo out of the top spot.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Arlo &#8211; Pro 2 cameras are battery operated and provide a cleaner install for those who don’t want to manage wires.</li>
<li>Only recording when motion is detected, this model helps save storage space.</li>
<li>The 100-decibel siren offers another way to scare off potential intruders when motion is detected in your preset zones.</li>
<li>As a wireless system, battery life is our only concern, and for the best battery life, you will sacrifice some image quality.</li>

<p>This <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I01QLTE/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amcrest &#8211; ProHD IP3M-943</a> plug-in-and-go camera won major points for its customization and night vision capabilities. Due to its ability to adjust every detail, we found this to be the best camera for commercial use and those familiar with sophisticated camera setups.</p>
<p>The feed starts by connecting through your phone’s Wi-Fi, then it sends an audio tone to the camera that tells it how to connect securely to the network. This tone is like receiving a text message “ping.”</p>
<p>Once the live feed started, we were instructed to set up alerts and notifications. The system is set up to record and alert when motion is detected, and notifications were instant when we tested it. Like the Arlo, the Amcrest ProHD only records when it senses motion in the field of view.</p>
<p>The Amcrest has a feature that no other camera had: the “Anti-Dither” option, which adjusts the amount of time an object has to move before the video starts recording. This is a major feature that scored big points for us and that we hope other cameras will adopt.</p>
<p>The Anti-Dither helps save storage space (and your patience) by avoiding a lot of pictures of birds flying by your cameras. It can be set to allow anywhere from 5-60 seconds of movement before the recording starts. Like most other self-monitoring systems, you have the ability to set zones on the camera to alert you and start recording.</p>
<p>The Amcrest provided the best night vision of any camera tested. It was detailed and clear. A word of caution: this camera can be easily spotted at night with its red infrared lights that stay on to provide clarity on the night image.</p>
<p>Both day and night zoom features work well. The Amcrest adjusts its picture quality based on the device you’re viewing it on; this helps keep the image in proper aspect ratio. Overall, looking on a smartphone, tablet or computer, this camera provided one of the clearest pictures of any camera tested.<b></b></p>

<p>Another unique feature is adjustable brightness and contrast. This can be useful if there are major obstacles within the camera’s view that you can’t avoid, but you want to avoid it being the main points of camera exposure.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to capture activity in your backyard, but the placement of the camera means it will record the inside of your house too. At night, the camera will expose an average of the scene, meaning the inside of your house will look right, but the scene of your backyard (where you care about watching for activity) will be much too dark. Being able to manually adjust exposure will make the inside of your house be too bright, but the outdoor scene exposed for properly at night.</p>
<p>The long list of customizations options might overwhelm some users. You have to be a little tech savvy to understand everything that can be done, but for our testing, we found the factory settings worked well.</p>
<p>Another downfall is that it does not record 24/7 without installing a micro SD card (not included). The Amcrest comes with free viewing on both your app and your computer and four hours of free storage on their website.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a self-monitored system that can be set to very specific specifications, the Amcrest &#8211; ProHD is worth checking out. We loved the clarity and customization that the software provides and it&#8217;s clear that this is designed for commercial installations.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Amcrest &#8211; ProHD IP3M-943 was the most customizable of any system we tested, which might overwhelm some users.</li>
<li>An “Anti-Dither” feature allows the Amcrest to ignore insignificant motion that would otherwise fill up your recording space.</li>
<li>Amcrest provided the clearest night time picture but had an easily spotted red light when recording.</li>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XZWHBJ4/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blink &#8211; XT Home Security Camera</a> camera is a simple, no fuss, user-friendly outdoor camera that has no subscription or data storage fees. With two-year battery life, this is a great option for someone who wants to set it and forget it, and quickly became one of the favorites of our testers.</p>
<p>The setup was easy: Video how-tos automatically appeared on the bottom of the phone screen showing us how to open and install from start to finish. Like the other cameras, you can scan in a QR code to pair the hardware with the app, but if you are having trouble you can also enter in the nine-digit serial code. The only setup needed outside of downloading the app is installing the two AA batteries included in the box.</p>
<p>The hardware to set up the camera on the wall is best placed with a straight on shot of what you need to see. Unlike other cameras, the mount is a flat base and only allows you to slightly move the camera up and down. But once up, it stays up — no messing with wires or recharging batteries. The batteries included boasted a two-year life. We didn’t test for two years, but there was no change in the battery indicator during our month-long test.</p>

<p>On the Blink app home screen, you do not have a live feed but rather a picture of the last known motion. There are two buttons on the picture: a video and a camera icon. Click on the video and you go to a live feed; click on the camera and it takes a snapshot of what it sees. There is also a switch to “Arm” the camera. If you are recording in the backyard, and know the kids are playing, you can easily shut off notifications to save time and space on the app. (Just don&#8217;t forget to re-arm the camera!)</p>
<p>Alerts came via push notifications on our device and popped up in under 20 seconds. You can see the video right from the notification, and don’t need to open the app. Videos are stored directly on the app in order of recording. There are no folders for days or months; simply scroll down to see all saved videos.</p>
<p>A favorite feature with the Blink app is that it auto-deletes videos that you do not deem important. If there is a clip that you wish to save, you share it or download it from the app directly. The user can have it set to auto-delete videos after 3, 7, 14 or 30 days, or even after one year. We loved this feature, as we found it cumbersome to delete old videos and images after testing.</p>
<p>Customization on the Blink app was fairly straightforward. Factory settings did not need to be adjusted on our test. The Blink also has a health meter built into its customization tab. You can view the battery life, temperature, Wi-Fi strength and whether any updates are available.</p>
<p>The Blink &#8211; XT Home Security Camera camera might be the most basic of outdoor cameras we tested, but it shouldn’t be underestimated to get the job done. We loved the straightforward, easy-to-use app that was designed with the busy person in mind. Setup was a breeze, alerts are quick, there is nothing to overly customize, and batteries don’t need to be recharged. The Blink camera is a smart choice for those who need to monitor any given area without all the fuss of a fancy system.</p>

<p>Relatively new to the industry, and famous for their video doorbells, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758L64L9/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ring &#8211; Spotlight Cameras</a> focus on providing more than just motion alerts and peace of mind. We loved that this camera has built-in lights, a replacement for the motion-detector floodlights that have been popular for decades: The option to trigger both a siren and flashing lights when motion is detected definitely adds functionality over camera-only options.</p>
<p>Setting up the Ring was a breeze. The phone application was user-friendly and walked you through all steps. If you got stuck or spent more than 60 seconds on a page, a pop-up appeared that linked to their YouTube page for additional instructions. We did not need to click the YouTube links, but we were grateful they were there.</p>
<p>Once up and running, the box includes all the hardware you need, including a drill bit and screwdriver. The camera hangs down from the mount and you can rotate 360 degrees and tilt 45 degrees. The Ring camera has two slots open for battery packs; only one battery is included.</p>

We loved the “neighbors” features that offers a feed where you can post and see suspicious activity around your home.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758L64L9/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Ring has our favorite feature of any camera app that we tested: The Community Page. This allows everyone within a few miles of you to post their videos of suspicious activities. Like a Facebook feed, you can post, like, comment and share videos. While testing, our community page had videos of package thieves, solicitors and concerned neighbors talking about loiterers.</p>
<p>The Ring differs from other cameras we tested with its two high-powered lights attached to the unit. These lights come on after dark when it senses motion adding another level of protection.</p>
<p>A major setback for the Ring was the battery life. We set up the camera with one fully charged battery and selected the option to have the live feed available when we wanted to see it. A pop-up appeared warning us that the live feed and &#8220;best picture&#8221; settings would drain the battery quicker.</p>
<p>We found the battery needed to be recharged twice per month to use the best picture quality. Even with a low battery, alerts were sent and the motion was recorded with no noticeable loss of quality. For an additional cost, you can buy a Ring Solar Panel that connects to the Ring; we think this might be necessary for most users.</p>
<p>The Ring offers an optional siren that is easily turned on or off from your phone. The siren also pairs with a set of lights on the bottom of the device that flash blue and red. Unlike the Arlo, the 110-decibel siren plays directly from the device and echoes from the surrounding walls, really making the testers and neighbors jump. The way that the device clicks into the wall mount makes it hard to pull down or steal; if you have the siren on, no one is going to stick around and try to turn it off.</p>
<p>The Ring provides the ability to easily switch on and off alerts, or snooze for a certain amount of time. When we were working in the backyard, we were able to snooze for 15, 30, 60 or 120 minutes; this silenced our phone notifications, but the camera still recorded the motion. As soon as the snooze time ran out, alerts resumed as normal.</p>
<p>Designed with the user in mind, you have the ability to customize the Ring settings, but they are not overwhelming as other cameras tested. Smart alerts can be set to light, standard or frequent; each adjusts to the motion sensitivity.</p>
<p>Overall, the Ring &#8211; Spotlight Cam rivals the Nest for its simplicity but falls behind the Arlo with its features. The app and features stood out from other cameras that we tested, and it was obvious that this was designed by real people for real scenarios. The community page is something we hope that other camera manufacturers will adopt. No buyer’s remorse with the Ring — we think this is a great addition to your home security system if its simplicity fits your needs.</p>
<h3>Vimtag &#8211; B3-S Outdoor Camera</h3>

<p>Note: We initially tested and reviewed the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0198PPD5Y/?tag=ybdoutcam-20&amp;th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vimtag &#8211; B-1 Outdoor Camera</a>. Prior to publication, we learned from the manufacturer that the B-1 model is being phased out and replaced with the newer <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077FXPJJG/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vimtag &#8211; B3-S Outdoor Camera</a>. Therefore, we have replaced all references to the B-1 with the B3-S throughout this article. The main difference appears to be a more streamlined look and slightly smaller size, plus it has better zoom and the image resolution increased from 720p HD to 1080p HD.</p>
<p>The Vimtag &#8211; B3-S Outdoor Camera is a heavy-duty camera that reminds us of a TV prop from the 90s. The camera came ready to use out of the box, with subscriptions that can either be set up from an app or directly from their website. The Vimtag rivaled the Amcrest for functionality, but this system was designed for an IT superstar rather than the average homeowner.</p>
<p>Setup for the Vimtag was not difficult, but it took some patience. The unit does need to be plugged in and only came with a 6.5-foot cord. We were able to install it using an open window and an extension cord. In addition to the power cord, there are two other wires that hang from the camera. One is for an optional Ethernet connection, and another provides a wired video feed. If not properly hidden, they would be a major eyesore. The Vimtag does not detach from the base, which made the install a little harder.</p>
<p>Like most other outdoor cameras, we gave the Vimtag app to our camera&#8217;s unique serial number using a QR code. Rather than using a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connection from the phone to tell the camera how to log into a secure network, the app sends a high-pitched audio tone for the camera to listen to. This unpleasant process takes nearly two minutes.</p>
<p>While this method of connecting your camera to Wi-Fi is not susceptible to Bluetooth or Wi-Fi hacking, we debated its benefits after we found out that you have to repeat this setup <i>every time</i> the camera loses power or a Wi-Fi signal.</p>
<p>A favorite feature was that you are able to set your preferences to record based on the size of movement (think people, not animals). The app also features the ability to customize your feed or pictures. You can set the area you want to record, but overall no specific motion zones to be alerted too. You can set the quality based on lighting, and easily turn on and off the camera from your phone.</p>
<p>With the Vimtag app, you are able to access the live feed at any time. Like the Nest, the Vimtag records 24/7 but does not store in one continuous file: It keeps all videos in 30-minute increments. Unfortunately, this quickly ate up storage on our phone; and if we needed to go back to find a specific point in the day, it meant sifting through nearly 50 videos per day.</p>
<p>Since the feed and recordings were not triggered by motion, we were not able to quickly find an image or footage of an event. We either had to go through all previous videos, or we had to take down the camera and pull out the SD card in the camera.</p>

<p>A major design flaw with the Vimtag is the storage system. If the power goes out or the Wi-Fi is disconnected, you will need to set up the camera from step one. In the unfortunate event of the cord being cut or unplugged, the camera instantly loses connection to the app and you lose any previously recorded footage that is not downloaded. If you are able to recover the camera, all the footage is stored in the 32GB SD card located in the back of the unit. For this reason, we recommend installing the camera in a very high place, making it hard for any unauthorized folks to take it.</p>
<p>Overall this was our least-favorite outdoor security camera. We did not find it to be user-friendly, and it&#8217;s not something the average person would use in their house. More suited for a commercial setting where it could be managed by an IT person, we concluded that there are better outdoor security cameras to choose from.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>With a quick, clear feed and instantaneous alerts the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I3I9L8M/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nest &#8211; Cam Outdoor</a> is a great option to add a level of self-monitored security to your house. One of our favorite features was the easy-to-use app and its ability to scroll through days of footage with a simple scroll through the app.</p>
<p>If a wireless camera is more up your alley, we commend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075P84FH2/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Arlo &#8211; Pro 2</a>. With features similar to the Nest Cam, The Arlo allows the user a bit more customization to the picture quality, includes an additional siren, and saves space by not continuously recording. An honorable mention for a commercial, tech-savvy product, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I01QLTE/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amcrest &#8211; ProHD IP3M-943</a>.</p>
<p>If you are looking to connect multiple devices, or to create a smart house, the Nest brand offers many other self-monitoring devices that tailor to your specific self-monitored security-system needs. You can easily link thermostats, locks and cameras to a single app on your phone. Additionally, Nest offers one of the most inexpensive upgraded plans: for only $5 per month, you can store up to seven days’ worth of footage in the cloud.</p>
<p>Overall the Nest outdoor security camera is a great option for both renters and homeowners, as it can be installed easily and adjusted quickly. The app is user-friendly and can be accessed from either a computer or smartphone and access can be shared with multiple people. The quality of the picture during both day and night, along with its zoom feature, made this the best option to clearly capture all activity. Recording 24/7, this is a great device to add peace of mind and home protection while capturing all of life’s precious moments.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>As is the case with hard-wired smoke detectors, battery powered units come in a large price range. Battery powered smoke detectors provide virtually all of the safety of a hard-wired system without the inconvenience and expense of construction and the need to connect to a central security panel. The market for these types of units is dominated by <a href="https://www.firstalert.com/products" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">First Alert</a> and <a href="http://www.kidde.com/home-safety/en/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kidde</a>, and both of these manufacturers also have several highly rated models online. Our screening involved a four-step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Screen for units below $50, with a target range of $25-$35 per unit. Most of the benefits of buying a unit above $35 relate to integrating units with complete home monitoring systems. The essential protective features needed from a smoke detector are available in many units in our target price range. Two outliers were selected (including one higher priced unit from Honeywell) in order to include a range beyond the two dominant manufacturers.</li>
<li>Screen for average online consumer rankings as a function of rating and number of reviews; we sought out units that were very well-liked by consumers and we explored the Q&amp;A section of the reviews to determine whether the units held up to scrutiny from verified purchasers.</li>
<li>A review of the literature relating to residential smoke detectors.</li>
<li>Identify units that cover the spectrum of useful features: interconnectivity for installing multiple units in a home, hush buttons, long life (lithium) batteries and the option to link to a home security panel that in turn notifies the local fire department in the event of a fire (Honeywell &#8211; 5808W3).</li>
</ol>
<p>While there are units that combine both types of sensors in one unit, consumers can be prone to disabling the entire unit as a result of false alarms (typically arising from the ionization sensor), which clearly defeats the entire purpose of early smoke and fire detection. With battery powered units, the entire functionality of the unit depends on whether the battery works properly.</p>
<p>If you are the type of person who is vigilant about setting and resetting alarms, then a unit that touts its capability for detecting both smoke and fire like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001AMML0E/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Universal Security Instruments &#8211; SS-770</a> might work well for you. However, installing two types of units is the optimal way to go for most people. The inclusion of a CO detector with a fire and smoke alarm is an added benefit. The “false alarm” dilemma also applies to units with integrated CO detectors: disabling the unit due to a false alarm will render the premises unprotected.</p>
<p>In terms of understanding the critical issue of battery life and when to test batteries, a subreddit discussion on batteries and nuisance alarms is quite helpful. Some of the problems relating to false alarms — such as units sometimes going off in the middle of the night — underscores the importance of having a silence feature for nuisance alarms, particularly for larger homes that require multiple units scattered in different locations throughout a house.</p>
<p>Although we did not test any units that have a voice-silencing feature, there are (pricier) smoke detectors that do have it.</p>
<h2 id="why-trust-us">Why you should trust us</h2>
<p>We reviewed specialist fire protection publications, public and private fire-related research sites and interviewed subject matter experts to understand the essential aspects of <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/guide/fire-safety">home fire protection</a> and the specific features needed to protect one’s home.</p>
<p>One of the most important, if not the most important aspect of installing battery operated smoke detectors is to perform regular battery checks. Absent working batteries, an individual alarm is worthless and a network of linked alarms is seriously compromised.</p>
<p>Combined with the propensity for consumers to disable alarms, the use of battery powered smoke detectors relies as much on consumer maintenance as it does on the equipment itself. It is also important to keep any smoke detector — battery or hardwired — free of dust and debris to ensure reliable performance.</p>
<p>We spoke with Steve Ferraina, a veteran firefighter for the City of Los Angeles who spoke about the importance of maintaining batteries: “While a hardwired system is optimal, it’s understandable that this type of system is not feasible for everyone. If you use battery-powered detectors, it helps to have a built-in reminder — like an automatic order — to check your units.”</p>
<p>Like many experts, Meiche believes that both photoelectric and ionization sensors need to be used in tandem, and if a consumer elects to use a battery system, separate units are the way to go. Ferraina also notes that more expensive is not necessarily better. “We used to give away smoke detectors for free. And as you’d expect, they were on the basic end of the spectrum. But the department would not have given them out if they weren’t excellent units.”</p>
<p>Field testing smoke detectors is by definition a hazardous endeavor that should be carried out in a controlled setting. The <a href="https://www.nist.gov/engineering-laboratory/smoke-alarm-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NIST</a>, a division of the US Department of Commerce, is involved in promoting innovation and competitiveness for domestic businesses. The NIST sponsors research papers relating to domestic fire alarm performance, along with establishing performance metrics to inform the development process for products and reduce the incidence of nuisance alarms.</p>
<p>In a NIST technical note <a href="http://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=901646" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Results From a Full-Scale Smoke Alarm Sensitivity Study</a>, T.G. Cleary and A. Chernovsky tested both photoelectric and ionization alarms in a variety of scenarios that varied fabric type (cotton and polyester,) ignition type (smoldering versus flaming), fire location and ventilation. They created a full-scale set at the NIST that included a smoldering sofa and created a matrix for response times under eight different smoldering scenarios.</p>
<p>Overall, the dual sensors performed the best in this study, but the findings for the single alarm types are quite important: the photoelectric sensor units significantly outperformed the ionization units for smoldering scenarios, while the opposite was true for flaming scenarios. Although a dual unit can perform as well or better than co-located separate units, the propensity for operator negligence in terms of replacing batteries makes it more sensible to go with single sensor units.</p>
<p>In 2012, the NBC television network affiliate in Dallas/Fort Worth performed a smoke alarm test with a smoldering sofa. The photoelectric sensors they tested took less than twenty minutes on average to trigger the alarm, while the ionization units took nearly three minutes longer on average — enough extra time for the fire to have already become free burning. In reviewing the results of the test, Don Russell, a professor at Texas A&amp;M noted that in some instances, ionization smoke detectors are simply too slow to respond to a developing fire.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs-one">Who needs a home smoke detector?</h2>
<p>The National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) estimates that there are 2,300 fatalities annually that occur in approximately 365,000 residential fires in the US. Having working fire alarms in a home is estimated to cut the risk of fire death by approximately one-half.</p>
<p>It is crucial to recognize that smoke alarms do not extinguish a fire, but merely detect the presence of a fire or potential fire. The principal function of a smoke alarm is to alert the occupant of danger and to allow them sufficient time to escape unharmed.</p>
<h3>Lifesaving home safety</h3>
<p>Smoke alarms are essential for home safety; they provide early detection that can prevent damage to property and life-threatening fire and smoke conditions. We probed the literature for recommendations about the safest approach to procuring and installing fire alarms.</p>
<p>As a life safety product, fire alarm testing is performed in settings where simulated fire and smoke conditions are created. The majority of research has therefore been conducted by government agencies such as NIST and <a href="https://www.nfpa.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFPA</a>, in addition to universities.</p>
<h3>Property protection</h3>
<p>The use of smoke alarms is regulated at the state and municipal level, and every jurisdiction has its own regulations pertaining to new construction and existing dwelling units. Additionally, many insurance companies mandate smoke (and CO) alarms as a precondition for providing home insurance. FEMA provides a current list of <a href="http://www.thewfsf.org/sap_usa_files/FEMA_StateSmokeAlarmRequirementsMay2010.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state-by-state requirements</a> and guidelines for using home smoke alarms. In addition, both First Alert and Kidde provide regulatory information on their home sites.</p>
<h3>New construction compliance</h3>
<p>For new construction, many states require smoke detectors to be hard-wired to a home’s electrical system, while battery powered units are sufficient for existing dwellings. In most cases, transferring property in instances where there is a lender involved will require that a home is equipped with functioning smoke detectors.</p>
<p>For small apartments that may only need to monitor smoke in one location, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001AMML0E/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Universal Security Instruments &#8211; SS-770</a> provides excellent ionization detection without an interconnect feature. Although the Universal unit is the most budget-friendly detector we tested (approximately $21/unit) it is the only one to use proprietary technology — Universal Smoke Sensing Technology — that detects both fast burning and smoldering fires. The Universal SS-901-2C uses a nine-volt battery versus the more commonly found AA batteries. The Universal would make a good companion to a photoelectric detection sensor that also uses a nine-volt battery.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>Like many home electronics products, smoke detectors are available with a dizzying array of optional features. While the essential purpose of a smoke detector is to make noise when smoke or fire is detected, there are many other options to consider. Our analysis of what consumers find most valuable includes the following features:</p>
<p><b>Power source:</b> The choice is between battery-powered versus units that are hard-wired into an electrical system. Battery powered units do not require installing wiring behind walls and are far more convenient to install. On the flip side, it is essential to regularly check and replace batteries and to keep the units clean.</p>
<p><b>Type of sensor: </b>Photoelectric sensors provide better detection for slow-burning, long-smoldering fires, while ionization detectors perform better in the event of fast burning, flaming fire. To safeguard your home, it is essential to have both types of units co-located at each required spot. There are many units that combine both types of sensors, but we do not recommend these in the even that they are disabled from nuisance false alarms.</p>
<p><b>Carbon monoxide monitor:</b> Having a carbon monoxide monitor included in a unit adds some cost, but it is an essential thing to have. One of the units — either the photoelectric sensor or the ionization sensor should also include a CO monitor.</p>
<p><b>Smart detection for the location of fire and smoke: </b>In the range of units that we tested, only one, our joint top pick First Alert model, provided a voice alert for the specific room location of a fire. For children or older people who may not respond as readily to a horn or beep alarm, this can be a desirable feature.</p>
<p><b>Silence buttons:</b> Anyone who has a working fire alarm and cooks is aware that now and then, a non-life-threatening cooking mishap can set off a nuisance alarm. Having a silence button makes it easy to temporarily halt the alarm — or multiple alarms if they are interconnected — rather than yanking out a battery.</p>
<h3>Hard-wired vs. battery powered</h3>
<p>For anyone who is not buying or building a new home or undertaking a substantial renovation of their home, battery-powered smoke detectors are a sensible choice. Over time, digital and wireless technology have made battery powered smoke detectors as sophisticated as their hard-wired siblings. Features such as interconnection, voice alerts, programming specific areas of a home and remote home monitoring are available in higher end battery powered units.</p>
<p>While there are many benefits to having a hard-wired system, including the ability to connect to a remote home monitoring service to automatically dispatch emergency help, this type of system is installed primarily to comply with local building codes. While battery powered smoke detectors are at risk for operator negligence in terms of battery replacement, one major benefit is that they will continue to operate in the event of an electrical interruption in a home.</p>
<p>More sophisticated (and expensive) battery powered units like the Honeywell 5808W3 are designed to link to central security panels and are even used for commercial installations. In effect, the Honeywell is a battery unit for people who want the sophistication of a hard-wired smoke detector but who do not want to rip into their walls.</p>
<h3>The Two Main Types of Smoke and Fire Detection Sensors</h3>
<p><b>Photoelectric sensors</b> work when smoke enters the alarm and deflects the light emanating from an LED beam. As the results of the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/publications/smoke-alarm-performance-kitchen-fires-and-nuisance-alarm-scenarios?pub_id=912596" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cleary NIST</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Five-Nights-That-Could-Save-Your-Life-Not-All-Smoke-Detectors-Are-Alike-133584358.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NBC</a> studies confirm, photoelectric sensors are more effective at detecting slow-smoldering fires, including fires that can smolder for hours before becoming inflamed. A common source of a slow smoldering fire is a cigarette butt left burning in a sofa.</p>
<p><b>Ionization detection</b> works by having a tiny amount — typically measured in units called “kilo becquerels” — of the radioactive material Americium 241, that acts to ionize nitrogen and oxygen to create a small electrical current that in turn triggers an alarm. The main drawback for ionization alarms is that they are prone to false/nuisance alarms and are consequently also prone to being disconnected. However, for free-burning fires, ionization detectors are generally more responsive than photoelectric models.</p>
<p>In research focused on the topic of disabled alarms, a study of smoke alarms in rural Alaska homes found that the incidence of nuisance alarms in homes with ionization smoke detectors was eight times higher than for photoelectric alarms. The danger of nuisance alarms was manifested by the fact that ionization smoke alarms were almost 5 times more likely to be disconnected 6 months after installation compared with photoelectric alarms.</p>
<p>A Texas A&amp;M study that took into account disabled alarms concluded that the probability of a fatality was 19.8% with ionization alarms when used exclusively, but only 3.99% with photoelectric alarms. Based partly on these findings, the International Association of Fire Fighters, the largest firefighter union in the world, supports legislation making photoelectric alarms a mandatory requirement for fire and building codes.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>Our testing involved basic, high-level testing in a non-laboratory (home) setting. Most extensive testing of smoke detectors involves either a university or institutional setting in which a highly controlled environment and scientific methodology can be employed.</p>
<h3>Battery test</h3>

<p>We inspected each unit out of the package to evaluate its convenience and basic design. The First Alert &#8211; SCO5CN came with two AA batteries already installed and immediately ready for testing. All of our tested units shipped with batteries included, which is good from a convenience standpoint, but leaves consumers guessing about how fresh they are.</p>
<p>Experts recommend that batteries should be replaced with an automatic reminder like being part of a battery shipping program or on one’s birthday. For long-life lithium batteries, it probably makes sense to check them once a year. Sealed units like the First Alert &#8211; “Atom” P1010 are designed to be discarded when they fail a battery test.</p>
<p>All of our units responded to the manufacturer’s recommended battery test by emitting a chirping or horn alarm.</p>
<h3>Interconnecting and programming</h3>

<p>Interconnecting smoke detectors allows for notifying occupants about a smoke or fire condition anywhere in their home. With linked (interconnected) units, if an alarm sounds in a bedroom, for example, all linked units will sound as well. Only the same model units can be linked.</p>
<p>Programming units generally refer to being able to assign a specific location to a specific alarm unit. In addition to triggering all the interconnected units in a home, programming provides a voice alert that denotes the specific room/location of a smoke or fire event.</p>
<p>All home smoke detectors have the basic functionality required to detect fire: when smoke or fire is sensed, an alarm sounds. Unit pricing is a function of added features, and the most important step up in pricing and functionality from basic units to more sophisticated ones is the capability for wireless interconnection. Basic units are generally in the $20-25 range per unit, while interconnectable units are more commonly in the $25-35 range like the First Alert and Kidde models we tested.</p>
<p>Another very desirable feature — especially for the more false alarm-prone ionization units — is to be able to temporarily silence a false alarm either through a voice command, pushing a button on the unit itself or either way. If you need to remove the batteries from a unit to silence it, clearly there is a risk that you will neglect to reinstall them and consequently not be protected.</p>
<p>We tested two units, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EVO7C2/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">First Alert &#8211; SCO501CN</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PC5S37K/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kidde &#8211; RF-SM-DC</a> that can be linked with other (same model) units. The First Alert is easily set up by depressing the main test button in sequence with the unit to be added. In addition, there are preprogrammed locations that allow a user to select the location for any room in the house. In the event of a fire or CO event, all the units issue a voice alarm noting the location of the fire.</p>
<p>The wireless setup for these units is different. For the First Alert, additional units can be added by going through a sequence of depressing buttons on the “original” unit and subsequently on the units to be added. The Kidde unit employs a more robust technology that allows the user to set a dip switch panel on the back of the unit to a common pattern. If left in default mode with all the switches off, the units will connect with one another. As is the case with virtually all home smoke detectors, different brands and models cannot be linked with one another.</p>
<h3>False alarm hush</h3>

<p>Our two top picks each have silence buttons that deactivate the units in the event of a false alarm. The First Alert &#8211; SCO501CN cooperated right away (both programmed units quieted immediately once the button was depressed), while the Kidde &#8211; RF-SM-DC required depressing the button for about one second. This proved a bit tricky; letting go of the button too quickly made the unit cycle through its programming options, and holding it too long didn&#8217;t silence the units.</p>
<p>The cute little <a href="https://www.firstalert.com/product/atom-photoelectric-smoke-alarm-with-10yrbattery" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">First Alert &#8211; Atom P1010</a> has a silence button that quiets the unit for 10 minutes. If the unit continues to send an alarm in a false alarm scenario, then it must be replaced since it is a sealed unit with a (long-life) lithium battery.</p>
<p>The sophisticated Honeywell unit we tested can be hushed by depressing its test switch. In the hair dryer test recommended in the manual, the test switch silenced the unit.</p>
<p>Our Universal Security Systems model, the least expensive unit we tested, does not have a silence feature. Since it is an ionization alarm, albeit with Universal’s proprietary “Universal Smoke Sensing Technology,” it is likely more prone to nuisance alarms than photoelectric sensors.</p>

<p>We recommend using two different units together as top picks.</p>
<p>The tandem of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EVO7C2/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">First Alert &#8211; SCO501CN</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PC5S37K/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kidde &#8211; RF-SM-DC</a> battery powered smoke detectors provides complete home fire and carbon monoxide protection when co-located at required locations throughout a home. Co-locating these units, one with a photoelectric sensor for slow-burning fires and the other with an ionization sensor for flaming fires, provides redundant protection in the event that one of the alarms is disabled from the removal of a battery due to a false alarm, or in the event that the batteries die in one of the units.</p>
<p>Together, our two top picks allow a homeowner to set up as many units as required throughout a home and have security in knowing that a smoke or fire event in one location will alert everyone at once.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EVO7C2/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-cta-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-cta-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-cta-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-cta-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-cta-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-cta-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-cta-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-cta-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-cta.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Top pick photoelectric unit: First Alert - SCO501CN</h3><p>The First Alert - SCO501CN is a breeze to set up, install and program. This photoelectric unit with interconnect capability can cover everything from a small apartment to a large home and protect you from smoke, fire and carbon monoxide with voice notifications. We recommend that this unit is paired with the Kidde - RF-SM-DC, our top pick for an ionization sensor unit.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EVO7C2/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Both of our top picks excel at their respective specialties: the First Alert &#8211; SCO501CN (photoelectric sensor) for detecting slow-burning, smoldering types of fires, like those that might originate with a cigarette butt in a sofa cushion, while the Kidde &#8211; RF-SM-DC (ionization sensor) is excellent at detecting fast burning flaming fires.</p>
<p>One of the key reasons we recommend the First Alert &#8211; SCO501CN is for its voice alert feature, which is more likely to wake a child versus a sound alarm. This unit is extremely well and extensively reviewed by consumers and has a very friendly user interface. This unit is simple to test, program and uses AA batteries that can be tested easily. And to top it off, it can be programmed to voice announce the specific (room) location of a fire.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PC5S37K/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kidde-alarm-cta-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kidde-alarm-cta-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kidde-alarm-cta-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kidde-alarm-cta-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kidde-alarm-cta-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kidde-alarm-cta-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kidde-alarm-cta-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kidde-alarm-cta-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kidde-alarm-cta.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Top pick ionization unit: Kidde - RF-SM-DC</h3><p>The Kidde - RF-SM-DC is an ionization sensor wireless unit with interconnect capability that is very sensitive to detecting fast burning fires, and like the First Alert - SCO501CN is simple to set up, install and program. We recommend pairing it with the First Alert unit to provide complete home protection from fire and smoke events.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PC5S37K/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>While the Kidde &#8211; RF-SM-DC has a voice alert for the type of detection (fire or CO), it does not announce a specific location. However, it is a highly responsive ionization unit that pairs well with the First Alert because it also can be interconnected with other units. The Kidde is a natural partner for the First Alert &#8211; SCO501CN since it also uses AA batteries, and can be interconnected to multiple units throughout a home.</p>
<p>Our recommendation for both types of units — photoelectric and ionization — is reinforced by the official policy position of the <a href="https://www.nfpa.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFPA</a>, a leading fire protection educational and advisory association and learning resource. Along with the venerated consumer safety and compliance organization <a href="https://www.ul.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Underwriters Laboratory</a> (UL), the NFPA’s official position is the consumers need both types of sensors in their homes. All the units that we tested carried one of UL’s certification marks. The inclusion of this mark means that representative products have satisfied UL’s requirements.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The best protection comes from having two separate units — one using ionization sensor technology and the other photoelectric; both of our top picks function best with one another since they have complementary types of sensors.</li>
<li>The photoelectric First Alert &#8211; SCO501CN has many features and functions just as well as more expensive hardwired units as long as batteries are checked frequently and the unit’s kept free of dust and dirt.</li>
<li>The ionization Kidde &#8211; RF-SM-DC is a breeze to program and gives the security of very rapid alarms for fast burning fires.</li>
<li>Programming for alarms to announce specific rooms/locations of a smoke or fire event is desirable, but not essential; the First Alert &#8211; SCO501CN has this feature.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Universal Security Instruments &#8211; SS-770</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001AMML0E/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Universal Security Instruments &#8211; SS-770</a> scores high marks for plug-and-play simplicity in an inexpensive package. Lacking interconnect capability, the instructions, set-up and maintenance are relatively straightforward for this unit, although some reviewers have experienced a higher than normal incidence of false alarms. As expected for a lower price unit, there is no voice alarm or ability to silence the unit from voice or with a button on the unit.</p>
<h3>First Alert &#8211; P1010</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-17508 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010.jpg" alt="First Alert P1010" width="1890" height="1262" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010.jpg 1890w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-768x513.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-885x591.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-1000x668.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-320x214.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-885x591@2x.jpg 1770w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-320x214@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01A0M4EYU/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">First Alert &#8211; P1010</a> is an elegant little photoelectric smoke detector that uses a 10-year life lithium battery for a power source, and is the best-designed product in the category. The entire unit is approximately 1-¾” by 1-¾” and is barely visible, especially if it is mounted on a white wall. As with the Universal model, this unit cannot be interconnected and is recommended only for smaller dwelling units, and only if it is paired with an ionization sensor unit.</p>
<h3>Kidde &#8211; KN-COSM-BA</h3>
<p>The ionization sensor <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PC5S0PA/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kidde &#8211; KN-COSM-BA</a> includes a CO detector, but does not have an interconnection feature. We like it for its easy battery replacement and push-button hush feature. For a small apartment that only needs fire detection in one location, the Kidde &#8211; KN-COSM-BA would make a good companion for a photoelectric unit that does not have an interconnection feature. When pairing ionization and photoelectric units, it makes sense to find units that use the same batteries to put them on the same change cycle.</p>
<h3>Honeywell &#8211; 5808W3</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017KD4FA/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Honeywell &#8211; 5808W3</a> is in a somewhat different category from the other units tested in that it has the capability to be connected to a home monitoring system, such as the Honeywell 5800 series, that is connected to a local fire department. This photoelectric sensor is best considered for homeowners who are seeking to implement a whole home security system.</p>
<p>The Honeywell 5808W3 is the most expensive unit that we tested, and it can also be used for commercial installations with matching Honeywell monitoring receivers. It uses a 10-year life lithium battery, and the overall build quality is excellent.</p>
<p>In keeping with a unit that can cross over to commercial applications, the Honeywell has the least friendly user interface of all our tested models. The faceplate of the unit is a blank sheet of plastic with two LEDs, and to test the unit, a tool has to be inserted throughout the plastic housing.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>First Alert touts itself as “America’s Safety Company” and is headquartered in Aurora, Illinois. It sponsors a fire safety initiative called “Safe Kids USA,” and provides smoke detectors at a reduced cost for low-income families. Kidde is a division of United Technologies, a large, diversified public company. The company roots can be traced back to 1917 when it produced the first fire and CO detection system for ships.</p>
<p>Although there are battery powered smoke detectors that can do everything in one package, we strongly recommend that consumers install two different types of units — one using ionization detection technology, and another using photoelectric technology — in each pertinent location in their home.</p>
<p>Our two top picks for a battery powered smoke detector, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EVO7C2/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">First Alert &#8211; SCO501CN</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PC5S37K/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kidde &#8211; RF-SM-DC</a> represent two top performers from the dominant industry players in the smoke detector market. These units work well together since they employ different fire and smoke detection technology: photoelectric sensing for the First Alert and ionization for the Kidde.</p>
<p>We believe that consumers will be delighted with the First Alert &#8211; SCO501CN, a top performer for critical photoelectric smoke and fire detection. Its voice notification, interconnection capability and programmable, room-by-room functionality make this a cornerstone of your home protection strategy when combined with an ionization detector like the Kidde &#8211; RF-SM-DC.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter testing seven top products over four weeks, we found that the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ECHYTBI/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Infant Optics &#8211; DXR-8</a> is the best baby monitor overall. Great image quality and unmatched motorized camera controls make this much better than all the cheap models, and without sacrificing battery life or resorting to touch-screen controls. If you’re not ready to spend more than $160 for a baby monitor, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CZUD4R8?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hello Baby &#8211; HB-24</a> is half the price of our top pick and still offers enough video quality to be very usable, but you lose the motorized control.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>As always, we looked around at other reviews and guides to see what features are must-haves and what’s just fluff. The Wirecutter prioritizes image quality and battery life, while reviews.com focuses on ease of use; The Bump is all-in on premium features like sleep quality tracking.</p>
<p>We considered unorthodox ideas like using a GoPro or an old smartphone as a baby monitor, but the success of those ideas really depends on what equipment you already have; we wanted to get a clear recommendation that will work for <i>everyone</i>.</p>
<p>We didn’t test any wearable vital-sign monitors, either; we’re not judging you if you feel that you need to constantly monitor your infant’s blood oxygen level while they sleep, but many physicians note that <a href="https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/babymonitors.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s not going to help with SIDS risks</a>.</p>
<p>We narrowed our list down to video monitors for less than $200 with good reputations and essential features. On the higher end of that price bracket we looked for nice screens and motorized camera movements. On the budget end, the screens are smaller and you don’t get fancy controls, but we found models with all the essential features and more.</p>
<p>Some features, like noise alerts or thermometers, weren’t available on a few models, but all the video monitors we tested can link up with extra cameras and they’re all great at seeing in the dark.</p>
<p>We also bought one Wi-Fi based camera to test the state of internet-transmitted video monitoring, and we talked in-depth with a fellow parent who’s also a security expert to see what extra risks come along with a “smart” camera.</p>
<p>We included two audio-only baby monitors, since we know some parents just don’t want to put a camera in the nursery. (You’ll also save some money if you skip the camera.)</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs a baby monitor?</h2>
<p>Nap time is the reason we own baby monitors. By the time your little bundle of joy is sawing logs mid-afternoon, you’re usually more than ready to take a break and do something other than sit quietly in the corner. A baby monitor lets you close the door (so you can make some noise) without worrying that you’ve abdicated responsibility. We love our babies, but it’s great to be able to love them from the comfort of a downstairs sofa while they’re asleep in their cribs.</p>
<p>Fear of “what might happen” is also a big driver of baby monitor sales: the original <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/r/isamu-noguchi-radio-nurse-baby-monitor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Radio Nurse”</a> was created by designer Isamu Noguchi for the Zenith Radio Corp. after parental paranoia peaked in response to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindbergh_kidnapping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lindbergh baby abduction</a> of 1932.</p>
<p>Some worry that a monitor might make you more neurotic about nap time rather than help you relax. If you can hear or see anything that happens behind a closed door, though, you’re less likely to interrupt a nap when checking on your baby, and that’s good for everyone. A baby monitor works great in tandem with <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-white-noise-machine/" rel="noopener">a white noise machine</a> to keep your baby from being disturbed without making it hard for you to know if something happens in the room.</p>
<p>Two of our testers for this comparison are dads working from home, and they’re not alone: 3.9 million employees are now telecommuting at least half of their work hours, which amounts to almost three percent of the U.S. workforce. (And that doesn’t even include freelancers.) A video monitor doesn’t mean you can double up and watch your baby while you’re on a call or working at your computer, but if you’re tag-teaming with another caregiver a video monitor can make life much easier.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Video monitoring:</strong> Not everyone wants a video camera in their nursery, but being able to see as well as hear what’s going on can be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Motorized camera adjustments:</strong> The more expensive video monitors will allow you to aim the camera with your remote, which is helpful if the camera needs to be in an awkward position or if you’re monitoring a “baby” who’s big enough to get up and run around the room.</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Manufacturers often list straight-line, no-interference transmission range, but in the real world of concrete walls and wireless interference those numbers probably don’t tell you much. We found that the stronger signals were more stable through walls (from a detached garage, for example), but all of these monitors are usable in a two-story townhouse.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life:</strong> Like range, the number you see on the box might not match your actual experience. The good news: these monitors all have enough battery life to cover even the longest naps. We tested each monitor under the same conditions to make sure you have a fair impression of their relative longevity.</p>
<p><strong>Display size:</strong> With a video monitor, there’s a big difference between watching a blurry lump and being able to clearly see your baby.</p>
<p><strong>Temperature monitor:</strong> If you’re in a different room you may want to keep an eye on room temperature, especially if you live in a place like California where you’re not using a thermostat all the time to maintain room temperature. None of the thermometers we tested had better accuracy than three degrees Fahrenheit, but it might add to your peace of mind.</p>
<p><strong>Wake on noise:</strong> Most of these monitors will wake up from screen-off “sleep” when there’s a sound above a set threshold. (The LeFun WiFi camera is motion activated instead, and our top pick does not have this feature.)</p>
<h2 id="is-wi-fi-safe">Is a Wi-Fi baby monitor safe?</h2>
<p>We talked to a friend and fellow parent, Robert (aka <a href="https://twitter.com/_p0pr0ck5_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">p0pr0ck5</a>), who is a security researcher based in L.A. Being a security guy, he’s innately suspicious of the “Internet of Things” and all the unforeseen problems that come with it.</p>
<p>Now that most of us use Wi-Fi everywhere in our houses for everything from looking at cat pictures to streaming music, Wi-Fi transmission is practically free. Using Wi-Fi also means that you can see your monitor feed from work or your phone — even while you’re traveling. The internet is really the only way to get that kind of amazing flexibility.</p>
<p>Robert says this cheap-and-flexible approach creates the biggest risk. “Too often, IoT devices communicate with the internet without any encryption, making it easy to snoop on what your fridge has to say, what your internet-connected lights are talking about or what video stream your security cameras or baby monitor are sending to their provider.”</p>
<p>Even if your device uses encryption, the biggest risk is still security on the camera manufacturer’s side. Robert notes: “I can use a password that no human or computer in the universe could ever guess, but if my account provider isn&#8217;t handling my password securely, and <i>they</i> are breached by hackers, my ultra-secure password is worthless.”</p>

<p>Wi-Fi baby monitors rely on two-way communication between your camera and a server, and that means someone else might also be able to exploit mistakes that were made in designing the security protocols that should keep the cameras safe.</p>
<p>The worst examples of vulnerabilities are <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/hacking-the-ip-camera-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shockingly bad</a>: “back-door” access to a camera that can overwrite passwords or even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/06/large-botnet-of-cctv-devices-knock-the-snot-out-of-jewelry-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">install malicious software</a>. We checked the one Wi-Fi model we tested against common vulnerabilities, like an open telnet port or easy-to-guess root password. Our untrained tester couldn’t hack it, but is that enough?</p>
<p>Robert was quick to caution that this is a far cry from thorough investigation of the “full stack”: the website, the applications and the infrastructure being used to get video from your camera to a server and back to your laptop or smartphone.</p>
<p>Robert sums it up like this: “We don&#8217;t know the real security risks, because no one with the capacity to properly analyze these things from an unbiased perspective has the resources to do so — and if they do, they <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/security-researcher-to-be-jailed-for-finding-bugs-in-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most likely</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/marcus-hutchins-arrest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don&#8217;t have permission</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>“In a culture where new IoT devices constantly flood the market, consumer perception of function, affordability and integration with other IoT solutions is the main goal. Privacy and security simply are not a focus for the average consumer. Often (<i>very</i> often), the financial and timing costs far outweigh the value add [of a full-stack security audit.]”</p>
<p>After our testing, the value of a cheap-and-powerful device like a $40 camera doesn’t really seem to outweigh the risks. (Especially considering all the extra steps setting it up.) For now, our top pick has a local-transmission-only video camera.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Video image quality</h3>
[table id=261 /]
<p>For the most part, the limiting factor that determines how well you can see your baby with one of these setups is screen quality. The camera sensors in these monitors are pretty good at picking up detail, even in low-light environments. A bigger screen lets you see all of that detail, though it also comes with a bigger price-tag.</p>
<p>In addition to real-world testing in the nursery, we tried to get a more unbiased measurement of picture quality using a 1/4&#8243; grid test pattern. We measured how far away the camera needed to be in order to display the pattern clearly (with zoom turned on, if available). The best results came from the big motorized cameras with correspondingly large screens, while the little screens on more affordable monitors made it difficult to make out tiny details from far away.</p>
<p>All of these systems will work for you if you just want a rough idea of what’s happening in a crib, but it’s definitely nicer to be able to see facial expressions clearly on the big screens.</p>
<p>Night vision, surprisingly, was nearly the same across all of these cameras. Infrared sensitivity of digital camera sensors is very good, and the IR light emitters on the cameras do a good job of showing what’s a baby and what’s not in the dark. There was a much bigger difference in things like auto-white-balance adjustment, which is nice when it works, but is not as essential to your peace of mind.</p>
<h3>Audio quality</h3>

<p>Audio quality on baby monitors is pretty terrible, but that’s partly because the conditions are worst-case-possible: the microphone is relatively far away from what you’re trying to hear, and you can’t really filter or prioritize frequencies like telephones do.</p>
<p>Parents want to hear everything, but the most important sounds for a baby monitor to transmit (crying, crashes) are pretty easy to recognize even through a tiny and muffled speaker. If you want to calm your baby with the soothing sound of your voice while they’re waiting for you to come to the nursery, though, you might be disappointed.</p>
<p>The real stand-out in our audio tests was Samsung, but instead of being ahead of the pack as they were in the video tests, the audio components disappointed. Voices sound muffled on both ends, and the receiver is just hard to hear if there’s any noise around.</p>
<p>Typically, even poor sound quality is sufficient to hear your baby cry, so this isn’t a disqualification, but Samsung’s system would have ranked higher if they paid as much attention to audio quality as they did to video.</p>
<h3>Range and clarity</h3>
<p>Unless you’re using your baby monitor while camping on the open plains, range is going to be measured in frustration rather than distance. Range on digital wireless devices is basically an all-or-nothing scenario. If you can see the video feed, it’s crisp and clear; once you go beyond the range of the transmitter, the video starts to go blank and you’ll soon get a “no signal” or “out of range” warning.</p>
<p>We found that most of these monitors gave good connection quality in a small townhouse. The Levana shows its limits quickly, though: the feed dropped out frequently when we turned on the other cameras, and while it still picked up video from across the street with no buildings in between, it was by no means a reliable connection at the range limits.</p>
<p>The other three monitors were bulletproof in the house, but only the Samsung gave stutter-free connectivity out in the detached garage.</p>
<h3>Battery life</h3>
<p>For each video monitor, we charged the battery fully and turned off any screen timers to use as much power as possible, then waited for the batteries to run down.</p>
<p>If you need more than a few hours of screen time you should be able to hook up the charger, so even the 4-hour battery life on Samsung’s receiver is sufficient for real-world use. That said, the extra two hours provided by our top picks does make a difference if you forget to charge from one day to the next and want to sit on your patio during nap time.</p>

In addition to that extended battery life, the VTech shines through with top-notch audio quality even at long range.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007NG5UF4/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If you need to move around the house and can’t keep your monitor on a charger all the time, the Levana system will run for 13 hours with the screen on. That’s so far beyond ordinary needs that it didn’t really offset the video quality and range issues when we were ranking our picks.</p>
<h3>Temperature sensor</h3>
<p>For the units that have a thermometer, we compared the temperature to a stand-alone thermometer in the same location to see how accurate they are. The biggest error we saw was seven degrees Fahrenheit, which is not insignificant, but for an $80 camera it wasn’t totally surprising.</p>
<p>The high/low temperature warning is a handy feature that could tell you about something like broken A/C or heater systems, but don’t rely on it for anything critical. The HelloBaby was the only monitor that let us set custom high/low temperature thresholds.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-baby-monitor">Best video monitor: Infant Optics &#8211; DXR-8</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ECHYTBI/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DXR-8 from Infant Optics</a> is one of the most popular cameras on the market, with glowing reviews from many parenting sites. We like this camera too, and it’s our top pick for a good match of image quality, battery life and ease of use.</p>
<p>The screen isn’t quite as big as the Samsung touchscreen, but it’s almost as clear. The smaller 3.5&#8243; screen also means you get more battery life than Samsung’s 5&#8243; offering.</p>
<p>The camera also gives you a bit more flexibility with a screw-mount optical zoom adapter. If you’re just watching a cradle during naptime, the zoom shows more detail. In a few years when you’re monitoring a toddler, then you can take off that zoom lens and get a wider view so you won’t need to pan and scan as much to follow the action.</p>
<p>The range and quality of the image from this camera wasn’t quite as good as the Samsung setup, but we did like the audio from the Infant Optics hardware more than Samsung’s. The connection worked wherever we tried it in the house, and it was reliable all the way out to a detached garage.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ECHYTBI/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infant-optics-DXR-8-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infant-optics-DXR-8-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infant-optics-DXR-8-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infant-optics-DXR-8-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infant-optics-DXR-8-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infant-optics-DXR-8-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infant-optics-DXR-8-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infant-optics-DXR-8-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infant-optics-DXR-8.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Overall: Infant Optics - DXR-8</h3><p>The DXR-8 gets you all the key features in an easy-to-use package. Great image quality and motorized camera control make this much better than all the cheap models, but without sacrificing battery life or resorting to touch-screen controls.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ECHYTBI/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The game-pad-style controls were also easier to use than a touch screen, though remembering shortcuts for volume and zoom settings wasn’t as easy as it might have been with dedicated buttons for those functions.</p>
<p>If the only advantage offered by this model were a bigger screen, or pan/tilt control, or the zoom lens accessory or the better transmission range, then we might not have picked this camera as best overall. The fact that it’s better than the $80 cameras in all of these categories is not a small advantage, though. You’re not paying $100 more for any one feature, but for a better-quality package. That’s the kind of difference we like to see in a winning product.</p>
<p>The one surprising omission from this system is a wake-on-sound feature. There’s a feeding timer that can wake you every four or six hours, and an option to make the system warnings (low battery, lost connection) quieter, but no auto-wake. The screen can automatically turn off (to save the battery) after three or five minutes while the sound is still on for you to listen for anything happening, but you’re relying on the sound of your baby to get your attention.</p>
<p>This is a surprising omission, considering audio-only baby monitors have been doing vibrating/beeping notification of a crying baby for a long time now. If having the screen come on to notify you of a loud sound is a big deal, then the Hello Baby &#8211; HB24 (or the audio-only VTech &#8211; DM221 with vibrating notification) is probably a better pick.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ECHYTBI/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infant Optics &#8211; DXR-8</a> is a versatile package with all the essential features, plus a zoom lens add-on that nobody else has.</li>
<li>The image quality here isn’t quite as good as Samsung’s, but the controls and battery life are far better.</li>
<li>This is a solid setup, with good range and good sound quality sealing the deal.</li>
<li>The only feature that’s missing in sound-activated notifications so you can listen to Netflix without being worried you’ll miss any crying.</li>

<p>Compared to the 5&#8243; screens and motorized cameras on top-ranked models, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CZUD4R8?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hello Baby’s HB24</a> definitely made some compromises to get their price down to around $70. The essential functions, though, are all handled well.</p>
<p>The camera itself is compact and looks a little bit wobbly; we were surprised at how well it worked in testing, though. It seems clear that the limitations on resolution come from the small screen, and the low-light performance is great.</p>
<p>Hello Baby designed the most pocketable “parent unit” monitor/receiver of any that we tried. There’s no belt clip, but the fold-out kickstand works very well.</p>
<p>The tiny 2.4&#8243; screen is bright enough and clear enough to see what’s happening in a crib or watch a toddler playing in the next room, and the digital zoom lets you see a little bit more detail if you need to. Camera placement is definitely the key to making this system work well, but if you have reasonable expectations this system will give you what you need.</p>

<p>There’s a thermometer, eight lullabies, adjustable sensitivity for the sound-activated mode and even a timer that will beep to remind you about your feeding schedule if you don’t already have a plan for that.</p>
<p>Hello Baby’s audio quality is pretty good. There’s not much we can say about baby monitor sound quality except that your expectations should be low. The HB24 is better for both listening and talking back to your baby than Samsung, but that’s really not saying much.</p>
<p>In our transmission range test this model also sits right in the middle: it’s nothing amazing, but for monitoring a room on the other side of your house it should be sufficient. When we took the monitor out to the detached garage there were some spots where the signal didn’t come through, but we always found a spot where it worked.</p>

<p>Some parents don’t want video cameras in their nurseries, and we understand. There’s a good argument for a cheap, reliable audio monitor, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007NG5UF4/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">VTech &#8211; DM221</a> is a great example.</p>
<p>Audio quality in a baby monitor is not hi-fi, but this model lets you hear what’s going on just a bit better than the video camera systems. The big feature VTech brings to the table is that you can mute the speaker and let the parent unit notify you of loud sounds with “silent” vibration. You can set a “beep” notification, too, if you’re worried about falling asleep and missing notification from the baby monitor.</p>

<p>The battery life on this receiver is, at almost 18 hours, pretty astounding. The battery pack itself is nothing special; almost certainly it’s made from a pair of AAA-size NiMH battery cells and the connector plug in a plastic wrapper.</p>
<p>It did start beeping an occasional “low battery” warning after only six hours (less than halfway through the battery’s capacity) to remind you to top it up, but if you’re in a pinch it’s got a lot of reserve battery.</p>
<p>Since most people will be able to plug in at some point before elapsing six hours of baby monitoring, this should be more help than hinderance. Sadly, this means that even though it could comfortably run all night on the battery, you’ll definitely want to plug this one in before you fall asleep lest the battery warning wake you up. The occasional “beep beep” isn’t as loud as the notification that your baby’s crying, but it’s not something you want going off at 2:00 a.m..</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007NG5UF4/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">VTech &#8211; DM221</a> is a fully-evolved audio monitor. If you don’t want video, you don’t have to give up any of the useful monitoring features.</li>
<li>Range and battery life are top notch, and audio quality is as good as any baby monitor we’ve heard.</li>
<li>The low battery warning kicks in early, which is a bit annoying, but it’s usually not hard to have your monitor plugged in most of the day anyhow.</li>
<li>This is the only monitor we tested (other than smartphone apps) that gives a vibrating notification when there’s a loud sound, which can be a great feature if you’re watching a movie or talking on the phone during naptime.</li>

<h3>For the networking guru only: LeFun &#8211; Fi368</h3>
<p>We are tempted to recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00W9B1GT2/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LeFun Fi368</a> camera to more people, but there’s basically one thing stopping us: Wi-Fi itself.</p>
<p>As Wi-Fi-connected cameras go, this one is pretty solid. It has at least rudimentary firewall protocols built in, so it won’t just give itself over to you with easy-to-guess passwords like some other common cameras do. <a href="#is-wi-fi-safe">There are still risks</a>, but that’s true of all Wi-Fi home devices.</p>
<p>Setup is more work than for the non-Wi-Fi cameras, since you can’t tell the camera your Wi-Fi password directly. Instead, your phone will tell the camera your password with audio or a QR code generated by the control app. This setup process requires patient obedience of strange directions, and it is more than a bit creepy when your mobile phone suddenly starts loudly chirping/screeching and the camera gives a happy “bloop” in response.</p>
<p>If you’re fortunate enough to have ethernet cable run to a good spot for a baby monitor camera, then you can avoid that whole setup process and skip straight to setting up an account. Sadly, the camera does not take power-over-ethernet, but it will run off a USB port with the included adapter cable.</p>
<p>Once you’re networked and you’ve set up an account on MIPC.com, things are both great and scary. The web page is kind of slow and hasn’t been updated since NPAPI plugins were made illegal; there’s also no obvious “password reset” function and nothing that makes clear exactly what a “guest” account can or cannot do. It wasn’t clear what plugin it’s using to run video, but it worked on the Chrome browser we tested with.</p>

<p>We tested both the Android and Windows programs for controlling the camera, and they worked quite well, much better than the website. The apps will do everything a baby monitor should with your phone or computer: detect sound or motion and notify you, let you listen or talk back and let you control the camera pan/tilt motors.</p>
<p>If you’re planning to use this in a working-from-home scenario for nap monitoring, that’s pretty great. If you’ve got a spare tablet device around, it’s even better. If you’re expecting to run this from a public terminal or a restricted-access work computer, you might be out of luck.</p>
<p>As far as stories of randomly logging into other people’s nurseries or pranksters playing death metal in the middle of the night … it’s as unlikely you’ll be the victim of cyber pranks as it is that someone will throw a brick through your nursery window, but it’s still something you have no control over. This camera is more secure than a Chromecast (you need the serial number off the camera to even start connecting, you can&#8217;t just walk into range and see the camera pop up on your phone), but that’s not a high bar to clear.</p>
<p>If you’re confident in the security of your home network then this might be a great choice, but for some people the unknowns will be too many and the benefits too few.</p>
<p>The even uglier side of this is that while Wi-Fi works most of the time and enables amazing freedom in our use of the internet, it’s not always reliable for some of us. The thought of one more device to troubleshoot, whitelist or reboot is enough to assure us that the extra $40-$130 for a camera with a dedicated monitor is going to be justifiable for many of the people who just need a baby monitor.</p>
<h3>Samsung SEW3043</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-11108 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo.jpg" alt="the Samsung - SEW3043" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo-1500x1001.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>There were some great things about the Samsung SEW3043 video monitor, but on the whole, we just don’t recommend it. Since we tested Samsung has started including a second camera in this package, though the price has also gone up so it&#8217;s still a terrible value.<br />
<strong>Update: After we tested our original lineup in 2018, Samsung has stopped making baby monitors altogether.</strong></p>
<p>The range you can use this monitor at is great, and it was the most immune to interference or drop-outs. The screen is also the biggest, which makes it easy to see what’s going on in night vision mode. Combined with full pan/tilt control, this is a solid video setup on paper.</p>
<p>The performance perks come at a price, it seems: even with a giant lithium-ion battery pack, this monitor died after just four and a half hours of screen-on time. Battery life is sufficient in standby mode (where the screen only turns on for noise/motion) or if you leave it plugged in, but it’s disappointing compared to the life of the other monitors we tested.</p>
<p>Some little conveniences and features look good on paper, but turn out to be detrimental in actual use. For example: this monitor features a belt/pocket clip, but Samsung made it part of the snap-on battery cover. If you actually try to use the clip you’ll hear the monitor clattering to the floor after the whole battery cover pops off under the weight.</p>
<p>The touchscreen controls are also disappointing. It looks nice, and in 2018 maybe a new generation of parents find the icon-based on-screen menu more intuitive than our testers, but we mostly preferred the direction-pad-and-buttons interfaces on the Infant Optics parent unit.</p>
<h3>VTech &#8211; DM111</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-11102 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo.jpg" alt="holding the Vtech - DM111 near a laptop" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo-1500x1001.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JEV5UI8/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">VTech &#8211; DM111</a> is very much like the DM221, our audio-only pick, but stripped of every extraneous feature and $15 cheaper. VTech probably uses the same microphone in the nursery unit and the same speaker in the parent belt pack, but that’s all the DM111 really is. No two-way communication, no rechargeable battery, no vibrate alarm when your baby cries while you’re wearing headphones.</p>
<p>The DM111 doesn’t include any batteries, though it’ll run without them with the included wall adapter. It accepts standard love-them-or-hate-them AAA cells; we used high-capacity <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/90303880/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rechargeable batteries</a> for testing, and they ran for almost 14 hours. The receiver won’t recharge batteries when plugged in like the 221 will, so we think this is really only a sensible buy if you’re not planning to run it on batteries at all and you don’t want to have to think about the extra features of that model.</p>
<h3>Levana &#8211; Jena</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-11113 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo.jpg" alt="monitoring the Levana - Jena while playing piano" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo-1500x1001.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We nearly went with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008P8EZOG/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Levana &#8211; Jena</a> for our budget video option, since it has a few very strong design points. In the end, we eliminated it because it was the most susceptible to interference: when other monitors or cameras were turned on in the same room, the receiver would lose connection to its camera even on the other side of a wall or floor.</p>
<p>The range was good with line-of-sight or only one or two walls between camera and monitor, but at nearly the same price the Hello Baby system was more reliable and has better video quality. The Jena’s button layout also isn’t as intuitive as Hello Baby’s.</p>
<p>The Jena was very impressive in one test: for battery life, it bested all but the audio-only systems. Levana managed to get 13 hours of screen-on-time out of its 1800 mAh battery pack, and it comes with an easy-to-use charging dock, too. The Jena also has a belt clip that works, unlike Samsung’s silly clip that seems designed as a prank.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Baby monitors are tricky to test and recommend, since every parent will rely on a monitor in a slightly different way. Video monitors are becoming popular, though, and for obvious reasons: being able to see your baby is a big deal if you’re in the next room and you hear a sound.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ECHYTBI/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infant Optics &#8211; DXR-8</a> Video Baby Monitor has a great camera and a good remote monitor to give you control of the essential features. This isn’t a cheap monitor, and there are some features we’re surprised it doesn’t have, but the design is much better than the closest competition.</p>
<p>For those who can’t shell out more than $100 for a system, two choices really stand out: the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CZUD4R8/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hello Baby &#8211; HB24</a> doesn’t have the video quality of a top-dollar system, but it works well and has all the features you’d expect to see.</p>
<p>For audio-only monitoring with features like vibrating notification and two-way talkback, VTech has nearly perfected the baby monitor in the DM221.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e researched and tested the best pet gates on the market for dogs and cats. The<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001PYQWXY/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Safety 1st &#8211; Nature Next Bamboo Gate</a> was our favorite dog gate for its portability, ease of use and good looks. For more semi-permanent setups, the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XT30G4/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Summer Infant</a> is a well-built runner-up. We also really enjoyed using the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JJFNJK/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Carlson</a> because of its tall framework and small pet door that’s perfect for cats.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-chose">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We started our research by gathering information through online forums, review sites and retailers such as Amazon, to get a baseline for the most popular pet gates on the market. After careful consideration, we narrowed down our results to eight qualifying models to advance to our in-home test.</p>
<p>Having spent several weeks with each of the gates and testing them daily, we were able to simulate real world testing environments to produce reliable results. We recruited our 100-pound golden retriever as the feature pet for our tests. To help assess the gates, we identified four categories we found most important for pet owners to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ease of installation and breakdown</li>
<li>Locking mechanism effectiveness</li>
<li>Ease of walking through</li>
<li>Build quality</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-eight-best">Compare the best pet gates</h2>
[table id=13 /]
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>With our selection narrowed down to eight finalists, we began our testing by installing them throughout our two-story home. All of the pet gates were placed in high traffic areas to allow for frequent interaction. Over two weeks, we critiqued each product by installation times, locking mechanics, walkthrough accessibility and build quality.</p>
<h3>Ease of installation and breakdown</h3>

<p>There are two main styles of gates: pressure mounted and wall mounted. To avoid drilling holes in the walls, pressure mounted gates offer a great solution that utilizes tension between the walls to hold up the gate. Areas with woodwork like doorways or stairway posts are typically more sensitive to drilling.</p>
<p>Pressure mounted gates have a no-hassle installation process, taking approximately five minutes to put up. Place the four tension screws in each corner of the gate, extend them to the screws to the wall, then turn the tension wheels to secure the gate into place.</p>
<p>Wall-mounted gates, like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JN6304/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">North States</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004AUEJTE/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Evenflo</a>, are fixed to the wall with screws and drywall anchors (anchors not included) for full support. They offer full clearance from top to bottom when open. The absence of a bottom bar leaves us without worry of accidental tripping. Installation will require more precision work, taking approximately 5-10 minutes per gate. This also means removing them will be more time-consuming and require patching holes in the walls.</p>
<p>Extension panels are easy to install on all of the models. Each one connects to the main frame by a metal pin. The hole in each of the corners make it breeze for the pins to slide into. They do not require any other pieces and are held together by the tension.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001PYQWXY/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Safety 1st</a> gate is a pressure-mounted gate featuring a classic design without a swinging door. Its simplistic format requires no setup out of the box. Simply extend the length of the gate and lock the tension by pressing down the bars. When installing the Safety 1st gate against base molding, the bottom part of the frame is no longer flush with the top. This creates a slight bow and will slightly affect its tension, but still remains adequate for most applications. Fortunately the gate’s tensioning rods allow for ¼-inch micro adjustments to refine the tension.</p>
<h3>Locking mechanisms</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3852" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/auto-closing-pet-gate.gif" alt="GIF of auto-closing pet gate" width="900" height="507" /></p>
<p>Unless your dog has a thumb, all of the locking modules should fare well against your four-legged friends. In this category, we evaluated how well these components operate for humans. Each of the locking mechanisms should reliably open and lock without stutter.</p>
<p>To measure, we opened and closed each gate 30 times in succession to see how well they performed with exaggerated repetition. In addition, we kept the gates mounted in our house for several weeks to test normal day-to-day usage.</p>
<h3>Ease of walking through</h3>

<p>Gates are great for partitioning your pet from unwanted spaces, but owners should not feel confined by them. We should be able to walk freely through the gates when needed. For this test we measured the doorway opening on each of the gates. Simply put &#8212; the wider the gate is, the better it is, allowing for natural motion through the gate. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DCR5EKE/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin</a> gate shown above had an impressive door width of 22 inches for a pressure mounted model.</p>
<p>The wall mounted models, such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JN6304/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">North States</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004AUEJTE/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Evenflo</a> gates, offer the widest openings by design. Many of the pressure-mounted models require extra framing on either side of the door to keep its rigidity.</p>
<p>Even though the Safety 1st gate does not have a swinging door feature, the unit is able to disassemble and fold up quite easily. It is also lower to the ground with a gate height of 24 inches so stepping over the gate as needed is doable without requiring yoga moves. Even without a door, this gate remains quite accessible with the lower height.</p>
<h3>Build quality</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3854" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/build-quality-close-up.jpg" alt="build quality close up of Summer Infant gate" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/build-quality-close-up.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/build-quality-close-up-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/build-quality-close-up-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/build-quality-close-up-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/build-quality-close-up-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/build-quality-close-up-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/build-quality-close-up-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/build-quality-close-up-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/build-quality-close-up-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/build-quality-close-up-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>All of the gates we tested had metal framework with a few plastic components. Overall, we were pleased with construction quality out of the box.</p>
<p>Weight is a good indication of structural integrity, since the mounting screws are nearly identical with the pressure mounted gates. The added weight helps secure the framework against the floor. Most of the other pet gates ranged anywhere from 4-15 pounds.</p>
<p>If you have a large dog that likes to lean up on the gate, you may want to lean towards one of these heavier models. Wall-mounted gates do not have three points of contact (two walls and floor) when mounted, so large amounts of downward pressure should be avoided.</p>
<p>We also measured build quality based on the gates&#8217; susceptibility to scratches or biting. Our dog didn’t want to jump on our gates for this test nor would he feast on the metal bars, so we had to improvise. We used the tip of a screwdriver to simulate dog nails or teeth for this stress test. All of the models performed fairly well to light and moderate amounts of pressure, any more force would show a visible line in the paint. We didn’t find these marks to be distracting at all and no physical marks were left from the scratch test.</p>
<p>Over the course of several weeks we also made observations of normal wear and tear. We looked for scuff marks and discoloration on the framing and on the locking module. The same story was pretty consistent with all of the gates. Any plastic components were most susceptible to scuffs, but can usually be wiped down.</p>
<p>Finally we tested the rigidity of the frame bars by squeezing them as hard as we could, to see how easily they&#8217;d bend. Some larger and more eager pets have been known to weasel their way through poorly constructed metal bars. Most of the gates had no issues in our stress test, but the Carlson Extra Tall and Regalo flexed a little more than the rest. The added height on this gate may be the cause of the weaker frames.</p>

<p>Our top dog gate pick goes to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001PYQWXY/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Safety 1st</a> model because its features an extremely quick setup and excellent portability. The bamboo framing also allows for this dog gate to be extremely light at just over four pounds. Easily tuck away the gate in a closet or lean it against a wall when it is not needed. Not everybody wants a gate attached to a doorway at all times.</p>
<p>This dog gate has an impressive span of 28-42 inches, so it should have no problems covering hallways, doorways or openings in the kitchen. Its versatility makes it stand out from the rest and should be have a place in every dog owner&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>Not only does this gate provide solid functionality, but the contrast in dark panels and light frame make for a very charming look. The frame is constructed of bamboo and the panels are made from 100% recycled plastic! The Safety 1st gate takes on a “less is more” approach on this model and we absolutely agree. Even though this gate does not have a built in door or metal framework, its simplicity is a welcome contrast to many other pet gates.</p>

<p>The tension bars do not require complicated mechanics like a spring loaded trigger system, so we wouldn’t be surprised if this gate keeps its structural integrity for many years to come. Simply lift the tension bars to provide slack, line up the metal clip with the appropriate groove to create tension, and push down to lock in place.</p>
<p>With the right amount of pressure, the gate should stand firmly on its own with the rubber pads gripping the wall. The gate can be adjusted in ¼-inch increments to ensure a snug fit. One of the attractive features of this gate is that the setup and breakdown can be accomplished within a few seconds.</p>
<p>Of course there are a few considerations with this gate. Standing at only two feet tall, the Safety 1st gate is not ideal for cats or dogs that are eager enough to jump over this short partition. If a gate is needed for a high traffic area, a model with a swinging door may be more ideal to allow for a clear path. This gate is intended to be a quick and temporary solution and it does this very well.</p>

<p>For its reliable locking module, small pet door and extra tall framework, we easily recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JJFNJK/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carlson Extra Tall</a> gate for cat owners, but it can surely work for dogs as well. If you have both, then perfect! This gate towers over the rest &#8212; measuring 41 inches tall and includes a small pet door at the bottom. Many consumers report that the extended height deters many cats from jumping over the gate. If you need to provide access for your small pet to travel through freely, the small pet door offers that option.</p>
<p>The Carlson Extra Tall gate can fit in hallways and doorways from 29-34 inches, but can be extended by purchasing additional panels to cover larger openings. The door can only be swung in one direction, which is an important feature when using it at the top of the stairs for added safety. The doorway opening only measure 16&#8243; wide, which is on the smaller end especially for such a large gate.</p>

<p>The locking system requires two hands to operate when the red clip is fully engaged. This may not be of concern if the gate is used in an area with less traffic. If you plan on traveling through this gate frequently, we recommend not using the red clip so one-handed usability is still an option.</p>
<p>The Carlson Extra Tall gate locks and unlocks very consistently without issue. When engaging the lock, a large u-shaped component extends to nestle around another piece to hold it into place. Some of the other gates have much smaller latches that rely on spring systems to lock into place.</p>
<p>We would have liked to see the Carlson Extra Tall with thicker bars within the frame. Our stressed showed more bowing on this model than the others, but not to the point of major concern. The most eager pets may be able to bend the bars with enough force and will, but this should be a non-issue for most pet owners. Our 100-pound golden retriever didn’t think twice about maneuvering through the gate.</p>
<p>You’ll notice that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JJFNJK/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carlson Extra Tall</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001OC5UNA/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Regalo</a> pet gates are nearly identical and share the same design and building components. We could not find definitive information online that these companies are related, but the similarities in their products are too hard to ignore. However, we can distinguish that the Carlson brand is marketed towards pet owners, while the Regalo brand is intended for babies. We chose the Carlson Extra Tall over the Regalo for our favorite selection because of the addition of the small pet door.</p>
<h2 id="other-pet-gates">Other finalists we tested</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AX0LG64/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carlson Design Studio</a> gate’s locking mechanism was the easiest to use out of all the gates. The button release felt substantial and the lever only required a short pull to disengage the lock. With such a fluid locking system, the one-handed usability is great on this model.</p>
<p>We do not recommend the Carlson Design Studio pet gate for families with small children. After 48 hours with this gate installed, our one-year-old adventure-seeking son was able to open the gate on his own. He then repeated this action the next morning. We aren’t sure if this a measure of his intelligence or if the gate simply too easy to open.</p>
<p>The Carlson Design Studio gate is marketed as a pet gate, but we should clarify that it does not double as a baby gate. We are a bit disappointed that the gate is not safe enough to both purposes. The other gates that were tested in this series were all reliable enough to use for pets and small children.</p>
<p>Aside from not being suitable for use with children, the Carlson Design Studio&#8217;s metal construction feels rigid and does not flex when pulled. With all-steel construction, this gate is very durable against scratches and even teeth markings. This gate fits doorways 37.5 inches wide to fit most standard doorways, but a 4-inch extension is included.</p>
<p>The auto-closing door feature didn’t have enough tension to close consistently on its own. However, a gentle push would usually be enough to make sure the door is shut all the way. This is something to be mindful of so that you don’t simply assume the door will close every time.</p>
<p>Finally, the elephant in the room is the cherry wood finish at the top of the gate. This might not be for everyone, it certainly wasn’t the style we were looking for, but we can’t speak for everyone.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more semi-permanent gate with a swinging door, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XT30G4/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Summer Infant</a> model impressed us all with its build quality, easy one-handed use and auto-locking feature. Its heavy construction and bronze metal finish made for an impressive design. The bars within the frame are arranged tightly and are not vulnerable to bending when force is applied.</p>
<p>The only thing we would have liked to see on this gate would be a wider door opening: 17.5 inches is one of the most narrow doorways we’ve measured on a gate. This makes it a harder to maneuver, especially when carrying a child and/or bags. If it was marketed exclusively as pet gate, we may have a had a different perspective. Unfortunately the brand name carries the added expectations.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JN6304/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">North States</a> gate has an elegant bronze matte finish, lightweight swing and wide opening. This wall mounted gate looks and feels like an extension of the home rather than an afterthought. If you have a mildly tempered dog and don’t require a gate that supports a lot of weight, this could be a great model. Dogs who like to jump up on gates, might give the wall mounts a run for their money. For this reason we can’t fully recommend this gate to all dog owners.</p>
<p>For a simple pressure mounted gate with a door, look no further than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DCR5EKE/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin</a> gate. The main feature is the doorway opening at 22 inches, much wider than the other gates in its class. This allows for pass through without affecting normal stride. The metal framing is quite nice, but you can find more substantial models for the more ambitious pets. In many cases the Munchkin will perform very well and is also great for young children.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004AUEJTE/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Evenflo</a> gate’s locking module felt sticky and did not pull easily. It was also inconsistent in how much force was required to pull the door shut. This is unfortunate because we really liked the design language on this model. The door has a fluid swing and the frame bars felt more substantial than most of the other models. Coincidently the taupe paint color on the gate perfectly matched our walls, but it wasn’t quite enough to win us over.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001OC5UNA/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Regalo</a> gate shares many similarities with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JJFNJK/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carlson Extra Tall</a> because they stem from the same parent company. We will also note that the lever-locking module is not good for one-handed use. For that reason we cannot recommend this gate if you have small children.</p>

<p>We can easily recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001PYQWXY/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Safety 1st</a> gate as the best option for your pet gating needs. The design aesthetics are charming with the light bamboo frame and contrasting dark panels. When not being used it can be easily tucked away because of its small form factor. It doesn’t offer an intricate locking mechanism and it doesn’t stand as tall as some of the other gates, but it was enough to keep our 100-pound dog on one side.</p>

<p>If you need something more substantial, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XT30G4/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Summer Infant</a> has the toughest frame we’ve tested. The frame bars are incredibly rigid and will not bow or bend for any pet. Unfortunately the doorway opening was the narrowest at 17.5 inches, making it more of an obstacle if used in high traffic areas. The auto-close feature may also be sought after by some, but disliked by others. In the end, it comes down to personal preference, but we admire the build quality nonetheless.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JJFNJK/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carlson Extra Tall</a> gate remains to be the best option for cats because of its towering stature. Cats will require a ladder to get over this gate. The locking system performs reliably without hitch and the small pet door is a welcomed feature. Its simple, all-white design makes it easy to integrate into any home.</p>
<p>Each household is different and finding the right gate can make a difference in the quality of life for you and your pet. Assess your specific needs for you and your pet and hopefully one of our pet gate favorites will make your house a little more manageable with your furry friends.

				<description><![CDATA[We tested six of the best baby gates available on the market every day over multiple weeks to discover the North States baby gate was the best available.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter comparing thirty baby gates, we narrowed down the results to six finalists, which we tested daily over multiple weeks with the help of our adventure-seeking one-year-old son. We found that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JN6304/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">North States &#8211; Easy Swing and Lock Gate</a> is the best baby gate due to its build quality, ease of use and elegant aesthetics. With refined construction and a dependable locking mechanism, this gate is easily worth the five extra minutes for installation. Our runner-up is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DCR5EKE/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin &#8211; Easy-Close Safety Gate</a>, a great option if you want to avoid drilling holes in your walls.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-chose">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>There are absolutely no compromises when it comes to the safety of our children. This is why we spent several hours on forums, review sites and retailer sites including Amazon, researching baby gates. Amazon had an overwhelming selection of baby gates with four out of five stars and above, which we favored when making a selection. With so many great options we defined four categories we found most important when shopping for safety gates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ease of installation and breakdown</li>
<li>Locking mechanism effectiveness</li>
<li>Ease of walking through</li>
<li>Build quality</li>
</ul>
<p>We combed through both good and bad online reviews, polled parents and created an in-home labyrinth of gates for a full hands-on review, to find the best baby gate for your home. All in all, the gates we tested worked as advertised and we felt comfortable using them in our own home. However, a few gates inched ahead in build quality and ease of use, leaving us with clear favorites.</p>
<h2 id="the-six-best">Compare the best baby gates</h2>
[table id=12 /]
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Now that we have our six finalists, we paid careful attention to each gate from setup to breakdown. Over two weeks we logged installation times, stress tested the lock mechanics, measured the doorway opening, and carefully examined the build materials of each gate. The gates were set up in high traffic areas for two weeks so we could become fully familiar with each product.</p>
<h3>Ease of installation/breakdown</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gate-installation-logo.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>All of the gates come pre-assembled with the exception of the North States and Evenflo, which required wall mounting components. Of the ones we tested, there were two main styles of installation: pressure mount and wall mount — each offering varying levels of permanence.</p>
<p>Pressure-mounted gates (sometimes called tension gates) are easier to install because you simply extend the screws and twist the tightening ring to create enough pressure to hold the gates in place. Wall mounted gates require you to screw the brackets into studs in your wall. Installation and breakdown is a relatively quick process for both mount styles, ranging from five to ten minutes, but railings or molding sometimes makes finding a suitable location tricky.</p>
<p>Adding length to the pressure mounted models with the panel extenders was easy. The only concern with the extension panels is that they can potentially extend more than you&#8217;d want, leaving you awkwardly in between sizes — the adjustable pressure screws can only be extended so much to compensate for the gap before it starts to affect the integrity of the gate. We also found that the fully extended pressure screws also give an undesirable look.</p>
<h3>Locking mechanism</h3>

<p><strong>The locking mechanism may be the most important feature when looking for the best baby gate.</strong> We require this component to be reliable in both locking and opening, to keep our children safe while still allowing adults to travel freely. The gate should also have good one-handed usability for when the baby is in tow.</p>
<p>We tested each gate by opening and closing them 30 times in one sitting, then with normal usage over the course of the weeks of testing. In addition, we let our one-year-old son play with each of the gates to see if he could open them on his own.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JN6304/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">North States gate</a> was one of the top performers with a perfect score in our test. We appreciate its simplicity and fluidity, while still maintaining rigidness. This locking module requires pressing down on the locking wedge with a thumb and lifting up on the gate simultaneously. The gate easily slides back into the locking position by pulling or pushing against the brackets.</p>
<p>If you’re in the market for a pressure gate, we give praise to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DCR5EKE/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001PYQWXY/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Safety 1st</a> gates. The Munchkin&#8217;s locking module is a double trigger system that pulls back the locking pin when squeezed. It also performed with a perfect score in our test. The door easily snaps back into place with a gentle push or pull and no lifting is required.</p>
<p>The Safety 1st gate strictly relies on the pressure from the gates length, which can be adjusted in increments of ¼” to ensure a snug fit.</p>
<h3>Ease of walking through</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3367" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ease-of-walking-through.jpg" alt="open baby gate" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ease-of-walking-through.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ease-of-walking-through-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ease-of-walking-through-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ease-of-walking-through-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ease-of-walking-through-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ease-of-walking-through-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ease-of-walking-through-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ease-of-walking-through-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ease-of-walking-through-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ease-of-walking-through-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We should distinguish that <strong>all swing-open pressure-mounted gates require a bar running across at floor level</strong>. This is a structural piece to hold the gate in place when you open the gate. This is the only way these gates can work without drilling screws into the wall, which is a good thing, but the bar is a potential trip hazard.</p>
<p>Wall-mounted gates provide full clearance, but the walls will eventually require a patchwork of the drilled holes when the gates are no longer needed. These gates generally have wider doorway openings because it does not require the same amount of support framing as pressure mounted gates. We prefer not having to worry about tripping when carrying a child, but pressure-mount gates have their place.</p>
<p>Gates make great partitions, but the ability to walk through the gate is just as important. The last thing you want is to fight with a gate when you have a baby on one arm and a bag in the other. For this evaluation, we looked to see which gate has the widest openings.</p>
<p>The wall mounted NorthStates and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004AUEJTE/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Evenflo</a> don’t require a substantial amount of framing on either side of the door, making them the easy winners in this category, each gate spanning up to 42” and 48” respectively. The Munchkin gate has the widest opening at 22” for the pressure gates. It also features a door that swings both directions for convenience. If you plan on placing this gate the top of the stairs, there is a third lock that can be installed at the base.</p>
<p>Some gates on the market feature a door that will shut behind you as you walk through it, as seen on the Summer Infant model. To some, this may seem like a great safety benefit, while others may find that it gets in the way when you need the door left open to travel through with large items.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XT30G4/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Summer Infant</a> has a narrow door opening at 17.5”, as opposed to 19” and up on most other models. We often have to walk through the gate at an angle, especially when carrying a child. The resistance from the auto-closing door seems to get in the way more than it helps. The door makes a loud noise when it swings shut, so we recommend using this gate away from the baby’s room.</p>
<h3>Build quality</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3369" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/build-quality-close-up.jpg" alt="baby gate build quality close up" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/build-quality-close-up.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/build-quality-close-up-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/build-quality-close-up-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/build-quality-close-up-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/build-quality-close-up-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/build-quality-close-up-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/build-quality-close-up-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/build-quality-close-up-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/build-quality-close-up-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/build-quality-close-up-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>In this category, we looked at build materials and rigidity. We began by comparing weights, observing build materials and performing stress tests on the frame bars to see if they would bow.</p>
<p>Once again the North States baby gate takes claim in another category. Even with its all metal construction, it feels very lightweight and fluid in its swing. Even though the vertical bars were thinner than the other gates, they did not bend when pressure was applied against them. The matte bronze finish is elegant and looks great against hardwood flooring and neutral colored walls. The locking mechanism doesn’t rely on a cheap plastic module like some of the other gates.</p>
<p>The Summer Infant baby gate also gets high marks and for its heavy metal construction, weighing in at 21 lbs. Its framework is thicker than the other gates and will not bow or bend for anyone. Its extension panels also feel exceptionally sturdy.</p>
<p>The Evenflo model could have been on the top of our list as well with its clean lines and metal construction, but the build quality of the locking mechanism is too large and cheap feeling. To unlock the gate, you must squeeze the trigger and pull the locking module away from the wall. We found this motion to stick more often than we would like.</p>
<p>The dark horse of this group is the Safety 1st baby gate, made from durable bamboo and recycled plastics. We love that is made from eco-conscious materials while maintaining a clean and attractive look. Even though the Safety 1st gate is incredibly lightweight at 4.1 pounds, we were impressed with how tightly the pressure mechanics were able to grab onto the wall. We pushed and pulled on the gate to simulate a little more forceful than the strength of a toddler and the gate stood strong.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: North States</h2>

<p>Our research and tests indicates that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JN6304/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">North States baby gate</a> is the superior choice, providing value in both aesthetics and functionality. <strong>The North States gate had good marks in almost all the categories we tested with no major shortcomings.</strong> The refined build quality, light swing and dependable locking mechanism made for a very convincing argument.</p>
<p>The North States has a unique design with four independent mounting brackets anchored to the wall. With the hinge nestled along the wall, the gate is able to swing completely open, letting open the full width of the hallway. This especially comes in handy when carrying large items through this area. Even though it&#8217;s a permanent set up, the North States gate never gets in the way of our everyday routine. In contrast, pressure gates require tightening screws in the four corners, which can look quite jarring when they are bright silver and your gate is dark.</p>

<p>The Evenflo is also a wall mounted gate, but does not have the same minimalistic approach as the North States. It has additional framework on both sides of the door instead of independent mounting brackets, which doesn’t allow for a full wide opening.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3373 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanism-north-states.jpg" alt="locking mechanism on North States baby gate" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanism-north-states.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanism-north-states-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanism-north-states-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanism-north-states-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanism-north-states-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanism-north-states-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanism-north-states-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanism-north-states-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanism-north-states-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanism-north-states-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The two-part locking mechanism on the North States gate is one of our favorites to use. The button feels just as rigid as the first day we installed it. It performed very well in our stress test and have had no problems ever since. The gate makes a pleasant clicking sound when the components are locked into place.</p>
<p>The only weakness we found was the installation time. It took approximately ten minutes to install as opposed to five minutes with the pressure-style gates. We highly recommend using a measuring tape, pencil to accurately mount the wall brackets, and drywall anchors to securely mount the brackets. Take your time here, because this could turn a great gate into a less than average one. This gate ended up feeling like an extension of our home and have been using it exclusively in our own house since we finished testing.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The gate’s metal construction is strong but feels very lightweight in its swing.</li>
<li>Minimal wall mounts and extendable gate allows for a tailored design.</li>
<li>Reliable and snappy locking system.</li>
<li>Gate allows maximum doorway opening for easier passthrough.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-gate-without-drilling">Best without drilling holes: Munchkin</h2>

<p>If drilling holes into the wall is absolutely not an option, we’d gladly recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DCR5EKE/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin</a> baby gate. The locking mechanism is reliable and clicks into place every time. We also appreciate the larger door opening on this model compared to the other pressure gates. While carrying our son, we never worried about accidentally hitting his legs against the gate because the opening was too narrow.</p>
<p>The Munchkin gate took approximately five minutes to get set up, like all of the other pressure-mount models with a swinging door. They all come with four large screws to be placed in each of the corners. The padded end goes against the wall and the tightening screw can be turned to increase the pressure against the wall holding it up. This is a great solution for semi-permanent setups or areas where drilling into the wall is not ideal, such as doorways with woodwork.</p>

Of the gates we tested, it offers the widest clear opening. This gate also swings in both directions for maximum flexibility.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DCR5EKE/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The two-trigger locking module works very reliably, engaging fluidly every time we used it. When pulling or pushing the door into the locked position, it snapped into place every time with a satisfying click. The ability to swing the door both ways was convenient in frequently traveled areas. If you are planning to use this gate at the stop of the stairs, there is a stopper that is included to force the gate to swing only one way for safety.</p>
<p>In our extensive tests the Munchkin gate impressed, but it didn’t take the top pick for a couple reasons. First, we would have preferred the locking mechanism to be constructed with less plastic. Even though it functions well, it does not feel high quality. Second, the North States has the advantage of tailor-fitting many different sized halls and doorways. Extension panels can be added to the Munchkin gate, but it will not look as seamless.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001OC5UNA/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Regalo</a> baby gate didn’t score as highly because the locking mechanism requires two hands to operate if the lock is fully engaged. If one handed usability isn’t an important feature for you, then you may consider going with this model.</p>
<p>It’s possible that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004AUEJTE/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Evenflo</a> gate required a little more breaking in, but in our experience, the locking mechanism was not as fluid as we would have hoped. Without drywall anchors, this gate was visibly unstable. The tiny screws that lock the width of the gate could have been better constructed as well.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XT30G4/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Summer Infant</a> gate was well constructed with a heavy frame. It also looks quite nice with the arch above the swinging door. Unfortunately, we never got used to the narrow doorway. Otherwise, it was very sturdy and had a well functioning locking module.</p>
<p>We can’t go without mentioning the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001PYQWXY/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Safety 1st</a> gate, an excellent solution for your temporary gate needs. Its parts are constructed well and provide a secure partition. <strong>This gate was ready to go out of the box with no setup required.</strong> Being the simplest gate without a swinging door, it can be placed anywhere with an opening between 28” to 42”. Extend the gate long enough for the pressure to hold and lock it in place. We appreciate its versatility to fit anywhere in the house as needed. It is also collapsible and can be tucked away when not being used.</p>
<p>If you have base molding, note that the Safety 1st gate will slightly bow because it will hit the wall at different lengths. Placing the gate above the base molding to avoid the bow isn’t recommended because the floor cannot provide extra support. We didn’t find this to be a huge problem since the support was still adequate.</p>

<p>Overall we were impressed with many of the finalist gates we tested. The wall mounted <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JN6304/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">North States</a> gate was our favorite for most applications, with its simple but high-quality components. The lightweight metal design made this gate feel the least intrusive out of all the gates, while still maintaining toughness. By utilizing the wall as an anchor, the gate is able to pivot from the edge of the wall, allowing for more free space.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DCR5EKE/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin</a> gate gives a solid performance for the pressure gates. Its wide walk-through opening and reliable double-lock mechanism make this an easy choice. We liked that the door was able to swing both ways for added convenience. The metal and plastic build quality doesn’t feel quite as luxurious as some of the other models, but it was never meant to be. The plain white design and fluid functionality are what made it to the top of the list.</p>
<p>Parenthood is incredibly rewarding, but it doesn’t always come easy, especially when your little one is on the move. After spending an extended amount of time with a variety of quality gates, we easily recommend the North States and Munchkin to keep your home safe for your family.</p>
