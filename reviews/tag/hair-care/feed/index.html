								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e tested some of the best men’s hair gel on thick, straight hair and thin, fine hair to find out which ones have the most flexibility and holding power but also don&#8217;t make your head look like it’s been shellacked. The best men’s hair gel for all hair types is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009G7Z3XM/?tag=ybdhrgel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Johnny B &#8211; Mode</a>, and the men’s hair gel that gets you more gel for your buck is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PTB4CM2/?tag=ybdhrgel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gentlemen Republic &#8211; Refined Molding Gel</a>.</p>
<p>A primary ingredient in all hair gel is water, and combined with thickeners and emulsifiers, it creates a substance that’s easy to apply and makes your hair look well-groomed. Many gels also have alcohol in the top three ingredients, and with daily use, they’ll dry out your hair. A few gels, like our top picks Johnny B &#8211; Mode and Gentlemen Republic &#8211; Refined, are alcohol free, and these can be used frequently without damaging your hair.</p>
<p>Hair gel might not give you the textured, natural look for your expensive haircut, so we’ve also reviewed other <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-mens-hair-product/">men’s hair products</a> you might want to try instead.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>here’s a dizzying array of men’s hair products on the market, but finding the one that works best for you can be a frustrating and expensive trial-and-error experience. We experimented with a wide range of men’s hair products and determined that <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/American-Crew-Defining-Medium-Hold-Paste-3-oz/14662890" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">American Crew &#8211; Defining Paste</a> is the best product overall for grooming all hair types. If you have thick hair, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007CXWC4/?tag=ybdhairp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">American Crew &#8211; Fiber</a> will give your hair body and control with a salon finish.</p>
<h2>Important Features to Consider</h2>
<p>Our tester has thick, straight hair that’s been cut to lengths varying from one-half inch at its shortest to eight inches at its longest. This cut allows him to style his hair for an upswept formal look or a finger-combed casual look, which both need different hair products to achieve. The tested products can be grouped into the following categories:</p>
<p><strong>Pomade:</strong> Traditionally an oil-based product, most pomades are now water-based and have a gel-like consistency. Pomade can be applied to wet or towel-dried hair and usually has a high shine and strong hold. Generally, pomade is used on hair styles that are combed. Think Mad Men.</p>
<p><strong>Fiber:</strong> There’s actually no fiber in hair-styling fiber. It’s a blend of beeswax, lanolin, oils and other ingredients in the form of a hard paste. Fiber needs to be warmed between your hands before applying and is most effective on dry, short or medium-length hair. Fiber has a matte (no shine) finish and adds texture to hair so it can be molded into shape.</p>
<p><strong>Paste:</strong> Hair paste is the most versatile of men’s hair products. True to its name, it has a thick, paste-like consistency that can be applied to all types of hair and lengths. Once the paste is worked through, hair can be styled in any manner repeatedly after one application. Hair paste has a firm hold with a matte finish and no shine.</p>
<p><strong>Cream:</strong> This is one of the easiest hair products to apply and is often combined with pomade and fiber. Hair cream is lightweight and doesn’t have a strong hold, so dry or barely damp hair can be styled loosely for a more casual look with a matte finish. Creams work on almost any hair length, but because they don’t have a strong hold, they’re not ideal for a spiked-up hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>Spray:</strong> We’re not referring to hairspray, but to products that are marketed equally to men and women: sea-salt sprays. The salt in these light sprays absorbs oils and adds texture and body, giving medium-length or long hair a tousled, surfer look.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for hair gel, we&#8217;ve reviewed the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-mens-hair-gel/">best hair gel</a> in a separate article.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e tested twelve top curling products on different hair types, ranging from short and thin to long and thick. After countless curls and flips, we determined that the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXS1OXQ/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Xtava &#8211; Twist Conical Curling Wand</a> is the best curling iron on the market, though technically it’s a “curling wand.” Our testers universally appreciated the Xtava’s smart digital controls, ceramic tapered barrel, comfortable grip and overall sleek look.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>To select our eight curling iron finalists, we first looked at online reviews from respected retailers like Amazon, Sephora, Target and Bed Bath and Beyond. We used these reviews to determine what consumers look for in a curling iron and which brands are leaders in the field.</p>
<p>Next, we consulted subreddits such as /r/fancyfollicles, /r/beauty and /r/femalehairadvice. We also checked out reviews from authoritative 3rd parties such as Reviews.com. This info helped us further our understanding of important curling iron features.</p>
<p>We continued researching curling iron technical components, such as barrel material, barrel size and temperature controls. We also consulted a professional hairstylist with twenty years experience, Priscilla Bagby.</p>
<p>Priscilla gave us practical information about proper curling iron/wand usage and what features she looks for in each. She also helped us in our decision to narrow down our finalists to only 1-inch barrels. We chose 1-inch barrels because this size can serve a variety of hair types and can be used to achieve the natural-wave look that is currently popular.</p>
<p>With Priscilla’s help, we also decided to represent all three of the most popular barrel materials in our list of finalists: ceramic, titanium and tourmaline. This let us compare the efficacy of the most popular materials on the market. We also included a range of price points, from bargain to luxury, so that we could find the best curling options for any budget.</p>

<h2 id="how-irons-work">How curling irons work</h2>
<p>Curling irons and wands use electrical resistors inside the barrel to heat up and remove water from hair strands. This process of removing water from hair is commonly called the water-set process. This process can be easily understood if you think of your hair like spaghetti. When curling irons remove the water from your hair, the hair dries in a manner similar to uncooked spaghetti. However, when the hair reabsorbs enough moisture, it loses this rigid structure, like when you add your spaghetti to a pot of water.</p>
<p>This process of direct heat and water evaporation inevitably leads to hair damage, because it breaks down the amino acids naturally present in your hair. Easy steps can be taken to prevent hair breakage and excess damage when curling, such as using a heat protectant and not using an unnecessarily high temperature while curling. During our hands-on testing, our testers used heat protectant to avoid hair damage.</p>
<h3 id="irons-vs-wands">Curling irons vs. curling wands</h3>
<p>The primary difference between a curling iron and a curling wand is that a wand does not have a clamp to hold hair around its barrel. With a wand, you use your hands to secure your hair around the barrel. Some people prefer this because it can lead to a more natural looking curl. Curling wands also may have tapered barrels, meaning the barrel becomes narrower at its tip.</p>
<p>Our professional, Priscilla, prefers to use a wand while curling hair because it can be used to “give hair a more natural look.” However, she concedes that most amateurs are more comfortable using curling irons. Without the safety of a clip, users may accidentally burn their hands while securing hair around the wand’s barrel.</p>
<p>Priscilla explains, “One good [skin] burn deters most people [from wands] for good.” However, “mastery can be achieved with repetitive practice.” Also, most curling wands come with a heat-resistant glove to protect your hands from these types of accidents.</p>

<p>Proper technique is very important when curling hair, not only to get the best look, but also to ensure that you do not unintentionally damage your hair. Immediately before using a curling iron or wand, precondition your hair with a heat protectant.</p>
<p>It is also important to avoid unnecessarily high temperatures when curling hair.There is no “one-size-fits-all” temperature that works for everyone; the right temperature for you is based on your hair’s texture and thickness.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about which temperature to use, start at a low temperature (around 300 °F) and slowly increase it until you are able to set a curl with one 15-second hold around the barrel. Once you have your curling iron or wand set to the correct temperature for your hair, Priscilla recommends focusing on three main factors while curling: sectioning, angles and direction.</p>
<h3>Sectioning</h3>
<p>“Sectioning” refers to how you section off parts of your hair for curling. After using a heat protectant, make sure your hair is dry and detangled before sectioning hair with clips.</p>
<p>Priscilla explains that “natural looks will usually just require two sections.” She recommends creating one section above your ears and another below. More sections can be added for more glamorous looks, but don’t go overboard. “No one needs to do five horizontal sections,” Priscilla says. “It’s way too much curl and looks amateur.”</p>
<h3>Angles</h3>
<p>The angle at which you hold your curling iron or wand while your hair is wrapped around its barrel will affect your curl. Priscilla explains ,“Holding the barrel of your iron or wand on a diagonal will result in a more natural beachy wave pattern, horizontal will result in a more natural brushed curl, and vertical will result in a ringlet curl.”</p>
<h3>Direction</h3>
<p>The direction of a curl can either be toward or away from your face. The curl’s direction, coupled with the angle at which you curl it, can have a huge influence on the overall look of your hair.</p>
<p>For those wanting a natural, two-sectioned look, Priscilla recommends directing the top layer of curls away from your face and the bottom layer towards your face to “maximize volume.” However, if you want to create an even more “lived-in” natural look, alternate the direction of the curls throughout your hair to create “a more natural pattern.”</p>
<p>If you are looking for an old-school Hollywood glam look, Priscilla explains that you should begin on your bottom section by directing curls away from your face, holding your iron or wand at a vertical angle. Continue that all the way around until you end up on the other side of your face with curls that are now directed towards your face. “Pull a boars-head groom brush through and voila, you’re Rita Hayworth.”</p>
<p>“The biggest mistakes that I see with clients and stylists alike is the strong desire to run your fingers through the curl while it’s still hot,” says Priscilla. For curls that last, let your hair cool completely before brushing or applying product. “If you want to relax the curl, simply grab the end of the curl, stretch the curl and hold while it’s cooling.”</p>

<p><b>Barrel size:</b> Curling iron and wand barrels range from 0.5 to 1.5 inches in diameter. We chose to test all 1-inch barrels because they create a curl that is structured, but not too tight for most hair lengths. If you have very cropped hair, you may want to opt for a smaller barrel size; or if you have very long hair, a larger one.</p>
<p>Barrel <i>length</i> is also a consideration because it determines the amount of hair you can wrap around your iron. Standard barrels are usually around 5-7 inches long. Extra-long models can extend up to 9.5 inches, which can be helpful for people with very long hair. Shorter models, under 5.5 inches, are handy for those with shorter hair and/or those who want an easier to carry curling iron.</p>
<p><b>Temperature range:</b> Most curling irons can reach incredibly high temperatures upwards of 400 °F. However, these temperatures are not necessary for most hair types. You should check a curling iron’s minimum and maximum temperatures to make sure it can sustain your ideal heat.</p>
<p><b>Ionic: </b>Ionic curling irons produce negative ions to attract the positive water ions naturally present in hair. These ions promote frizz-free, shiny hair. All of the curling irons and wands we tested promote ionization, although they all have different barrel types.</p>
<p><b>Barrel material: </b>Most curling iron barrels are metal with a coating of one of the materials listed below. However, higher-quality irons are available that are completely comprised of ceramic or titanium. Gold and tourmaline are used as coatings for either metal, ceramic or titanium irons. Coated irons that have a metal substrate may pose durability issues over the course of years, as the barrel’s coating may wear off and cause hot spots of exposed metal.</p>
<p>Some curling iron manufacturers make proprietary blends of the following materials (for example, “tourmaline infused ceramic”):</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ceramic: </b>Ceramic is a material that heats up quickly and evenly, making it a great pick for curling irons.</li>
<li><b>Titanium: </b>The preferred material of our professional hairstylist, Priscilla, titanium curling irons heat up faster than ceramic irons and are lightweight. However, titanium curling irons tend to be on the pricey side.</li>
<li><b>Tourmaline:</b> Tourmaline is a semiprecious gemstone, which is crushed to coat the curling iron’s barrel. This material boosts the negative ions produced by the curling iron, which helps make hair smooth and shiny.</li>
<li><b>Gold</b>: Curling irons with gold-plated barrels heat evenly and prevent overheating, making them a good choice for frequent use.</li>
</ul>
[table id=164 /]
<p><b>Safety features:</b> Ever leave your house and think, “Did I forget to unplug my curling iron?” If so, you understand why an automatic shutoff feature helps your peace of mind. An important safety consideration, automatic shutoff ensures your iron is never left on for more than thirty minutes to an hour.</p>
<p>Other important standard safety features include heat-protectant gloves to protect hands and a stand to prevent the iron from burning your counter. All of our curling wand finalists came with heat-protectant gloves, and all of our finalists had some sort of stand.</p>
<p><b>Usability:</b> A curling iron that is too heavy or unwieldy may lead to hair damage/breakage. Overall usability refers to the the iron’s weight, handle ergonomics, cord length and intuitiveness of the controls.</p>
<p><b>Aesthetics:</b> A good quality, attractive curling iron means it won’t be an eyesore sitting on your counter.</p>

<h3>Hands-on curling</h3>
<p>To see if our finalists really delivered perfect curls, we had regular consumers put them to the test. After using each curling iron, our testers answered questions about the appearance, usability, results and overall impression of our finalists. Our three testers each had a different hair type ranging from short and fine to long and thick. Each tester’s unique hair type meant that they had a different ideal temperature for curling hair.</p>
[table id=166 /]
<p>All of our testers also had some experience with curling irons. Our tester with the least experience had used a curling iron a handful of times and had no experience with curling wands. Our tester with the most experience was familiar with both irons and wands and had used a wand on a biweekly basis.</p>
<p>Our testers largely preferred the curling irons with digital controls as they were clear, simple and accurate. In particular, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FVHH2H6/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neuro</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXS1OXQ/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xtava</a> were found to have the best controls, as their digital temperature controls are simple to use and have bright LED numbers that are easy to read.</p>
<p>Two of our finalists, Hot Tools and Mr Big, have dial temperature controls. Our testers appreciated the dial controls for their simplicity, but were disappointed with the smaller number of heat settings.</p>
<p>The Bed Head and NuMe both have only one heat setting. This limitation was universally disliked by our testers. The single temperature setting for both of these curlers was too hot for all of our testers’ hair. In fact, our tester with average thickness hair experienced smoke due to burnt hair follicles; to prevent further damage, we avoided testing on fine-hair.</p>
<p>The most intimidating curling iron for our testers was the Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curl Secret. This curler is unique in that it is an automated curling machine, meaning it sucks in a section of hair and curls it around an inner barrel. Although it required some learning, this curling iron turned out to be easy-to-use, but ultimately delivered lackluster results.</p>
<p>While not a fully automated machine, the Beachwaver also has a mechanism to twist hair along its barrel. Our testers with medium and long hair were able to get the hang of its barrel-twisting controls easily. However, the mechanism was useless for our tester with short hair.</p>
<h3>Barrel length</h3>
<p>We found that the advertised barrel lengths of our curling irons were often longer than their practical lengths. These advertized lengths often include the unheated tip (at the end of the barrel) as well as the small portion of the barrel located below the curling iron clamp. To determine the length of the curling iron barrel that can effectively be used to curl, we did our own measuring.</p>
<p>Take, for example the Anjou, which was advertised as a 6.3-inch barrel. While this measurement is technically correct, it is misleading. If you subtract the unheated end of the Anjou’s barrel and the bit below its clip, the part of the Anjou’s barrel that actually heats hair is 5.3 inches.</p>
<p>This size made the Anjou ideal for our short-haired tester, but was too small for our long-haired tester. On the other hand, the Mr Big Curling Iron is advertised at 9.5 inches but, practically, only 8 inches of its barrel can be used for curling. Our tester with long hair appreciated this extra length, but our tester with short hair found it too cumbersome.</p>
<p>From our tester’s experiences, we recommend looking for barrels that are 5.5 inches and longer if you have long hair. If your hair is shorter, you should look for 5.5 inches or less. While you shop, keep in mind that advertised barrel lengths probably include the iron’s unheated tip.</p>
<h3>Temperature range</h3>
<p>We used a thermometer attached to a thermocouple to test the highest and lowest temperature settings of our curling irons. Keep in mind that the accuracy of these thermometer readings may vary slightly, as they were not performed in a lab.</p>
<p>The Neuro proved to be the most accurate curling iron of our finalists. Its tested temperatures were within 1 °F of its advertised minimum and maximum specs.</p>
<p>Generally, the rest of our finalists tested a bit lower than their advertised temperatures but were within 10 &#8211; 15 °F. While 11 of our 12 finalists claimed to reach temperatures over 400 °F, we measured that only the Neuro, Hot Tools and Mr Big Curling Iron measured above 400 °F. So if you need very high temperatures to curl your hair, we recommend the Neuro as your best-choice curling wand and the Hot Tools as a solid runner-up.</p>
[table id=165 /]
<p>This heat setting test was particularly useful for the Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curl Secret. This curling iron has four clearly labeled heat settings, and one ambiguous setting simply labeled “POWER.” We found the Conair’s “POWER” setting to be around 270 °F.</p>
<p>The NuMe measured significantly below 410 °F, its advertised temperature, reaching only 343 °F. This underperformance was noticed by our testers, who were displeased with the NuMe’s curling results.</p>
<h3>Heating speed</h3>
<p>To test how long each of our curling irons took to reach its maximum temperature, we again employed the thermometer and thermocouple, along with a stopwatch. We found that the Neuro was our fastest curling wand to heat up, taking only two minutes and 42 seconds to reach 449 °F. The titanium barrel of the Neuro helped it to easily beat the competition in heat time.</p>
<p>The curling irons that heated up fastest were the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E68O4JU/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curl Secret</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B074QWJWTB/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mr Big Curling Iron</a>. The Conair took two minutes to reach 397 °F, and the Mr Big took two minutes and 41 seconds to reach 412 °F.</p>
<p>The majority of our finalists took somewhere between five to 10 minutes to reach their maximum temperature. The slowest to reach its maximum temperature was the NuMe which took over 10 minutes to reach 343 °F. This slow heat time is most likely due to the NuMe’s 100-percent ceramic barrel, a material that takes longer to heat up.</p>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<p>To score high on our overall usability, a curling iron should have simple controls, feel comfortable and lightweight, plus have a long cord. Our testers gushed over the grips of the Neuro and Anjou, which they found particularly easy to hold.</p>
<p>Our testers did not like the grips on the NuMe and Bed Head. They complained that these finalists lack grip texture and ergonomic shaping, and that they have a weight-balance issue which makes them unwieldy.</p>
<p>We measured each curling iron’s power cord and found that the Neuro had the longest cord at 9-feet long. The Xtava, Anjou, Mr Big Curling Iron and Beachwaver also had very long cords, all around 8 to 8.5 feet. The curling wand with the smallest cord was the Remington at 5 feet, 10 inches. However, cord length did no prove to be an issue for any of our testers, as they found even the Remington to be a comfortable length.</p>
<p>The lightest of our curling irons was the Vivid &amp; Vogue, which only weighs about 0.8 pounds (12.2 ounces). This makes the Vivid &amp; Vogue ideal to travel with, especially since it features dual voltage. Our testers thought this extra-light weight made the iron easy to use. The majority of our curling irons and wands range from 1 to 1.5 pounds, which our testers described as a comfortable weight.</p>
<p>The heaviest curling iron we tested was the Hot Tools at 2 pounds. This curling iron’s extra weight gives the impression of a quality tool, but two of our testers complained that this extra weight made it feel more unwieldy.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXS1OXQ/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xtava &#8211; Twist Conical Curling Wand</a> impressed our testers with its styling results. All of our testers gushed about the curls created with this iron, especially our testers with long and medium length hair. The Xtava’s graduated barrel helped our testers get natural-looking, tousled, loose curls.</p>
<p>This curling wand is a great choice for those who want the “natural curl” look. If you are looking for a bit more of a structured curl, you might consider opting for a straight-barrel version of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXS1OXQ/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xtava</a> or the Neuro discussed below.</p>
<p>Out of the box, our testers thought the Xtava looked sleek and smart with its all-black design. They were also highly impressed with its easy-to-use digital controls. The Xtava’s simple buttons and easy-to-read digital screen allow you to control the temperature from 200 °F to 410 °F in ten degree increments.</p>
<p>Our testers also liked that this wand displays its temperature while it heats up, so you know exactly when it’s ready to use. The Xtava took four minutes and 20 seconds to reach its maximum temperature, which we measured as 383 °F. This was an average heat time for our finalists.</p>

<p>While this 383 °F temperature is lower than the Xtava’s advertised maximum (410 °F), we believe it is within the margin of error for our testing. However, if you have thicker hair that should be ironed at temperatures above 400 °F, we greatly recommend splurging for the hotter Neuro. That said, the Xtava is a great choice for the majority of hair types that should be curled below 400 °F, including fine, normal and wavy hair.</p>
<p>The Xtava’s smart controls, plus its comfortable handle, made the Xtava very easy to use for our testers. In addition to the standard heat-protectant glove that comes with most curling wands, the Xtava also came with a good quality case that proved convenient to use.</p>

<p>The Xtava’s tourmaline-infused ceramic barrel measured 5.5 inches in length and tapered from 1.5- to 1-inch wide. This makes it great for medium- to long-length hair. Those with very short hair might opt for the smaller-barreled Xtava, which tapers from 1 inch to 0.5 inch wide.</p>
<p>The weight of the Xtava curling wand is pretty standard among its peers at 1.4 pounds. While this may not be a super-lightweight model, none of our testers complained of arm fatigue.</p>
<p>The only feature our testers thought could be improved in the Xtava is its heat stand, which is pretty small and can easily tip over. However, the Xtava comes equipped with other safety features, such as an automatic shutoff plus a good quality heat-protectant glove and case.</p>
<p>The Xtava’s appearance is sleek, black and serious. However its controls are friendly, and its curling results are flirty and fun. Despite the high quality of the Xtava, it comes at a bargain at around $20. To put the cherry on top, the Xtava is dual voltage, which means you can use it outside of the United States.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FVHH2H6/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neuro &#8211; Unclipped Styling Rod</a> is a straight-barreled curling wand. Our testers thought the Neuro’s expensive price tag is worth it for those with very thick hair, or for those who want a more structured curl. However, if you have thin, normal or moderately thick hair and are looking for a loose tousled curl, the Xtava is a better choice.</p>
<p>The Neuro’s high price tag is partly due its high-quality titanium barrel and smart digital controls. This titanium barrel heats up quickly and can reach an incredible 450 °F, the highest temperature of all our finalists. Therefore, if you have very thick or textured hair, this curling iron is probably worth the splurge.</p>
<p>All of our testers ranked the Neuro’s digital controls far above its competitors. This curling wand’s temperature range was 160 °F &#8211; 450 °F, which you can set in 10-degree increments. Its digital temperature was exceptionally easy to read, and its buttons were intuitive.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FVHH2H6/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neuro-cta-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neuro-cta-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neuro-cta-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neuro-cta-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neuro-cta-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neuro-cta-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neuro-cta-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neuro-cta-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neuro-cta.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Luxe Pick: Neuro - Unclipped Styling Rod</h3><p>If you have thick hair and a bigger budget, the Neuro is easy to use and highly effective. This professional-grade curling wand can create a variety of looks, and its titanium-plated barrel can reach a remarkable 450 °F.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FVHH2H6/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Our heat testing also revealed that this curling wand is exceptionally accurate, measuring within 1 °F of its advertised temperature. The Neuro was also the fastest curling wand to heat up, taking only two minutes and 42 seconds to reach 449 °F. Our heat testing data proved that the Neuro’s titanium barrel is worth the price.</p>
<p>The Neuro also comes equipped with other professional-grade features, such as a customizable automatic shutoff feature. This feature allows you to program the curling wand to shut off after whatever amount of time you choose.</p>
<p>The Neuro’s straight barrel is 5.5-inches long, which works well for a variety of hair lengths. Because its barrel is straight, our testers found that it can be used to get a slightly more defined curl than the Xtava. This curling iron works well for creating different types of curls based upon the angle of the iron and the direction of the curl.</p>
<p>The Neuro’s styling results and its professional features make it ideal for consumers looking to spend more to get serious curling power. Like the Xtava, the Neuro is dual voltage, making it a good choice for trips abroad.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Neuro &#8211; Unclipped Styling Rod’s titanium 5.5-inch long barrel heats up the fastest of our finalists, taking just under three minutes to reach 450 °F.</li>
<li>The Neuro was the most accurate of our finalists, measuring within 1 °F of its advertised temperatures, and its simple digital controls allow you to select temperatures in 10-degree increments (200 °F to 450 °F).</li>
<li>With a temperature range suited for a wide range of hair types, our testers found this curling wand extremely easy to use and were pleased with its styling results.</li>
<li>The $100 price tag of the Neuro is worth it for those with very thick hair who are looking for a structured curl.</li>

<p>Our testers with medium-length and long hair loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S28DKO0/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Beachwaver</a>’s automatically rotating barrel, which was unique among our finalists. The Beachwaver’s rotation is controlled by two direction buttons on its barrel, but you don’t have to use this feature if you don’t want to. However, our testers with hair past their shoulders found this feature very handy in getting strands to wrap uniformly around the barrel.</p>
<p>Our short-haired tester found the Beachwaver to be too bulky overall to use successfully. However, our other testers appreciated the Beachwaver’s large handle, which they said felt more ergonomic than our other finalists. The Beachwaver’s large buttons are intuitive, which make using its fancy rotation feature easy.</p>
<p>The Beachwaver’s lowest temperature setting was 290 °F, meaning that it’s unsuitable for those with very fine, color-treated or damaged hair. Our testers liked this curling iron’s digital temperature controls, which allow you to easily select the temperatures in 10-degree increments up to 410 °F.</p>

With its large handle, this curling iron is comfortable to hold and features intuitive controls.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S28DKO0/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Though the Beachwaver was advertised to reach 410 °F, we measured its highest temperature to be 398 °F. This measurement may be within the margin of error for our testing, but if you’re looking for a curling iron that easily exceeds 400°F, we recommend going with the Hot Tools instead. However, the Beachwaver is a great pick for the majority of average- to long-hair types that should be curled at settings below 400 °F.</p>
<p>This curling iron took six minutes and 30 seconds to reach its maximum temperature, an average time for our finalists.</p>
<p>The Beachweaver’s clamp is the smallest of our finalists, yet our testers found it very effective. This small clamp minimizes the crinkle sometimes left by a curling iron’s clamp. Its 5.5-inch long barrel creates attractive curls that our testers rated “above average.”</p>
<p>The main drawback of the Beachwaver is its high price point at over $100. However, its comfortable handle and smart, automatic-spin feature make it a great curling iron for longer hair. The Beachwaver also comes equipped with an automatic shutoff feature that turns off the iron if left unused for 30 minutes.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Beachwaver &#8211; S1 is a good choice for those with medium length or long hair.</li>
<li>This curling iron has an automatic rotating barrel that is easy to control and helps to create nicely styled curls.</li>
<li>Though hefty in size, the Beachwaver’s handle is comfortable to hold, and large buttons make using its fancy features easy.</li>
<li>This curling iron is our luxury pick, with a price point upwards of $100.</li>

<p>We found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073GG2WN4/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anjou &#8211; 1-Inch Curling Iron</a> is the best choice for shorter hair. Our testers thought the Anjou’s more manageable size (14.4 inches overall) and ceramic barrel made it a great overall curling iron. Our testers were pleased with the curls the Anjou made, and they proved the iron to be both effective and easy to use.</p>
<p>The Anjou’s ceramic barrel is advertised as 6.3 inches; however, our testers found that they were only able to practically use 5.3 inches of the barrel. This is because the 6.3-inch measurement includes the unheated end of the barrel, as well as the portion of the barrel below the iron’s clamp.</p>
<p>This posed a problem for our tester with the longest hair, which falls around her mid to lower back. This tester wanted a little more length from the Anjou’s barrel in order to fit more hair around it. However, our other two testers had no issue with the Anjou’s barrel length.</p>

<p>The Anjou also comes equipped with digital heat controls, which allow you to select the temperature in 10-degree increments from 200 °F &#8211; 410 °F. The Anjou’s buttons are very small, which our testers thought was a bit of a pain. However, the controls are very simple and allow for specific temperature setting. We found that the Anjou took about six minutes and 33 seconds to reach its maximum temperature, which was a pretty average heating time among our finalists.</p>
<p>This curling iron works well for most hair thicknesses, except for those with very thick or textured hair that needs to be curled above 400 °F. We measured its maximum and minimum temperatures to be 198 °F to 398 °F, just a bit lower than its technical specs. This slight temperature discrepancy was not noticed in our hands-on testing.</p>
<p>Weighing 1.2 pounds, this curling iron is relatively lightweight, which our testers thought made it easy to manipulate. This curling iron is also dual voltage, so you can travel with it overseas.</p>
<p>The Anjou is easy to use, features smart controls and offers great results, making it a great pick for those with short- to medium-length hair. To top things off, the Anjou is a bargain, costing only about $25.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Anjou &#8211; 1-Inch Curling Iron is a good choice for those with short to medium-length hair because of its more manageable size at 14.4-inch length and 1.2-pound weight.</li>
<li>This curling iron’s digital controls allow you to select the temperature between 200 °F to 410 °F, and our testers were pleased with the curls created by the Anjou’s 5.3-inch ceramic barrel</li>
<li>The Anjou works well for a variety of hair thicknesses, but it’s not the best pick for those with very thick or textured hair that needs to be curled above 400 °F.</li>
<li>The Anjou comes at a very reasonable price point, costing only around $25.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/conair-reg-titanium-ceramic-1-inch-barrel-curling-iron/1041281284?Keyword=curling%20iron" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curling Iron</a> came in just behind the Anjou in its overall testing score, ranking above average with most of our testers. Our tester with the shortest hair especially liked the Conair’s smaller size and lighter weight.</p>
<p>The Conair’s barrel is made of ceramic-infused tourmaline and measures 5 inches long. This length worked well for our short- and medium-length hair testers, but it was too small for our long-haired tester. Overall, our testers ranked the curls created by the Conair as average.</p>
<p>The Conair lost points in its low-quality appearance. Its light weight (1.08 pounds) and — as one tester described it, “Aquaman-blue” handle — contributed to this overall impression of cheaper quality. However, when you consider that the Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro was able to yield average styling results for an incredibly cheap price at just around $20, it’s easy to forgive the Conair’s appearance.</p>
<p>The Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro’s controls are simple but do not offer the specificity of a digital curling iron. The Conair allows you to select the temperature at five different presets. If you select only “POWER,” the curling iron reaches about 275 °F. Beyond that base setting, your other options are 310 °F, 330 °F, 360 °F and 400 °F.</p>
<p>The Conair took an average length of time to reach its maximum temperature, six-and-a-half minutes. Our measured temperatures for the Conair were a bit lower than the specified minimum and maximum temperatures. This curling iron works best for those with normal or thick hair. Because of its limited temperature range, it’s not a good pick for those with very thin or very thick hair.</p>
<p>Overall, this curling iron is a solid budget pick as it offers average styling results with easy-to-use controls and at a friendly $20 price. This curling iron is better suited for those with short to medium-length hair because of its shorter barrel.</p>
<h3>Hot Tools: 1-Inch 24k Gold Curling Iron</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00176B8BG/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17432 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k.jpg" alt="Hot Tools curling iron" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></a></p>
<p>Our testers thought that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00176B8BG/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hot Tools &#8211; 1-Inch 24k Gold Curling Iron</a> was an overall average curling iron. Like the Conair curling iron, the Hot Tools delivers average styling results. However, during our temperature testing, this curling iron reached one of the highest temperatures of our finalists, heating up to 405 °F. Therefore, if you have thick hair and are looking for a bargain, the Hot Tools is a solid-choice curling iron.</p>
<p>The Hot Tools relies on a dial temperature control system, which is simple, but lacks the accuracy of digitally controlled irons. This curling iron also heated up in a reasonable amount of time, taking about six minutes to reach its maximum temperature.</p>
<p>In addition, the Hot Tools price is very affordable, falling just under $30. It has an easy-to-grip handle and a gold barrel, which measures 4.25 inches. This was our heaviest curling iron, coming in around 2 pounds. When curling a lot of hair, this extra weight can turn hair curling into an arm workout. Overall, the Hot Tools is a solid curling iron, but it lacks the professional features and exceptional results to make it one of our top picks.</p>
<h3>Remington &#8211; Pro Curling Wand</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-17437 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro.jpg" alt="Remington Pro curling wand" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>While our testers were happy with the loose curl that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010AIHKF4/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Remington &#8211; Pro Curling Wand</a> creates, they were less than impressed with this wand’s temperature display and plastic handle. Our testers wished the Remington’s digital temperature display was brighter and more readable and that its handle had a better stand for holding the wand while hot.</p>
<p>The Remington reached its maximum temperature quickly, taking only four-and-a-half minutes. However, we measured the maximum temperature a bit below the advertised 410 °F. If you have extremely thick or textured hair, this is not the wand for you. However, it does work well for all other hair thicknesses that can be curled at a setting under 400 °F.</p>
<p>This curling iron comes at a good price, around $25. However, the Xtava &#8211; Twist Conical Curling Wand comes at a similar price point and offers more professional features and better performance. Therefore, the Remington would only be a good choice if the Xtava was out of stock.</p>
<h3>Mr Big Curling Iron &#8211; 1-Inch</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-17434 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big.jpg" alt="Mr Big curling iron" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, our tester with long hair appreciated the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B074QWJWTB/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mr Big Curling Iron</a> the most, mainly because of its very long barrel that measures 8 inches. However, all of our testers thought that Mr. Big’s curling results were lacking and that its long clamp was unnecessary.</p>
<p>The Mr. Big Curling Iron was our fastest heating curling iron, reaching an incredible 412 °F in only two minutes and 41 seconds. However, because of this curling iron’s unwieldiness, we recommend opting for the Hot Tools if you have very thick hair and are looking for a curling iron that offers temperatures above 400 °F.</p>
<p>For its large size, Mr. Big is relatively lightweight, weighing 1.2 pounds. However, this iron is unnecessarily cumbersome to manipulate around your head, particularly for those with average-length hair. Even if you have long hair, there are curling irons which offer better results, such as the Beachwaver.</p>
<h3>Vivid &amp; Vogue &#8211; Travel Curling Iron</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-17438 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue.jpg" alt="Vivid and Vogue travel curling Iron" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Do you have short hair and travel a lot? If the answer is yes, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B074KG5FXK/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vivid &amp; Vogue &#8211; Travel Curling Iron</a> is a good option for you. If the answer is no, you should probably invest in a larger curling iron. This curling iron has a tiny 3.75-inch barrel and weighs less than a pound.</p>
<p>The Vivid &amp; Vogue has a very simple temperature switch that offers only high or low temperature settings. Its high-temperature setting measured about 350 °F, and its low setting measured 223 °F. This small curling iron took a longer time to reach its maximum temperature, clocking in at around eight minutes.</p>
<p>This extremely lightweight flat iron is simple and cheap, costing around $15. It is a solid flat iron for those with thin, short hair who travel a lot. However, its small barrel and overall lower quality make it a poor choice for everyday use or for those with hair that falls below their shoulders.</p>
<h2 id="others-not-recommended">Other finalists we do not recommend</h2>
<h3>Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curl Secret</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E68O4JU/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curl Secret</a> was the only fully automatic curling machine we tested. Initially, it visually and conceptually intimidated our testers. This machine requires hair to be placed inside two plates that are pressed together and then automatically curl hair inside a curling chamber. However, in practice the Conair was very easy to use and would not curl any piece of hair that was tangled.</p>
<p>This curling machine was extremely quick to reach its maximum temperature. We found that it reached 397 °F in two minutes. Because the Conair &#8211; Curl Secret only has two temperature settings, which we measured to be 372 °F and 397 °F, this curler is only suited for those with normal to thick hair.</p>
<p>Despite its ease of use, our testers were all dissatisfied with the curls produced by the Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curl Secret. Our tester with the shortest hair was unable to use the machine because her hair was not long enough for the machine to properly funnel into its barrel. Our testers with longer hair thought that their curls came out too crinkled. Therefore, we recommend spending time practicing your technique with a manual curling iron, rather than settling for the subpar results of the Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curl Secret.</p>
<h3>Bed Head &#8211; Curlipops Curling Wand</h3>
<p>To put it simply, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007ISRNJS/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bed Head &#8211; Curlipops Curling Wand</a> is too hot. When tested on hair of normal thickness, this curling iron burnt follicles to the point of producing smoke. With only one heat setting at 400 °F, our tester with fine hair was unable to try this curling iron due to risk of serious hair damage.</p>
<p>Our heat test showed that this curling iron’s advertised 400 °F temperature is accurate. At seven minutes and 20 seconds, it took a bit longer than average to reach its maximum temperature. This curling iron is suited for those with very thick hair that requires high heat.</p>
<p>The Bed Head iron also lacks an automatic shutoff function. Paired with its high heat, this deficiency poses serious safety concerns if you forget to unplug your curling iron. Even if you have hair that needs to be curled at this high temperature, our testers ranked this curling iron’s curls as slightly below average.</p>
<h3>NuMe &#8211; Classic Curling Wand</h3>
<p>Like the Bedhead, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B011LSFDE2/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NuMe &#8211; Classic Curling Wand</a> only has one heat setting, which frustrated our testers who all wanted more accurate controls. While its temperature is advertised to be a super-hot 410 °F, we measured it to be around 350 °F. That means this curling iron is only suited for those with hair of normal thickness.</p>
<p>Because the NuMe has a 100-percent ceramic barrel, it takes over 10 minutes to heat up to high temperature. This measured to be the longest heating time of any of our finalists.</p>
<p>Our testers also found the NuMe’s handle to be uncomfortable and thought it was unwieldy to use. This curling iron lacks an automatic shutoff, but still commands a higher price tag at around $70. We recommend you skip this curling wand and instead opt for either the affordable Xtava or the luxury Neuro.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Overall, we were pleased to find that you can get a great curling iron or wand without breaking the bank. With proven performance, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXS1OXQ/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xtava &#8211; Twist Conical Curling Wand</a> earns our pick for the best curling wand.</p>
<p>Our testers were impressed with the Xtava’s smart, easy-to-use, digital temperature system as well as its overall sleek appearance. This curling wand’s graduated barrel delivers a tousled curl that our testers universally appreciated. The Xtava comes with professional features, such as an automatic shutoff and dual voltage, yet only costs around $20.</p>
<p>On the more expensive side of curling wands was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FVHH2H6/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neuro &#8211; Unclipped Styling Rod</a>. This curling wand was loved by our testers because of its smart digital controls, quick heating time and salon-quality results. This curling wand has the widest temperature range of our finalists, ranging from 160 °F to 450 °F. That makes it suitable for a wide variety of hair types, and its straight barrel can be used to create a variety of looks.</p>
<p>If you prefer the clamp of a traditional curling iron, we have two top picks based upon the length of your hair. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S28DKO0/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Beachwaver &#8211; S1</a> scored well with our testers with average to long hair, who appreciated its auto-rotation feature.</p>
<p>The Beachwaver’s large handle is very comfortable and has large buttons that are easy to use. It also has smart digital temperature controls that can be set at increments of 10 °F. However, the Beachwaver’s lowest temperature is 290 °F, which means it’s not suited for those with very fine or damaged hair.</p>
<p>For those with short hair looking for a small-sized curling iron, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073GG2WN4/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Anjou &#8211; 1-Inch Curling Iron</b></a> is your best bet. This curling iron offers great results and smart digital controls for a bargain at approximately $25. This curling iron’s overall light weight and long power cord make it easy to use around your head. Its shorter, 5.3-inch ceramic barrel is well suited for those with short- to medium-length hair.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We tested eight of the best hair straightening brushes on the market to determine which straightened curly and wavy hair the best. Ultimately, the MiroPure - 2-in-1 was our top choice. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter hours of research, discussions with professional hair stylists and test driving products by straightening five heads of curly and wavy hair, we confidently recommend the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LZFH8PV/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> MiroPure &#8211; 2-in-1</a> as the best hair straightening brush. The brush glides through all hair types easily, while the included textured, heat-resistant glove helps provide tension. Our budget pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B4902PI/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">USpicy &#8211; FS005</a>, makes hair shiny and smooth at a more affordable price point, but its controls are harder to operate.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-chose">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>To begin with, we gathered consumer opinions from subreddits like /r/curlyhair and /r/naturalhair to learn which features in a hair straightening brush are most important to people with curls and waves. We read articles from well-known beauty magazines such as Allure to see which brands are making waves, and then we watched YouTube videos to learn how to use a straightening brush (and to see which brush the YouTubers recommend).</p>
<p>After that, we spoke with professional hair stylist and San Diego salon owner, Cindy Close of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Hair-Galleria-161277147258775/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hair Galleria</a>, to discuss how to use a hair straightener brush and which features are key. We also recruited a former stylist with coarse, wavy hair to be one of our testers. In this way, we learned about the mechanics of using a hair straightener brush, like how important tension is when straightening hair.</p>
<p>Armed with knowledge, we finally headed over to big box retailers such as Ulta, Target and Amazon to read consumer reviews and narrow down our choices. We only selected hair straightener brushes with at least a four star rating. Some of the hair straightening brushes use heated bristles, while some use hot air. We tested a variety of each style. Once we had our eight finalists, we spent several weeks testing on multiple people and conducting hands-on tests.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs a hair straightening brush?</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a straight hair look, but need a tool that causes less damage and maintains volume better than a traditional flat iron, a straightening brush may be the ideal hot tool for you.</p>
<h3>Flat iron pros and cons</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.conair.com/co/89/flat-iron-hot-brush-or-hot-air-brush-making-the-right-choice/341" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conair</a>, the pros to using a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-flat-iron/" rel="noopener">flat iron</a> are that it is simple to use and you can straighten your hair much more quickly than with a straightening brush. The cons are that the high heat levels can quickly dry out hair and the metal plates can heat unevenly and damage hair. Since they are so powerful, flat irons are best for thick, very curly hair.</p>
<h3>Hair straightening brush pros and cons</h3>
<p>If you have hair that is damaged or of thin to average thickness, you would more likely benefit from a straightening brush than a flat iron. A straightening brush uses heated plates and bristles to glide through dry hair strands. Brushes have lower temperatures and no hot spots (which flat irons can tend to have), and are better at maintaining volume as they straighten.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use">How to use a hair straightening brush</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >

<p>Heat is used to relax the hydrogen bonds in your hair, which changes your hair’s texture and allows you to straighten your hair by holding it in a certain position until the bonds reform.</p>
<p>Any kind of hot hair tool set above 120 ℉ can cause damage, and the impact on curly hair can be especially devastating. Using tools with a temperature that is set too high can cause <a href="https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/curls/this-is-what-happens-when-you-straighten-curly-hair" target="_blank" rel="noopener">irreversible damage to your hair</a> at a molecular level, changing natural curl patterns and leading to severe breakage. It is important to find the correct temperature for your hair type, starting with the lowest possible temperature.</p>
<p>There is no one single setting that works for all heads of hair. Our professional stylist recommends that you consider the condition and strength of your hair. For example, if you have fine, overprocessed or chemically treated hair, you should start with a setting below 300 °F.</p>
<p>For normal hair that has not been overly processed, she recommended staying under a temperature of 380 °F, while thick hair with no damage would be fine at 400 °F. Since determining the right setting can be tricky, it’s best to use a lower setting and work your way up if necessary.</p>
<p>Applying heat protectant before you begin can help minimize direct damage caused by heat. In our tests, we used a heat protectant with argan oil. Argan oil not only protects hair from the direct damage caused by heat, but it has the added bonus of protecting hair from <a href="https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/the-4-major-causes-of-hair-damage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">environmental factors</a> that damage hair. These factors include ultraviolet rays, wind, salt water, hard water build up and extreme temperatures (either too hot or cold).</p>
<h2 id="features-to-consider">Features to consider</h2>
<p>There are a few key things to look for when purchasing a hair straightening brush, and we’ll walk you through some of the most important features.</p>
<p><strong>MCH technology:</strong> MCH stands for metal ceramic heater, a new technology that uses 20 percent to 30 percent less energy than a PTC (positive temperature coefficient) heater. A tool with MCH heating technology reaches higher temperatures overall, at a faster speed (as quickly as 30 seconds). A hot tool with a PCB circuit board takes 45 seconds to reach the same heat.</p>
<p><strong>Ceramic technology:</strong> Ceramic is a composite material usually made of clay, which emits a non-damaging, far infrared heat. Far infrared heat is unique because it penetrates the hair shaft, making it the most efficient, gentlest way to heat hair. Ceramic also has unique heat conducting properties, so it heats up more quickly and evenly than dryers with metal or plastic heating elements.</p>
<p><strong>Ionic generator:</strong> Ionic iron produces negative charges, which create a smooth, shiny texture.</p>
<p><strong>Anti-scald:</strong> This feature ensures the heating element won’t come into contact with your scalp.</p>
<p><strong>Temperature range:</strong> Be sure to check for lowest minimum temperature. If you have fine or overprocessed hair, you’ll want to look for at least a minimum temperature of 300 ℉. Ranges above 400 ℉ are likely to be overkill.</p>
<p><strong>Usability:</strong> Are the controls easy to maneuver, and is it easy to set the temperature? Do the bristles hold hair in place without pulling or snagging?</p>
<p><strong>Auto shutoff:</strong> This is a great safety feature, so you aren’t second guessing yourself after you’ve already left for the office.</p>
<p><strong>Brush width and length:</strong> A smaller brush is recommended for curly or textured hair (allowing you straighten in small sections), while wider brushes can be a time-saver. Plate length also determines how long it will take to straighten your hair: the longer the plate, the more hair you can straighten at one time. In the end, it comes down to personal preference.</p>
<p><strong>Wet to dry:</strong> Our stylist consultant preferred wet to dry brushes because they pull less and don’t snag the hair. They’re also an excellent time saver and can significantly shorten your grooming routine.</p>
<p><strong>Bristle type:</strong> Silicone or rubber bristles help you work through tangles, while nylon may be better for those with a sensitive scalp.</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> If you’re going to use a tool on a regular basis, it should be something you enjoy looking at too.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Heating speed</h3>
<p>Since the highest heat setting we needed to use on our testers was 410 ℉, we used this temperature to determine how long it takes each brush to heat up for use. Once we set the temperature on the digital display of the straightening brush, we used a timer to count how long until each brush indicated readiness on its digital display.</p>
<p>While all of the models indicate when they are ready to use, we used an infrared thermometer to double check that they had reached their peak temperature when the brush indicated ready. We tested every 10 seconds until we reached 410 ℉ or its highest recorded temperature. We held it 6 inches away from the center of the brush, aiming it straight down onto the brush paddle.</p>
<p>In most cases, the digital display indicated the brush was ready to use long before it hit its peak temperature. The only brush that reached our desired temperature by the time the digital display indicated readiness was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0714J2X7T/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CNXUX &#8211; Hair Straightener Brush</a>. The CNXUX also reached its peak temperature the fastest.</p>
<p>We measured the temperature each of the brushes again after a full five minutes, to see if they ever reached their peak advertised temperature. While none of the brushes reached their true advertised temperature, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DT0K3P4/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InStyler &#8211; Straight Up</a> came the closest at 418 ℉.</p>
<p>Since the hot air brushes only have on/off settings, we didn’t measure heating speed, but we did gauge their heat output. We measured it the same the way we tested <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-hair-dryer/" rel="noopener">hair dryers</a>. After setting the brush to high and giving it a few minutes to warm up, we held the thermometer 6 inches from the center of the paddle to take our reading.</p>
<p>The Revlon &#8211; OneStep Dryer &amp; Styler and Lescolton &#8211; One Step Dryer &amp; Styler measured comparably (230 ℉ and 235 ℉, respectively), with a lower temperature than the majority of the hair dryers we tested for another article. Lower heat may make it more difficult to straighten thick or coarse hair, but it also means less damage.</p>
<h3>User experience</h3>
<p>One of the first things we considered in terms of user experience is weight. For example, we considered questions such as: does it hurt your wrist? Is it comfortable to hold for long periods of time? Our testers found the MiroPure &#8211; 2-in-1 and InstaMagic &#8211; Straightening Brush to be heavier than comfortable. These brushes may cause arm fatigue if you have long or thick hair that takes more time to work through.</p>
<p>We also considered the location of buttons, noting whether it was likely you would accidentally change settings during use. We also took note of whether the brush handle was long enough to avoid contorting your arm at awkward angles. Due to its recessed buttons and slim handle size, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LZFH8PV/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MiroPure &#8211; 2-in-1</a> won our votes as the most serviceable model. Perhaps the most bulky and cumbersome to use was the Lescolton &#8211; One Step Dryer &amp; Styler, which was so large as to be unwieldy.</p>
<p>Finally, we measured the cord length with a ruler and noted which brushes have a swivel cord. A swivel cord (the joint of the cord where it reaches the brush) makes the brush more comfortable and convenient to use, since it is less likely to get tangled as you are working. The InStyler &#8211; Straight Up had the shortest cord length at five feet. Generally we found that having a swivel cord made more of a difference in usability than cord length.</p>
<h3>Hands-on testing</h3>
<p>We asked five testers with a wide range of hair types (from thick to thin/damaged), lengths (short, medium and long) and curl patterns (from kinky to loose waves) to help us determine the best hair straightening brush.</p>
<p>For heat protection and to reduce frizz, we had each tester apply Eva NYC Mane Magic with argan oil before using any of the straightening brushes.</p>
<p>We had our testers rate each hair straightening brush on a scale of one to five (with five being best) for sleekness, smoothness and straightness. We also asked them to consider factors like how easy the brushes were to use, if they were heavy, and how well they were designed. Then we averaged the ratings for a final score. In the end, the preferences of the testers came down to hair type and less to do with tightness of curl.</p>
<h3>The results</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DT0K3P4/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InStyler &#8211; Straight Up</a> was rated the highest by our three thick hair testers. We already established that due to its higher heat levels, a flat iron is probably best for thick and very curly hair. However, if you have <a href="https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/seniors/do-gray-curls-have-their-own-hair-type" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gray strands</a> or color treated hair (making it drier, more porous and more susceptible to damage), these special considerations may make straightening brush your best choice.</p>
<p>Our testers with fine hair gave high ratings to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LZFH8PV/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MiroPure &#8211; 2-in-1</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0714J2X7T/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CNXUX &#8211; Hair Straightener Brush</a>. These models were less likely to catch and pull fine hair, but for the same reason, had less grip on thick or coarse hair.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B4902PI/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">USpicy &#8211; FS005</a> worked well on all types of hair, as it didn’t catch, but you could still get enough tension on thicker hair. The InstaMagic &#8211; Straightening Brush was the least favorite model, as it snagged on fine or long hair, yet didn’t straighten coarse hair despite a decent amount of tension.</p>
<p>Overall, our testers preferred the models using heated plates and bristles to the models using hot air. On the other hand, these hot air brushes had lower temperatures than the other straightening brushes, making them safer for those with fine or damaged hair.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">The best overall: MiroPure 2-in-1</h2>

After testing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LZFH8PV/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MiroPure &#8211; 2-in-1</a> on several heads of curly and wavy hair, we could see it gave the most consistent results across the board. It worked as well on fine, spiralled curls as it did on thick, kinky curls. Notably, it also left the hair the shiniest (perhaps due to the double ionic generator which seals the cuticles). Our tester with coarse, wavy hair found it didn’t straighten the ends as well as some of its competitors, so it may be best for users with fine to normal hair.</p>
<p>Users with fine to normal hair who are looking for shine as much as the straight factor will prize the MiroPure over our other top picks.</p>
<p>Not only did the MiroPure provide excellent results, but we loved it for its usability. It has a smooth, comfortable handle, and recessed buttons so you don’t accidentally change settings. For extra safety, it has a temperature lock and auto shutoff feature after 60 minutes. The swivel cord kept us from getting in an awkward tangle with the cord, making it more like a professional tool.</p>
<p>Finally, it comes with textured glove that makes it easy to grip hair, and a felt drawstring storage bag to keep everything together. According to our tester who is a former stylist, the glove was key to providing tension without burning your fingers. Our other testers found this bonus tool helpful as well, and the MiroPure is one of only two straightener brushes we tested that came with a glove. The bag was also a nice feature, since it helps keeps the bristles free of dust or debris.</p>

<p>While brush size is largely a matter of personal taste, we found that the 2.5 x 4 inch brush was the perfect size to work in small sections for tight curls, but also to straighten a whole head of hair efficiently. The brush has an anti-scald design so you don’t burn your scalp, and features cutting edge nanotechnology. We found we were able to get closer to the scalp with brushes with an anti-scald feature.</p>
<p>One of the things we really dug about the MiroPure was the number of heat settings. It has 16 different temperature settings, so it can be adjusted to a wide variety of hair types. The lowest setting is 300 ℉, so it is better for those with normal to thick hair. If you have very fine or damaged hair, the lowest heat setting on the MiroPure may still be too high for you.</p>
<p>Despite claims of reaching 450 ℉, the MiroPure only reached 395 ℉. However, the heat is evenly distributed so it straightens the whole section of hair being brushed, meaning fewer passes on the same strands. One thing we didn’t like is that at its highest setting (450 ℉), the brush smells like a hot glue gun. The good news is that most people will never need to set it that high.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The MiroPure &#8211; 2-in-1 has a double ionic generator, and it resulted in the shiniest strands during our hands-on comparison with other straightening brushes.</li>
<li>It has the most variable heat settings, with 16 different options from 300 ℉ to 450 ℉. This makes it best for people with fine to medium thickness hair, who want the wow factor in terms of shine.</li>
<li>The comb itself features nanotechnology, which manipulates atoms and molecules, helping to remove odors and microbes on the scalp.</li>
<li>The included heat resistant glove provides grip and tension for getting hair straighter, while protecting your hands and fingers from burns.</li>
</ul>

Despite its mid-range price, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B4902PI/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">USpicy &#8211; FS005</a> has the look and feel of a more luxury straightening brush. Since you don’t necessarily want a cheap straightening brush just because it’s inexpensive, we opted to name the brush with the most value as our budget pick. That would be the USpicy, with features like an anti-scald design, 360° swivel cord and automatic shutoff timer. If you have fine to normal thickness hair, you can expect nearly the same results as our top pick, albeit less shine. The lower price mainly means a sacrifice in ease of use with the controls.</p>
<p>It’s easy to use, and has an attractive matte black finish that makes it look like a quality tool. It comes with a glove to protect against heat and provide more tension, plus a cleaning tool and a storage bag. As we mentioned previously, the glove is extremely helpful to ensure the most tension.</p>

<p>It has cool tip ionic bristles, which helped us get closer to the roots. Our testers felt that the USpicy provides consistent heat, allows you to get the whole strand straight, and leaves less frizz. The controls aren’t as easy to use as our top pick, and we had to press each button multiple times before it would respond.</p>
<p>The handle is slim and the oval brush shape is 2.5 inches x 5 inches. It has fewer temperature settings than we might prefer, but it has the lowest heat setting (250 ℉), making it the best choice for those with fine or damaged hair.</p>
<p>One of the drawbacks to the USpicy is how easy it is to lock the temperature. It’s a useful feature, but we found ourselves accidentally locking the temperature even before we reached the setting we wanted. It’s a minor annoyance in an otherwise great design.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The USpicy &#8211; FS005 has a low heat setting, and at its highest setting, doesn’t get overly hot. This makes it a good option if you have finer hair.</li>
<li>It has a swivel cord for easy use and anti-scald design to prevent accidental burns.</li>
<li>With a matte black finish that isn’t easily smudged with fingerprints, the USpicy looks nice sitting on your counter and the provided drawstring bag keeps the brush and bonus tools in one place.</li>
<li>The USpicy, despite lower temperatures, left our testers hair straight, smooth and shiny.</li>

Perhaps because it has the truest temperature, reaching the highest recorded temp (418 ℉) of the finalists we tested, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DT0K3P4/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InStyler &#8211; Straight Up</a> was the favorite of our testers with thick tresses. It was also the only brush we tested that had an accurate “ready” indicator. It’s the most expensive model we tested, but our testers with thicker hair said they found it was worth the price.</p>

<p>The InStyler has a wider brush, measuring 3 inches x 6 inches, which is another reason it was preferred by those with thick hair; you can straighten a lot of hair quickly. It has cool tip ionic bristles, so the heat doesn’t touch your scalp, and each bristle is surrounded by ceramic plates: 65 in total. The heat is consistent and powerful, so you can tame even the thickest mane and finish long hair quickly.</p>
<p>One downside is that at its highest setting, it has the hot glue gun smell we mentioned previously. But again, at 450 ℉, it’s not a setting that most people will need to use. Also, and this is to be expected given its high heat levels, it took longer to cool down than our other finalists. We didn’t feel this was an issue, just something to keep in mind if you intend to store it immediately after use.</p>
<p>The InStyler does snag hair, so it’s best for those with thick or medium thick hair. People with thin hair may want to steer away from this brush.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The InStyler &#8211; Straight Up has a wider brush, so working through thick, coarse, or long hair is a breeze. However, it may not be best for those with fine hair since it can snag.</li>
<li>It has the highest recorded temp of the models we tried, which provided enough power to straighten the strands of our testers with thick hair in one pass.</li>
<li>Cool tip ionic bristles mean that you can get to the root without worrying about burning your scalp, and it leaves hair shinier and smoother.</li>
<li>With 65 ceramic plates, the temperature is even across the surface of the brush.</li>
</ul>

<h3>CNXUX &#8211; Hair Straightener Brush</h3>

We loved the design of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0714J2X7T/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CNXUX &#8211; Hair Straightener Brush</a>, with a slim profile, swivel cord, and square comb with ceramic bristles. The CNXUX heats up the fastest, and reaches close to its advertised temperature, with a high recorded temp of 410 ℉. It also has a faster automatic shutoff than the other finalists, turning off after only 30 minutes. Depending on how long it takes to finish your hair, this could be a plus or a minus, but we appreciate it for safety reasons.</p>
<p>We didn’t make the CNXUX our top pick because our testers reported that it leaves waves and isn’t smoothing enough. Despite a true temperature, it takes multiple passes to straighten hair because there is very little to no tension. The positive side to this is it doesn’t snag or pull hair, either. It’s a good option for those with fine hair and a loose wave that just needs a little help.</p>
<h3>Vidal Sassoon &#8211; VS433C</h3>

The majority of our hair straightening brushes have a paddle brush, but the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H2GG2II/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vidal Sassoon &#8211; VS433C</a> stands out for having a one-inch barrel-round brush that is ideal for creating volume. All of our testers agreed that it is better for styling than simply straightening. It can be used on damp hair, so it’s great if you need to save on time. The Vidal Sassoon is also very lightweight, making it ideal for travel.</p>
<p>It worked best on short hair and on medium length hair with a bob hairstyle, as it was able get closer to the root than our other straightener brushes. It doesn’t have heat settings, only a high/low switch, so it doesn’t offer much in the way of customization. For this reason, and the fact that it doesn’t work well on longer or thicker hair, it didn’t make our top cut.</p>

<h3>Revlon &#8211; OneStep Dryer &amp; Styler</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013HJEA4C/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Revlon &#8211; OneStep Dryer &amp; Styler</a> has a square-shaped paddle that our testers found ideal for blow drying, and ionic technology that left their hair smoother. It has flexible bristles that prevent tangling, so if you have found that most straightening brushes snag your hair, this model could be an ideal choice. On the other hand, our testers with thick hair found that it doesn’t provide enough tension to be effective.</p>
<p>With a paddle size of 4 inches x 5 inches, it appears bulkier than the dry straightening brushes, but it was still lightweight and easy to use.</p>
<p>We didn’t make this a top pick due to low ratings by our testers, but if your main goal is to cut blow drying time in half and smooth hair cuticles, the Revlon is still a helpful tool.</p>
<h3>Lescolton &#8211; One Step Dryer &amp; Styler</h3>
<p>You can use the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0714LHP8N/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lescolton &#8211; One Step Dryer &amp; Styler</a> wet or dry, making it a versatile option for someone who wants an all-one-tool for styling. In terms of features, the Lescolton has a lot to offer: nanotechnology (to inhibit bacterial growth), tourmaline technology and negative ion technology for faster drying with less damage. The bristles of the brush are even designed to work as a scalp massager, and the brush is very good at working through tangles.</p>
<p>On the other hand, our testers felt this would actually work better on straight hair, which just needs hot air to pass through and doesn’t require any tension. The same aspect that makes it good at detangling makes it hard to get enough tension for straightening. It tended to make curly hair fluffy, which could be great if you are looking for a volumizer, but was enough to keep it from being a top pick.</p>
<h3>InstaMagic &#8211; Straightening Brush</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ISW92FG/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InstaMagic &#8211; Straightening Brush</a> is different than the other brushes we tested because the bristles have a staggered formation rather than straight rows. This gives it the ability to grip coarse hair easily and provide tension. However, in the end our testers felt like it should have accomplished more with its grip. Additionally, the staggered bristles meant it snagged hair.</p>
<p>It is also one of our heavier finalists, and as one tester commented, “for the weight, it’s not doing much work.”</p>
<p>We had to read the manual to change it from Celsius to Fahrenheit (hold down the plus and minus buttons at the same time), so we didn’t find it as easy to use as the other models. What we did like about it: the swivel cord and wide plates for getting through hair fast.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>While the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LZFH8PV/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MiroPure &#8211; 2-in-1</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DT0K3P4/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InStyler &#8211; Straight Up</a> are priced slightly higher than their counterparts, we found they provided the most value of the finalists we tested. The MiroPure is the most versatile hair straightening brush we tested, due to a higher range of heat settings than a typical hot brush. It performs well on multiple hair types and curl patterns, providing consistently shiny and sleek results. However, it is probably best for those with fine to normal thickness hair.</p>
<p>The InStyler &#8211; Straight Up was a top choice among our testers with thick manes, since its powerful, evenly distributed heat meant fewer passes on even coarse or coiled hair. It is easy to use, and left our testers’ hair straight and smooth.</p>
<p>For the best value, we recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B4902PI/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">USpicy &#8211; FS005</a>. It has all the features of a more expensive pick and works well on fine to medium thickness hair. It is slightly more basic than our top pick, with fewer settings and not as sleek of a design. That said, the USpicy delivers consistently smooth results, has a low heat setting for those with damaged hair, and is a great pick at a middle of the road price.

				<description><![CDATA[We spent two weeks straightening curly, thick, thin and straight hair to find the best flat iron. Ultimately, The GVP - Ceramic Titanium Digital took first place. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n our quest to find the best flat iron, we spent two weeks carefully researching plate types, consulting professional hairstylists and testing six top products on five different hair types, ranging from thin and fragile to thick and curly. Ultimately, the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B077HL3Z57/?tag=ybdflat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> GVP &#8211; Ceramic Titanium</a> clearly distinguished itself as our top pick due to its accurate, easy-to-use digital temperature controls, comfortable grip and ability to make hair shiny and sleek.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We began our research by consulting online reviews from respected retailers like Amazon, Sephora and Ulta. These user reviews were used to understand what features consumers find important in a flat iron, and to determine which brands were leaders in their field. We read subreddits like r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide, and reviews from Wirecutter.com, and Reviews.com.</p>
<p>Before deciding which flat irons to test, we researched important technical components to consider in each flat iron, such as plate material, plate size and temperature controls. We also consulted a professional hairstylist with nearly six years of experience, <a href="https://www.amyneddermanhair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Nedderman</a>. Amy gave us practical information about proper flat iron usage, and what she looks for in a flat iron.</p>
<p>You may be wondering — <i>where’s the Chi</i>? Despite the recognizability of the Chi brand, we did not include a Chi flat iron in our six finalists because of lackluster reviews from consumers and professionals alike.</p>

<h2>How do flat irons work?</h2>
<p>Flat irons straighten hair by removing water from hair strands. This leads to “<a href="http://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/testing/efficacyclaims/Beating-the-Damaging-Effects-of-Heat-on-Hair-306144361.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">additional internal structuring</a>” which allows the hair to stabilize in a desired style. (When the hair absorbs enough moisture, it will return to its normal state.) This process of direct heat and water evaporation leads to hair damage, as it breaks down the amino acids naturally present in hair. The damage caused by flat ironing hair can also lead to the darkening of bleached or naturally light hair.</p>
<p>If you are able to straighten your hair using a hair dryer (check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-hair-dryer/" rel="noopener">hair dryer review</a> here)you should, as it is a much less damaging process for hair. However, the short-term styling benefits of a flat iron are often desirable enough to consumers to outweigh the damages associated with long-term flat iron use.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use">How to use a flat iron</h2>
<p>Simple measures can be taken to promote hair manageability and prevent hair breakage when flat ironing hair, such as preconditioning hair with a heat protectant. We used <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075FBD7CM/?tag=ybdflat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Moroccanoil &#8211; Perfect Defense </a> on all of our testers, per the advice of professional hairstylist, Amy Nedderman. However, while these products are described as “heat protectant” they cannot completely prevent the damage caused by using direct heat to style hair.</p>
<p>After using a heat protectant, Amy recommends detangling your hair, sectioning it off into clean sections then using a comb “in front of your flat iron to keep things clean as you work your flat iron toward your ends.” A flat iron that is set to the correct temperature for your hair should straighten hair in one fluid pass. Flat ironing hair too slowly or using multiple passes to straighten one section of hair can lead to unnecessary damage.</p>
<p>It is also important to avoid unnecessarily high temperatures when flat ironing hair, since it greatly damages it as we mentioned earlier. If you are unsure about which temperature to use, start at a low temperature and slowly increase it until you achieve the desired straightening results in one fluid pass. There is no ‘one-temperature-fits-all’ solution to flat ironing hair, as the right temperature will vary based on a person’s hair texture and thickness.</p>

<p><b>Plate size: </b>Flat iron plate widths typically range from 1 to 2 inches. We opted to test all 1 inch plates (with the exception of the BaBylissPRO that is 1.25”) because smaller plate widths are recommended for a wider variety of hair types. Very curly/textured hair should be straightened in smaller sections, meaning a smaller plate width is recommended. These smaller plates also can create more versatile styles. However, 2” plates are preferred by some because they straighten more hair at once, which speeds up your straightening routine. Plate length should also be taken into consideration, as it determines how much hair can be straightened at a time, and affects your ability to comfortably wield the flat iron. Average plate lengths from 3.5” to 4.25” are comfortable for most people.</p>
<p><b>Temperature range: </b>Flat irons are often advertised by highlighting the incredibly high temperatures they reach &#8212; often up to 450°F. However, temperatures above 400°F are not necessary for most people. It is important to check a flat iron’s minimum temperature, to ensure that the flat iron can be set to your ideal straightening temperature. You can find your perfect temperature by setting your flat iron on low, and gradually increasing the temperature until you are able to straighten hair in one fluid pass.<br />
<b></b></p>
<p><b>Ionic technology: </b>Ionic irons produce negative ions to attract the positive water ions found in hair. The result is frizz-free, smooth hair. All of the flat irons we tested promoted ionization, although they were different plate types.</p>
<p><b>Ceramic plates: </b>Ceramic plates heat up quickly and evenly. They’re also smooth, which means hair won’t snag or get caught. Check if a particular flat iron uses pure ceramic plates, or ceramic-coated metal plates since coated plates may chip over time and catch hair, or damage hair with contact to the exposed hot metal.<br />
<b></b></p>
<p><b>Titanium plates: </b>Titanium plates become <a href="https://karminhairtools.com/blog/flat-irons-tourmaline-vs-titanium-vs-ceramic-plates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely hot quickly</a>. They also emit more negative ions than ceramic plates, which helps to combat frizz. Titanium plates are also very lightweight. Flat irons with pure titanium plates are among the most expensive flat irons on the market.</p>
<p><b>Tourmaline-coated plates: </b>Tourmaline is a semi-precious gemstone, which is crushed and used to coat flat iron plates. This material is sought after because it also increases the negative ions produced by the plates — more negative ions means hair has less frizz and more shine.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic shutoff: </strong>Many flat irons include an automatic shutoff feature, so your flat iron is not left on for more than thirty minutes to an hour. This feature is an important safety consideration, and prevents amateurs and professionals alike from burning counters.</p>
<p><strong>Usability:</strong> Remember the importance of “one fluid pass” when straightening hair? If a flat iron is too heavy or unwieldy, it may prevent this fluid motion, and cause heat damage/breakage. This overall usability also takes into account the length of cord, and logic of controls.</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> If you flat iron your hair daily, it makes sense to have something attractive on your countertop.</p>

<h3>Hands-on testing</h3>
<p>All of our finalists promised the smoothest sleekest hair, but we had to test them with regular consumers to see if they really delivered. We had five different testers, each with a different hair type (silky and thin, wavy and fine, curly and fine, wavy and thick and curly and thick), try out each of our straighteners.</p>
<p>All of our testers had some experience with flat irons. Our testers with thinner, finer hair typically used straighteners less frequently, while our testers with thicker, curlier hair typically used flat irons more often. Each of our testers had a different ideal temperature range for straightening hair.</p>
<p>The ease of turning on and setting the temperature of our final six flat irons varied. All of our tester’s cited great frustration with the KIPOZI &#8211; 1 Inch Pro&#8217;s touch screen controls, which made even turning on and unlocking the flat iron a struggle. The HSI Professional controls also ranked very poorly with our testers, as they were located very close to the flat iron’s plates. This flat iron came with a glove for protecting your hands from heat, but our tester’s preferred a less perilous location for the controls. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B077HL3Z57/?tag=ybdflat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GVP &#8211; Ceramic Titanium</a>’s controls ranked highest among our testers because of their simplicity and the large temperature range they covered.</p>
<p>The Remington Pro  lost marks with all of our tester’s while warming up, as it emits an odor of burning plastic. Our experience was backed up by multiple Amazon reviews that mention the unpleasant smell. Though this flat iron was our most budget friendly option, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004INQ65S/?tag=ybdflat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair</a> was only ten dollars more, and greatly outperformed the Remington.</p>
<p>Drawing from their past experience using flat irons, all of testers naturally looked for plates that had a solid grip on hair without pulling, or having to squeeze your straightening hand too hard. Three of our testers gave the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RW0IBTS/?tag=ybdflat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BaBylissPRO </a> top scores for its ability to grip hair while straightening. However, the BaBylissPRO’s weight and boxy design outweighed the benefit of the plate’s grip for others.</p>
<p>The BaBylissPRO delivered quality hair results for our testers, but it does not seem worth the expensive price tag — particularly since our testers disliked the flat iron’s clunkiness, lack of ready light indicator and aesthetics.</p>
<p>To test the versatility of each iron, our testers also used each to create a wave or curl in their hair. The results of these tests were mixed, but generally our testers had the most success with the smaller, more rounded flat irons, such as the GVP, HSI, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003S516XO/?tag=ybdflat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Remington Pro</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, our tester’s were happy with the results from all of our flat iron finalists, but noted major differences in ease of use and design.</p>
<h3>Temperature ranges</h3>
<p>To determine the highest and lowest temperatures of our flat irons, we employed an infrared thermometer to measure the plate temperature at different settings. Our infrared thermometer had a 12:1 distance-to-spot ratio, so to test a half inch spot on the flat iron’s plate we held the thermometer 6 inches away and pointed it directly at the center of the plates. A caveat for all of our infrared thermometer readings &#8212; in order to point the thermometer at the center of the flat iron plates we had to angle the thermometer, which may have affected the accuracy our readings. The infrared thermometer is also not accurate on very shiny, reflective surfaces, so we were unable to rely on the readings for the BaBylissPRO that had very reflective plates.</p>
<p>Most of our finalists reached over 420°F, the highest temperature needed by our tester with the thickest hair. Temperatures above this are unnecessary for most, and using the top temperature, 460°F achieved by the Conair InfinitiPRO  is inadvisable for most, as it can do real damage to hair. Our tester with silky thin hair was unable to use the BaBylissPRO, or Remington Pro &#8211; 1&#8243; Flat Iron as their lowest heat temperatures were 300°F and 310°F respectively.</p>
<p>The KIPOZI measured a bit lower than displayed maximum and minimum temperatures (450°F, and 170°F respectively), with its maximum temperature coming in at 445°F and it’s minimum at 150°F. This discrepancy was also noticed by our testers, who often had to set this flat iron’s temperature higher than they normally would.</p>
<h3>Heating speed</h3>
<p>To test the heat time of our flat irons, we again employed the infrared heat thermometer along with a stopwatch.</p>

<p>We found that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/KIPOZI-Professional-Hair-Straightener-Adjustable-Temperature/dp/B0751DHHD1/?tag=ybdflat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KIPOZI </a>had the fastest heating time, taking only 35 seconds to reach its maximum temperature. The GVP  was second fastest, taking 53 seconds to reach its max.</p>
<p>The slowest to reach its maximum temperature was the HSI, taking 1 minute and 48 seconds. However, with all of our finalists reaching temperatures over 400°F in less than two minutes, heat time was not a deal breaker for any of our finalists.</p>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<p>Our lightest flat irons were the InfinitiPRO and Remington Pro . However, the Conair’s longer plates, 4.75”, were a bit more unwieldy in practice. Our tester’s seemed to prefer the handling of the 1” x 3.5” plates offered by HSI Professional .</p>
<p>The BaBylissPRO and GVP had the longest cord length, both 9 feet in length. The Conair and Remington had the shortest cords, which still measured a healthy 6 feet. You certainly won’t be tied to your outlet while straightening your hair with any of our finalists.</p>

<p>Universally chosen as the favorite by our testers, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B077HL3Z57/?tag=ybdflat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GVP &#8211; Ceramic Titanium</a> isn’t fussy and delivers top quality results without a top-tier price tag. The GVP’s plates are titanium infused ceramic, which heat up quickly, evenly and accurately. While the initial aesthetic impression of this flat iron is simple, its controls are smart.</p>
<p>The user-friendly buttons and digital screen can accurately control the plate temperature from 160°F to 450°F in ten degree increments. The GVP clearly indicated when heating was done by pausing ‘loading bars’ on the digital display. The ease of temperature control for this flat iron made it very easy for all of our tester’s to find their ideal straightening temperature.</p>

<p>The GVP’s small plates (1”x 3.5”), and well-designed handle were easy to fluidly glide through hair, minimizing potential hair damage. Its 9-foot cord also ensured that testers were able to easily handle the flat iron, without worrying about outlet proximity.</p>

<p>While the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RW0IBTS/?tag=ybdflat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BaBylissPRO &#8211; Nano Titanium&#8217;</a>s $130+ price makes it inaccessible to a portion of consumers, its performance rated higher than the GVP with our tester’s with normal to thick hair. The 300°F minimum temperature makes this flat iron unsuitable for thin, fragile or damaged hair. In particular, our testers all rated the BaBylissPRO’s grip on hair as exceptional.</p>
<p>The bigger plate size (1.25&#8243; x 4.25&#8243;), weight and the rectangular shape of the BaBylissPRO limit its overall versatility. However because of the great hair grip, the BaBylissPRO was effective even on highly-textured hair. The BaBylissPRO’s controls are very simple to use, but offer a limited temperature selection with only five temperature settings (300°F, 340°F, 375°F, 410°F, 450°F).</p>

<p>The results the iron offers, and its titanium coated plates make it worth recommending to a consumer with a big budget looking for serious straightening power.</p>
<p>However for your average consumer, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B077HL3Z57/?tag=ybdflat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GVP &#8211; Ceramic Titanium</a> is a better overall flat iron.<br />

<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The BaBylissPRO &#8211; Nano Titanium offers serious straightening power, and leaves hair frizz free.</li>
<li>The BaBylissPRO is suited for thicker hair types. It is not a flat iron for those with thin, fragile, or damaged hair because of its limited high temperature selection.</li>
<li>The $130+ price tag seems excessive, but the BaBylissPRO offers good results for those looking for a powerful flat iron.</li>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004INQ65S/?tag=ybdflat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair InfinitiPRO &#8211; 1-Inch </a> offers quality straightening results and good usability for under $30.00. While all of our testers ranked the Conair as an above average straightener overall, most cited frustration with the Conair’s temperature dial.</p>
<p>The Conair’s dial uses an increment system that is simple to operate. However, the flat iron only lists the maximum temperature in the manual, meaning that, unless you have access to an infrared thermometer, finding your perfect temperature requires rough approximation. Luckily, we measured the plate temperatures at each setting for you.</p>
[table id=112 /]
<p>Despite the ambiguity of the controls, the Conair provides solid results in hair texture. Four out of five of our testers listed the Conair’s hair results as above average, while our thick and curly hair tester listed its hair texture results as average.</p>

<p>This flat iron’s plates are made of ceramic-coated tourmaline, which results in hair with more shine and less frizz. In particular, our testers commented on hair looking shiny after using the Conair.</p>
<p>The Conair is also lightweight and sleek, making it easy to glide through hair. Its long plate length, 4.75”, was unnecessary for most of our testers.</p>
<p>However, it could be useful for those who like to work with bigger hair sections at a time.<br />
<b></b></p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Conair InfinitiPRO &#8211; 1-Inch is a great budget flat iron that offers solid hair styling results.</li>
<li>The Conair’s lightweight and easy-to-hold handle makes it easy to glide through hair.</li>
<li>While the Conair’s temperature control dial is a bit ambiguous, you can use our infrared thermometer test results to get close to your ideal flat iron temperature.</li>

<h3>Remington Pro &#8211; 1” Flat Iron</h3>
<p>Our least expensive straightener, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003S516XO/?tag=ybdflat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Remington Pro &#8211; 1&#8243; Flat Iron</a>, lost points with our testers because of the ‘burning plastic’ smell it emits while heating up. The flat iron’s light weight was a plus, but the iron was seen as lacking in overall quality by our testers. The Remington Pro’s controls were simple to use, but its plates often measured higher than the set temperature.</p>
<p>The Remington’s floating ceramic plates are supposed to be easier to glide through hair. However, the consensus from our testers was that the Remington’s plates did not sufficiently grip hair. Overall, the Remington is lightweight and simple to use, but does not deliver on quality or performance. For only ten more dollars, it is worth opting for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004INQ65S/?tag=ybdflat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair</a>.</p>
<h3>HSI Professional &#8211; Glider Ceramic Flat Iron</h3>
<p>Aesthetically, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001MA0QY2/?tag=ybdflat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HSI Professional &#8211; Glider Ceramic Flat Iron</a> was ranked highest by our testers. Its sleek black look and textured grip are very appealing. However, this sleek look is partly achieved by placing the temperature and power controls on the inner side, next to the hot ceramic plates. While a glove was included with the flat iron for hand protection, our testers were bothered by the control’s perilous location.</p>
<p>Four out of five of our testers ranked the styling results of the HSI as below average or average. Ultimately, the stylish aesthetic of this flat iron was not enough to make up for its lackluster styling results and poorly designed controls.</p>
<h3>KIPOZI &#8211; 1 Inch Pro</h3>
<p>At first glance, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/KIPOZI-Professional-Hair-Straightener-Adjustable-Temperature/dp/B0751DHHD1/?tag=ybdflat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KIPOZI &#8211; 1 Inch Pro Nano-Titanium Flat Iron</a> appears to be the height of flat iron technology. It has a touchscreen temperature interface and floating titanium plates. However, all of our testers cited great frustration with the KIPOZI’s touch screen. Many had trouble with the screen’s automatic lock feature, which often locks during temperature adjustment. Most struggled just to turn the KIPOZI on and off.</p>
<p>Some of our tester’s complained about the styling results of the KIPOZI, and had to adjust the heat higher than normal to get desired results. This was corroborated by our infrared thermometer, which revealed at times a 20°F discrepancy between its displayed and actual temperature. Once the correct temperature was found, good results could be achieved. However, the KIPOZI seems to unnecessarily complicate your straightening routine.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>A great flat iron should provide smooth, shiny, frizz-free hair, while minimizing hair damage. We found that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077HL3Z57/?tag=ybdflat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GVP &#8211; Ceramic Titanium</a> clearly outshone its competitors because of the smart simple controls, comfortable design and titanium infused ceramic plates. This flat iron is the best choice for most people because it offers above average hair results, is extremely easy to use and has a mid-range price (around $70).</p>
<p>For those with normal to thick hair, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RW0IBTS/?tag=ybdflat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BaBylissPRO &#8211; Nano Titanium</a> is a good splurge choice. Its $130+ price is reflected in the titanium plate’s ability to grip and fluidly glide through hair. Our testers with normal to thick hair ranked the BaBylissPRO’s hair results highest. However, this iron’s minimum temperature is 300°F, making it unsuitable for thin or bleached hair.</p>
<p>Those on a budget should consider the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004INQ65S/?tag=thewire06-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;ascsubtag=AgEAAAAAAAAAAOdPAAAAAFPY8UEAAAAAWljmTQ&amp;th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair InfinitiPRO</a>, which rated well with our tester’s because of its easy-to-use, thin, light-weight design. While it is easy to operate the Conair’s temperature dial, its increment system is ambiguous about the actual plate temperature it refers to. While this is a drawback, this flat iron was able to offer solid styling results for under $30.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Since the results from a hair dryer can be relative (hair length, texture and condition play an important role in finding the right tool), we first read articles explaining the complex structure of hair and the factors behind hair damage. Then we carefully considered consumer opinions from a variety of sources, including subreddits like /r/HaircareScience/ and /r/curlyhair/ and style blogs. We looked at the hair dryer review from <a href="http://thesweethome.com/reviews/the-best-hair-dryer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sweethome</a>, which influenced our decision to include the Xtava.</p>
<p>Next we headed over to Amazon, where we narrowed our choices down to the dryers that were rated highly by more than 100 reviewers. With enough consumer data, we knew we had opinions covering a wide variety of hair textures and types.</p>
<p>Once we chose our finalists and had a solid understanding of which features are most important to consumers, we headed to the bathroom for some hands-on testing. For each hair dryer, we used four different types of meters (thermometer, anemometer, wattage meter and decibel meter) and a head of wet hair to determine which hair dryer was at the top of its class.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use">How to properly dry your hair</h2>
<p>Most of us use a hair dryer in order to save time in the morning or to straighten or style our hair with heat. After all, wet hair just isn’t a professional look (neither is running in late to a meeting) and some mornings you don’t have time to wait for your hair to air dry.</p>
<p>You might think you’re sacrificing your hair&#8217;s health when you blow dry it, but that isn’t the case. According to Prevention.com, using a hair dryer at the right distance and temperature is actually the healthiest way to dry your hair. Why? The hair cuticle is a protective outer layer that is held together by delicate proteins. When water causes the strands to swell for an extended period of time, it puts pressure on those proteins and leads to damage. If your hair is already damaged, it is even more porous.</p>

    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/how-to-dry-hair.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Therefore, blow drying your hair properly can lead to healthier strands that are less likely to break. What is the magic formula? Let your hair dry most of the way naturally (about 70-80% dry). Then use the coolest setting and continuous motion to finish the job. Make sure to hold the dryer at least six inches away from your hair.</p>

<p>The key to finding the top performer is to find one with features for your hair type. Hairstylist, Josue Perez, recommends adjusting the heat level to your hair texture and condition. High heat is best suited for thick or coarse hair, while a cooler temperature is better for fine or damaged hair.</p>
<p>If you have thick hair that takes a long time to dry, investing in a high-wattage dryer is essential. If your hair tends to frizz, you’ll want an ionic dryer (or even better, a dryer with tourmaline technology). On the other hand, celebrity stylist, Peter Butler, points out that a non-ionic dryer is better for flat hair that needs more texture and movement. The best results come from using the dryer that causes the least amount of damage to your hair since the appearance of shine and smoothness comes from the condition of the hair cuticle.</p>
<p>Wondering whether to spend the extra money on a professional dryer? Here’s a consideration: professional hair dryers produce greater air velocity, have hotter temperatures and have more durable housing than their drugstore counterparts.</p>

<p><strong>Ionic:</strong> Water ions are positively charged, so ionic dryers create negative ions to help break down water molecules before they soak in. This science combats frizz and allows for much faster dry time.</p>
<p><strong>Ceramic coating:</strong> The heating elements of ceramic dryers are made of coated ceramic (a composite material usually made of clay), so they emit a non-damaging, far infrared heat. Hairstylist Lance McBrayer,\ explains that the infrared spectrum of light is invisible to the eye, but penetrates further than visible wavelengths because it directly heats objects in an area without heating the entire space. Far infrared heat is unique because it penetrates the hair shaft, making it the most efficient, gentlest way to heat hair. Ceramic also has unique heat conducting properties, so it heats up more quickly and evenly than dryers with metal or plastic heating elements.</p>
<p><strong>Titanium coating:</strong> Similar to ceramic (but lighter) titanium is used to distribute heat evenly. This is due to the metal’s ability to maintain a high, constant temperature, which also means faster drying and less damage to hair.</p>
<p><strong>Tourmaline coating:</strong> Tourmaline dryers are made or coated with crushed crystals of the semi-precious mineral tourmaline, which distributes negative ions when heated and leads to a shinier, less frizzy finish. It has been found to dry hair <a href="http://www.modernsalon.com/article/20880/ceramic-ionic-tourmaline-what-does-it-all-mean" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40% more quickly</a> than a hair dryer without tourmaline technology.</p>
<p><strong>Wattage:</strong> <a href="http://www.glamour.com/story/how-to-choose-best-hair-dryer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glamour</a> reports that a high-wattage motor means more wind power and less heat damage. Celebrity stylist, Ryan Richman, recommends a hair dryer that falls within the 1300 to 1875 watt range for home use.</p>
<p><strong>Variety of heat/speed settings:</strong> As we mentioned earlier, heat levels should be adjusted to suit your hair texture, condition and the amount of time you have before heading out the door. If you’re sharing your dryer with someone else, it’s especially important to have a dryer that has enough settings to meet both of your needs.</p>
<p><strong>Cool shot button:</strong> Cold air seals the hair cuticle, leaving a smoother surface that reflects more light (i.e. shiny hair). It also locks in style and curl, and protects against overheating.</p>
<p><strong>Attachments:</strong> If you have curly/wavy hair or want to control the style outcome, using an attachment such as a concentrator or diffuser will give you better results. A diffuser distributes heat broadly, adding bounce and body. Concentrators direct and focus the air output, which helps prevent frizz.</p>
<p><strong>Removable filter:</strong> Cleaning out dust and debris buildup from the filter extends the motor life of your hair dryer. It’s fairly similar to cleaning out the lint filter in your clothes dryer. According to <a href="http://www.self.com/story/often-should-replace-hair-dryer-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Self</a>, you should clean your hair dryer vent weekly. The dryer can pose a fire risk if you don’t regularly clean it, so a removable filter that makes the process easy is key.</p>
<p><strong>Usability:</strong> A user-friendly design is something to take into consideration when choosing a hair dryer. It should be easy to handle, relatively lightweight and have buttons placed in a logical position. Cord length and storage are other factors that can make a hair dryer a positive or positively annoying experience.</p>
<h2 id="motors">AC vs. DC motors</h2>
<p>AC motors are heavy-duty, long-lasting motors that are known for their powerful airflow, quality and performance. The cons to using a dryer with an AC motor are that it is larger and heavier, and they tend to be more expensive.</p>
<p>On the flip side, DC motors are smaller and lighter. However, they are less powerful than an AC motor. They have a shorter life span, performing for approximately 400-700 hours, but are generally more reasonably priced.</p>
<p>Damiano Petruccelli, US Sales Manager for Turbo Power Hair Dryers, has said, “The first thing you look for is AC motor vs a DC motor; AC will outperform DC in every aspect.” However, <a href="http://thebeautydepartment.com/2014/03/best-blowdryer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Beauty Department</a> points out that there are always exceptions to the rule, so it’s worth it to read the reviews before deciding against a dryer simply because it has a DC motor.</p>

<p>We tested three hair dryers with DC motors, and four with AC motors. After testing and comparing our finalists, we found that the generalizations of AC vs. DC motors didn’t really pan out. You <em>can</em> find a lightweight, budget-priced hair dryer with an AC motor (like the Xtava) or splurge on a professional hair dryer with a DC motor (like the Super Solano &#8211; 3500).</p>
<p>Unless you’re using it in a salon, you probably don’t need to invest in a more expensive model simply because it has a longer-lasting motor. In terms of power, two of our finalists with the highest wattage (the Rusk &#8211; W8less and BaBylissPRO &#8211; Nano Titanium) have DC motors.</p>

<h3>Hands-on testing</h3>
<p>Since hair dryers will often try to sell you on the fact that their model will make your hair look amazing, we took each of our finalists out for a spin to see if they lived up to they hype. Over the course of three weeks, we incorporated each finalist into our morning routine to see if we were out the door faster or if our hair looked smoother.</p>
<p>We put our finalists to work on both fine, curly hair (read: prone to frizz) and thick hair, and were surprised to find that the dryers were basically equal in terms of drying time and results. This may be due to the fact that we narrowed down our finalists to those with higher-quality heating elements made with ceramic or titanium, but we had comparable results with the technology-free Xtava.</p>
<p>We did notice a major difference in using a concentrator since it’s harder to control where the air is directed without one. This was one downside to the Conair &#8211; Compact, which doesn’t come with a concentrator. On curly hair, the dryers with tourmaline technology like the Rusk &#8211; W8less and Super Solano &#8211; 3500 did seem to combat frizz better than our other finalists.</p>
<p>Over the years, we’ve used a few cheap hair dryers that produced bad results and we can happily report that there were no “hat days” with our finalists. On the other hand, expecting any of these dryers to magically transform your hair is a bit of a stretch. The true magic lies in healthier hair since the cuticle lies flatter and reflects light better. So as long as you’re not actively damaging your hair with your hair dryer, you should see healthier hair and better results emerge over time.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that in an interview discussing the secret behind her company’s raved-about blowouts, Drybar founder <a href="https://sf.racked.com/2014/1/3/7630141/drybar-founder-alli-webb-explains-why-blowouts-are-magic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alli Webb</a> mentions the amount of time spent perfecting each section, the angle of the dryer, and hair products mattered more than the actual hair dryer (even though she has <a href="https://www.thedrybar.com/buttercup-blow-dryer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one on the market</a>).</p>
<h3>Infrared heat thermometer</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6266" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/infrared-testing.jpg" alt="measuring heat with an infrared thermometer" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/infrared-testing.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/infrared-testing-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/infrared-testing-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/infrared-testing-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/infrared-testing-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/infrared-testing-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/infrared-testing-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/infrared-testing-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/infrared-testing-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/infrared-testing-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>In order to gauge the heat output of each dryer, we used an infrared thermometer to accurately measure the temperature at the highest setting. For the test, we held the thermometer six inches away from the hair dryer and pointed it directly at the center of the nozzle. At 82.4 °F, the BaBylissPRO reached the highest temperature of all the dryers we tested. The Conair and Rusk came in next, both reaching a peak temperature of 80.2 °F. The dryer with the lowest high heat setting was the Super Solano, which only reached 76.2°F.</p>
<p>While blasting your hair with the highest heat setting isn’t the best idea if you have fine or fragile hair, high heat will help you remove excess water from your hair. Drying faster also means that you are exposing your strands to heat for less time.</p>
<h3>Wind speed</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6267" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wind-speed-testing.jpg" alt="wind speed testing" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wind-speed-testing.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wind-speed-testing-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wind-speed-testing-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wind-speed-testing-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wind-speed-testing-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wind-speed-testing-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wind-speed-testing-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wind-speed-testing-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wind-speed-testing-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wind-speed-testing-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Celebrity hairstylist Kristen Ess <a href="http://www.glamour.com/story/how-to-choose-best-hair-dryer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">points out</a> that without the wind power associated with a strong motor, hair is essentially toasted with heat. Keeping this in mind, we used the anemometer to check the air flow velocity of each dryer. We held the anemometer six inches away from the dryer (which is the distance that you should keep your dryer at all times) and pointed the nozzle directly at the meter.</p>
<p>Our findings were that Rusk boasts the most wind power at 33.6 mph. A close second was BaBylissPRO at 30.1 mph. The remaining finalists fell in the 20-28 mph range, with Conair &#8211; 1875 having the least amount of wind power at only 20.8 mph.</p>
<h3>Wattage</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6268" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/killawatt.jpg" alt="wattage meter with a hair dryer plugged in" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/killawatt.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/killawatt-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/killawatt-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/killawatt-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/killawatt-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/killawatt-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/killawatt-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/killawatt-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/killawatt-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/killawatt-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The other benefit to a high-wattage dryer is that they last longer, so you get more for your money. According to <a href="http://www.allure.com/story/expert-tips-buy-right-hair-dryer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allure</a>, you’ll get the speediest results using a hair dryer with at least 1800 watts. Each of our finalists are marketed at 1800 watts or more, but we wanted to see how this actually played out once we plugged it into our Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitor and tested them all on the highest settings. Interestingly, none of the numbers we came up with matched the claims, but we did get an idea of which dryers had the strongest motors.</p>
<p>The BaBylissPRO tested at the highest wattage (1563 W) and the Rusk came in a close second (1552 W). Which didn’t surprise us, since they both rated the highest in wind power and heat. The dryer with the lowest wattage was the Super Solano 3500. As a professional-quality hair dryer, it did surprise us that this rated far lower than our other non-professional finalists, including the store-brand Conair dryers.</p>
<h3>Noise levels</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6269" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/noise-testing.jpg" alt="noise meter measuring a hair dryers noise levels" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/noise-testing.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/noise-testing-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/noise-testing-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/noise-testing-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/noise-testing-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/noise-testing-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/noise-testing-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/noise-testing-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/noise-testing-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/noise-testing-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>

<p>Since loud noises in small spaces can be particularly annoying, we wanted to see which of our finalists had the quietest motor. We used a GoerTek sound decibel meter to test each dryer at a distance of six inches, the distance it would most likely be from your ear. At 90.1 decibels, the quietest dryer was the Conair &#8211; 1875, which is one of the reasons we chose it as our frequent flier pick. If jet lag keeps you up at night, you can feel free to take a shower and blow dry your hair without disturbing the other hotel guests.</p>
<p>The Rusk and Conair Infiniti Pro tied for second place in this test, but they were still 6.1 decibels louder than the Conair &#8211; 1875. The loudest dryer was the Super Solano, so don’t choose it if you have roommates that like to sleep in late.</p>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<p>When you’re juggling a round-brush in one hand and a blow-dryer in the other (especially if it’s before you’ve had your morning coffee), the last thing you want is a heavy dryer that will make your arms ache. Ideally, a dryer that weighs around a pound is your best option. The longer it takes your hair to dry, the more important this factor becomes. With this in mind, we graphed the weight of each hair dryer to see which dryers balanced power with weight.</p>
<p>The lightest hair dryer we tested was the Xtava, which weighs less than a pound and still measured at 1523 W. It was also the most comfortable and convenient to use with its curved handle and 360 degree swivel cord. A close second was the Rusk, which only weighs a pound and tested at 1555 W. On the other end of the spectrum, the Conair &#8211; Infiniti Pro weighed an uncomfortable 2.6 pounds.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Rusk &#8211; W8less</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ulta.com/w8less-2000-watt-dryer?productId=xlsImpprod3540315" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rusk &#8211; W8less</a> has nearly everything you could want in a hair dryer. Infused with ceramic and tourmaline, it emits far infrared heat and negative ions for a faster, gentler blow dry. The far infrared heat penetrates the hair cuticle to dry hair from the inside out, so it’s less damaging to the hair structure. With tourmaline technology, millions of negative ions break down the water molecules so hair dries faster and is exposed to heat for less time. All of this leads to healthier hair and a shinier, smoother finish.</p>

Striking a perfect balance between power and weight, this ceramic- and tourmaline-infused dryer has all the advantages we could ask for.</p><a href="https://www.ulta.com/w8less-2000-watt-dryer?productId=xlsImpprod3540315" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Ulta</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Rusk is extremely efficient, producing the greatest air velocity of all our finalists and testing at 1555 W. Even with all that power, it was one of the quietest dryers we tested. It has high heat capabilities for when you need to remove excess moisture or have thicker hair that takes ages to dry. Plus it only weighs a pound, so you aren’t tempted to give up the job halfway through.</p>
<p>A trend with the professional models is to have unlabelled settings, but this isn’t the case with the Rusk. The three heat and two speed settings plus a cold shot button are clearly labeled so there’s no question which setting you’re on.</p>

<p>At 8’, the cord length is average among the finalists we tested and the lightweight, ergonomic design of the Rusk makes it comfortable to use. In fact, the only part of the design we would change would be to add a hanging loop for storage and use a round cord for less tangling.</p>
<p>While our finalists all produced similar results, the Rsuk did seem to have an edge on combating frizz on curly hair, which we attributed to the tourmaline technology.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks to ceramic and tourmaline dryer technology, the Rusk &#8211; W8less is effective on thick hair yet gentle enough for fine or delicate hair.</li>
<li>Possessing a high wattage and wind speed, the Rusk still managed to be one of our quietest dryers.</li>
<li>The Rusk weighs only a pound, so you can hold your arms overhead without getting tired.</li>
<li>The ergonomic design of the Rusk and clearly labelled buttons make this hair dryer comfortable and simple to use.</li>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6273 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/conair-1875.jpg" alt="Conair - 1875 dryer in a travel bag" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/conair-1875.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/conair-1875-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/conair-1875-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/conair-1875-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/conair-1875-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/conair-1875-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/conair-1875-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/conair-1875-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/conair-1875-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/conair-1875-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Since the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IV22/?tag=ybddry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair &#8211; 1875</a> is dual voltage, you won’t need a converter to use it overseas. All you’ll need is an adaptor to change the shape of the plug. It has a patented “twist it” folding handle, so it folds down to approximately 4.5×5” and fits conveniently in a carry-on bag. Priced under $20 at the time of publication, it won’t break the bank if you accidentally leave it behind in al hotel.</p>
<p>With such a low price point and compact size, we wondered how it would measure up to our full-size dryers in testing. We were pleasantly surprised that it parallelled the Rusk in terms of temperature, and performed on par or better than some of our professional dryer finalists when it came to wattage.</p>

<p>One drawback was that it performed significantly lower in the wind speed test than our other finalists. When combined with its high temperature, this means that the Conair &#8211; 1875 could have a tendency to over dry your hair. However, since it does have ionic technology and therefore a faster drying time, your hair is exposed to the heat for less time. A majority of consumers on Amazon rated it five stars, and were pleased with its power.</p>
<p>The Conair &#8211; 1875 has two heat and speed settings, plus a cool shot feature. One thing we didn’t love about the Conair &#8211; 1875 is that it doesn’t come with any attachments, such as a concentrator. It was much harder to direct the airflow downward (the proper angle for straightening hair with a round brush) without a concentrator. On the plus side, that’s just one less thing you have to pack in your bag.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dual voltage is the most convenient feature of the Conair &#8211; 1875, allowing you to dial to the correct voltage setting (125 or 250) for worldwide use.</li>
<li>Despite its small size, its high heat setting was hotter than the majority of our finalists.</li>
<li>Featuring patented “twist it” technology, the Conair &#8211; 1875 can fold down to half its size so it takes up less room in your luggage.</li>
<li>The Compact weighs just over a pound, so it won’t have much effect on luggage weight limits.</li>
</ul>

<h3>BaBylissPRO &#8211; Nano Titanium</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001T0HHDS/?tag=ybddry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6274 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/babyliss.jpg" alt="Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium in blue" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/babyliss.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/babyliss-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/babyliss-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/babyliss-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/babyliss-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/babyliss-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/babyliss-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/babyliss-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/babyliss-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/babyliss-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001T0HHDS/?tag=ybddry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium</a> beat out the other finalists in terms of wattage and heat. It also possesses serious wind speed and has an ergonomic design. It’s the only dryer we tested with nanotechnology and titanium parts, so it stands out in a class of its own. Nanotechnology manipulates atoms and molecules, and in a hair dryer, is used to remove odors and microbes on the scalp. Titanium is a metal that maintains a high constant temperature, which definitely proved true in our testing with an infrared heat thermometer.</p>
<p>Although titanium distributes heat evenly and keeps the temperature steady, the higher temperature can distress fine or fragile hair. The BaByliss is also our second heaviest dryer, weighing nearly two pounds. For these reasons, the BaByliss narrowly missed the mark as our top pick. It was definitely our pick for runner-up however, and would make an excellent choice if you have tons of hair that can handle a very hot dryer.</p>
<h3>Conair &#8211; Infiniti Pro</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6275 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/conair-pro.jpg" alt="Conair Infiniti Pro" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/conair-pro.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/conair-pro-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/conair-pro-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/conair-pro-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/conair-pro-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/conair-pro-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/conair-pro-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/conair-pro-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/conair-pro-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/conair-pro-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>For a drugstore hair dryer at a budget price, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0199STDWO/?tag=ybddry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair Infiniti Pro</a> has a lot to offer. It has a long-lasting AC motor, meaning you’ll get your money’s worth out of the Infiniti Pro before it needs replacing. It has ionic and ceramic technology for healthier and less frizzy hair, which is another way it rivals the professional models. In our tests, it performed on par with the other finalists and was one of the quietest dryers we tested.</p>
<p>While the Infiniti Pro is a great deal and beloved by at least a few fashion magazine editors, we didn’t choose it as our budget pick due to its uncomfortable weight. At 2.6 pounds, it was the heaviest hair dryer among our finalists, and we definitely felt it in our wrists and biceps after using it. On the other hand, if you really want a workout, this may be the perfect blowdryer for you.</p>
<h3>Twinturbo &#8211; Turbo Power 3200</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0040VGR3Y/?tag=ybddry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6276 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/twinturbo.jpg" alt="Twinturbo 3200 dryer" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/twinturbo.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/twinturbo-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/twinturbo-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/twinturbo-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/twinturbo-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/twinturbo-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/twinturbo-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/twinturbo-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/twinturbo-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/twinturbo-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0040VGR3Y/?tag=ybddry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Twinturbo &#8211; Turbo Power 3200</a> has an Italian-made, K-Lamination® AC motor, which has been recently improved to be lighter and consume less than energy. So while it has a high price point, it’s sure to last you for a long time. In fact, the manufacturer claims that it has a motor life of 2000 hours, which is double the usual lifespan of an AC motor. It features ceramic and ionic technology and a nickel chrome heating element for faster drying times and less hair damage. The Twinturbo also has a safety thermostat that prevents overheating.</p>
<p>Despite the reputation for design and technology that Italian motors are known for, the Twinturbo had the second-lowest wattage of the models we tested. Combining this factor with its moderate heat and wind speeds, we didn’t feel the Twin Turbo justified its high price point.</p>
<h3>Super Solano &#8211; 3500</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6277 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/super-solano.jpg" alt="Super Solano - 3500" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/super-solano.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/super-solano-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/super-solano-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/super-solano-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/super-solano-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/super-solano-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/super-solano-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/super-solano-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/super-solano-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/super-solano-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>In print, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001ADPTY8/?tag=ybddry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Super Solano &#8211; 3500</a> has features to make it stand out: lightweight, ceramic, tourmaline, an Italian-made motor. In reality, the Super Solano didn’t live up to our expectations. When we performed our comparison tests, we found it to have the lowest wattage, the lowest temperature on its highest heat setting and the loudest motor. Likely due to the low wattage, it tested at a less-than-average wind speed. Plus, it had the highest price point among our finalists.</p>
<p>It does have the widest range of heat settings, since you can combine heat and speed settings for more temperatures. So if you have fine, delicate hair that warrants a lower temperature and don’t mind spending the extra money, this dryer could work for you. It also has an 11’ round cord and hanging loop, which were definite selling points, but not enough to name it a top pick.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Since hair texture and style vary, it’s hard to name a one-size-fits-all hair dryer. However, the <a href="https://www.ulta.com/w8less-2000-watt-dryer?productId=xlsImpprod3540315" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rusk &#8211; W8less</a> was the most ideal for all types of hair. It excelled in every one of our tests, and met nearly all the key metrics we used in testing. With a high-wattage motor and plenty of wind speed, it makes a blowout fast and simple, so you can spend less time getting ready and more time on important things like breakfast. Infused with ceramic and tourmaline, it causes less stress on your strands and provides shinier, smoother results.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001T0HHDS/?tag=ybddry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BaBylissPRO &#8211; Nano Titanium</a> is another solid choice, unless you have more damage-prone hair that could be distressed by the very hot temperature of this dryer.</p>
