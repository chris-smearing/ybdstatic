				<description><![CDATA[After testing the most popular Keurigs on the market, we found that the Keurig K-Elite is the best pick for most coffee drinkers. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ver the past two weeks we have brewed dozens of cups of coffee, testing the five most popular Keurig machines on the market in our quest to find the best one. From this research, we found that the best Keurig overall was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0788F3R8X/?tag=ybdkeu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K-Elite</a>. With a large water filter, built in reservoir, and multiple brewing options, it&#8217;s coffee at its most convenient.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>To ensure we tested the newest and highest quality Keurigs on the market, we first checked out user reviews from Amazon and Walmart to get a feel for what consumers found important. Next, we consulted reviews from respected websites such as Wirecutter and Consumer Reports to get a feel for which Keurigs rated highly. Finally, we called Keurig to ensure that all of our finalists were the newest models and had no plans of discontinuation in the coming year.</p>
<p>We did not test a machine from Keurig’s Classic line because we already tested the K-Classic in <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-single-cup-coffee-maker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our single cup coffee maker review</a>. We also did not test any of Keurig’s 2.0 machines, as a brand representative told us they were no longer going to be produced.</p>
<p>Our research portion for this article also included a “cupping” coffee tasting at James Coffee Co. in San Diego. During this event, our testers learned about the many factors that affect the way a cup of coffee tastes. We used this knowledge to help our Keurig testers set proper controls while taste testing.</p>

<h2 id="keurig-controversy">The Keurig controversy</h2>
<p>In recent years, Keurig machines have gotten pushback from environmental advocates over their use of K-Cups. K-Cups are single-use, individually packaged portions of coffee for Keurig machines. They are not biodegradable and have a detrimental environmental impact that has been well-documented.</p>
<p>K-Cups can be recycled if the separate components are taken apart prior to recycling, according to <a href="https://www.recycleacup.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recycleacup.com</a>. The coffee inside the K-Cup must first be emptied and then the plastic, aluminum and paper of the K-Cup must be disassembled. This is a pain — which is why millions of K-Cups end up in the trash.</p>
<p>An easier solution is to use Keurig’s universal reusable filter called My K-Cup. To use, fill it up with the ground coffee of your choice (read our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-cheap-coffee/">cheap coffee review</a> here), brew in your Keurig machine and rinse out after use. While My K-Cup requires a bit more effort than simply popping in a plastic K-Cup, it greatly minimizes your environmental impact.</p>
<p>My K-Cup can also save you some cash, as K-Cups are more expensive than buying coffee by the pound. However, French presses and traditional drip coffee makers are still cheaper and create less waste than operating any Keurig machine.</p>
<p>Despite these considerations, many consumers still prefer the convenience of a Keurig to traditional coffee makers. Keurig provides a consistent cup of coffee with the touch of a button and is less expensive than visiting Starbucks everyday.</p>
<p>However, if you&#8217;re still wary after reading this, you might want to check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-drip-coffee-maker/">drip coffee maker review</a> instead.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >

<p><b>Size:</b> Counter space is precious. Before buying, make sure your Keurig fits in your kitchen without dominating it. Keurig offers many size options, so finding the right one for you should not be a problem.</p>
<p><b>Cup volume: </b>Most Keurigs brew four to 12 ounces of coffee per serving, but some have more limited options.</p>
<p><b>Water reservoir: </b>When it comes to everyday handiness, the capacity of the Keurig’s water reservoir makes a big difference<b>.</b> While it does not take a large effort, it is still a bit annoying to constantly fill up a small water reservoir. The Keurigs we tested ranged from 12 to 90 ounces in water capacity.</p>
<p><b>User interface:</b> Making a cup of coffee should not be complicated, so an easy, well-designed interface is a big plus.</p>
<p><b>Features: </b>Automatic turn-on, filtration, attached frothers and different strength options are all features offered by different Keurigs. Deciding which of these features is the most important for you will help you decide which machine is right for you.</p>
<p><b>Aesthetics:</b> Make sure your Keurig appeals to you visually because it will likely be on view in your kitchen.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Unit dimensions and cup volume</h3>
[table id=201 /]
<p>First things first, we wanted to see how much space these machines would take up. We measured the footprint of each machine and checked if they could fit a 7-inch travel mug under the brewer. The only machines we tested unable to do this were the K-Mini Plus and K-Latte.</p>
<p>We also compiled information about the different cup volumes each Keurig can pour. Our testers preferred a typical eight-ounce cup, but we gathered information on each machine’s capabilities to help you find the right one for you.</p>
<h3>Brew temperature</h3>
[table id=202 /]
<p>It is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18226454" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally recommended</a> that coffee is best brewed between 195 °F &#8211; 205 °F and best served between 160 °F &#8211; 175 °F. However, how hot you like your coffee is largely based on personal preference.</p>
<p>To find out how hot each of our Keurigs served coffee, we used a digital kitchen thermometer to measure the coffee temperature right after the last drop had been poured from the machine. To ensure consistency in our testing, we brewed three cups of coffee prior to measurement. We also made sure water temperature, room temperature and cup temperature were consistent throughout testing.</p>
<p>We found that all of our finalists served coffee within the recommended range of 160 °F &#8211; 175 °F. The <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Keurig-K-Latte-Single-Serve-K-Cup-Coffee-and-Latte-Maker-Comes-with-Milk-Frother-Compatible-With-all-Keurig-K-Cup-Pods-Black/669553233" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K-Latte</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C1XC3GF/?tag=ybdkeu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K-Cafe</a> served our hottest cups of coffee, both measuring at 175 °F. The lowest temperature coffee was served by the K-Elite and the K155, which both measured 161 °F.</p>
<p>It should be noted that we tested the K-Elite’s temperature on its default temperature setting. However, if you prefer a hotter cup of coffee, you can increase the machine’s temperature settings.</p>
<p>Our testers did not find any of the coffee brewed to be too cold for their taste, but one remarked that the K-Latte and K-Cafe felt hotter. If you know that you like your coffee extra hot, the K-Latte may be your best pick, as it also performed well in our other testing categories.</p>
<h3>Brew speed</h3>
[table id=203 /]
<p>We used a timer to find out how long each machine took to heat up and brew an eight-ounce cup of coffee. All of the Keurigs we tested were able to heat up and brew a cup in about two minutes, so this was not a make-or-break testing category for our finalists. In general, our finalists took about a minute to heat up, and then just under a minute to brew.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0788F3R8X/?tag=ybdkeu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K-Elite</a> was our only finalist to come with an automatic turn-on feature. This means it can be programmed to automatically turn on and heat the water at your desired time, which can help save you a minute during your morning routine.</p>
<h3>Sound</h3>
<p>Overall, we did not like the unattractive sounds produced by all of the Keurigs we tested. We wanted a Keurig to be as quiet as possible while brewing coffee.</p>
<p>To test this, we used a sound meter that recorded the sound level in A-weighted decibels. While each of our Keurigs brewed an eight-ounce cup of coffee, we held the sound meter about an arm’s length distance from the machine and recorded its loudest sound.</p>
<p>We found that all of the Keurigs were similarly noisy, topping off around 70 dBa. This is about the same amount of noise produced by a vacuum cleaner running in an adjacent room. All of our Keurigs measured about 60 dBa for the majority of their brew, but then emitted a 70 dBa spurting sound as they pushed the last drips of coffee into the cup.</p>
<p>We did not record any significant differences in noise level between our finalists, so we can’t name any one machine the quietest.</p>
<h3>User experience and taste</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/k-latte-1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>For our practical testing, we had two testers brew multiple  eight-ounce cups with each of our machines and record their experiences. Our testers prepared for this at a cupping event at James Coffee Co. in San Diego, CA. Here, our testers learned about factors that can affect the taste of coffee.</p>
<p>We learned that during the extraction of coffee from the coffee bean (which occurs when you add water to brew the coffee), the water ratio, contact time, grind size, water temperature and agitation of the beans all influence the taste of coffee. All of these factors were pretty standardized by using Keurig machines to brew coffee, meaning there wasn’t much difference in taste between machines. The water ratio was set to eight ounces for all of our taste testing; each machine had about a minute of contact time between water and grounds; and the beans were agitated in a very similar fashion. We also had our taste testers use the same batch and amount of ground coffee in the My K-Cup for taste testing.</p>
<p>Our testers did not find much variation in taste when using our finalists, which makes sense because of the standardization across Keurig’s machines. However, our testers thought that the K-Mini Plus brewed a more watery tasting cup than the other machines. This could be related to the fact that the K-Mini brews a cup according to how much water you put in the machine. For example, if you want an eight-ounce cup, you must fill the machine to eight ounces. However, because we used eight ounces for all of our machines and were sure to put exactly eight ounces into the K-Mini, we are a bit mystified by the watered down taste.</p>
<p>Our testers also rated how easy it was to set up and use each Keurig. We thought that a single-serve coffee machine should be simple enough to figure out without consulting a manual.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">The best overall: K-Elite</h2>

<p>While testing, one major thing stood out about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0788F3R8X/?tag=ybdkeu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K-Elite</a>: you do not have to refill its water reservoir nearly as often as the other machines. This sounds obvious, but its 75-ounce water capacity really makes it handier than the other Keurigs we tested.</p>
<p>Our testers also liked that this Keurig has a water filter. If you prefer making coffee with filtered water, this is an obvious choice for you. However, even if you don’t mind the tap, the water filter is supposed to extend the life of the machine overall, as less impurities should build up within it. Installing the filter in the reservoir was not hard, but it did require reading the manual.</p>
<p>The K-Elite brews four, six, eight, 10 and 12 ounces of coffee, meaning you can fill anything from a tiny cup to a travel mug. It also offers “strong” and “iced” options, but we didn’t find these options helpful, as our testers preferred the normal brew strength.</p>
<p>On its default setting, this machine served coffee at about 161 °F. This was on the low side of our finalists — about the same temperature of coffee produced by the K155 and K-Mini Plus. However, our testers did not make any remarks about the coffee temperature being too cold. Also, the K-Elite was the only Keurig we tested that can be programmed to brew at higher temperatures, up to 192 °F. You can change the default temperature of the K-Elite in its settings menu, which is a big plus if you are picky about your coffee temperature.</p>

<p>This Keurig was the fastest to heat up, taking only about thirty seconds. Its automatic turn-on feature also means that you can skip these thirty seconds in the morning by programming the machine to heat itself up at a certain time. This means that after you press the brew button, you only have to wait 45 seconds while it brews.</p>
<p>Our testers thought that this Keurig was the most complicated to use because of its many features. When setting up this Keurig, we were immediately asked to program the time, altitude mode and automatic turn-on time. While all of these features are useful, we had to consult the manual to figure out how to program them.</p>
<p>This machine does take up a fair amount of counter space at 13.1&#8243; H x 9.9&#8243; W x 12.7&#8243; D. It also has the shortest power cord, measuring only about a foot. However, it has a sleek look that’s aesthetically appealing on a counter.</p>
<p>Overall, the K-Elite takes our top spot because when you wake up in the morning you want coffee fast — this machine delivers on that. The last thing anyone wants to do is mess with a water reservoir first thing in the morning. The K-Elite delivers on convenience, which is why consumers are attracted to Keurigs in the first place.</p>
<p>This Keurig runs at about $160, which is a relatively mid-range price for a Keurig machine. If you are buying a Keurig to make your life more convenient, we believe the K-Elite is worth the extra coin.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The K-Elite was our fastest-brewing Keurig machine.</li>
<li>This machine’s 75-ounce water reservoir means you won’t be constantly refilling this machine.</li>
<li>The included water filter is a plus for those who prefer filtered water; the machine may also have a longer life for this reason.</li>
<li>This machine’s short power cord and large size limit its movability in the kitchen.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Keurig-K-Latte-Single-Serve-K-Cup-Coffee-and-Latte-Maker-Comes-with-Milk-Frother-Compatible-With-all-Keurig-K-Cup-Pods-Black/669553233" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K-Latte</a> was nearly our first pick because of its bargain price (about $100), milk frother and simple design. If you have any interest in using your Keurig machine to make cappuccinos and lattes, this is the best machine for you. However, we found the K-Elite to be better overall because it beat out the K-Latte in crucial areas such as brew time and reservoir size, which make a difference in day-to-day use.</p>
<p>The K-Latte’s reservoir is 36 ounces, which is significantly smaller than the K-Elite’s reservoir. However, this machine is not much smaller than the K-Elite because of its attached milk frother. The milk frother’s base is attached to the bottom of the machine, but can be folded up. This means if you are not using the milk frother you can fold in its base, and then store the frothing cup in a cabinet. This is much handier than the other latte-making Keurig — the K-Cafe.</p>
<p>This milk frother worked well, taking about two minutes to froth and warm milk to 150 °F. While this machine is frothing milk, you can use the coffee portion to brew a shot of coffee. However, you cannot brew a regular cup of coffee while the machine is frothing milk.</p>

<p>While our testers did not think that these lattes tasted as great their store bought competitors, they were still pleased with the results, which took only about two minutes to make once the machine heated up.</p>
<p>This machine took one minute and fifty seconds to heat up and one minute to brew — a relatively slow time for our finalists. However, the resulting coffee was among the hottest of our competitors, measuring 175 °F. Therefore, if you like your coffee extra hot, this is your best pick.</p>
<p>Our testers also thought that this Keurig’s interface was very simple to use. Aesthetically, this machine looks a little funny because of the attached frother, but its black design won’t stand out on your counter. Its power cord is also much handier than the K-Elite’s, measuring about 40 inches.</p>
<p>The K-Latte is only available at Walmart or by phone order from Keurig because of Keurig’s exclusive agreement with Walmart. Its price is a bargain at about $100, especially when you consider Keurig’s other latte machine, the K-Cafe, rated poorly with our testers and costs an additional $50.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The K-Latte was our best latte maker because of its bargain price and easy-to-use design.</li>
<li>This machine’s milk frother can be detached and its base folded up, making this machine much handier than the K-Cafe.</li>
<li>The K-Latte has a smaller water reservoir, holding only 36 ounces, meaning you will have to fill it up more often.</li>
<li>The K-Latte served one of the hottest cups of coffee of our finalists.</li>

<p>This Keurig performed well with our testers, but was not our top pick because of its high price — upwards of $250. This machine shined when it came to ease-of-use and water-reservoir size and performed on par with our other finalists for speed and temperature.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DWKEHU4/?tag=ybdkeu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K155</a> had the best display of our finalists by far. Our testers loved its easy-to-navigate digital display. This machine does not offer many extra features, which makes using it really easy. All you are asked to do is select a four, six, eight or 10 ounces and brew.</p>
<p>The huge water reservoir (90 ounces) is also a big plus for this machine, which is marketed to work for small offices. If you were using this machine in an office setting, this large water reservoir would be really useful, so employees would not have to continually fill its tank.</p>
<p>However, we still cannot justify its $250 price tag from its ease-of-use and water capacity alone. Where are the extra features? A water filter or automatic turn-on feature would also be very helpful for a small office. We believe that even with its smaller 75-ounce tank, you could use the K-Elite for a small office and get these bonus features for a cheaper price.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C1XC3GF/?tag=ybdkeu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K-Cafe</a> comes with a milk frother and a coffee shot option like the K-Latte. However its poor design and similar speed performance to the K-Latte leave us wondering why it costs about $80 more than the K-Latte.</p>
<p>This machine design is less handy than the K-Latte’s because its milk frother cannot be folded in. This means you always need space for a Keurig machine with an attached milk frother, which measures 15.3 inches in total width. One of our testers thought it  also made the machine look a little goofy.</p>
<p>The K-Cafe’s performance testing was largely on par with the K-Latte’s. It also brewed one of our hottest cups of coffee at 175 °F. It took a similar two minutes to heat up and 45 seconds to brew. Also, its frother also took two minutes to froth milk to 155 °F (just five degrees hotter than the K-Latte).</p>
<p>The only justification for the increased price of the K-Cafe we could find was the larger water reservoir, which holds 60 ounces. This is a big factor in handiness as we have mentioned before, but we do not believe it to be handy enough to justify spending an extra $80, especially considering this machine’s cumbersome design.</p>
<h3>K-Mini Plus</h3>

<p>This was the smallest and most stylish of our finalists. However, those were the only areas this machine really delivered on.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DR89BR6/?tag=ybdkeu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K-Mini Plus</a> requires you to put in the amount of water that you would like for each individual cup of coffee. For example, if you want an eight-ounce cup of coffee, you put eight ounces of water into the machine before brewing. To heat and brew, this machine takes about two minutes total. This left us asking — why not just use a French press?</p>
<p>If you have to put in the exact amount of water for each cup, the only conveniences you are saving for yourself by using the K-Mini Plus are not having to measure your own coffee grounds or rinse out the French press after use. However, if you are using the My K-Cup and coffee grounds, you will have to measure your own grounds anyway.</p>
<p>Also, our testers thought this machine’s coffee tasted worse than the other finalists. Overall, we cannot justify spending about $100 for a machine that does not deliver on convenience or taste.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>In practical testing, our Keurig finalists had a lot of similarities. For example, testing data for noise level and brew temperature was very similar across all of the Keurigs we tested. However, the K-Elite stood out from the crowd because of its fast brew time, 75-ounce reservoir and included water filter. For about $150, the K-Elite provides the best Keurig experience for your buck.</p>
<p>If you are buying a Keurig machine to make your morning routine more convenient, your best bet is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0788F3R8X/?tag=ybdkeu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K-Elite</a>. We like the extra features this Keurig offers such as a water filter and automatic turn-on feature. We also think you could use this Keurig for a small office and skip paying the extra dough for a K155 Office PRO.</p>
<p>If you want to indulge in a latte or cappuccino, we recommend the <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Keurig-K-Latte-Single-Serve-K-Cup-Coffee-and-Latte-Maker-Comes-with-Milk-Frother-Compatible-With-all-Keurig-K-Cup-Pods-Black/669553233" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K-Latte</a>. This machine is a great price at around $100 and delivers the hottest cup of coffee of our finalists. It costs less and has a more convenient countertop design than its rival, the K-Cafe.</p>
<p>In the future, we hope Keurig finds solutions to help minimize noise levels. We also think that offering a complimentary K-Cup recycling service would be a great way to help reduce waste created by these machines.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent a month using the best insulated tumblers side by side with water bottles and travel mugs.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>There are over 20,000 listings on Amazon for &#8220;insulated tumbler.&#8221; YETI is the undisputed brand king, with a tumbler that&#8217;s now even more popular than their ultra-rugged (and expensive) coolers. As with all things that are mass-produced and insanely popular, the number of competitors (and imitations) has expanded just as quickly as YETI&#8217;s profit numbers.</p>
<p>We read and watched dozens of YETI tumbler reviews and comparisons to narrow the mile-long list down to four of the best insulated tumbler cups. <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-tumbler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wirecutter</a>, as always, provides some in-depth testing, and <a href="https://www.savingfreak.com/best-tumbler-yeti-vs-rtic-vs-orca-vs-ozark-trail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saving Freak</a> compares the costs and benefits of the various copycat brands. GearJunkie, like most sites, only <a href="https://gearjunkie.com/yeti-rambler-tumbler-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passes a verdict on the YETI</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY5Kryq62SQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What&#8217;s Inside</a> tried to do a controlled test, but wound up destroying one of their samples.</p>
<p>In our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/" rel="noopener">water bottle review</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/" rel="noopener">travel mug review</a>, we&#8217;ve seen Klean Kanteen and Hydro Flask go head-to-head competing for a position in our tests. <b>For the first time, Hydro Flask offers something substantially different from Klean Kanteen: a bigger cup that actually matches what everyone else is offering.</b></p>
<p>Between the various well-known brands that are just barely different from YETI, RTIC is budget-friendly and offers a flip-cap lid that at least compares in functionality to the Mag-Slide on the new YETI lids.</p>
<p>CamelBak has an interesting contender in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LA4PUMc/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KickBak</a>, and it fared well in Wirecutter&#8217;s insulation test, but customer reviews of the lid are scathing so we skipped it.</p>
<p><b>We decided to test only the 30-ounce tumblers in this review, since they&#8217;re the most popular and represent a type of drink carrier that&#8217;s really different from a </b><a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/" rel="noopener"><b>16-ounce travel mug</b></a><b>.</b> It also allowed us to compare them directly to our favorite 30-ounce insulated <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/" rel="noopener">water bottle</a> to see what difference that narrower opening makes. We selected representatives from a range of prices to see if insulation quality really changes when you buy a $40 tumbler instead of a $16 tumbler.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-get">Should you get a tumbler, water bottle or travel mug?</h2>
<p>Like <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/#best-insulated-water-bottle" rel="noopener">insulated water bottles</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/" rel="noopener">travel mugs</a>, an insulated tumbler will keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold. The vacuum insulation also stops that slippery condensation from forming on the sides and leaving a puddle on your furniture.</p>
<p>The choice between a travel mug and an insulated tumbler is a tricky one. In most ways, these products serve an identical purpose for most people: They maintain temperature, and they&#8217;re convenient to sip from (no screw-top like an insulated water bottle).</p>
<p>The big difference with a tumbler is the lid. <b>While a travel mug is still designed for easy-access sipping, many tumblers don&#8217;t have any kind of stopper at all to slow down your sipping pleasure.</b> The lids are simple and easy to clean, but they offer far less insulation than good travel mugs. The best travel mugs keep your coffee hotter and your laptop (not to mention pants) safer from spills.</p>
<p>A tumbler is also available in much larger sizes than popular travel mugs. You can buy a thermos or a giant insulated water bottle, of course, but those aren&#8217;t easy to sip from.</p>
<p>So, the ideal setting for an insulated tumbler is on a hot afternoon where you want to keep your drink insulated, but you&#8217;re more worried about convenience more than spills. Drinking something cold poolside on a scorching-hot day is a perfect example. Reading on the patio in the early morning with a cup of coffee is also a case where the tumbler works better than an ordinary cup.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>

<b>Size:</b> The most popular tumblers hold around 30 ounces, and among the friends and coworkers who use them daily, that was unanimously the preferred size for sipping cold beverages or ice water.</p>
<p><b>Spout stoppers:</b> Flip-up stoppers and slide-over stoppers are the two common approaches to keeping a tumbler closed. Look closely at what you&#8217;re buying, though: Many tumblers are made with a few different lid styles if you look for them.</p>
<p><b>Base diameter:</b> Do you need to keep your tumbler in a car cup holder? Check the size just to be sure, but most cup holders are designed to hold extra-large restaurant-size paper cups, which these tumblers mimic.</p>
<p><b>Painted, coated or brushed finish:</b> Color coordination is a nice benefit of painted or powder-coated tumblers, but they&#8217;ll show signs of wear eventually. Brushed stainless steel looks great even if it gets scratched, and there&#8217;s nothing that will peel off after a few years.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Everyday use tests</h3>
<p>Our tester used these tumblers in place of his usual water bottle and coffee mug for two weeks. At work, around the house, in the car and at the park, they all kept beverages handy. The 30-ounce size was bigger than our testers preferred for a morning cup of coffee, but for keeping hydrated (or keeping a rum and coke chilled) it&#8217;s just about perfect.</p>
<p>The differences between the mugs seemed smaller and smaller as we got used to them. The flip-lid from RTIC doesn&#8217;t flop around as much as most travel mug lids in this style, which was our biggest concern. The slide closures on the YETI and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0769CQYVS/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican &#8211; Traveler</a> were easy to use, though not any more so than the flip lid.</p>
<h3>Cleaning test</h3>
<p>Cleaning these tumblers and lids was easy, even by hand. Compared to popular travel mugs like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZI5XNO/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo &#8211; West Loop</a> with its springs and levers on the inside of the lid, a tumbler lid is dead simple to clean.</p>
<p>What about the dishwasher, though? <a href="https://www.rticcoolers.com/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTIC</a> and <a href="https://www.hydroflask.com/caring-for-your-hydro-flask/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hydro Flask</a> say that you should hand-wash only, while <a href="https://www.yeti.com/en_US/are-yeti-tumblers-dishwasher-safe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YETI</a> specifically claims their tumblers will survive dishwashing. (Pelican doesn&#8217;t comment either way.) Given the number of outright contradictions we&#8217;ve seen over our years researching vacuum-insulated products, we&#8217;re not surprised by either answer. Extra-hot drying cycles will make the metal expand and contract, so there&#8217;s some risk to every mug, but the biggest problems are usually with color coatings and glued-on plastic pieces.</p>
<p>If you want to keep your insulated tumbler looking and working its best, hand-washing is the safe way to go. But it seems clear that one trip through the washer won&#8217;t destroy the insulation if you find a week-old smoothie in the back of your truck.</p>
<h3>Insulation test</h3>
<p>We took our four tumblers and our <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07996C56J/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">top-performing insulated water bottle</a> and filled them all with 28 ounces of hot water. Temperature ranged from 190 to 194 degrees Fahrenheit, which is on the upper end of coffee temperature after brewing.</p>
<p>We then checked on the heat loss for the next six hours, and again at 12 hours. The chart below models the results for easy comparison. (The raw data had a difference of four degrees Fahrenheit in starting temperature. The chart shows an adjusted starting temperature, but the temperature change from one sample to the next is as recorded.)</p>
<div id="visualizer-18187-1186780092" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-18187"></div>
<p>The differences between these tumblers is so small that it would be impossible to tell them apart. The real difference is between the tumblers and the water bottle: because the vacuum-sandwich stainless steel walls provide the most effective insulation, the wide lid of a tumbler is a real liability. Even the fact that the Hydro Flask tumbler has no seal to keep steam in made only a tiny difference in the test.</p>
<p>We also added the results from an old test of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp 16-ounce travel mug</a> to this chart for comparison. <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/#how-we-tested" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The testing conditions were different</a> (starting temperature was lower, and we didn&#8217;t test for as long), but we&#8217;ve normalized the starting point on this graph so the sample intervals line up. It&#8217;s clear that even a small narrow-neck bottle keeps heat better than the tumblers.</p>
<h3>Ice test</h3>
<p>In our research, we saw so many variations of the ice test, we were a little surprised that there wasn&#8217;t some kind of consensus. Instead, it seemed that every test had a slightly different result. The real problem with an ice test is getting around the margin of error: It&#8217;s hard to know if you&#8217;re measuring the temperature of the water or the ice cubes. (Infrared thermometers are also often used, and those <a href="https://blog.thermoworks.com/thermometer/how-to-use-an-infrared-thermometer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only read the surface temperature</a> of the water, not the temperature of the whole bath.) It&#8217;s also tricky to ensure that all your ice is the same temperature going in.</p>
<p>We ultimately decided not to repeat an ice test because the insulation performance is so clearly demonstrated by a hot-water test. If heat coming into the cup is any different than heat escaping, the amount of time it takes for that difference to show is measured in hours. If you really want the best insulation possible to keep ice frozen all day long (or if you want to keep small amounts of liquid nitrogen, or something similar), a sealed narrow-neck bottle is still your best bet.</p>
<h3>Leak test</h3>
<p>In our travel mug tests, we went as far as putting the mugs into a spin dryer to see if they would leak in the most extreme circumstances. By comparison, most tumblers will spill some of your drink when you tip them sideways. We filled each tumbler with water and turned them upside down to see if any of the stoppers actually prevent leaks.</p>

Don't put this in a bag with a laptop, but if you knock it over it's not going to dump your drink.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The RTIC&#8217;s lid is surprisingly secure, given the competition. You can usually hold this cup upside down, or even leave it sitting on a table upside down, and not see more than a few drops. As soon as you shake it or drop it on the floor, though, all bets are off. (The more fluid you have inside, the more explosive the spill will be when the flip-cap pops open.)</p>
<p>Of the two brands that are trying sliders, YETI is fairly successful, while Pelican&#8217;s lid is a hot mess. It&#8217;s not clear exactly what the issue is, since the basics of the mechanism seem the same, but the Pelican lid always dribbled a stream of water when we turned it upside down. The YETI &#8220;Mag Slider&#8221; lid isn&#8217;t as magical as it sounds, but it works fairly well to stop anything more than occasional drips.</p>
<p>Hydro Flask gives you nothing to work with for spill prevention. If you really want the color options and tapered form factor they&#8217;re offering, they do have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07943NMYX/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a straw lid option</a> that might be better at stemming the flow of sticky drinks in case of an accident.</p>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RTIC &#8211; 30-Ounce Insulated Tumbler</a> is the best bargain in this lineup, and it&#8217;s our top pick overall. The stopper actually prevents some spills, and compatible accessories are easy to find. This is an updated version of the RTIC, but the old <a href="https://www.amazon.com/RTIC-30-oz-Tumbler-Pink/dp/B019D9HESO/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">all-metal-no-stopper version</a> is still available.</p>
<p>Without buying and trying out these tumblers, it&#8217;s easy to make assumptions about performance. &#8220;Maybe the steel is thinner,&#8221; you think. &#8220;Maybe the vacuum is actually less of a vacuum.&#8221; Our testing shows, though, that If there&#8217;s anything fancy that other brands are doing to improve theoretical insulation performance, the giant plastic lid is an equalizer that levels the playing field.</p>
<p>In every case we&#8217;ve seen (even among top-class insulating mugs and bottles from Zojirushi, Thermos and Hydro Flask) a big lid means mediocre insulation. Improving the insulation of a tumbler without making the lid area smaller is like adding better insulation to your house while the doorways and windows are sealed with plastic sheets.</p>

The plastic base is a drawback, but the price makes this a real winner. If you're picky enough about durability or insulation that a budget model is a turn-off, you should probably check out a travel mug or thermos anyhow.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>So, what is the difference that brings the price down? The plastic &#8220;foot&#8221; on this new RTIC is less tough than the YETI if you drop it on a hard surface, but the difference in price more than makes up for that.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important consideration when it comes to recommending a bargain-priced tumbler is availability: <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-30-Ounce-Double-Wall-Vacuum-Sealed-Tumbler/171452737" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ozark Trail</a>, <a href="https://www.target.com/p/zak-designs-174-30oz-stainless-steel-tumbler/-/A-52542332" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zak! Designs</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Steel-Tumbler-Insulated-Greens/dp/B01AZB6TQW/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BEAST</a> and a dozen other companies are also producing similar tumblers at low price points, but inventory (and new brands) come and go seasonally. RTIC has been around since the beginning of the fake-YETI game, and availability online is always good. That popularity also means that accessories (like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0779M1CBK/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this handle</a>) will actually be designed to fit this cup.</p>
<p>The main feature that bumped this tumbler to the top of our lineup is the spill-proof lid. If you don&#8217;t want the flip-cap to stick up into your face when you&#8217;re drinking, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019D9HESO/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">older version of the RTIC</a> with no stopper is going to be just as good at insulating your drink. Note that the outer dimensions are slightly different; old-style handles don&#8217;t fit new-style mugs with the plastic foot.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The RTIC &#8211; 30-Ounce Insulated Tumbler is a bargain-priced drink vessel that will keep your beverage just as cold (or hot) as other brands.</li>
<li>This flip-up lid stopper is the only option we found that really prevents leaks, though it&#8217;s still not safe to put in a bag.</li>
<li>RTIC compromises on quality very slightly, with some plastic parts, but the vacuum insulation is all that it needs to be.</li>

If you want something better than a budget-priced tumbler, there&#8217;s no way to beat the original <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YETI &#8211; Rambler</a>. YETI didn&#8217;t technically invent this category of drinkware (similar insulated travel mugs have been around for a very long time), but they created a new market with big 30-ounce tumblers targeted at outdoor enthusiasts who loved their coolers for camping and tailgating.</p>
<p>This is not a Yeti thermos: You can easily beat this kind of insulation with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07996C56J/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">narrow-neck bottle from Klean Kanteen</a>, for about the same price. If you want the easy-filling and easy-sipping convenience of a tumbler, YETI has the same performance drawbacks as the other brands.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/YETIcta-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/YETIcta-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/YETIcta-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/YETIcta-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/YETIcta-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/YETIcta-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/YETIcta-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/YETIcta-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/YETIcta.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Upgrade Pick: YETI - Rambler</h3><p>YETI didn't invent this category, but they made the 30-ounce insulated party cup into a must-have accessory for cold refreshment. The magnetic slider is more convenient than a flip-up stopper, but it doesn't make this cup leakproof. The main reason to pick this tumbler is if you've gotta have that logo.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The one category YETI manages to squeak ahead of some competition is in spill prevention. The Rambler&#8217;s slide cover actually stops most (but not all) leakage and only lets drops escape. In comparison, the Pelican will dribble out a stream. The RTIC is more leak-proof, but the YETI really is ready for those times when your friend fires up the motor on the jet boat and you haven&#8217;t finished your drink.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a YETI for coffee that&#8217;s a little different than the classic 30-Ounce Rambler, there&#8217;s also the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BM72ZXT/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YETI &#8211; 14-Ounce Rambler Mug</a> for about $10 less. The small amount of coffee it holds compared to the large lid surface means it&#8217;s only going to keep your coffee hot for about 45 minutes, but compared to six minutes for an open-top ceramic mug for some people this is exactly what they&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>The other case where this is an obvious pick is if you&#8217;re buying a gift. Nothing says &#8220;I only sorta love you&#8221; like a knock-off version of a trendy product. If you know someone who actually wants a YETI, the price difference is worth it.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The YETI &#8211; Rambler is the product that got everyone buzzing about giant insulated cups, and they&#8217;re still the most recognizable.</li>
<li>The price of this tumbler is high, and it doesn&#8217;t keep your drink any hotter or colder than others.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll get drips if you hold the YETI upside down or drop it on the floor, but this lid is good at keeping your drink inside.</li>
</ul>

In many ways, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0769CQYVS/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican &#8211; Traveler</a> hits the optimal price to performance ratio in this lineup, but that doesn&#8217;t make it the best buy.</p>
<p>Pelican is a company that makes quality flight cases for sensitive equipment, and in many ways they&#8217;re like YETI: a small company who established a niche with a specific product, then started building a brand around it. This tumbler is a bit different than the rest, and if you love the screw-on lid with the bigger spout area it&#8217;s a good buy.</p>
<p>The slide-cover lid isn&#8217;t as good at sealing against leaks as YETI&#8217;s lid, though. It dribbles a small stream if you hold the cup upside down. If you really want to keep your drink in, the flip-up lid on the RTIC (or the old-style <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071KW6MRN/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican Snap Lid</a>, which you can still buy in 2018) is a better choice.</p>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079445ZGP/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hydro Flask &#8211; 32 Ounce Insulated Tumbler</a> is a notable contender from one of the big names in the world of insulated drinkware. Many publications give it a win for the sleek profile and brand reputation.</p>
<p>About the only feature that really stands out, though, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07943NMYX/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the straw lid</a>. If you want your insulated tumbler to look like a Big Gulp, this is the way to go. It&#8217;s a hefty price tag, though: The straw lid was a $13 accessory for a $40 tumbler when we checked. The basic lid that comes with the tumbler is claimed to be designed for good insulation, but without even a stopper to keep heat from circulating in and out it doesn&#8217;t make any difference.</p>
<p>If you or the person you&#8217;re buying for already have a Hydro Flask water bottle, buying a matching tumbler for use around the house is a nice touch. They&#8217;re good looking tumblers, but they don&#8217;t perform any better than the other brands to justify the huge price difference.</p>

If you primarily want an insulated cup to drink coffee from, we think a sealed and better-insulated travel mug is a smarter pick than a tumbler. If you want to carry water around with you, likewise, water bottles are better at making water portable while keeping it colder (or hotter.)</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re just looking for the functionality of the classic SOLO party cup with the benefit of better insulation, the double-wall stainless steel vacuum-insulated tumbler checks all the right boxes.</p>
<p>The brand everyone knows is YETI, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">our best buy pick from RTIC</a> beats that cup in two ways: first, RTIC is selling their cup at less than half the price with no loss in performance. Second, the RTIC has a flip-up spout stopper that actually keeps your drink inside, even if you turn it upside down and shake it.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t like the flip-up lid or if you don&#8217;t like supporting imitation products, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the YETI &#8211; Rambler</a> has an updated lid that&#8217;s pretty good at keeping drinks inside without sticking a flap in your nose.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>In order to determine which grinders to test, we drew on the extensive research we did in our best electric grinders post. We were looking for a grinder that can create grinds consistent for either French press or pour over coffees, which are the most common at-home brewing methods. Consumers brewing those styles are looking for grind particles that are consistently medium to coarse with an equal number of larger and smaller grinds and the majority in the middle.</p>
<p>In the French press and pour-over style of coffee brewing, a consistent grind releases flavors and exposes aromatics to the coffee drinker. On the other hand, an inconsistent grind can lead to off-flavors and bitterness because different ground sizes cause inconsistent release of flavors and aromatics. We used a <a href="https://www.kruveinc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kruve Sifter</a> to measure the grind particle size distribution and determine which grinders were consistently generating the desired grind particles.</p>
<p>We read a wide array of user reviews from Amazon, Reddit and various coffee blogs to create a list of grinders to consider. Then, we cross-referenced them with manual grinder reviews across the web, looking for brands and specific grinders that scored highly across a wide variety of sources. Ultimately, we chose four grinders to test: two that seemed primarily designed for countertop use and two that were sized more efficiently, making them more versatile for home or on-the-go use.</p>
<p>We looked to determine if the size of the grinder impacted the quality of the grind. We also considered the user’s experience when grinding at home and while traveling. Durability was scrutinized more closely when considering if a grinder was suitable for use outside the home.</p>
<p>For espresso drinkers, a consistent, fine grind is traditionally preferred. However, recent science has shown that a controlled mix of particle sizes is important for generating the subtle flavors an espresso can possess. So if espresso is what you’re after, you’ll want a grinder created specifically for that purpose. Although it is possible to make an espresso fine grind with a manual grinder, we excluded espresso as a brewing method to focus on the most common methods of coffee making.</p>

<p>In addition to the grinders we tested, there were several notable hand grinders that we chose not to review, including multiple versions of the Lido line of grinders from Orphan Espresso and the Knock &#8211; Feldgrind manual grinder. These grinders are highly regarded and in some cases fairly hard to acquire, but since we chose $100 or less as a reasonable budget for the average consumer purchasing their first manual grinder, we decided to omit them.</p>

[table id=101 /]
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>We considered a multitude of features on each grinder, including grind options, grind consistency and particle size distribution, user experience, cleanliness, durability, noise, size and aesthetic. Each of our grinders featured a conical ceramic burr set, eliminating the need to compare differing burr materials. Conical burr grinders consist of a cone-shaped burr that sits inside of a hollowed out burr that fits over it. Grinds are pulled vertically through the burrs.</p>
<p><b>Grind options: </b>Only the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Handground-Precision-Coffee-Grinder-Ceramic/dp/B01GQVFCLS/?tag=ybdmanl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Handground Precision</a> offered preset indicators for the style of grind they’re intended for. For example, an image of a French press brewer represents the recommended setting for making French press coffee. The remaining three grinders used some variation of a rotating nut that can be loosened or tightened for coarser or finer grinds. One detriment we found on these three was a tendency for the nut to loosen on its own depending on the vigor with which the user was grinding beans. All four allowed for variation between steps or offered a stepless rotation, allowing for micro adjustments for truly dialing in a grind profile.</p>
<p><b>Size, style, materials and durability:</b> We also considered each grinder’s size, if it was suitable for use while traveling and if the materials would withstand regular use over time. There was a noticeable divide between the smaller, travel-friendly grinders and the countertop-based grinders. The smaller ones were more durable with bodies made primarily of stainless steel. Both the Porlex and JavaPresse have stainless steel bodies and a removable arm, making them easier to use while traveling.</p>
<p>All of the grinders had conical ceramic burr sets. However, the overall quality of a ceramic burr set is more accurately measured over time. High-quality burrs will stay sharp and require less maintenance as time goes on. Low-quality burrs may be sharp at first, but dull quickly, requiring sharpening or replacement. Sharp burrs grind more consistently than a dull grinder.</p>
<p>The larger the grinder, the more beans it can hold in the hopper, reducing the need to fill and refill beans if making multiple cups.</p>
<p><b>Noise and speed: </b>How loud a grinder is, especially in the morning, matters a great deal! The manual grinders were all quieter than electric versions, but some unexpected noise issues occurred during use due to the instability of the countertop grinders. The Hario and Handground were top-heavy when filled with beans. During the testing process they were prone to tip and fall, causing a ruckus.</p>
<p>It took between two and three minutes for each grinder to hand grind beans for one cup of coffee (27 grams). The larger grinders had an advantage: one rotation of the cranking arm created more grind than their smaller counterparts. They also held more beans.</p>
<p><b>User experience: </b>In our testing, we considered how easy it was to set up and adjust each grinder and its functionality of use. Some grinders were unsteady when the crank arm was rotating, and some were unnecessarily difficult to calibrate. The minimalist JavaPresse &#8211; Manual Grinder and Porlex &#8211; JP-30 have a simple up and down design with easy-to-remove burr sets, which makes for minimal mess and easy cleanup.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We tested each grinder for grind quality, and conducted blind taste tests with both French press and pour over coffee. We did our testing at the Coffee Cycle coffee shop in an effort to keep our methods consistent with our previous electric grinder testing. Proprietor Chris O’Brien provided a high level of expertise in all facets of coffee in case we faced difficulties. In order to keep our testing consistent, all of our grind particle size and distribution tests were done from one batch, as was all of our brewed coffee in the taste test. Chris provided us with El Salvadorian coffee beans from the awarding-winning Bird Rock Roasters for our testing.</p>
<p>French press grinds should be between 600 and 1,000 microns in size. For pour-over coffees, the ideal grind is between 400 and 800 microns. To achieve the ideal flavor extraction, the majority of grinds should be consistently sized. Grind size distribution should be a bell curve with a small but equal number of finer and larger grind particles complementing the majority of beans in the middle of the size distribution.</p>
<p>We set up <a href="https://www.kruveinc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kruve Sifter’s</a> three-tiered receptacle system with sifters of 600 and 1,000 microns for our first grinding test. That range showed a grind that was ideal for French press, our coarsest desired grind. We set each grinder on the finest setting as our starting point. This process made it easy to identify grinders that created a lot of boulders (large particles) or extra fines (very small particles).</p>
<p>“Usable settings” are not something you can typically determine before buying a manual coffee grinder. Manufacturers imply that all the settings are usable, but our previous testing on electric grinders and our testing on manual grinders proved otherwise.</p>
<p>Usable grind size settings are more important than total settings because any options outside the desired range for French press or pour over coffees are not beneficial for coffee brewing.</p>
<h3>Consistency</h3>

<p>We ran an equal weight of beans through each grinder multiple times to do a basic level calibration of the machine, making sure the grinder was assembled correctly, and working properly. All the beans were ground from the same batch. Then, we measured the grinds with the Kruve Sifter to determine if each grinder would consistently achieve the desired results over multiple uses. Only the JavaPresse and Porlex achieved grinds fine enough and with an even enough distribution to make a quality French press or pour over coffee.</p>

<p>All of the grinders we tested were fairly easy to set up and use out of the box. The Hario &#8211; Skerton was the most difficult to adjust. It has a unique grind adjustment mechanism that required you to unscrew and remove the crank arm, then disconnect an interlocking nut and stopper system in order to adjust the grind setting. The silicone grip base did not stabilize well, which made it more difficult to grind. The Handground &#8211; Precision manual grinder came with additional washers to calibrate the burr set; however, the process was complicated, messy and ultimately not beneficial.</p>

<p>We all performed our taste test using a traditional cupping method, looking for body, acidity and flavor. Traditional coffee cupping involves filling a cupping spoon three-quarters full with coffee. To taste, you tip and slurp the coffee aggressively in order to aerate the coffee flavors and spread them across your palate. This process cools the liquid, minimizing temperature differences that may impact the flavor profile of the coffee.</p>
<p>We gathered a random sampling of tasters with varying coffee experience to taste the coffee made with our grinders. We ground multiple sets of beans with each grinder, and brewed a French press and pour over cup from each. Each cup in the taste test used beans ground at the optimal settings based on our prior testing, and was brewed with 27.5 grams of coffee to 400 milliliters of water.</p>
<p>Then, we ranked each cup from best to worst in the categories of French press and pour over. We aggregated the rankings from each taster to create a combined score for each grinder in both styles. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013R3Q7B2/?tag=ybdmanl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">JavaPresse</a> won our tasting for French press, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002JZCF2/?tag=ybdmanl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Porlex</a> won for pour over style. The Hario Skerton took third in both categories and the Handground fourth.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013R3Q7B2/?tag=ybdmanl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">JavaPresse &#8211; Manual Grinder</a> was our clear winner. It was the best overall grinder for both at-home manual coffee grinding, as well as the best for on-the-go grinding needs. The JavaPresse claims 15 settings, but stepless micro-adjustments offer lots of opportunity to achieve the grind profile desired for both pour over and French press.</p>
<p>The JavaPresse is small, compact and extremely easy to assemble, adjust and use. To use, you remove the cap at the top to put your beans in the hopper, replace it, fit the crank arm and turn the arm to grind the beans.</p>
<p>It only holds enough beans for one 12-ounce cup of coffee but makes up for it with a durable stainless steel body and high-quality conical, ceramic burr set. Adjusting settings merely requires sliding the grind catcher off the body of the grinder and rotating the nut that adjusts the settings from fine to coarse.</p>

It also won first place in our French press blind taste test.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013R3Q7B2/?tag=ybdmanl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The body itself is very stable and fits together well. Each part complements the other parts. During the grind effort, the body and bean hopper remain tightly connected. A tall, narrow slot window allows you to see grinds building up, adding confidence that all your hard work is effective. Its small size and removable crank arm allows for easy storage and transport. It is small and light enough to comfortably fit in a purse, briefcase or backpack. Its vertical packing shape also prevents it from becoming unwieldy.</p>
<p>During testing, we started with the finest grind setting and got a good distribution of grinds falling within the 400-800 micron range, but none below the 400 micron mark. That range is just right for a pour over. With some minor adjustments, the grinds would come out in the 600-1,000 micron range with a perfect bell curve of size distribution.</p>
<p>The majority of grinds were in the middle of the desired range with some finer and larger grind particles. Despite the small stature, the JavaPresse was the most effective at creating grinds that fell within our desired ranges for French press and pour over coffee.</p>
<p>One drawback we found is that you cannot see into the bean hopper to see if you’ve ground all of your beans. This is true of the Porlex &#8211; JP-30 as well. It seems to be a sacrifice of size and durable stainless-steel body. You have to do it by feel, or by taking off the crank arm and cap to look. With only gravity pulling the beans down on a smaller burr set, it takes almost three minutes grind a cup of coffee for a set of beans. The Porlex handle on the crank is too small and can be frustrating after awhile.</p>
<p>You have the ability to make micro adjustments, but it is hard to tell if you’re on the same setting each time if you ever change it. You could mark it with a sharpie to make sure that it stays in place. However, it is the most economically priced grinder we tested.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://javapresse.com/impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JavaPresse website</a>, the company donates to a cause for every purchase or “action” a member of the community makes. There is no description of what constitutes an action or how much is donated, but they are currently supporting the Make-a-Wish foundation of Central and South Texas.</p>

<p>At first glance the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002JZCF2/?tag=ybdmanl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Porlex &#8211; JP-30</a> could be a twin to the JavaPresse, but it really doesn’t have the same caliber of quality. The Porlex’s fit between top section containing the burr set and hopper and the lower grind catcher is looser, so you need to make sure you hold it firmly in the middle or it will pull apart during use. It has the same durable stainless steel body, and the crank arm is a bit longer, helping generate a bit more leverage to speed up the grinder. The knob on the crank arm is also bigger and a little more ergonomically pleasing. Internally, the parts feel cheaper. There is more of a mess and static around the base of the burr set, which causes grinds to cling to the burr set instead of falling into the grind catcher (which you cannot see because there is no window on the grinder catcher).</p>

<p>At the finest grind settings, a majority of the grind falls in the desired range of 600-1,000. It tended toward too coarse of a grind for even French press during the first round testing, but became more consistent as we used it. By the time we taste tested, we could get grinds fine enough for pour overs, but it wasn’t consistent. One grind would create a perfect distribution of grinds for pour over and the next wouldn’t be good enough for French press, even though we did not change any of the adjustments on the grind.</p>
<p>Despite issues with consistency and quality control for fitting of the parts, the Porlex was still a useable grinder. However, it has a much higher price-point and felt underwhelming compared to the JavaPresse. It was functionally much better than our other finalists, the Hario and Handground, making it our second place finisher.</p>

<p>Our other two competitors were both more suited toward the kitchen counter than on-the-go. The largest in size by a significant margin, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Handground-Precision-Coffee-Grinder-Ceramic/dp/B01GQVFCLS/?tag=ybdmanl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Handground &#8211; Precision Grinder </a>looks cool and feels sturdy. It comes with a sticky base meant to help with stability and a side-mounted crank arm to generate leverage.</p>
<p>The anti-static glass hopper and bean catcher prevent grinds from clinging to the side, and it can hold three to four cups worth of beans to be ground in the hopper. The hopper and catcher are glass, so you can see when your grind is done, and it comes with washer for calibrating the burr set more finely.</p>
<p>For each positive feature of the Handground, there was a negative. The Handground was very hard to keep stable during the grinding process. The extra leverage afforded by the side mount crank arm also caused it to tilt and wobble, even if you were using your opposite hand as a stabilizer. It worked best when we were standing and applied downward pressure on top of the grinder.</p>
<p>Our first attempts to grind beans resulted in a grind profile much too coarse for a French press. In order to calibrate for a finer grind, we needed to pull apart the entire apparatus, which includes three screws undone with an Allen wrench (provided), two rotating outer pieces, the burr assembly including inner and outer, the hopper, rotating preset arms and the springs and washers already in there. The entire inside is coated with industrial lubricant, so be prepared for a mess on your hands. And you definitely want to wash the machine thoroughly afterwards.</p>
<p>After spending 15 minutes trying to get everything to line up again, we finally reassembled the Handground Precision Grinder. We added both washers in hopes of creating a much finer grind capable of producing a pour over coffee, but we were disappointed. Originally, a majority of the beans were ground to boulders over 1000m with a significantly lesser amount caught below 1000m, and a minority of grinds at finer than 600m in the bottom of the sifter.</p>
<p>After adding the washers to create a raised burr set and setting the grinder to the finest setting more than half the total grinds were still boulders above 1000m. A quarter of the grinds fell in between our desired range of 600-1,000, and the remainder were fines and extreme fines. That meant the Handground was incapable of making grinds in our desired range for either pour over or French press during our testing.</p>
<p>There was no consistency to this grinder. It has a beautiful aesthetic, but the function and quality of grind fails to impress. We also considered that we made a mistake in the reassembly of the grinder, but the complicated grind system would have still negatively impacted our ranking of the grinder significantly.</p>
<p>Finally, the Handground was the unanimous last place finisher in our blind taste testing for both French press and pour over style of coffee. This grinder fails to impress: It feels like the functionality of the grinder was an afterthought to the aesthetic.</p>
<h3>Hario &#8211; Skerton</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001802PIQ/?tag=ybdmanl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hario &#8211; Skerton</a> is a serviceable coffee grinder. It feels like a bland version of the Handground, though it is more effective. It does allow for micro adjustments, but it is more complicated than the other grinders to adjust, and is not very intuitive. The ceramic burr set seems like it is of a decent quality, but most of the other parts feel cheap.</p>
<p>It has a plastic hopper and glass-bowl bean catcher that is heatproof but not anti-static. One grind and there was already a mess of grinds stuck to the interior chamber. The curvature of the base looks good, but it also catches grinds at the lip, making it more difficult to disperse them. The cap is a soft anti-slip silicone cover that will slip off with a minor bump. There is an anti-slip silicone cover on for the base that isn’t fitted and collects dirt and dust. It fell off multiple times during testing.</p>
<p>It is in-between the Handground and JavaPresse in size but still big enough to be inconvenient for traveling. Its dumbbell shape makes it a little wobbly, but because it is shorter in stature it doesn’t tip as much as the Handground.</p>
<p>At the finest possible grind setting, the majority of grinds falls above 1000m with a quarter each in the desired range and too fine. The grind fails to meet even the coarsest options for a French press. It placed third in our taste test and failed to leave an impression.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013R3Q7B2/?tag=ybdmanl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">JavaPresse</a> consistently created the right grind profiles to make great tasting cups of French press and pour over coffee. It has a user-friendly design that is easy to use, great for traveling extremely durable. Plus, it’s the best price. It was easy to choose the JavaPresse as the best manual grinder to buy for at home or on the go.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002JZCF2/?tag=ybdmanl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Porlex &#8211; JP-30</a> would be your alternative choice if you’re looking for a similar product from an established company. The consistency of grinds seemed to improved with continued use, and it has a durable finish. Ultimately neither the Hario nor the Handground were able to produce the desired grinds with any consistency, making them impossible for us to recommend.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>In order to determine which grinders to test, we had to learn what great grinders are supposed to do. So, we went to experts in the coffee industry like cafe owner and barista Chris O’Brien, enthusiasts like roaster Nathan Long and got some assistance in our testing from hydrodynamacist Doug Dommeruth. We read industry reports on best practices that make for high quality grind results according to the <a href="http://www.scaa.org/?page=main" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Specialty Coffee Association of America</a>.</p>
<p>We specifically learned about the differences between burr and blade grinders, found examples of conical and flat or disk burrs and compared steel vs ceramic burrs. We also researched the type of <a href="https://www.kruveinc.com/pages/recipe-series" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grind consistency and brewing guidelines</a> that are ideal for the most common at-home coffee styles of pour over and French Press.</p>
<p>We also used user reviews to find out what brewing methods the general consumer is using at home. We learned that how well a grinder performs depends partially on what brew method you are planning to use with the grounds. According to our research, most users are making a French press, drip, pour over or Aeropress style of coffee at home, and are looking for grind particles that are consistent with uniform, medium to coarse size.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10005" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/coffee-brewing-guide.png" alt="coffee brewing guide by method" width="2000" height="1716" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/coffee-brewing-guide.png 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/coffee-brewing-guide-610x523.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/coffee-brewing-guide-1500x1287.png 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/coffee-brewing-guide-768x659.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/coffee-brewing-guide-885x759.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/coffee-brewing-guide-300x257.png 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/coffee-brewing-guide-295x253.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/coffee-brewing-guide-1000x858.png 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/coffee-brewing-guide-360x309.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/coffee-brewing-guide-375x322.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/coffee-brewing-guide-414x355.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/coffee-brewing-guide-320x275.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/coffee-brewing-guide-768x659@2x.png 1536w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/coffee-brewing-guide-300x257@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Then, we read a wide array of user reviews from Amazon, Reddit and Prima Coffee and cross-referenced them with “top grinders” lists, looking for commonalities. We narrowed our list to 10 and then cut it to seven by looking for overlapping brands or features that would negatively impact that grinder’s ability to be the “best coffee grinder” to use at home. For example, one brand makes multiple grinders with the same designs, but upgraded features at higher price points.</p>
<p>In the French press and pour over style of coffee brewing, a consistent grind releases flavors and exposes aromatics to the coffee drinker in a controlled way. On the other hand, an inconsistent grind can lead to off-flavors and bitterness because different ground sizes cause inconsistent release of flavors and aromatics. We used a <a href="https://www.kruveinc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kruve Sifter</a> to measure the grind particle size distribution and determine which grinders were consistently generating the desired grind particles.</p>
<p>For the espresso drinker, a consistent, fine grind has traditionally been preferred. However, recent studies have shown that a controlled mix of particle sizes was important for generating the subtle flavors an espresso can generate. For the purposes of our grinder testing, we are excluding espresso and focusing on the other most common methods of coffee making and the grinders that work best for at-home use.</p>

<p>Features we considered on each grinder were the number of grind options, the consistency of the grind’s particle sizes, motor noise, ease of use, cleanliness, size and aesthetics. In addition to talking directly to local coffee roasters and experts, we researched the difference between burr and blade grinders.</p>
<p><b>Burr versus blade grinder: </b>Blade grinders are just what they sound like, two blades connected in the middle to a spinning axle. They look similar to an airplane propeller. The blades spin on a flat platform, chopping the coffee beans. Blade grinders are generally very affordable, but they also lack the ability to maintain a consistent grind due to inconsistencies in cutting speed and the location at which the blade impacts the beans. Blade grinders also dull more quickly than burr grinders.</p>
<p>The clear winner between burr and blade when choosing a grinder is burr grinders: they provide a more consistent grind profile that is particularly suited to French press and pour over styles. Burrs are also more durable and dull at a slower pace than a blade grinder, and with more control you are able to create the grinds that are best suited to your personal taste.</p>
<p><b>Types of burr grinders: “</b>Burrs” are two rough-edge surfaces, often steel or ceramic, that beans are crushed and ground between. Once you’ve chosen a burr grinder, you must choose a steel or ceramic burr, and determine if you’d prefer a conical or flat burr set for your grinder.</p>
<p><b>Flat burr grinders: </b>Flat burr grinders have the option to adjust the width between burrs making for a more specific calibration when trying to get desired grind result. However, they are known to cause more waste and static which may make your grinds stick to the sides of the container. Beware of false burrs or hybrid burrs that use teeth to break up beans as opposed to grinding them.</p>
<p><b>Conical burr grinders: </b>Conical burr grinders consist of a cone-shaped burr that sits inside of a hollowed out burr that fits over it. Grinds are pulled vertically through the burrs. Conical grinders generally rotate at a slower rate than flat burr grinders, making them quieter. The slower speed generates less friction and heat. This is considered a positive because of the potential for the heat to impact the flavors of the grind before it comes into contact with properly heated water. Grinders with conical burrs are often more expensive at the consumer level than flat burr grinders.</p>
<p><b>Steel versus ceramic burrs: </b>For both steel and ceramic burrs, the sharper the burr, the more consistent the grind will be over the long term. Ceramic burrs are most often found in commercial grinders or high-end consumer models. They are harder and stay sharp longer than steel burrs, but are also more brittle which can cause them to chip if there is a stone mixed in with your beans.</p>
<p><b>Usable settings: </b>In addition to burr style, we considered each grinders’ <i>usable grind settings</i>. A usable setting is a grind setting which delivers the most grind particles between 600 and 800 microns. We used the Kruve Sifter to determine the grind size distribution. The Kruve is a series of fine to coarse sieves and catching hopper that measure the size of ground coffee particles. Grind particles in that size range create the optimal amount of exposed bean-surface to extract even flavor profiles when exposed to hot water for drip, pour over, Aeropress and French press brewing.</p>
<p><b>Stepped versus stepless grinders: </b>Our chosen grinders were either stepped or stepless. On a stepped grinder, you can only jump from one step to the next, either more fine or more coarse in a predetermined increment. Stepless grinders enable more minute adjustments between pre-set markings, allowing for a more specific calibration of our grinder and more opportunities for creating the perfect cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Out of the box, the Bodum’s usable preset options did not create the preferred grind output. However, because it is stepless we were able to make tiny micro-adjustments between those settings to create excellent grinds for both pour over and French press style coffee. The Bodum’s stepless capabilities made all the difference for dialing in the perfect grind. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XPRQW2A/?tag=ybdgrndr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kitchenaid</a> has four usable settings, but because we were limited to only those four options with no adjustments in between, we were unable to consistently generate our desired grind.</p>
<p><b>Size, style, materials and durability: </b>We also considered the overall size and style of each grinder. At-home users will likely be keeping their grinder in view on a kitchen countertop. An overly large grinder could be a detriment if counter space is at a premium or in smaller living spaces. If the grinder is always in view, you want it to look good, so, style was an added consideration when determining which grinder to recommend.</p>
<p>The materials used and quality of the grinder’s build are important considerations for choosing a grinder. We examined each grinder, looking for weak spots and noting quality of materials used. For example, if plastic was substituted for glass in the grind catcher the static would cause more of a mess. Grinder motor cases, and burr material were important factors too.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0161Q2RUM/?tag=ybdgrndr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Krups</a> was one of the smallest grinders we tested and its blue tinted grind collector sure looked cool, but it felt cheap. The plastic housing and buttons seemed on the verge of breaking. The cool blue grind collector was not as functional either. Without an anti-static coating, the plastic held onto the grinds making it necessary to clean after every use to avoid grind build up affecting your coffee flavor.</p>
<p>The Baratza &#8211; Virtuoso felt heavy duty and looked professional. It had a small, but tall footprint and seemed to blend in wherever it was stationed. Numerous reviews attested to its long term durability as well, and is a favorite of coffee geeks and coffee shops alike.</p>

<p>After selecting our shortlist of contenders, we went to the experts next. We spoke with Chris O’Brien, proprietor of Coffee Cycle in Pacific Beach, San Diego, who learned the trade at the award-winning Bird Rock Coffee Roaster. While the grinders we tested are for at-home consumer use, we did most of our testing at the Coffee Cycle shop in an effort to keep our methods consistent with a high level of expertise.</p>
<p>Chris provided us with high quality Bird Rock Roasters coffee beans from the same batch to keep our testing consistent and acted as the on-site expert for taste testing and quality control. We tested each grinder for grind quality and again in a blind taste tests with both French press and pour over brewing. For heating up water, check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-electric-kettle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electric kettle review</a>, but if you need a more controlled pour for pourover brewing we recommend a goose neck kettle.</p>
<p>Scientist Doug Dommermuth helped us develop our method of testing, and aided us in understanding our accumulated data. Doug’s background is as hydrodynamacist studying fluid in motion or developing code to understand waves. Doug is also passionate about coffee and was able to talk us through some of the deeper science of coffee including flavor profiles based on refraction rates and pointing out initial flaws in our testing based on his experience as a scientist.</p>
<p>It should be noted that while we were only able to test these grinders as-new, the overall quality of a burr is more accurately measured over time. A quality burr will stay sharp and require less maintenance, while a lower quality burr may dull quickly  and require sharpening or replacement. Commenting on our testing methods, professional barista Chris O’Brien said “this is the most accurate testing a consumer could do on an unseasoned burr.”</p>
<p>French press grinds should be between 600 and 1000 microns in size. For pour over coffees our ideal grind should be between 400 and 800 microns. To achieve the ideal flavor extraction the majority of grinds should be consistently sized. A smaller, but equal number of finer and larger grind particles would complement the larger middle grind size. We set up the Kruve Sifter’s three-tiered receptacle system to catch most grinds in the center of our preferred range. This process also made it easy to identify grinders that created lots of boulders (large particles) or extra fines (really small particles).</p>
<p>“Usable Settings” are not something you can typically determine before buying a product. Manufacturers would imply that all the settings are usable, but our testing proved otherwise. For each grinder, we started in the very middle grind setting and worked our way up or down as needed. Usable settings are more important than total settings because any options outside the desired range added no value to the grinders, and are not beneficial to the at-home user. We found that if a machine could consistently grind 600-800 microns for French press, we would also be able to achieve the finer grind needed for a pour over coffee setting.</p>
<p><b>Consistency: </b>We ran 27.5 grams of coffee beans through each grinder multiple times to do a basic level calibration of the machine. All the bean ground were from the same bag. Then, we ran a control grind to measure for each grinder. Finally, we measured our grinds with our Kruve Sifter to determine if each grinder would consistently achieve the desired results over multiple uses.</p>
<p>We also checked the grinds against the suggested settings for each grinder. In almost all cases, the manufacturer’s suggested settings for French press and pour over failed to produce properly ground coffee. However, because of the stepless nature of some grinders, we were able to find usable settings close to those suggested presets.</p>
<p><b>Ease of use: </b>We pulled the grinders from the box and attempted to setup and use each without reading the directions to see if the settings were intuitive. The Baratza &#8211; Virtuoso was the minimalist of our lineup with only a single button and single timer switch, while the Breville &#8211; Smart Grinder Pro had a digital screen that offered a multitude of settings and options.</p>
<p>All of the grinders were fairly easy to setup and use, but often the suggested settings were incorrect, requiring some calibration or adjustment. The Capresso &#8211; Infinity grinder was the only one that accurately indicated which settings would be right for a particular brew style, but only half of those settings were usable. The Cuisinart had a safety shut off where it wouldn’t grind if the bean hopper wasn’t accurately closed, but with no indicator we thought we may have broken it before we even got started. During testing, it continually impacted the user experience, and in one case, vibrated the lid loose enough to shut off on its own.</p>
<p><b>Size and design aesthetic: </b>How much counter space does it take up? If your grinder takes up the entire kitchen counter, it isn’t functional for at-home use. There is a good chance you’ll need that space at some point, so we considered the size and footprint of each of the grinders.</p>
<p>Then we looked to see if they were aesthetically appealing. Personal taste will vary, but there were notable design differences between the grinders. Some seemed to have been built solely with function in mind, and some seemed to have design as a part of the build process. That included color scheme of materials, length of the electrical cord and design of the user interface including setting icons, digital screens and timer.</p>
<p><b>Noise and cleanliness: </b>How loud is it going to be early in the morning? For at-home use this an important question, so we made sure to note when a grinder was observably louder than others or had a motor that revved loudly. The cleanliness of the grind from hopper to burrs to collection point and the spread of grinds when attempting to use them affect the experience of using a grinder, too.</p>
<p>The last thing you want to do after pouring an excellent cup of joe is spend a lot of time cleaning up after yourself. So the ease of <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoproducts/cleaning/">cleaning</a> was also considered.</p>

<p>According to Chris, our testers and observers, <strong>“What matters in the end is, does it make a good cup?”</strong> After all of our product testing, we performed a blind taste test with coffee made both as a French press and pour over brew from each grinder. We used beans from the same batch of Bird Rock Roasters Colombia Tolima. Bird Rock Coffee Roasters won National Micro-Roaster of the year (2012) and multiple awards for a variety of world and national coffee competitions.</p>
<p>For our blind taste test, we gathered tasters with varying coffee experience to taste cups of coffee made from our Bird Rock coffee beans. Each cup in the taste test used beans ground at the optimal settings based on our prior testing, brewed with 20 grams of coffee for 300 milliliters of water. We all performed our taste test using a<a href="http://www.scaa.org/?page=resources&amp;d=cupping-protocols" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> traditional cupping method</a>, looking for body, acidity and flavor.</p>
<p><b>How to test coffee</b>: A traditional cupping involves filling a cupping spoon ¾ full with coffee. To taste, you tip and slurp the coffee aggressively in order to aerate the coffee flavors and spreading them across your palate. This process also cools the liquid, minimizing temperature differences that may impact the flavor profile of the coffee.</p>
<p>Then we scored each cup based on a one to five scale for both French press and pour over, One being the worst and five being the best. We totaled the scores for each taster to create a combined score for each grinder for each coffee-making style. The highest score won the blind taste test.</p>
<p>Despite taste being fairly subjective, our blind taste testers came to a unanimous decision! All selected both the French press and pour over cups made from beans ground by the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0043095WW/?tag=ybdgrndr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bodum &#8211; Bistro Grinder</a>. Continuing the element of surprise, our taste testers were shocked to discover that their top three favorites also included the Krups &#8211; GX5000 and the Cuisinart grinders, which were the two least expensive grinders we tested. The Breville &#8211; Smart Grinder Pro scored very high marks for pour over style coffee, coming in fourth overall.</p>

<p>With so many grinders to test, each with a multitude of options, it was a surprise that there was even a clear winner. <strong>Factoring in all the variables and the taste test, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0043095WW/?tag=ybdgrndr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bodum &#8211; Bistro</a> was the overall best electric grinder for everyday at home use.</strong> The Bodum allowed for stepless micro-adjustments between presets, offering lots of opportunity to dial in your grind for both pour over and French press.</p>
<p>For French press, we found the preset for pour over (as indicated by the icon on the dial) consistently created grinds between 800 and 1000 microns.  For pour over, we adjusted two steps toward the espresso preset. Halfway between espresso and pour over was the sweet spot. Grinds at this setting were between 400 and 800 microns with an appropriate distribution of larger and smaller grinds. The finest preset, indicated as espresso, was actually an excellent setting for pour over coffee. These grinds were consistently between 400 and 600 microns.</p>

<p>The Bodum has one of the smallest footprints on the counter. It measures a modest 10.75” tall by 6.25” deep by 4.75” wide, and weighs just over four pounds. The cord is hidden underneath and is long enough to reach elusive wall outlets or remain hidden if you are able to keep it close. It has a sleek, modern design which we tested in black, but comes in a slew of other colors including blue, green, red, chrome, copper and white on white.</p>
<p>The materials pass the durability test, with an aluminum body housing a stainless steel conical burr on the inside. The hopper on top is BPA-free plastic, keeping it lightweight, and the grind catcher is made of anti-static borosilicate glass with a silicone wrap around the middle to prevent slipping.</p>
<p>The anti-static hopper prevents grinds from sticking to the sides, reducing the need to clean after each use, and stale grinds from getting into future coffees. The lid fits tight and has a fitted opening that covers the dispensing chute preventing mess, containing the grind when removing it from the grinder.</p>
<p>Our biggest durability concern is with some plastic pieces in the gears that operate the burrs. At a price point below $100 this isn’t a surprise, but user reviews skew positive for long term use.</p>
<p>The hopper holds 220 grams of coffee beans, which means less need to refill if you choose to store beans there. For optimal freshness, you might want to store your beans in an airtight container. A 12 ounce cup of French press or pour over demands 27.5 grams of roasted beans. This means that you’ll be able to grind about eight cups before needing to refill.</p>
<p>It was an impressive sweep. The Bodum &#8211; Bistro took the top spot for pour over and French press style coffees in our blind taste test. There was shock and surprise that our testers all chose the same coffees, and even more surprise when one of our lower priced entries took the top spot.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OXGXW8O/?tag=ybdgrndr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; Smart Grinder Pro</a> was our second choice for an at home grinder. The middle preset consistently created grinds in the 400 to 800 micron range, which overlaps the ideal grind size for both pour over and French press. It offered 60 preset grind options out of the box, and at least half of them are usable settings. That is the second most of all the grinders we tested, behind the Bodum &#8211; Bistro.</p>

<p>The Breville is a higher price point, but feels like a professional grinder. Its stainless steel conical burrs ground consistent particle sizes. It was also the only grinder with a high quality grounded plug which coiled conveniently underneath the grinder.</p>
<p>The Breville has a sealable grind receptacle making for minimal mess. It was the largest grinder, but it also held the most beans, up to a full pound.</p>
<p>The digital LCD screen was easy to read, and lights up in the dark. Its digital timer program, Dose IQ, made it easy to create repeatable results or grind the proper amount for multiple cups. If you’re looking for more professional options and versatile grind profiles, the Breville could be the right grinder for you.</p>
<p>As a bonus, it was also the only grinder able to create fine grinds for a quality espresso. It also offered attachment cradles to use an espresso portafilter during the grind process. The consistency of the grinds made this the best electric home grinder we tested for espresso drinkers.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-586-Virtuoso-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B006MLQHRG?tag=ybdgrndr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baratza &#8211; Virtuoso</a> looks professional with a smaller footprint than other almost pro-level grinders. It is simple and easy to use with a minimalist design and options. At least half of the grind settings were functional-to-good for our desired grind profile, but it was not as consistent as the Breville or Bodum in our testing. With fewer user options for customizing the grind, landing in the middle of our taste test and at the highest price point, it was hard to recommend. The Baratza was a high quality product, but didn’t fit the parameters we set for being the best at-home grinder.</p>
<p>Baratza is a popular brand with coffee professionals for longevity and great customer service. But even the coffee professionals consulted for this review agreed the dramatic difference in price-point made it hard to choose this established brand over the Bodum.</p>
<p>This item seems to have been out of stock on Amazon for a while now, and on Baratza&#8217;s official site, when you try to buy the Virtuoso, it redirects you to the Virtuoso+ item. This seems to be the same grinder, with a grind timer added. At the still high price point, it&#8217;s not likely we&#8217;ll test the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QMY8GLX/?tag=ybdig-20">Virtuoso+</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000AR7SY?tag=ybdgrndr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Capresso &#8211; Infinity</a> had a quiet, smooth grind with an accurate settings guide, but the grinds had to traverse a long chute between the hopper and the grind receptacle, forcing the user to flush the chute between each grind or risk stale grinds being mixed in with fresh ones. It performed well in the fine to medium-fine range, making it good for pour over coffees, but quality and consistency was lacking for other styles. The Capresso did everything okay, but nothing great.</p>
<p>To be fair though, we have four different family members using this grinder for mostly pourover coffee and they all love it. At this price point, the Capresso is very enticing as it gets the job done for many households, while looking pretty good on the counter too.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XPRQW2A/?tag=ybdgrndr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KCG0702CU</a> grinder looked great and felt heavy duty. It was also big with a deep footprint. Its size would make it tough to keep on the kitchen counter if space was any sort of concern. There were no steps between grind settings, leaving only four usable settings out of 15. The grind hopper and catcher were both made of glass, but beans would get caught in the grind hopper. You as the user would need to open up the hopper to force the beans down into the spinning burrs.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00018RRRK/?tag=ybdgrndr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; DBM-8</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0161Q2RUM/?tag=ybdgrndr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Krups &#8211; GX5000</a> received high marks in our taste test, but both failed the durability, materials and grind consistency tests. Only the very finest settings created grinds fit for a French press, and the burrs seemed smaller and cheaper, making it hard for the grinds to be properly crushed. The buttons on the Cuisinart actually stopped working for a time during our initial testing. We unplugged it, wiggled the cord and plugged it in again. It worked, but we aren’t sure why.</p>
<p>The redeeming quality of both grinders was the price, and placement in our taste test. Both were among our lowest priced entries, but scored high in our taste tests. That made us question our testing procedure, but also pointed to the subjective nature of taste testing. It is possible to get a decent cup of coffee out of an inconsistent grind using a professional barista, but considering the issues with quality and durability both fell out of contention for top placement.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The goal of a high-quality grind is to create a great tasting cup of coffee. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0043095WW/?tag=ybdgrndr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bodum &#8211; Bistro</a> combined consistent grind profiles and durable materials with a user friendly design to make a great cup of coffee that was top in our taste test. Those qualities and a consumer-friendly value make it the the best electric coffee grinder for home brewing of French press, pour over, drip and Aeropress coffee. The Breville &#8211; Smart Grinder Pro was also a great runner-up grinder with lots of professional options and design, but it’s twice the price of our top pick</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent over four weeks commandeering the office coffee pot, brewing over 50 pots and consuming about 400 cups to find that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X8NSHGU/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Verena Street &#8211; Mississippi Grogg</a> is the best cheap coffee brand. This light-roast, fair trade and kosher brand out-brewed the competition, pleasing even our pickiest taste tester and receiving complements such as “creamy” and “strong, but not overpowering.” For a bolder flavor profile, we recommend<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006G7WCTI/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Marley Coffee</a> medium roast or<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PV4FG3Q/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Koffee Kult</a> dark roast.</p>

<h2 class="collapse" id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>Our search began at the local grocery stores to see what was widely available to shoppers. We noted the ubiquitous blends and recorded their price per ounce. We then went to the reviewers on Amazon.com where coffee was available in all varieties. We considered options on Amazon, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Prime-Pantry/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=7301146011" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prime Pantry</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonFresh-Grocery/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=10329849011" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon Fresh</a> to find the best-rated cheap coffee options.</p>
<p>We narrowed our list to 20 brands total: 10 brands you know and 10 brands you want to know. Through our research we found that people are branching out to try more coffee flavors, sources and strengths.</p>
<p>Our research was then directed towards the price point and determining what classifies as a “cheap” cup of coffee. If you are heading to Starbucks to grab a grande cup of regular coffee, it will put you back $2.10. McDonald&#8217;s premium roast coffee will cost $1.29. Dunkin&#8217; Donuts medium coffee is $1.89. Frappuccinos, lattes and mochas will double your coffee cost.</p>
<p><strong>Our research has shown that the average ounce of coffee beans costs $0.51.</strong> Given a typical water to bean ratio, the average home-brewed mug costs $0.33 per cup. On the inexpensive side you can brew a cup for $0.15, or with pricey beans you will still only pay $0.57 per cup.</p>

<p>We found that there are a few major differences between coffee brands you know, and ones you don&#8217;t. The first being price. Coffee brands you know had an average per-cost-ounce of $0.51, twenty cents cheaper than unknown brands of $0.73. We first thought this might have been due to production costs from big farms and large processing facilities.</p>
<p>However, we quickly learned about two other factors that affected price: the source and batch size. Most brands you know are Arabica coffee sourced from Ethiopia. Unknown brands had more diverse sources and were a combination of small batch, organic, sustainable, fair trade and/or ethically sourced blends.</p>
<p>Something that kept coming up in our research was “conscious consumerism,” or awareness of the impact your coffee makes on the community, environment and overall quality of life of those who harvest and grow it. Campaigns for products free from animal testing, bee friendly pesticides, compostable packaging and sustainable farming are all part of conscious consumerism.</p>

<p>Sustainable farming is the production of food using techniques that protect the environment, public health, human communities and animal welfare. Seven out of ten of the unknown brands we chose listed organic, fair trade and sustainable farming methods, which is a major reason for the 20-cent increase in average price.</p>
<p>To further our research, we asked all of our coffee testers if they would spend an extra $1.00 on a product if it was proven that the company directly benefited the community or environment. Each tester said yes. In addition, when looking at overall ratings online, organically and sustainably-sourced coffee rated higher overall compared to your typical Arabica coffee.</p>
<p>As a result, the biggest factor affecting your coffee price is not the big brand name but the batch size, sourcing and farming techniques used to obtain it. When choosing a sustainable brand, you can rest assured knowing that while you will be spending a small amount more, you are also doing a small part to help the world.</p>

<p>Your favorite coffee connoisseur might have an argument for single origin vs blended origin beans, but the average coffee drinker will not taste the difference. Each origin has a unique attribute that is added to the bean, but the taste is not the main reason to look into blended or single origin. There are very few regulations that mandate disclosure of type, or percentages, of the blends in your bag of coffee. As a result some expensive blends may be a low percentage of a desirable origin and the majority could be from a less desirable origin.</p>
<p>The important factor to consider with your coffee source is the processing procedure in the location from which it came. For example, coffee beans that are sourced from Ethiopia or Brazil are processed naturally and result in bold and fruity flavors. Africa processes their beans in a washed process that produces more well-balanced and complex flavors with noticeable acidity when roasted. On the other hand, coffee that is sourced from Central and South America tends to be more expensive due to the processing method that reduces mold on the beans.</p>
<h3>Arabica vs. robusta beans</h3>
<p>Coffee can be compared to wine in terms of flavor because it is also affected by soil, altitude and the region in which it&#8217;s grown. The two types of coffee bean options are Arabica and Robusta: But what does this mean? The easiest way to categorize the two is by the altitude in which they grew. Arabica beans are grown in the mountains at an altitude above 2000 feet, while Robusta coffee is found below that, typically on flat plantations.</p>
<p>Arabica is the more desirable bean, and you will find it in nearly all your daily coffee blends. Arabica beans are more popular because they are grown in richer soil that allows the bean to become naturally mild and aromatic. Arabica is a fragile, oval-shaped bean that needs to be grown in cool and subtropical climates. Arabica beans contain about 60% more sugar content than Robusta, adding to their delicious taste.</p>
<p>Robusta plants can carry as much as three times the caffeine  of Arabica, and they are known to have a stronger and harsher taste when roasted. You won’t find Robusta coffee in many blends today as it only comprises 25% of the market, which is mainly restricted to instant black coffees and Italian espresso blends.</p>
<p>Both beans have a range of grades suitable for coffee drinking, but there is a substantial price difference with Arabica beans; they cost nearly double Robusta. This is partly due to the less labor intensive and higher yield harvest. If given a choice, nearly all experts agree that Arabica coffee is the way to go.</p>
<p>All beans we tested were Arabica beans and still fell under the “cheap” category.</p>
<h3>Roast type</h3>

<p>Did you know that lighter roasted coffee actually has more caffeine than darker roasts? The purpose of the coffee-roasting process surprised us. Before roasting, coffee beans are soft with little taste. The roast starts the process of adding flavor. Age, processing method, grind and brew type will also play a role.</p>
<p>Light roast beans and grounds are light brown in color with minimal oil on the surface of the beans. This retains most of the caffeine and tends to be more acidic. Lightly roasted beans reach an internal temperature of 356°F &#8211; 401°F, where they crack just a little and expand in size.</p>
<p>Medium-roasted coffees will show no oil on the surface and have a balanced flavor, aroma and acidity, again with more caffeine than dark roasts. They are roasted to an internal temperature of 410°F &#8211; 428°F, allowing the beans to expand but not past a second crack.</p>
<p>Dark roasts are easily identified with their rich dark brown or black color. Dark-roast beans will have noticeable oil on the surface and taste more bitter, smoky or even burnt. As a coffee roast gets darker, it loses the origin flavors and takes on the flavor mainly from the roasting process. These beans are largest of the three, reaching an internal temperature of 464°F &#8211; 482°F, just past the 2nd crack.</p>

<h3>Ground vs. whole beans and freshness</h3>
<p>Once purchased, the most important factor for brewing your own coffee is the freshness. It’s not a question of whether your coffee will go bad, but when. When making your first cup of coffee in the morning most people would agree that making it quickly and easily is the key, which is the biggest benefit for ground coffee, but you may be sacrificing freshness and taste for convenience.</p>
<p>We love opening up a bag of ground coffee, enjoying the aroma, then easily scooping it into the coffee maker to brew. But, if you have a little bit more time in the morning and a coffee grinder, you will benefit from a bolder-flavored coffee by grinding your own coffee beans.</p>
<p>Coffee beans hold their taste in the bean oils, and once beans are ground, the oils will evaporate and the taste can go flat. The vacuum seal on ground coffee only holds the oil until opened. So as the grounds of coffee go down in the bag, so will the taste. Be sure to reseal the bag after each use.</p>
<p>The question remains, once a bag is open, how long does it last? There are a few factors to consider. The first usually depends on the roast date, the closer to the roast date the fresher your coffee is going to to taste. Next is the coffee bean type, ground coffee doesn’t maintain its fresh taste very long. Seattle Coffee Gear says that ground coffee sealed in a cool, dark place will stay fresh for about two weeks, while properly stored whole coffee beans will stay at best quality for about four weeks after opening at room temperature. Oxygen is your biggest enemy here.</p>
<p>All experts agree that no matter the bean type, ground or whole, they recommend storing your coffee in an airtight container in a cool and dark place. If storing unopened coffee in the pantry, you can expect ground coffee to last up to five months and whole bean coffee to last for up to six months.</p>

<p>In search of the best beans overall, which can take into account many factors, we also wanted to see which were the best tasting coffee beans as well.</p>
<p>To ensure that no tester had a biased view of any cup they drank, for each test we opened a fresh bag of coffee and prepared in a separate room. Each pot of coffee was prepared based on the coffee instructions and brewed a full pot before anyone was able to have a taste. Each drinker was asked to rate the following categories on a scale of 1-10:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coffee aroma</li>
<li>Coffee taste (Drinkers were asked to taste it black before adding any cream and sugar to their cup. We asked those who mixed the coffee for further feedback on how the coffee tasted with the mix-ins.)</li>
<li>Coffee finish or aftertaste</li>
<li>Overall quality</li>
</ul>
<p>We also asked tasters to guess the brew type (light, medium or dark) and include any flavor notes before anonymously leaving their feedback to later analyze. We have a very diverse group of coffee drinkers, but most tend to drink stronger and bolder coffee. When analyzing the results, we found that the taste testers overwhelmingly liked the stronger tasting light and medium roasts, which matched their pre-testing preferences.</p>
<h2 id="best-brand">Best tasting: Verena Street</h2>

<p>Freshly roasted and prepared in small batches, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X8NSHGU/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Verena Street &#8211; Mississippi Grogg</a> out-brewed all the other options with a warm and inviting taste our staff would love to wake up to. We found that this brew was rich and robust without being overpowering or tasting cheap.</p>
<p>Our trusty testers rated this coffee a 7.55 out of 10 on our overall testing scale. In the aroma category the coffee scored a 7.60 and received the most 10’s out of any coffee we tested. Those who like strong black coffee rated the aroma low with the thought it was going to be “fruity” or “weak,” but were pleasantly surprised with the taste. The coffee finish rated highly as well at 7.80 out of 10. Tasters specifically noted the caramel finish. Most guessed incorrectly that this was a Medium coffee roast.</p>

<p>Canadian favorite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YVRX5W/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tim Hortons</a> whole-bean light roast has taken the top honors for coffee brands we know and love. Our testers knew right away that this was something they “grew up with” and left additional comments including “traditional,” “classic” and “homey.” In addition, testers guessed accurately that this was a medium brew.</p>

<p>Predating the conscious-consumer movement, Tim Hortons hosted its own Coffee Partnership to help the communities where they buy their beans in Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala and Honduras. A pillar of their community outreach program is the Junior Achievement program, aimed at helping middle school kids with education.</p>
<p>Back to the coffee taste, Tim Hortons roasts their beans in small batches and claims that only three people know their secret recipe. Our testers rated the coffee finish highest in the taste test, noting that it was just a good cup of coffee. Even better, this fail-safe coffee will only put you back $.69 per ounce.</p>

<p><strong>The best light roast and whole bean coffee was our top pick, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X8NSHGU/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Verena Street &#8211; Mississippi Grogg</a>.</strong> The office chatter surrounding this taste test made it a staple on the office shopping list and is now in the rotation of coffee blends brewed. Receiving the most eight, nine and tens across the scoring board, people loved the natural hazelnut flavor found in the roast.</p>
<p><strong>The best medium roast coffee we tested was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006G7WCTI/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Marley Coffee</a>, which came in third overall in our test.</strong> Marley is an organic, ethically-farmed and 100% Ethiopian blend with herbal tastes including fruity wine undertones. Our testers loved the taste and finish of this coffee and guessed it was either a light or medium blend. One tester loved the “watermelon or green tea” undertones and most mentioned the unique taste that was a welcome change in the morning. Marley Coffee ranked as the most expensive coffee we tested at $.87 per ounce. Money well spent according to our testers.</p>

<p><strong>The best dark roast was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PV4FG3Q/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koffee Kult</a> dark roast</strong>. This 100% arabica coffee blend, sourced from Colombia, Guatemala and Sumatra offers a full body and rich option for your coffee palate. Our testers knew that this was a dark coffee roast by its strong aroma, but were pleasantly surprised by the wood-fired taste. Most testers did call out the bitterness of this coffee, but pointed out that it didn&#8217;t linger and the acidity was enjoyable. Again, this winner is one of the most expensive coffees we tested at $.88 per ounce, but if you love the bold coffee taste, this is for you.</p>

<p><strong>The best ground coffee was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004DP6LQA/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">New England</a> medium roast.</strong> This coffee tricked our bold coffee lovers into thinking it would be a weaker or lighter coffee, but it won everyone over with the taste and overall quality. Our tasters noted the sweet smell and smooth taste of the New England Coffee&#8217;s medium roast. An added benefit of New England’s medium roast is the price, costing a very cool $.45 per ounce, this will please both your taste buds, and your wallet.</p>

<p><strong>Coming in 5th on the list overall and 2nd on the known brands list, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JI498GG/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dunkin&#8217; Donuts</a> medium roast scored major points as a great coffee choice.</strong> Testers were all over the place wondering what kind of roast this was due to its strong aroma and bold taste. Our office testers who enjoy a bold cup of coffee ranked this very highly in taste and finish, but others listed it as harsh and acidic. One tester noted that they enjoyed the coffee more when they let it cool down and added ice to it. We loved that idea! Another wallet friendly choice, Dunkin&#8217; Donuts coffee will only cost you $.44 per ounce.</p>

<p>We couldn’t have a cheap coffee article without mentioning <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZZLTR2N/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">McCafe</a> coffee! Rounding the top three, McCafe medium roast scored well among known coffee brands, but ranked seventh in our overall tasting list. Home-brewing this cup of coffee will only set you back $.50 per ounce, very reasonable and below average in cost. Our testers were split if this was either a medium or dark coffee, but either way it ranked well on quality. Our tasters also liked the balanced nature of this brew and included comments such as “bitter, but smooth” and “acidic, but fruity.”</p>
<p>There were two surprises at the bottom of our list, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004LL5O46/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Starbucks</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I8GC9E8/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Maxwell,</a> which ranked lowest for brands you know, as well as our overall list. These two coffee giants both received bad scores in taste and finish categories. Comments included “overly acidic,” “slightly burnt” and “basic.” Both costs were below average per ounce. Maxwell was the least expensive coffee that we tested at $.23 and Starbucks ranked in the middle at $.55.</p>
<p>When looking at the list as a top 20 choice we noticed that the popular brands ranked surprisingly low overall. Only three in the top 10 were brands that most people have heard of. Perhaps online shopping is providing availability to more brands that can be tailored to your taste buds.</p>

<p>Our unknown brands overwhelmingly ranked high in all of the categories we tested. Our runner up for best overall coffee and unknown brands was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FTE4NEU/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cameron&#8217;s whole bean</a> light roast. Cameron’s offers drinkers another option in the sustainable and small batch category, but comes in as one of the most expensive options at $.71 per ounce. Tasters commented over and over that this was a smooth coffee and that taste wasn’t overpowering. The finish of the coffee ranked higher than any other we tested.</p>
<p>Rounding out the top ten on our overall list, and the top five in our unknown brands list, both <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0189JVAD4/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Subtle Earth</a> whole bean light roast and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006CQ1ZHI/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Death Wish</a> whole bean dark roast have notable features to be considered for your new coffee of choice.</p>
<p>Subtle Earth whole bean light roast is one of the only coffees that made our list, boasting both certified organic and GMO free ingredients. You can tell the care that is taken from farming to finish when looking at the story of Don Pablo’s Subtle Earth coffee. Our tasters picked out a number of fruity and herbal flavors, but what won everyone over was the sweet finish with no added flavor in the beans. Costing you only $.53 per ounce, this flavorful cup provides more than just a boost of caffeine, it can also boost your savings.</p>
<p>Being advertised as the “world&#8217;s strongest coffee,” <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006CQ1ZHI/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Death Wish</a> whole-bean dark roast coffee is not for the faint of heart. We should mention here that this might not be considered a “cheap coffee” as it costs a very bold $1.25 per ounce, but we chose to test it as has a very large online presence and thousands of five-star reviews.</p>

<p>Our coffee testers do love a strong and bold cup of coffee, so though we expected it to rank highly, Death Wish sat in the middle of the pack due to its low marks in aroma and taste. It did gain major points for its finish though, where tasters noted that it was smooth, but had some overpowering bitterness to it. If you need a large jolt of energy with intense flavor, look no further than Death Wish coffee.</p>
<p>Overwhelmingly, the lesser known brands ranked higher and received more detailed tasting notes. When searching the description of these brands, you will find more information on specific origin, details in roasting and care in the small batches. The attention to detail made from the farming to the roasting will set you back a few more dollars, but know that along with a more satisfying cup of coffee you are also doing your part to better the world.</p>

<p>Making a change from your beloved coffee brand might seem like a daunting task, but considering the vast amounts of tasty, wallet-friendly and environmentally savvy options, we recommend you add the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X8NSHGU/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Verena Street &#8211; Mississippi Grogg</a> to your morning routine.</p>
<p>Verena Street sells both whole-bean and ground coffee, decaf, espresso and three other roasting options that can please even the pickiest coffee drinker. We found this brand had a cost point that was right in the middle of all the brands we tested, making it a smart budgeting choice. Testers loved the sweet hazelnut aroma, the surprisingly bold flavor and the caramel finish that shot this coffee to first place in whole bean coffee, light roasted coffee and best overall taste.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter 50+ hours spent researching, testing and tasting coffee and even more hours spent analyzing concerns and comments from consumers, we determined that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YEYKK8U/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO &#8211; On Barista Brain</a> is the overall best drip coffee maker thanks to its modern design, refined construction and delicious brew. For connoisseurs who want drip coffee in its purest form, try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O9FO1HK/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bonavita &#8211; BV1900TS</a>. Without any bells and whistles, this brewer sticks to basics and produces a simple cup that a barista would be proud of. If you want one below the $100 threshold, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MVWGQX0/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; DCC-3200</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>The massive home-brewing industry includes several substantial subcategories like <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-single-cup-coffee-maker/">single-cup coffee makers</a>, percolators, <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-french-press/">French press coffee makers</a> and drip coffee makers. To narrow down the focus and ensure we were able to test thoroughly, we opted to specifically test the most popular drip coffee makers. We also wanted to take cost, ease of use and coffee amount into consideration.</p>
<p>Drip coffee makers are the most common household appliances for brewing coffee at home. Consisting of a reservoir, a heating element, a shower head, a container for grounds and a tube connecting the heating element to the reservoir, they have a relatively simple composition. This simplicity makes them easy to use, durable and capable of quenching the thirst for an entire office of coffee drinkers, or just one java lover at home.</p>
<p>We wanted to ensure that a variety of brands and styles were tested, so we took to consumer reports, reddit and consumer forums to see what other coffee drinkers were saying. On reddit, we came across the Bonavita and the Moccamaster, which were mentioned in nearly every thread on drip coffee makers.</p>
<p>We also read hundreds of Amazon consumer reviews. Afterwards, we scoured the rankings for twelve coffee makers that had the highest number of five-star reviews and cross-checked other sites.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://scaa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA)</a> was the next step in our elimination process. The SCAA has a list of well-regarded home brewing machines that they recommend. It should be noted that to be considered for their list, you must apply. The SCAA rigorously tests each applicant “on proper water temperature, brewing time and ability to brew within their Golden Cup recommendations.” There are only 12 home brewers currently certified by the SCAA.</p>
<p>We also consulted the extensive <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/coffee-makers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Reports</a> guide, as well as reviews from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Best Buy. We added a Hamilton Beach maker to our list after noting that Consumer Reports highlighted several different models. None of their other suggestions passed the Amazon consumer rating test; they all either had poor ratings or a small number of excellent reviews.</p>
<p>After narrowing down the list to six candidates, we decided to dive into the science behind the brewing process so we knew which elements to test. The science is simple. Fill the reservoir with the desired amount of water, measure the grounds, add them to the filter, and it is time to brew!</p>
<p>The heating element boils the water causing it to bubble and rise through the tube and into the shower. Here, it flows through the grounds and creates the coffee, which drips into the pot. This meant we needed to test water temperature during the brewing process and the amount of time each coffee maker takes from start to finish.</p>
<p>Both the basic construction and process behind drip coffee makers are what make them durable and easy to maintain. No one wants to solve a math equation first thing in the morning. They just want to pour some water, measure some grounds, press a button and enjoy.</p>
<p>Once we were versed in the best coffee makers on the market and knew exactly how they brewed coffee, we were ready to begin testing.</p>

<p><strong>Taste:</strong> Taste is obviously subjective, but you should take your preferences into consideration. Are you ok with a cup of joe from a fast-food joint or do you prefer going to a coffee shop? Can you distinguish between burnt, nutty or fruity coffee? Do you prefer bitter? All of this comes into play when choosing which coffee maker to purchase. The beans you select play a large role in determining the taste of the coffee, but don’t underestimate the machine. Some are constructed to brew for speed, others for temperature, and some are intended to brew to the SCAA Golden Standard.</p>
<p><strong>Carafe Size (or cup capacity):</strong> If you are brewing at home, you may not need a 14-cup carafe, but this could very well be a requirement for an office.</p>
<p><strong>Footprint:</strong> If you live in a studio or have a small kitchenette in your office, you may not be willing to dedicate a large amount of space to your coffee machine. So, you will want to consider space when purchasing.</p>
<p><strong>Height:</strong> If you plan to put your coffee maker on your kitchen countertop, be sure to measure the height available in your space. Many of the coffee makers we tested required additional space above them to allow room for pouring water into the reservoir.</p>
<p><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> A well-designed coffee maker will have a comfortable carafe handle, be easy to pour and easy to fill. It should also be fairly intuitive to use and simple to clean. There shouldn’t be any pools of water around the machine after pouring.</p>
<p><strong>Brew Time:</strong> Not everyone will mind if their coffee takes 20 minutes to brew, but some want it to be ready in minutes after they wake up. This is also an important factor if you want a machine that meets SCAA standards. They mandate that water should only be in contact with the coffee grounds for six to eight minutes. If it is taking longer, the flavor will be impacted which can result in a bitter cup of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> There is a huge range in cost for coffee makers. The cheapest machine we tested was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EI7DPPI/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach</a> coming in around $57.69. On the other end, the Moccamaster cost close to $300.95.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We used a combination of qualitative and quantitative tests to determine the best coffee maker. First, we noted practical concerns like temperature, brew time and cup capacity that came up frequently in product reviews. Then we also called on the team to provide insight into usability and taste.</p>
<p>We invited eight colleagues to use and taste the six coffee makers and provide feedback over the course of one day. The following day we asked eight different colleagues to participate in a blind taste test and took our own notes on usability. This called for several rounds of testing and resulted in a very hyper work environment. Our goal was to test the coffee makers against SCAA standards to see how they matched up.</p>
<p>We used a burr grinder and fresh coffee beans throughout all testing to ensure consistency in taste and grind sizes.</p>
<h3>Carafe Capacity</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-7031 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/carafe-capacity.jpg" alt="carafe size comparison" width="900" height="488" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/carafe-capacity.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/carafe-capacity-610x331.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/carafe-capacity-768x416.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/carafe-capacity-300x163.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/carafe-capacity-295x160.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/carafe-capacity-885x480.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/carafe-capacity-360x195.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/carafe-capacity-375x203.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/carafe-capacity-414x224.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/carafe-capacity-320x174.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>As we mentioned above, cup capacity is a big factor to consider when choosing a coffee machine. If you are only brewing for yourself, a 14-cup carafe may be overkill. In an office of 20, the Bonavita didn’t seem quite sufficient. The Cuisinart has the largest cup capacity of 14 cups. While it was slow to brew, it did maintain temperature, which we&#8217;ll delve further into later.</p>
<h3>Brew time</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/brew-time-animation.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The SCAA has set standards for brew time as well. They require that brew time last more than four minutes but no longer than eight. If the brew cycle continues for too long, the resulting coffee can be bitter, and if it’s too short it will not be strong enough to keep you caffeinated.</p>
<p>Brew time varied considerably. We noted that prime performance occurred between the eight- to ten-cup capacity. If more water than that had to be shuttled through the machine, the task simply could not be completed in time.</p>
<p>We performed this test with two iterations. The first time we used exactly eight cups (to match the capacity of our smallest machine), then in the second test we loaded each reservoir with the maximum capacity. In both iterations, only the Bonavita, Moccamaster and the OXO were able to brew a cup in the prime amount of time.</p>
<p>The Bunn was able to brew efficiently as well, but it has many shortcomings which are why we took it out of the running for this test.</p>
<h3>Temperature</h3>

<p>According to the SCAA and industry standard, a coffee machine should reach within five degrees of 200 °F for four to six minutes. We used the Javelin PRO digital thermometer to measure the water temperature when it began brewing and then measured again five minutes later. To ensure that we were getting the water temperature as it hit the coffee grounds, as the SCAA requires for certification, we inserted the Javelin right above the grounds where the shower head disposes the water.</p>
<p>The SCAA also has relatively strict requirements for temperatures in the carafe after brewing, which we also tested.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the three priciest models were the only coffee makers to come close to upholding this standard. The OXO was the only coffee maker to maintain the appropriate temperature for five minutes. The Bonavita and the Moccamaster both came close, passing the first test but losing heat in the second.</p>

<h3>Brewing methods</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7035" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brewing-method.jpg" alt="brewing method" width="900" height="507" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brewing-method.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brewing-method-610x344.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brewing-method-768x433.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brewing-method-300x169.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brewing-method-295x166.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brewing-method-885x499.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brewing-method-360x203.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brewing-method-375x211.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brewing-method-414x233.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brewing-method-320x180.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Now we get into the fun stuff. After watching these coffee makers in action for the above testing, we brewed a few pots in each machine for tasting. We opted to do both a blind and an open trial to get feedback on functionality as well as pure taste. The eight of us involved in the taste testing are coffee addicts who drink multiple cups a day, both home-brewed and from our favorite local coffee shops.</p>
<p><strong>Brew Methods</strong> &#8211; We did several rounds of taste testing over the course of a few days and brewed with two methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>We brewed according to the SCAA standards which call for approximately two tablespoons of coffee grounds per ¾ cup of water.</li>
<li>We followed the recommendations listed in each maker’s manual.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first round following SCAA guidelines had far more polarizing results. The scores ranged much more dramatically than when we followed each individual manual. The Moccamaster, the OXO and the Bonavita all required the same amount of grounds as the SCAA standard (which may be why they are all on their list of certified home brewers). As for the other three machines, the amount of coffee was cut in half.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that while the range of results was much higher in the test that made use of the SCAA scale, the order remained the same. The OXO came in first and the Bunn took last place.</p>
<p>Each maker also came with a recommended serving amount of coffee grinds per cup of water. The OXO and the Moccamaster both came with their own serving scoops which resulted in the highest ranking coffee according to our taste test.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, when we followed the instructions in the user manual, the Cuisinart coffee was even stronger. We expected the high-end machines to follow very closely to SCAA standards, which they did, but we didn’t expect the less-specialized makers to recommend the same high amount of coffee. Again, the results followed in the same order with the OXO taking first and the Bunn coming in last.</p>

<p>During both tests, we asked all participants to rank each coffee on a scale from one to ten on smell, taste, strength and bitterness. We gave them a minute to enjoy each sample and offered water and plain biscuits in between cups to help neutralize their palettes. The floor was also open for any additional feedback.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YEYKK8U/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO</a> took first place overall. It scored third in bitterness in both tests, which we considered ideal as we prefer our coffee to be strong but not overly bitter. When the results were averaged, the OXO won in all versions of the test that we performed. It produced coffee with a pleasant aroma and a strength that will wake you up without the biting bitterness.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O9FO1HK/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bonavita</a> came in second place. It ranked highly for both taste and bitterness. If you do not like strong bitter coffee, this is not the machine for you.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002S4MUHM/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Moccamaster</a> narrowly scored third place, with similar scores that were just slightly lower than the Bonavita. The Moccamaster was notably less bitter than the Bonavita. It was also mentioned by several participants that coffee this machine produced was not particularly hot.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MVWGQX0/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart</a> scored well in strength and bitterness, balancing out the lower taste and smell results.

It scored the highest marks in taste, strength and smell.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YEYKK8U/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EI7DPPI/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach</a> is a budget buy that produces mediocre coffee that will keep your office going, but may not have them running back for more.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EAQJCWW/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bunn</a> coffee maker was not made for taste; it was made to be efficient. It scored poorly across the board. It lost in strength and bitterness and got the second worst results in taste.</p>
<h3>Cleaning &amp; general user experience</h3>
<p>While each machine brewed a drinkable cup of coffee, the user experience was not created equal. Many of these had slightly aggravating quirks that either resulted in a mess or a less than seamless initial brew.</p>
<p>The Bunn was not even part of an initial group test because it took so long to figure out how to get the machine started. All other coffee makers can be operated without really looking at the manual.</p>
<p>With The Bunn, you will need the instructions, YouTube tutorial and a time machine so you can just avoid the whole experience. You have to pour water in the reservoir, allow that to heat up and then brew as normal. This may not sound atrocious, but try emptying and cleaning it and get back to us. Aside from the Bunn, none of the coffee machines we tested had any flaws that would prevent us from buying again.</p>
<p>The Bonavita has a reservoir that is slightly difficult to fill, but you will only make this mistake once. It also has a brew basket that only attaches to the carafe, which means fewer pieces; however, you have nowhere to place the wet, leaking basket when you go to pour your coffee.</p>
<p>The Moccamaster has a durable yet lightweight build but also has a lot of loose plastic parts that could easily go missing. It has a cool sensor feature that prevents brewing unless the thermal carafe is placed properly, which helps to prevent spills.</p>
<p>Cuisinart has a lid design that users had trouble with because it had to be removed in order to fill the reservoir. Said reservoir also had a narrow opening that led to several spills.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach and the OXO didn’t have any notable complaints.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>When it came to price, there was a notable range of several hundred dollars between the most and least expensive models we tested. The Hamilton Beach, coming in at $57.69 at our last check, was the least expensive. On the other end of the price spectrum was the Moccamaster costing a whopping $307.95 which is over one hundred dollars more than the next most expensive coffee maker.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach is a cost-effective model that markets itself as two for the price of one because of the single-serve option. While we had several complaints with the single-serve option, this was a solid option for the price (albeit slow to brew).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YEYKK8U/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO &#8211; On Barista Brain 9-Cup Coffee Maker</a> won our top pick not only for its simplistic design and usability but also for the quality cup of coffee it produced. Each step of the brewing process from filling the reservoir to enjoying your cup was a breeze. In fact, it is so quiet and easy to use that our team asked if they were using it properly. You need only select your cup amount and wait until the reservoir is empty. Testers appreciated that this machine was simple and fine-tuned in every detail.</p>
<p>The only complaint heard from any of our participants was that you cannot see through the aluminum pot to know how much is left, which can lead to disappointment when the afternoon fatigue hits and there is no coffee left.</p>
<p>While it did have a brew time of 8:37 for a full pot, which is several minutes longer than both the Bonavita and Moccamaster (which came in at 6:15 and 6:12 respectively), there were far fewer flaws in this machine than in the other top contenders.</p>

<p>The OXO was the only coffee maker to abide by the SCAA rules and keep brewing temperatures within five degrees of 200 °F for five minutes. This resulted in a strong, slightly bitter and piping hot cup of coffee. The seasoned coffee drinkers in our office were delighted.</p>
<p>In terms of design, the OXO was a crowd favorite. It had the fewest amount of delicate attachments and a sturdy composition that can handle a high volume of use. It also looks incredibly sleek and modern. This is not an unsightly kitchen necessity; it is a welcome futuristic-looking addition.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O9FO1HK/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bonavita &#8211; BV1900TS</a> was selected as the second best coffee maker in our testing. We have to qualify this by saying that bitterness was ranked as a negative rather than a positive. If you prefer bitter coffee, the Moccamaster might be a better fit for you.</p>
<p>Overall, The Bonavita brewed a wonderful, balanced and nutty cup of coffee in just six minutes. It came within three degrees of maintaining the temperature recommended by the SCAA. This was likely due to the fact that it had practically finished brewing by the time five minutes had passed and we measured the temperature again.</p>
<p>This coffee machine looks like something you would see in a trendy coffee shop or on a designer kitchen’s counter. Without any bells and whistles, this maker is built with one purpose, delivering a consistent and reliable cup of coffee. Although the individual pieces won’t strike you as built to last, the pared-down design makes it seem like this coffee machine has a long life in it.</p>

<p>While the Bonavita did produce the best tasting cup of coffee, there are a few notable concerns that prevented it from being our top pick. Let’s start with filling the reservoir. This seems like a simple task, but if you like to fill the reservoir with your coffee pot, you are in for a mess. Without the lid, the coffee pot spills water everywhere and you will quickly find any nearby items covered in water. We opted to use an extra cup rather than the coffee pot itself.</p>
<p>Next we have the shower head and basket. The shower head is flimsy and mists over coffee grounds that lay in a filter basket. The basket is not attached to anything and becomes a nuisance after brewing. When you go to pour your first cup, you have to remove the filter basket and replace with the lid. While we did find this to be annoying, we adapted quickly and found that it pressured us to maintain a cleaner coffee maker (since you are forced to empty and clean the filter basket immediately after use).</p>
<p>Overall, this is a pricy option but it did brew amazing coffee and was easy to clean and maintain. It also takes up a very small amount of space and has a portable aluminum coffee pot you can bring to your workspace for easy refills.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Bonavita &#8211; BV1900TS&#8217;s design is aesthetically approved for most households with its petite, sleek shape.</li>
<li>The basket in which the grounds are placed are not fixed to the machine, occasionally leading to a scattering of coffee grounds.</li>
<li>This is a pricy option, but the coffee it brews is top-notch.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are looking for a quality coffee maker under $100, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MVWGQX0/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; DCC-3200</a> is a great choice. It came in third place in our taste test and cost only $74.99 when we checked last, which is $100+ less than our top pick and $200 less than our second choice. This is also a great option for an office because it brews a whopping 14 cups at a time, which is significantly more than the OXO’s nine-cup limit.</p>

<p>While brewing a batch of coffee, we really enjoyed the sturdiness of this machine. The handle was the most comfortable to hold and carry.  Although this coffee maker might not have the same sleek design as the high-end Bonavita or Moccamaster, it still looks relatively streamlines and is quiet and compact, especially considering how much coffee it can produce.</p>
<p>In the taste test, several participants noted how great the temperature of this coffee was. If you prefer a piping hot cup of joe, give the Cuisinart a shot.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, this was one of the only machines that actually notified you with a beep when the brewing process was complete. We thought this was a nice touch on a well-thought-out product.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Cuisinart &#8211; DCC-3200 is a steal that also brews a whopping 14 cups at a time.</li>
<li>This machine brewed the hottest cup of joe and even notifies you when coffee is brewed.</li>

<h3>Technivorm &#8211; Moccamaster KBT</h3>
<p>There was a notable divide in the six coffee machines we tested. Three were built to appease coffee connoisseurs and the other three were built for those who just want a cup of morning joe. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002S4MUHM/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Technivorm &#8211; Moccamaster</a> definitely belongs in the former category. This difference was not only evident in cost, but design and taste.</p>
<p>Costing $307 at our last check, this maker has the price tag and delicate design that elevates it from the everyday brand. We really enjoyed using this coffee machine and drinking the coffee it produced. It narrowly missed being named our runner-up because of the bitterness of the coffee it brewed.</p>
<h3>The Hamilton Beach &#8211; 49980A</h3>
<p>Not only is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EI7DPPI/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach</a> the cheapest coffee maker on our list, but it also offers a single-serve option. The Hamilton Beach came in last place in our taste tests and scored low for the poor strength of the coffee. This coffee maker was not made for satisfying a refined palette; it was made for practicality.</p>
<h3>The Bunn &#8211; NHS Velocity Brew</h3>
<p>None of the other coffee makers had any notable flaws that would prevent us from recommending a purchase other than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EAQJCWW/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bunn &#8211; NHS Velocity Brew</a>. Using the Bunn is the opposite of straightforward.</p>
<p>When you start your day, a complicated coffee maker is the last thing you want to deal with. The instruction manual was practically useless. We had to watch several YouTube tutorials to even get the brewing started.</p>
<p>When first setting up the Bunn coffee maker, we had to fill multiple pots of water into the maker. It&#8217;s easy to overfill without warning, which results in water spilling from the bottom. After making a huge mess, we hesitantly hit the start button.</p>
<p>Both filling and emptying the water reservoir is an ordeal. To empty it, you have to pick it up, carry it to the sink and hold the entire machine upside down. This led to our assumption that most Bunn users probably don’t clean their coffee maker often.</p>
<p>The Bunn can brew a cup in three-and-a-half minutes because it is always on and always heating the water that is permanently left in the reservoir.</p>
<p>Although the Bunn is recommended by the SCAA, during our testing we found that it failed to reach proper temperature when brewing the coffee or hold at the proper temperature. SCAA rule states that the brew basket much reach, but never exceed 197.6-204.8 °F, we found the Bunn only reached 196 °F. Another rule requires the carafe to hold an entire pot of coffee between 176-185 °F for 30 minutes, but at the end of 30 minutes, the Bunn had dropped to a temperature of 168 °F.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>All of these coffee machines produce drinkable coffee, but in our opinion, a coffee maker should be more than that. If you are a caffeine addict like us, you rely on this machine to get you through the day. Investing slightly more for a cup of coffee that makes you eager to get out of bed in the morning is a game changer.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YEYKK8U/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO</a> not only had us racing to get that first sip in the morning, but it also revamped our countertop. The space is no longer covered in coffee grounds or puddles of coffee from a poorly designed machine. The coffee area is tidy, because every part of the OXO is doing exactly what it was designed to do and looking super cool while doing it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e&#8217;ve been using, cleaning and trying to destroy travel mugs over three years of testing. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a> is the best travel mug for maximum heat retention and easy clean-up.

<h2 id="how-we-selected" class="collapse">How we selected mugs to test</h2>
<p>Our testers have used travel mugs daily for many years and while engaged in activities ranging from truck driving to theatrical stage management, so they had some long-standing demands and expectations. We sorted through countless published professional and consumer reviews and dove into enthusiast discussion boards to find our finalists. We’ve especially kept an eye out for online buzz about flaws and weaknesses, which we’ve tested for and noted. Value is an important consideration for items like this, and we’ve included mugs that ranged in price from $16 to $30 at the time we ordered them.</p>
<p>After our old top pick from Camelbak was discontinued, we started looking for replacements. The Burnout promised to solve all our problems with heat-retention tradeoffs, so we added it to the list. We&#8217;re watching for a new auto-seal design that&#8217;s as easy to clean as the Camelbak, but we haven&#8217;t found it yet.</p>

<h2 id="features-to-look-for" class="collapse">Features to look for</h2>
<p>There are a handful of usability factors that make the difference between your go-to travel mug companion and a dud you’d rather just leave at home. We’ve found the most important factors to be the following:</p>
<p><strong>Leak and spill protection:</strong> You should be able to use a travel mug without fear of spills on your lap or in your backpack.</p>
<p><strong>Ease of opening:</strong> If you want to enjoy a hot beverage while driving, one-handed operation is as much a safety feature as a convenience.</p>
<p><strong>Mess avoidance:</strong> All spouts and lids will collect some liquid while you’re drinking (flip-open lids tend to be the worst in this regard), so in our usability table we’ve rated how safe they are around white silk shirts.</p>
<p><strong>Ease of cleaning:</strong> Nobody wants to use a mug they can’t get clean.</p>
<p><strong>Heat retention:</strong> Hot drinks like your coffee or tea should stay pleasantly hot.</p>
<p><strong>Cup holder/single-brewer compatible:</strong> For those looking for compatibility with a single-cup coffee brewer, we’ve noted which mugs are seven inches or shorter (typical height for a single-cup brewer when the drip tray is removed; your machine may vary), and whether a “shorty” model (usually in 12 oz capacity) is available.</p>
<p><strong>Durability:</strong> Drops happen. A winning travel mug can survive the accidental fall from the top of your car as you absentmindedly back down the driveway on a hectic Monday morning.</p>
<h3>Notes for tea and pour-over brewing</h3>
<p>If you want a built-in loose-leaf-infuser option: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZI5XNO/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VG761C/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stanley</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HYOGTTG/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zojirushi</a> all sell tea-steeping versions of the mugs we tested here (or snap-in accessories) that might help you out, but we’ve been happy with the convenience of drop-in or basket infusers.</p>
<p>Both loose-leaf tea drinkers and pour-over coffee geeks should note mouth-width before they buy: we found the necks of the Klean Kanteen, Thermos Direct Drink and Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 were too small to take any but the narrowest tea infusers; the Hario V60 pour-over coffee brewer just fits the mouth of the Thermos.</p>
<h3>Why are they all stainless steel?</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5461" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors.jpg" alt="stainless steel cup interiors" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Most heat from your mug (once you put a lid on it) is lost through conduction, and the material that conducts the least is nothing at all — hard vacuum. Keeping a vacuum inside the wall of a mug requires a material that’s stiff and strong: steel is stiff, strong, easy to work, and economical. Most of the steel mugs tested specify “18/8 grade” steel or SAE/AISI “304 Stainless”, which contains approximately 18% chromium and 8% nickel. 304 is one of the most widely used alloys in the world (for everything from cookware to the DeLorean to the Gateway Arch) because of its versatility and stain resistance, so there’s a good chance the mugs that don’t specify an alloy are using it or something very similar.</p>
<p>In a strong bath of citric acid, 304 will release slightly more chromium than other alloys do, but for beverage use 304 stainless is as inert as any other stainless alloy, and none of us tasted any unusual metallic flavors in these mugs (even after we left hot orange juice in our top picks for a few hours). If you’re sensitive to trace amounts of nickel or chrome and you drink extra-acidic tea or coffee, consider the Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 (which was nearly our favorite and is “non-stick” lined).</p>
<p>It’s probably worth noting here: all these manufacturers specify that they use BPA-free plastics.</p>
<h3>Non-steel mugs</h3>

<p>We included one non-steel mug in our lineup, the Ello &#8211; Mesa double-wall ceramic mug. We looked at other popular ‘reusable to-go cup’ designs, but none of them had spill-proof lids or insulating properties that would make them competitive in this line-up. (Some issues, like reports of a smelly latex rubber lid on one popular brand, or lids that were difficult to snap on, made our choice not to test even easier.)</p>
<p>The Mesa does keep your drink hot three times longer than a conventional open-top single-wall ceramic mug (an hour above 140°F instead of 15 minutes), but the sliding closure on the lid did not prevent spills.</p>
<p>While some manufacturers of the stainless steel mugs say you can put them in the dishwasher, the microwave is territory held securely by mugs like the Mesa: we microwaved water to a piping-hot 186°F and were happy to find that the outside of the mug was only a pleasantly-warm 93°F, unlike some ceramic mugs that get insanely hot on the outside when nuked.</p>
<p>So, if you are simply looking for slightly better insulation in a ceramic tumbler that can go in the microwave and the dishwasher, the Mesa is worth considering; if you want to stop spills and keep your drink hot for a long commute, read on.</p>

<p>Well on our way to developing permanent caffeine dependence after our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-french-press/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">French Press</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-single-cup-coffee-maker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Single-Cup Coffee Maker</a> reviews, we indulged another caffeine binge as we filled, drained, cleaned and tried to break 13 travel mugs for multiple weeks.</p>
<h3>Leak test</h3>

<p>The ability to put a travel mug in your bag without fear of making book-and-computer soup separates the best of the travel mugs from the rest. It’s easy to say “this lid locks in the closed position so it won’t leak!” but some locks are easy to defeat accidentally (Contigo West Loop, we’re looking at you). To say without equivocation that the best mugs won’t leak, we put all the mugs in a duffle bag that spent half an hour inside an industrial dryer.</p>
<p>The mugs were filled, dried carefully, weighed, wrapped in a towel and sealed in an individual bag. Then the seals on each mug were double-checked by shaking (all passed) and dropping them before we put them in the dryer. We started the spin-cycle, checked once at ten minutes, then again at the 30-minute mark. All leaks were clearly visible, and we weighed the mugs again after taking them out of their bags to see how much water had leaked out.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HYOGTTG/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48</a>, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a>, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H4LUMUA/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klean Kanteen</a> leaked nothing in the half-hour they were tossed around inside the dryer. The Forge, without any lock or back-up mechanism to keep the seal from opening, only let out a single drop that we could see on its towel-wrap at the ten minute mark, and we didn’t see any more evidence of leaks at the end (nor could we measure the amount of water that had escaped.)</p>
<h3>Spill test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5464" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test.jpg" alt="ceramic Ello in a spill test" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Another important duty of a travel mug is stopping spills. Some of our testers have worked in locations where only spill-proof mugs are allowed, and far too many of us have experienced the tragic consequences of using unworthy mugs in moving vehicles or at desks covered with important documents.</p>
<p>We simulated a desk-spill by filling each mug halfway with a measured amount of water, then tipping it on its side (spout down). After 15 seconds, we picked up the mug and re-checked the amount of water to determine how much water spilled. We wanted to be sure we were simulating a real-world spill: a lid or seal you can manually close might be great for throwing in a bag, but the spills that matter are the ones that happen while the lid/lock isn’t closed. (Note: we tested the Ello &#8211; Mesa both opened and closed. It spilled so much while it was supposed to be “sealed” we included that number on the chart.)</p>
<p>The self-sealing mugs practically cheat on the spill test, and that’s why we like them. Of the mugs that spilled nothing when knocked over, also note that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EPGMZZS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Forge</a> has a lid design which prevents it from rolling off your desk.</p>
<h3>Clean-up test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5506 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results.png" alt="cleaning test results chart" width="900" height="942" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results.png 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-610x638.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-768x804.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-287x300.png 287w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-295x309.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-885x926.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-360x377.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-375x393.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-414x433.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-320x335.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Keeping a mug clean is one of those tasks that makes the difference between “buy it for life” and trashing an expensive mug in disgust. Our rating here is based on hand-washing with a sponge, scrubber or bottle-brush, but we’ve also noted if the manufacturer says you can put the whole mug in the dishwasher.</p>
<p>We tested how easy it is to effectively field-clean the mugs with a method similar to systems used by metallurgists looking for cracks in airframes: a (non-toxic, water-based) fluorescent paint was poured into the mugs and then out through the drinking spout. Next, the mugs were filled with soapy water, agitated, drained through the spout, and rinsed in the same way.</p>
<p>While the paint came out in our simple rinse procedure without any obvious dribbles or droplets remaining in most cases (there was a tiny drop left inside the Klean Kanteen’s three-piece seal), we did spot some residue left behind on all the mugs under a UV inspection light.</p>

<p>The Contigo Autoseal system is great for convenient spill-free sipping, but its springs and levers are immersed in your pumpkin-spice foam and nutmeg sprinkles.</p>
<p>The hinged-lid Thermos and Zojirushi mugs are pretty easy to clean, with the Thermos Direct Drink taking an edge here because of a vent design that&#8217;s a hole rather than a tube.</p>
<p><strong>Some notes on dishwasher compatibility</strong></p>
<p>All of the lids for these mugs (with the exception, inexplicably, of the OXO Good Grips) are guaranteed safe for top-rack dishwasher cleaning. Some also guarantee that the body of the mug will be okay on the top rack, but only if it’s an unpainted stainless steel body — a mark against the Auto-Seal Transit’s silicone grip design. Stanley and Bubba are both willing to back up their mugs in dishwasher use despite paint and plastic accessories; the hammertone paint looks OK, but the plastic rings on the Bubba seem destined to trap dishwater over time.</p>
<p>While we wouldn&#8217;t recommend daily dishwashing of these mugs (the extreme heat expands and contracts the steel along the seams that keep the vacuum in, which is why many manufacturers say it voids their warranty). If you want to be able to throw it in the top rack every once in awhile for a deep-cleaning, though, it&#8217;s encouraging to know that a company has your back even if the vacuum fails after ten or twenty years.</p>
<h3>Heat retention test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5465" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners.jpg" alt="top four heat test winners" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-300x200.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We ran two tests to measure how well these mugs retain heat. The first test gives a broad overview of mug performance when starting with water at typical restaurant serving temperature; the second test shows how our favorite mugs performed when starting with a lower temperature.</p>
<p><strong>High-temperature heat retention</strong></p>
<p>In the first test we poured very hot water (it was a lot of pouring, so starting temperature varied, but we’ve normalized the differences to show loss from a 185°F starting temperature) into all the mugs and checked the temperature after an hour. Results are in the main table above.</p>
<p>We found that all of the mugs, even the air-insulated Ello &#8211; Mesa, will keep your Starbucks coffee hot enough to be ‘drinkable’ after sitting around for an hour. Not only that, <strong>two of the mugs we tested kept beverages hot enough to burn you</strong>. We want to point out that this kind of test obscures some basic usability complaints that are frequently made in comments about award-winning mugs: they keep boiling-hot coffee so hot that you may need to take extra steps in order to drink it. Some mug-owners on Reddit suggest ice cubes — no, that’s not a joke, <em>ice cubes</em> — to get your fresh cup of hot coffee or tea down to a drinkable temperature.</p>

<p>The Redditors were absolutely right: when we made tea with freshly-boiled water in either of the top two insulation performers (the Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 or the Thermos Direct Drink Insulated Bottle) we found that it won’t be cool enough for most people to drink (below 155°F) until an hour later, even if you leave the lid off completely.</p>
<p>Mugs like these are great if you want to keep drinks hotter for longer. Just be sure you cool your coffee or tea before adding to the mug, or pour out your beverage to drink until temperatures inside the mug have reached a safe level.</p>
<p>Studies show that the severity of burns start getting significantly worse at temperatures above 175°F, so temperature curves between 200°F and 175°F aren’t showing anything but a danger zone. A study published in the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2002.tb08814.x/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Journal of Food Science</em></a> shows that most people will mix cream/milk (or colder coffee) into their hot coffee to bring it down to around 140°F if they’re going to drink it immediately. Further, the Specialty Coffee Association of America cupping and tasting protocols recommend that evaluation of flavor should not begin until coffee has cooled to between 160 &#8211; 140°F.</p>
<p><strong>Commuter ‘sip’ test</strong></p>

<p>With that in mind, our second test used water heated to only 167°F. We filled five mugs: three top-ranked in our first heat test, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EPGMZZS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CamelBak &#8211; Forge</a>, and a heavy, 18 oz-capacity open-top ceramic mug as a control.</p>
<p>After 30 minutes, 50ml of water was decanted from each mug into a 100 ml pyrex beaker every 15 minutes. With a bench thermometer and K-type probe, we took eight samples from each mug, leaving a slightly larger sample at the end. This controls for the way most of us drink away the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water#Heat_capacity_and_heats_of_vaporization_and_fusion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specific heat capacity</a> of the water in our travel mugs if we sip periodically over the course of a commute or while working at a desk.</p>
<p>The best and worst performance in this test still correspond roughly to what we saw the first test we ran, but it does show that even in this less-generous scenario the Forge can keep coffee in the “comfortably hot” zone all the way up to two hours, though it’s 15°F cooler than the Thermos. That’s longer than any of us likes to keep the same mug of coffee around, so we’re more than satisfied. (Any insulated mug is also far, far better than a ceramic open-top mug, which lost the same amount of heat in less than 20 minutes.)</p>

<p>Other than falling off a desk, the most likely accident a mug will endure is falling off the roof of a car or truck. We subjected the mugs to a battery of drop tests to give a real-world worst-case assessment of what will happen when you forget which pocket your keys are in and set your mug on the car’s roof “just for a second.”</p>
<p>We included a drop onto a padded surface in our leak test earlier, and all of the mugs escaped that without damage (most didn&#8217;t even leak).</p>

<p>In the first part of our (more destructive) drop test, nearly all the mugs also survived falling from desk height onto concrete with only some road rash. The exception is the the Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48, which cracked badly enough that the lock is only barely holding together.</p>
<p>We carried on dropping the mugs from higher and still higher heights, eliminating mugs that were too broken to be usable. The eight-foot drop cracked five of the remaining eleven mugs. After the ten-foot drop, one more (the Thermos Direct Drink) was eliminated. We’ve separated those mugs still working into “indestructibles” which look the same as they did after the first drop, and “juggernauts” which still do their jobs perfectly, but bear cracks or other deformation beyond scuffs or scrapes. The Forge, for example, shows obvious signs of fracture on one arm of the carabiner loop — it doesn’t flex or bend, though, and the seal mechanism functions as before.</p>

<p>Two of the mugs we tested kept heat inside so well, they actually made it difficult to test what we considered “normal” use because we had to dump extra cold half-and-half or ice cubes in so that we could drink from them without suffering burns. Make no mistake, this almost-magical feat is surely appreciated by those who want to drink a hot cup of home-brewed coffee eight hours after they pour it.</p>
<p>We’ve picked the The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a> (sometimes called Direct Drink) bottle as our favourite for that kind of use, since it was slightly easier for us to clean and it didn’t rattle around in our cupholders as much as the skinny Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 did. Bloomberg called this &#8220;the best mug for heat freaks” and we concur with that assessment: this mug stayed 15°F hotter than lesser mugs even when we were pouring the heat away in our 165-minute “sipping test.”</p>

<p>The Thermos performed flawlessly in our leak test, sealing its lid tight and locking with a back-up mechanism. It doesn’t seal itself every time you set it down, the way our top pick does, so you have to either close the top every time you sip or invite spills — but if you do knock it over with the lid open, it won’t spill as much as most of the other mugs we tested.</p>
<p>The Thermos &#8211; Sipp started developing a crack in the eight-foot fall. While that’s not nearly as durable as the CamelBak &#8211; Forge, the Thermos is much tougher than the other best-insulating mug, the Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 (which probably won’t close anymore if you drop it onto concrete). The Thermos is also entirely dishwasher-safe and easy to hand-wash, and has a handy loop on the back of the lid that makes it easy to carry around.</p>
<p>Note: This is one of the more confusingly-named products we researched — it’s sometimes called things like “Sipp Stainless Insulated Drink Bottle” and is nearly identical to the “Commuter Bottle.” Whatever the name, we liked it.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>

Contigo is now one of the most prolific brands in the travel mug market, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160LEYFY/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Auto-Seal Transit</a> is the best model in their line.</p>
<p>Auto-sealing mugs like the transit are perfect for use at your desk, around fussy librarians or while driving. It&#8217;s basically impossible to spill anything from this mug while you&#8217;re drinking from it, and the spout prevents drips from gathering the way they will in flip-top designs.</p>
<p>Contigo mugs represent what really has become the baseline for travel mug functionality: To beat Contigo at their own game, a mug must be easy to drink from with one hand while still preventing spills, must be easier to clean, stay hot for longer, and take more abuse. The now-discontinued Camelbak &#8211; Forge was the only model that was better overall (still losing in heat retention), while the Thermos &#8211; Sipp has much better heat retention but doesn&#8217;t stop spills.</p>
<p>The Transit survived our ten-foot drop test with only a superficial crack in the easily-removed spout-cover. That cover is an interesting perk; a quick turn covers up the drinking spout to keep dirt out. It&#8217;s a nice perk that doesn&#8217;t get in the way when you don&#8217;t need it.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160LEYFY/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Safe Sipping: Contigo - Transit</h3><p>A great mug from a trusted brand that's highly durable and spill resistant. A great choice if you don't mind sacrificing heat performance and if you're OK with hand-washing.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160LEYFY/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Auto-Seal mechanism is unmatched at stopping knock-down spills, but the Transit gave up a teaspoon worth of liquid in our 30-minute tumble test. That&#8217;s a good result, but not as good as the bank-vault seal on the Thermos &#8211; Sipp. If you want to stash a mug in your bag this is not a bad pick, but we wouldn&#8217;t take it on an all-day trip with a full load of coffee inside a backpack.</p>
<p>In our temperature test, the Transit only lost 34°F of heat in the first hour, while the base-model Contigo &#8211; West Loop lost 40, so the minimal price difference is far less significant than the performance gap. That&#8217;s still a major difference from the Thermos and Zojirushi mugs, which lost less than half as much heat in the same time. The Transit&#8217;s result is in line with other good wide-mouth mugs that you can fit a sponge into, but it&#8217;s not amazing.</p>
<p>One failing of Contigo&#8217;s design is the seal mechanism: it&#8217;s a pain to clean. If you have a dishwasher or only drink clear tea, you&#8217;ll probably never have a problem with this, but you&#8217;ll still want to double-check that nothing gets stuck in the springs and levers inside this lid. The Transit&#8217;s lid is the only part you should put in the dishwasher, but the body isn&#8217;t difficult to hand wash.</p>
<p>On the whole, this is a great mug with a long heritage of good design. The price is right at about $15, and if you ever need to drink your coffee in a place where spills would be a disaster this is an excellent choice.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Contigo &#8211; Auto-Seal Transit is easy to use for one-hand-sipping without leaving you vulnerable to spills.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re looking for an affordable mug that won&#8217;t break quickly, the Transit is very good on both counts.</li>
<li>Clean-up is the only weakness in this design: The springs that seal the spout are immersed in your drink, and can&#8217;t be removed for washing.</li>
<li>For secure carry in a bag the Transit was better than most, but it did leak a teaspoon worth after half an hour in a spin-cycle.</li>

<p>From a startup company founded by rocket scientists, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DJS1LHN/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Burnout termperature regulating travel mug</a> is one of the few new products that&#8217;s trying something different. We bought this mug for our 2019 update.</p>
<p>Burnout pulls the heat out of your drink in the first minute after you pour. This neat trick is accomplished with a layer of wax that&#8217;s inside the mug&#8217;s stainless steel walls. Once the wax melts, it&#8217;ll help keep all of that heat inside the vacuum-insulated chamber, even as you drink your favorite hot beverage away.</p>
<div id="visualizer-19338-1670736649" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-19338"></div>
<p>The problem with the heat-sucking material inside the Burnout is that it&#8217;s too good at its job.  If the mug starts at around room temperature, hot coffee (at just below an ideal brewing temperature of 190-200°F) will cool to 140 in fifteen minutes. If you like warm coffee instead of hot coffee, that&#8217;s probably ideal.</p>
<p>You can get a bump in heat if you take the time to boil some extra water and dump that in the Burnout for a few minutes before you add your beverage. (Pre-heating with 110°F tap water does basically nothing.)  Boiling extra water isn&#8217;t such an inconvenience for pour-over, french press and tea drinkers, but it&#8217;s a big hassle if you&#8217;re relying on a coffeemaker like <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-keurig/">our favorite Keurig</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, pre-heating with boiling water also cancels out the safety goal of this mug, since the temperature is still at a scalding 172 after thirty minutes and takes two hours to hit our preferred 155. Yes, you can pre-heat for a shorter time and add milk to fine-tune the temperature, but you can do the same with our top heat-retention pick, the Thermos &#8211; Sipp, by adding an ice cube when you pour your coffee.</p>
<p>Even if a hot-ish 135°F sound perfect to you, the biggest problem with the Burnout is the lid. This design uses an internal stopper that seals a sippy-cup spout (very much like the Contigo Autoseal designs) but with a sliding, locking toggle switch instead of a push-to-drink system. This means you don&#8217;t get automatic sealing when you stop drinking, but it&#8217;s still difficult to clean out all of the springs and levers on the inside. It can also spit out drips when you close it.</p>
<p>Worse still, even when the stopper is in the closed position, it leaks. It&#8217;ll keep dribbles from coming out if you turn it upside down, but as soon as you drop it on the floor or shake it around it&#8217;ll let drips out. The slider switch is fairly easy to use, but it&#8217;s also vulnerable to getting bumped open inside a bag; this mug did poorly in our tumble test.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s the price. If you&#8217;ve been waiting and waiting for a travel mug that would give four-hour warmth without burning your tongue, maybe $100 doesn&#8217;t sound like a lot. Compared to our other mugs, though, that&#8217;s a pretty crazy price.</p>
<p>We love the idea of this mug, but the concept just hasn&#8217;t been executed well enough to justify this price tag. If it were dishwasher safe and had a bomb-proof seal like the Thermos, maybe the price tag and fiddly work required to plan a perfect pre-heat routine would be worth it.</p>
<h3>Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 and YAE48</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5469 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles.jpg" alt="two Zojirushi travel mugs" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HYOGTTG/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48</a> has received so many accolades from reviewers, it’s hard to imagine a review that excludes it. This mug is the state of the art in vacuum insulation performance from a company with a long history of designing great food and drink containers. That said, the diminutive SA48 was so narrow and tall that it rattled around in our cupholders (and was hardest to clean inside, even with a bottle brush).</p>
<p>We also included the SA48’s sibling, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01077GFV8/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YAE48</a>, which is specifically marketed as a “Travel Mug” and seems designed to address concerns about cup holder size and the height restriction imposed by single-cup coffee machines. The wide mouth means that the YAE48 is easier to get a kitchen sponge into when cleaning, but it sacrifices insulation and leak-proof performance with that giant lid (which actually unscrewed from the body during our spin-cycle bag-leak test).</p>
<p>Neither mug is especially durable; the SA48’s lid shattered on a desk-height drop and the YAE48 wouldn’t stay closed after an eight-foot drop split it across the lock. The warranty on these mugs is also limited to insulation performance for five years, which is disappointing when the lids and locks have this many intricate parts.</p>
<h3>Contigo &#8211; Auto-Seal West Loop</h3>
<p>This is the third version of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZI5XNO/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Auto-Seal West Loop</a> design, now easier to clean than old models, and with a lock button. Sadly, the lock doesn&#8217;t prevent leaks and it&#8217;s still immersing springs in your drink.</p>
<p>The West Loop is a good mug, but the Transit is more durable and holds heat better. The only trade-off is that the Transit sacrifices dishwasher compatibility because of the silicone grip. The West Loop&#8217;s insulation is guaranteed to be safe in the dishwasher, but if you buy a painted model you can count on flaking and peeling of the finish after a few months cleaning it that way.</p>
<h3>Klean Kanteen &#8211; 16 oz. Wide-Mouth</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5470 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo.jpg" alt="Klean Kanteen mug on a white counter" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We included the winner from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/">insulated water bottle review</a>, the Klean Kanteen, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H4LUMUA/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">but in a 16 oz. size</a> to match the other mugs and with the manufacturer’s leak-proof “café cap.” (We did not include the Hydro Flask in our line-up; in our water-bottle test the 32 oz Hydro Flask didn’t insulate as well as a 20 oz Klean Kanteen, and while the flip-cap lid on the Hydro Flask is easier to use with one hand, it has all of the problems of the other drip-flip lids we tested).</p>
<p>The Klean Kanteen is still a drink container we like, but it’s not easy to open and close with one hand (and in fact took a fair bit of effort to open with two hands), and it has more parts to disassemble for cleaning than any of the other mugs.</p>
<h3>Thermos &#8211; Stainless King Travel Mug</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5471 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug.jpg" alt="solo of Thermos King stainless mug" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Thermos is the oldest and best-known name in insulated drink containers in the western world (“thermos” became such a prevalent word that US courts ruled it was legal to use as a generic term for insulated bottles in 1963). We tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DZQT0E2/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Stainless King Travel Mug</a> along with our runner-up, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a>.</p>
<p>The King is available with a handle, which may appeal to those who keep a mug in the cold and pick it up with bare hands, but we found that a trigger-action mug like our top pick was even better since we could carry it and take drinks from it even with gloves on. The twist-action closure on the Stainless King wasn’t really designed to open and close with one hand, and requires disassembly if you want to put it in the dishwasher.</p>
<h3>Stanley &#8211; Classic</h3>
<p>We’ve included this self-sealing mug, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VG761C/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stanley &#8211; Classic</a>, which only comes in their retro-lunchbox-style “hammertone” finish, as the only painted mug guaranteed dishwasher safe; the paint does seem thick and durable, and we haven&#8217;t seen reports of it chipping or peeling the way the Contigo paint does. The functionality is generally good, but it wasn’t even as leak-proof as the Contigo mugs were. The spring on the trigger-button of this mug was also much, much stronger than the other self-sealing designs, which was a big turn-off for some testers (and didn’t keep it from leaking at all). The design also had more parts to keep track of than the other self-sealing mechanisms.</p>
<h3>Bubba &#8211; Hero Elite</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0186EP0JW/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bubba</a> was included because it has the highest price to consumer rating ratio of any of the mugs we found, and the ceramic liner is a unique feature. While on the whole this mug seems a decent value, that liner didn’t prove to be an asset in any way we could find, and the way the lid collects drips and spreads them around is just annoying. The fact that the plastic ring which attaches the lid to the body just popped off in our eight-foot drop test makes us wonder how long it would take for grime and water to start collecting at that joint (even in normal use).</p>
<h3>Timolino &#8211; Icon</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0038XKF60/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Timolino &#8211; Icon</a> won top marks from <em>Cook’s Illustrated</em>, and it performed well in our cleaning and drop tests, but the drip-flip lid is a serious annoyance that was also noted by Amazon reviewers. While it didn’t break, this mug did leak around the seal every time we looked at it funny, so we wouldn’t put it anywhere near a computer bag.</p>
<h3>OXO Good Grips- SSDWTM</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-01/the-best-spill-proof-travel-mug-for-every-professional" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a> found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XF97OTI/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this OXO mug</a> quite difficult to destroy. Dropping it three times from ceiling height before giving up. We like its durability, but the push-button lid is the only one we tested that isn’t dishwasher safe, and it traps a good quantity of fluid in the spout even after it’s closed, which makes it messy to drink from.</p>
<h3>The discontinued champion: CamelBak &#8211; Forge</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5467 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge.jpg" alt="the CamelBak - Forge on a table" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><strong>Ed: the Camelbak &#8211; Forge was discontinued in 2018, and we&#8217;re sad to say that it hasn&#8217;t been replaced with an equivalent design. Our original review is preserved here for posterity.</strong><br />
The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EPGMZZS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CamelBak &#8211; Forge</a> is as smart as it is tough. The mechanism for opening and sealing the spout whenever you pull the “trigger” is simple and effective, and the Forge practically turns itself inside out for you when you need to clean it. (Even replacing the o-ring for the seal would be trivial.)</p>
<p>The Forge keeps your drink hot for a very long time; not as long as some of the mugs we tested, but well within the expected performance of a vacuum-insulated travel mug with a wide-mouth opening. Mugs with narrower openings (like our runner-up pick below) will keep the heat for longer, but that makes them harder to clean and fill.</p>
<p>In our leak test, the Forge did leave evidence that it had let out a single drop when we checked at 10 minutes into the half-hour spin-cycle test; no further leaks were found at the end of the test, and the amount lost didn’t register on our electronic kitchen scale.</p>
<p>The Forge doesn’t have a way to lock out its trigger the way Contigo’s latest designs do, but CamelBak has shaped a loop at the back of the lid that totally protects the trigger from basically anything other than your finger. It’s possible that some object of the right shape could press on it in just the right circumstances, but on the spin-cycle leak test the Forge was far more effective than the other self-sealing mugs (even the ones with locks).</p>
<p>What’s more, the loop is a convenient way to clip the Forge onto a backpack, bike bag, or just to hook a finger through, and it also prevents it from rolling if it’s knocked over. (That means it won’t just stop you from spilling coffee: it’ll also save you from that embarrassing conversation where you have to ask your coworkers if they’ve seen a mug rolling around on the floor.)</p>

<p>CamelBak has catered to the outdoor enthusiast crowd for decades, and has a great reputation for warranty work and customer service. They guarantee this mug for life against defects in the workmanship or materials, which doesn’t strictly cover things like worn rubber o-rings or driving over it with a cement truck, but when we looked for comments on repair services we found that CamelBak is often very generous.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line" class="collapse">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Caffeine keeps us alert, awake, and energized. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160LEYFY/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo &#8211; Transit</a> ensures that it will also go into your mouth, not onto your lap or computer. The easy-to-sip-from self-sealing design make it a clear winner for most uses, though it doesn&#8217;t have the best heat retention.</p>
<p>If you like your drinks at tongue-scalding temperatures, consider the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a>, which keeps boiling water too hot to drink for an hour, even with the lid off. The Thermos is also easier to clean than most mugs. It will spill if you knock it over with the lid flipped up, but when it’s locked you can rest assured it won’t come open in your bag.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After having highly organized marketing professionals test and rate 8 different options, we were able to make our final picks for best planner. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent hours researching, testing and conducting a focus group, and this time we found that the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B164VJS/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Erin Condren &#8211; 2018 Hardbound LifePlanner</a> is one of the best planners for 2018. The Erin Condren&#8217;s quality construction makes it stand out from other cutesy planners on the market. The<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HM2BHYV/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Me and My Big Ideas &#8211; Happy Planner</a> was a close runner-up, with large note-taking sections, a beautiful design and helpful prompts for setting goals.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we tested the planners</h2>
<p>We had a group of professionals at <a href="http://www.siegemedia.com">our content marketing agency</a> (that also runs Your Best Digs) pick a new weekly planner for the coming year.</p>
<p>Each tester used a planner individually for at least as week. Then, we held a focus group so participants could look at all of the planners and rank them. The group ranked the planners in order of best to worst, with 1 being best, and 11 being worst. We averaged the scores to create an average ranking. The lower the score, the better the planner rated. The results of that testing, and all the notes, data and etc, are available in a handy Google doc for your reference, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fTZ2Ji1cwTtyfubgBn6HewL7Pp4_gmU6feL8vFEIY5A/edit">here</a>.</p>
<p>The team was firmly aware that there can’t be a true “best planner” universally &#8212; because in many ways, a planner is an extension of personal preference and style. However, with enough opinions, we definitely feel we can help push you towards a planner you’ll enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>For the 2018 planner testing, we followed a similar process. This time, we added a qualitative element to our focus group and individual testing. We gave each tester surveys with open-ended questions like &#8220;what do you like about this planner?&#8221; and &#8220;what is this planner <em>not</em> good for?&#8221; The result was a more in-depth understanding of what makes the best planners the best, and you&#8217;ll see that reflected in the analysis of this year&#8217;s winners.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075843X8R/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Erin Condren &#8211; 2018 Hardbound LifePlanner</a> was created by a stay-at-home mom (<a href="https://www.erincondren.com/our-story">Erin Condren</a>) who had a passion for design. Her designs, and ultimately her LifePlanner, gained a cult following, and landed her big breaks on Rachel Ray and the Ellen Show. Today, the Erin Condren planner is one of the most blogged-about agendas out there, and it’s loved for more than just its pretty cover art.</p>

<p>Our selective testers were impressed by the amount of writing space it provided. In fact, all but one tester agreed that it has enough room to write down everything they want. It also scored well in overall size, with the majority of respondents noting that it was not too big and heavy, nor too small and light. Everyone who used it said that its fonts were easy to read, and “high quality” was one of the most commonly-used descriptors for this planner.</p>

It's packed with encouraging quotes that may be the pick-me-up you need during a busy workweek. With large note sections and high-quality construction, the Erin Condren planner is the visually pleasing solution to organization.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B164VJS/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The primary tester who used this agenda found the paper and cover to be good quality, and said that it was easy to write in with pens like the ones we tested in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-pens">pen review</a>. They also loved the monthly overview, and were a big fan of the motivational quotes at the end of each week. On the other hand, they caution against using this planner if you’re an avid traveler; it’s a little too big to throw in a carry on.</p>
<p>The Erin Condren comes with a “color-coordinated” place-holder ribbon and finished pages with a splash of color, which means it’ll always look good sitting out on your desk or tabletop. We also like that it comes with a few dot grid pages for those who dabble in bullet journaling.</p>
<p>Other things our testers liked about this planner: it lies almost entirely flat like a book when you open it, which makes writing in it easy. One tester also noted that “the space for each day is just enough” to write their multitude of daily tasks in. If we had to pick something we didn’t like about the Erin Condren, we would say that there isn’t a ton of room for making lists. Some testers also wanted to see more interactive prompts about goals and objectives.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WV9JW2S/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Happy Planner</a> from <a href="http://www.meandmybigideas.com/about/">Me &amp; My Big Ideas</a> is the brainchild of a Mother-Daughter duo who started their business together creating stickers for scrapbooking. This background is evident in their highly-customizable Me &amp; My Big Ideas &#8211; Happy Planner, which is replete with personalizable accessories, and yes, stickers. That being said, it still has all of the features required of a serious (and seriously helpful) planner. In fact, it was a close contender for first place in our tests.</p>

<p>Our testers all thought that it had attractive, easy to read fonts and a great layout. The majority of our our picky team of testers said that they would definitely commit to using this as their yearly planner. All but one person also said that there’s plenty of room to write in it. Testers loved the fun colors and colorfully-illustrated quotes sprinkled throughout the Happy Planner. They also loved that there was a dedicated birthdays section, enough room to take notes and tabbed sections that make accessing each month easier. Notably, this one is also an 18-month planner, making it perfect for long term and/or academic use, and planning long term project initiatives.</p>
<p>Of course, there are factors that stopped the Happy Planner from being number one, and they almost exclusively have to do with the planner’s construction. The majority of our testers found this planner too heavy for everyday use, and found that the large binding rings made it difficult to write near the center of the planner. This planner is also designed to have removable pages that you tear towards you to remove. So long as you tear them in the right direction, you can also put them back in the binding. However, it’s easy to accidentally tear them out from the side, which makes them impossible to put back in the binding.</p>

<h4>Last year&#8217;s best overall planner</h4>
<p>In 2017 the <a href="http://www.gettoworkbook.com/product/2017-get-to-work-book-classic-chipboard-cover">Get to Work Book</a> was our pick for best planner overall. Our group liked the Get to Work Book’s big, clean areas to write and overall inspirational design. It features large note taking areas, as well as helpful tabs that make flipping through or getting to the right page a breeze. It also includes great monthly reflection sections, as well as a “action items this week” area that makes prioritizing your most important tasks a breeze.</p>
<p>On the negative side, some people had concerns with the Get to Work Book’s size: it’s pretty bulky and will take up significant room on your desk. It’s also slightly masculine looking, which likely accounted for its slightly lower scores from the women in the group. The group also didn&#8217;t rate for price: the Get to Work Book is the most expensive planner we tested, <a href="http://www.gettoworkbook.com/product/2017-get-to-work-book-classic-chipboard-cover">at $50+</a>. Notably, it was also the top-rated planner by men.</p>
<p><strong>Long term testing notes:  </strong>After using this planner for a year, our long-term tester found that it was simply too bulky for his every day use. Despite that, he thought the layout was &#8220;amazing&#8221; and could be an invaluable resource if you don&#8217;t mind lugging it around, or plan to have it stay on your desk.</p>
<div>
<h4>Another planner highly rated by men</h4>
</div>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077119XCB/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Passion Planner</a> was another hit with guys, a second-place pick from three of our male testers. As with the Get to Work it didn’t fare quite as well with women, however, and was number 9 out of 11 in overall ranking once the scores were averaged.</p>
<p>The team liked its monthly reflection areas, built in bookmark and significant note taking sections. The Passion Planner was also unique in having hourly breakdowns by day, which was a bit polarizing: some loved it, some hated it. If this makes sense for your planning style, the Passion Planner could be a great pick. However, if it doesn’t, the hourly breakdowns might feel like detail for the sake of it, and actually get in the way of your daily planning. Overall, the Passion Planner is a solid choice if it fits your scheduling style. The 2019 version is available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B077119XCB/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<h4>The top pick by women</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CZ37KWB/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rifle Paper 17 month agenda</a> received the highest ranking from women, with an average rank of 2. It didn’t fare as well with the men, at a 6.5 average score, but that’s to be expected given its feminine aesthetic. The ban.do wasn&#8217;t too far behind, but on average, it far outpaced the field. The planner was lauded for more than its design inside and out: it also includes motivational quotes on each weekly page, tabs for quick reference, and is nicely sized for toting around or not taking up much space on your desk. Some reviewers noted they didn’t love the thinnish pages and felt like they could rip them out, but that was the only real negative for this planner. The 2018/1019 version is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CZ37KWB/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">available here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Long term testing notes: </strong></p>
<p>Our long term tester for this planner noted that she thought the size of this planner was ideal, with enough room to write everything she wanted to. She liked the weekly and monthly views, and the functional tabs and pockets and durable cover.</p>
<p>Over the course of the year, she found that she didn&#8217;t like the way the monthly sections were separated from the monthly calendar, and she also disliked the daily sections being split into columns. Overall though, she plans to use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D33M71Z/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rifle paper agenda again in</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072P12K7J/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2018</a>.</p>
<h4>Another planner highly rated by women</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bando.com/products/ban-do-17-month-large-agenda-marble-blonde">ban.do marble blonde planner</a> is also a great choice for those who want a feminine look. It’s bursting with personality, and has a huge amount of note taking space. It also comes with two sheets of stickers, making this by far the most “fun” of any the planners we looked at. Overall, the ban.do ranked 3.75 on average with the women, and only slightly lower with the men, at 4 overall. On the negative side, the ban.do is a heavy, bulky planner compared to the rest of the models we tested, and that was a turnoff for some people. However, if you have a big desk and don’t plan on lugging it around, <a href="https://www.bando.com/products/ban-do-17-month-large-agenda-marble-blonde">the ban.do</a> can excel at the job asked of it.</p>
<p><strong>Long term testing notes: </strong></p>
<p>Our long term tester for this planner noted that she liked using the fun stickers over the course of the year, and she appreciated the way monthly and weekly calendars were right next to each other. She also liked all the fun and quirky holidays pre-printed on the calendar pages.</p>
<p>She disliked the planner&#8217;s overall bulkiness, and found it could be improved with a note section in the weekly calendars and a bookmark. The 2019 version is available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CPZ8NS1/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<h4>The rest:</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/9935480321/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Action Day planner</a> is a no frills, no personality planner that confused most of our group. It has 16 pages at the beginning telling you how to use it, which people either loved or hated, and it has no real note taking section besides in the very back of the planner.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.hadronepoch.com/search?type=product&amp;q=*wtf*">WTF planner</a> is another fun option, but it feels more like a book than a planner, with pages that are hard to hold open. This makes it functionally difficult to use and was the main deterrent keeping it from a higher ranking than the 6 average it got from our group.</p>
<p>The team liked the horizontal, <a href="https://www.hadronepoch.com/collections/planners/products/spiral-weekly-planner-gray">undated weekly planner</a>, but came to the conclusion that it&#8217;s more of a supportive device than a standalone. For people who like the quick, constant visual reference, it can be a great desk add-on: but it&#8217;s not something with enough flexibility to be your primary planner.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sugarpaper.com/collections/calendars">Sugar Paper planner </a>was the highest rated option in our &#8220;other&#8221; group. The team liked its big note taking areas, intuitive layouts, and nice design end-to-end. Some didn&#8217;t love the legibility of its gold font or that the weekly views are condensed into one page, when they could have been two.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JSTORY-Medium-Personal-Monthly-Planner/dp/B01CCFU0G4/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Medium Monthly Planner</a> is as minimalist as it comes: essentially paper in a brown shell. That was a turnoff for most looking for better functionality than a simple looking planner like this can offer.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KEU5GOA/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Simple Elephant</a> was well loved by our testers, with a high quality, professional design. Importantly, this was the only planner in which our testers unanimously agreed that there was enough room to write everything. It&#8217;s packed with inspiring prompts for goal setting and objective tracking, and it doubles as a gratitude journal too.</p>
<p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075KQ9NX7/?tag=ybdplan-20'">Freedom Mastery &#8211; Deluxe Law of Attraction Planner</a> was another highly-rated agenda in our tests. It comes chock-full of stickers, prompts and inspiration, acting as part agenda and part vision board. If you like all of the inspiration, the Freedom Mastery may be perfect for you. However, testers looking for something simple wanted to steer clear of this one.</p>
<p>If you <em>are</em> looking for something simple, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B076TCRWV3/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tools4Wisdom </a>planner may be the best choice for you. This one had an academic feel to it, and our testers liked that it had plenty of room in which to write. It&#8217;s got all of the basic facets, like daily, weekly and monthly views. At the end of the day, it&#8217;s just generic, which may be exactly what some people want.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Long story short, if a planner works for you, it&#8217;s the best planner. But some planners are better than others, and a really great planner does more than work: it inspires you to use it and be more organized.</p>
<p>For 2018, we found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075843X8R/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Erin Condren &#8211; 2018 Hardbound LifePlanner</a> is the best planner for achieving that goal. It&#8217;s efficient, attractive and inspiring, all inside a well-constructed binding that&#8217;ll easily last you through the year. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B164VJS/?tag=ybdplan-20">Check out the 2019 edition of this planner here</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WV9JW2S/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Me and My Big Ideas &#8211; Happy Planner</a> is another great option, with removable and re-insertable pages and tabbed months that make staying organized a breeze.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> single cup of coffee is often all we need as we’re rushing out the door in the morning or fighting that midafternoon crash at work. After two weeks of testing our initial group and a follow-up test of updated models, we determined that the new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0788F3R8X/?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Keurig &#8211; K-Elite</a> is the best single-cup coffee maker. It makes pod coffee quickly and conveniently, with all the options you need.</p>

<h2 id="what-is">What is a single-cup coffee maker?</h2>
<p>Single-cup coffee makers fall into one of three categories.</p>
<p><strong>Drip machines:</strong> First, single-cup coffee makers can be simpler, smaller versions of traditional drip machines. These look and function like most home brewers you’re probably familiar with, but they drip coffee directly into your waiting mug.</p>
<p><strong>Keurig pod compatible:</strong> The Keurig brand dominates pod coffee makers, and they&#8217;re the largest supplier of both machines and patented cups of prepackaged ground coffee vacuum-sealed in nitrogen to prevent oxidation. With the pod in place and the mechanism shut, small pins pierce both the top and bottom of the pod.</p>
<p>At the push of a button, water is pumped from a tank on the side of the machine into a reservoir containing the heating coils. Once the water is heated to the optimal temperature, it is pushed through the pod and directly into your mug.</p>
<p><strong>Nespresso:</strong> A third type of machine creates a stronger, more concentrated espresso-style brew. Also dominated by a single brand, Nespresso, these machines pump out shots of espresso topped with that desirable frothy layer of crema. The shots can be enjoyed on their own or used to make lattes, cappuccinos, and other espresso drinks.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-chose">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>We wanted to put together a comprehensive sample of the best coffee makers out there, representative of these three categories. Before we started our research online, we got input from our resident coffee aficionados. Obviously, the two big names, Keurig and Nespresso had to be included.</p>
<p>We spent a dozen hours combing through Amazon reviews, coffee blogs, and ranking sites like Cnet and Consumer Reports. We also watched product demonstration videos and searched through a few subreddits in the pursuit of actionable information and advice. Using this new knowledge, we chose seven products for testing.</p>
<h3>2019 Update</h3>
<p>In our initial round-up, we featured the flagship of the Keurig &#8220;2.0 system&#8221; fleet, the K575. This more expensive Keurig featured a variety of brew settings and the option to fill a carafe using special jumbo-size pods. The 2.0 system was notable for using a proprietary label and electronic reader to only allow Keurig&#8217;s own coffee pods; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9e0yCq1AEeY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it was an easy system to bypass with an old label</a> but many users objected to the intended restriction.</p>
<p>One Keurig 2.0 model is still for sale direct from the manufacturer, but Keurig has switched focus away from proprietary pods. The advantages of the second-generation system, like custom temperature settings or iced coffee brew modes, have now been incorporated into a new K-Elite model that we picked as best overall in a roundup of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-keurig/">the best Keurig brewers</a> in 2019.</p>
<h2 id="the-seven-best">Compare the best single-cup coffee makers</h2>
[table id=270 /]
<h2 id="why-buy">Who needs a single-cup coffee maker</h2>
<p>Single-cup coffee makers have grown in popularity because of their reliability; single-cup machines that use pods make a consistent product every time. They’re efficient, convenient, and offer a huge selection of beverages &#8212; over 200 coffees, teas, and hot chocolates, including styles from Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Snapple, Tazo, and Illycafe.</p>
<p>By eliminating bean scooping and paper filters, these machines also take away the chore of making coffee and cleaning out the machine. No need to guess on the water-to-coffee ratio and no need to measure either. Just pop in the pod, hit the button, drink your coffee, and toss the pod.</p>
<p>With the exception of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MFC73AZ/?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nespresso &#8211; Citiz</a> (pronounced &#8220;cities&#8221;), all the coffee makers we tested also allow you to use your own ground coffee if you prefer. A common complaint in the 1990s, when the Keurig system was introduced, was the reliance on pods exclusively. Today, Keurig offers the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EMWIXL4/tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a>, which lets you use your favorite freshly ground blend from your local roaster.</p>
<p><strong>Brewing one cup at a time also ensures the mug you’re drinking is fresh.</strong> It cuts down on time and waste too. If the first person to get into the office at 8 a.m. makes a full pot of coffee, but the boss doesn’t roll in until after nine, his coffee will be stale, taste burned, and probably end up going in the microwave.</p>
<h2 id="controversy">Controversy around single-cup coffee makers</h2>
<p><strong>First, K-Cup coffee is more expensive than buying beans and using a traditional brewing machine, French press, or percolator.</strong> Depending on the particular K-Cup and brand of coffee in comparison, coffee made with the Keurig system is somewhere between three and five times more expensive.</p>
<p>According to an article published in the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/03/the-abominable-k-cup-coffee-pod-environment-problem/386501/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March 2015 issue of the Atlantic</a>, the 11 grams of coffee per pod works out to about $40 per pound. A pound of whole bean dark roast at Starbucks goes for about $12 a pound and the same is about $9 at Dunkin Donuts.</p>
<p>Even our favorite local premium roaster in San Diego, Dark Horse Coffee, sells its <a href="http://www.darkhorsecoffeeroasters.com/shop/harrar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethiopian Yirgacheffe</a> for $18 a pound, which is still less than half the price of a pound of K-Cup coffee.</p>
<p>When the Keurig was introduced in 1990, the company held the exclusive patent on the cups that fit into the machine. In September of 2012, that patent expired and the market was flooded with private-label pods from a variety of independent and corporate entities. The competition brought down prices &#8212; but only temporarily.</p>
<p>Keurig responded by introducing a sensor embedded in their 2.0 models that prohibits the use of unlicensed pods. The machine reads a piece of digital information on each pod label and will only brew if the pod is, in fact, a licensed variety. The competition, in turn, filed lawsuits and the Internet community posted hacks and workarounds that allowed third-party pods to be used.</p>
<p>Proprietary pod detectors have all but disappeared from Keurig&#8217;s line, but consumer freedom advocates have long memories.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the Keurig system that has drawn criticism is the environmental impact of the one-use-only pods, which are neither easily recyclable nor biodegradable.<strong> According to <a href="https://www.recycleacup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recycleacup.com</a>, K-Cups can only be recycled if the separate components are taken apart prior to recycling.</strong></p>
<p>Pods are made of a combination of plastic, aluminum, and paper. The coffee inside must be emptied before you put it in the recycle bin, and each different material within the K-Cup should be separated. Most people don’t do this. Therefore, most coffee brewed with a Keurig machine results in another plastic pod being added to the trash.</p>
<p>A traditional drip coffee maker or pour-over method utilizes a paper filter that is biodegradable and compostable, and French presses and percolators create no waste. That cannot be said for Keurig systems. Not only are the disposable K-Cups an environmental issue, but also the manufacturing of them involves many more steps than any other kind of coffee.</p>
<p>Many coffee drinkers find convenience in pod-style coffee machines. They pour a consistent cup of coffee every time, they’re cost-effective compared to buying a cup of coffee at Starbucks, and you can choose from a variety of flavors and beverages. If you consider that worth the expense, read on.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<p>The features that are important to you will primarily be determined by the type of coffee you intend to make on a daily basis. If espresso-based coffee drinks get you going in the morning, you should look no further than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MFC73AZ?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nespresso &#8211; Citiz Espresso Maker</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to continue to make drip coffee from freshly ground beans, and you want to manipulate the strength and water-to-coffee ratios yourself, you probably don’t need a Keurig. But, if you’re attracted to the convenience and variety of the K-Cup system, then choosing which one is right for you will require looking at some additional factors.</p>
<h3>Size</h3>
<p>These machines vary significantly in terms of size. <strong>The Keurig appliances are large and can take up quite a bit of counter space</strong>. Their height, in particular, makes them hard to store out of the way and off of the counter, in a cabinet or on a shelf. The size of your kitchen and your needs for clear counter space will lead to considering some options over others.</p>
<h3>Aesthetics</h3>
<p>In addition to varying dimensions, the machines all have distinct design qualities that make them more or less visually appealing. Some models are sleek, sharp, and impressive. Others look bulky, antiquated, or cheap.</p>
<p>Objectivity is difficult to achieve when evaluating what looks good aesthetically, but for something that will end up most likely living in view on your kitchen counter, it would be nice to like the way your coffee maker looks.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>Your Best Digs is primarily motivated by the quest to find and recommend the very best products. While value is important to us, we do all of our testing and evaluation without weighing price too heavily. We aim to give our readers a complete understanding of what it’s like to own and use these products. Armed with that information, it is then ultimately for you to decide on the cost-benefit analysis that fits your needs and your budget.</p>
<p><strong>It’s important to remember, however, that it’s not just the cost of these machines that varies so greatly; so does the cost of operating them</strong>. As discussed above, the price per cup of using the Keurig or Nespresso pod system is much higher than using a traditional grind and drip. The convenience vs. affordability evaluation will differ depending on what you value.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Capacity</h3>
[table id=267 /]
<p>Our first task was to noted the different volumes that each machine pours in order to determine the size of cup that it can accommodate. Many travel mugs, like the 12-ounce version of the top-ranked model in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/">travel mug review</a>, will fit under the standard 7&#8243; spout, but in most cases we had to remove a drip tray to get extra clearance.</p>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<p>One of the main attractions of the single-cup coffee maker is the speed. Most people hope for a quick process with a minimal wait time as they’re trying to get out the door in the morning. We ran the clock on both the time it took for each machine to heat the water and how long it took to brew an eight-ounce drink (a 3.7-ounce pour with the Nespresso).</p>
<p>When considering time, it’s useful to know that two of the machines we tested offer an auto-on timer option &#8212; the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014W1C2VM?th=1?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart SS-700 Single Serve Brewing System</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018UQ5VEK?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Keurig &#8211; K-Elite</a>. The water heater will click on at the specific time you set, which means all you have to do is press the brew button and you’ll be drinking coffee in less than a minute.</p>
[table id=269 /]
<h3>Heat</h3>
<p>One common complaint of people using Keurig machines is that the coffee isn’t quite as hot at they would like it to be. Most coffee is recommended to be brewed between 195 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit, and served between 155 and 175 degrees, but personal preference for coffee temperature varies widely.</p>
<p>We used the thermometer that won our pick for <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-digital-meat-thermometer/">best digital thermometer</a>, the Lavatools Javelin Pro, to determine the temperature of an eight-ounce cup of coffee immediately after the brewing process concluded. For the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MFC73AZ?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nespresso &#8211; Citiz</a>, we used the larger 3.7-ounce setting since it lacks an eight-ounce option. If you know you tend to enjoy your coffee at a certain temperature, the data we found during this test will be particularly helpful.</p>
<p>Note that high-end Keurig machines feature a temperature adjustment setting, but this only brings the brew temperature down from 192 degrees to allow for brewing at high altitudes where water will boil at low temperatures. We tested at the default (highest) setting of 192 which resulted in water hitting the cup at just under 170.</p>
[table id=268 /]
<h3>Accessories</h3>
<p>The machines we tested come with a variety of different accessories to suit any taste. Some come with charcoal filters, which attach to a wand sitting in the water tank to purify the water before brewing. <strong>Some Keurig systems come with a K-Cup reusable coffee filter that allows you to use your own ground coffee</strong>, while you might need to buy this piece separately with other machines.</p>
<p>Many of the models we tested came with sample packs of pods to try, and one machine, the Black+Decker Brew &#8216;n Go, even came with a travel mug that fits perfectly under the spout.</p>
<h3>User Experience</h3>
<p>After coming down from the buzz of testing the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-french-press/">best French presses</a> earlier in the year, our coffee-testing team was excited to get familiar with the user experience of the single-cup machines. We lived with the coffee makers for two weeks and used them often, toggling through features, observing sounds, deciphering cleaning directions, and of course, drinking copious amounts of coffee.</p>
<p>We recorded our thoughts, feelings, and emotions throughout the whole process and reflected back on them, in conjunction with all of our data, to determine our favorite single-cup coffee makers.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0788F3R8X/?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Keurig &#8211; K-Elite</a> is a leader in the single-cup market for a reason. It’s versatile, easy to use, and allows some adjustment &#8212; plus it makes decent coffee. If you want the best pod-based single-cup coffee maker on the market, you should invest in the Elite.</p>
<p>When you brew with the K-Elite, you have the ability to choose the size of the drink, from a strong, concentrated four-ounce up to a 12-ounce travel mug. If you want to fill a 16 oz. travel mug, you&#8217;re probably best off running two pods unless you prefer coffee on the watery side. The increments allow for more control over the size and strength of your morning cup of joe than any other single-cup machine we tested.</p>
<p>This machine does take up a fair amount of counter space at 13.1″ H x 9.9″ W x 12.7″ D. It also has the shortest power cord, at about a foot. However, it has a sleek look that’s appealing on a counter.</p>
<p>While you can manipulate the strength of your coffee by adjusting the ounces of water to some extent, the Elite also has a “strong” setting. This adds about 20 seconds to the regular brew cycle, increasing the extraction time. The result is coffee that is noticeably richer. Taste varies, so we&#8217;re glad to see this option.</p>

    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/k-elite-video-1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Our testers also liked that this Keurig has a water filter. If you prefer making coffee with filtered water, this is an obvious choice for you. However, even if you don’t mind the tap, the water filter is supposed to extend the life of the machine overall, as less impurities should build up within it. Installing the filter in the reservoir was not hard, but it did require reading the manual.</p>
<p>Other upgrades over the original Keurig machines include “auto-on” and hot water functions. The “auto-on” feature will heat the water at your pre-set time, leaving you just 45 seconds away from your coffee when you press the brew button on your way out the door.</p>
<p>The hot water function does not use a separate spout, so you&#8217;ll probably want to run a rinse cycle between making coffee and tea.</p>
<p>On its default setting, this machine served coffee at about 170 degrees Fahrenheit. This was on the low side of our finalists — but normal for a Keurig. Our testers did not make any remarks about the coffee temperature being too cold.</p>
<p>Also, the K-Elite was the only Keurig we tested that can be programmed to brew at different temperatures, from 187 to 192 degrees. You can change the brew temperature in the settings menu, which is a big plus if you&#8217;re at higher elevations or using specialty pods.</p>
<p>Our testers thought that this Keurig was the most complicated to use because of its many features. When setting up the machine, we were immediately asked to program the time, altitude mode and automatic turn-on time. While all of these features are useful, we had to consult the manual to figure out how to program them.</p>
<p>Overall, the K-Elite takes our top spot. When you wake up in the morning you want coffee fast — this machine delivers on that. The K-Elite is tops for convenience, which is why consumers are attracted to single-cup machines in the first place.</p>

<p>This Keurig runs at about $160, which is a relatively mid-range price for a Keurig machine. If you are buying a Keurig to make your life more convenient, we believe the K-Elite is worth the extra coin.<br />
In our testing, the Keurig 2.0 outperformed the competition in terms of speed, heat, and usability. The one-minute, 47-second heat cycle was the fastest of the K-Cup-based systems we tested, and the 41-second brew time was just two seconds slower than the fastest K-Cup machine, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014W1C2VM?th=1?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart SS-700 Single Serve Brewing System</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The K-Elite was our fastest-brewing Keurig machine.</li>
<li>This machine’s 75-ounce water reservoir means you won’t be constantly refilling this machine.</li>
<li>The included water filter is a plus for those who prefer filtered water; the machine may also have a longer life for this reason.</li>
<li>This machine’s short power cord and large size limit its movability in the kitchen.</li>
<li>Some coffee drinkers dislike the watered-down nature of Keurig&#8217;s standard recipe, but this model gives you options.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005MF9C?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Black+Decker &#8211; Brew &#8216;n Go</a> may lack the bells and whistles of some of the other machines, but that’s part of its appeal. The Brew n’ Go is essentially a mini version of a traditional drip coffee maker that dispenses coffee into a 15-ounce stainless steel travel mug, which is included in the box.</p>
<p>It has one button and one setting: Brew. The Brew n’ Go will use all the water poured into the machine, so it’s recommended to use the included mug, or the same mug you plan to use for coffee, to fill the tank.</p>
<p><strong>Unlike the other single-cup coffee makers, it does not shut off after a specific number of ounces, and it will overflow your mug if you pour in too much water.</strong></p>
<p>This can be a positive or negative depending on your personal coffee brewing preferences.</p>

<p>The permanent mesh filter system eliminates the need for paper filters, and it cleans easily with just a rinse. You can either use coffee ground for drip machine use or grind the beans yourself at home. You have total control over strength and taste because you select the amount of coffee, the type of coffee, and the amount of water.</p>

<p><strong>We found that the Brew n’ Go made coffee significantly hotter than the other single-cup coffee makers we tested.</strong> At 182 degrees, coffee made with the Brew n’ Go is five degrees hotter than the newer Keurig model and more than 10 degrees hotter than every other machine we tested.</p>
<p>The coffee that comes from a Brew n’ Go will stay warmer longer, so you can slowly enjoy it longer than coffee from the other machines we tested.</p>
<p>The compact design allows the Black+Decker Brew &#8216;n Go to fit on any small counter, in a cabinet, or even on your desk at work. It’s about a quarter of the size of the Keurig machines we tested.</p>
<p>Finally, at about $18, it is substantially more affordable than the other top seven single-cup coffee makers. And, that price includes the stainless steel mug that fits the machine perfectly. If what you want is a single cup of no nonsense, reliably hot drip coffee, the Black+Decker Brew &#8216;n Go is an excellent choice.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A permanent mesh filter and included stainless steel travel mug make the Black+Decker Brew &#8216;n Go a truly complete system. Just add coffee.</li>
<li>One setting means the control is in your hands, not the machine. Choose your favorite blend, grind the beans your way, and add just the right amount of coffee and water for you.</li>
<li>It serves hotter coffee at a more affordable price than any other machine we tested.</li>
<li>The Brew n’ Go has a sharp, compact design that will fit just about anywhere.</li>

<p><strong>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MFC73AZ?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nespresso &#8211; Citiz Espresso Maker</a> is a beautiful machine that makes espresso-style coffee in servings of 1.35 or 3.7 ounces.</strong> These highly concentrated coffees can be enjoyed on their own or can be used to make lattes, Americanos, cappuccinos, or iced drinks.</p>
<p>Like the K-Cup brewers, the machine is very easy to operate. Pop in a pod, press the size option you want, and the coffee pours directly into your mug. The Citiz is even designed with a small tray that folds out so a smaller espresso cup, or demitasse, can sit just below the spout.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8397" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Maker_Nespresso-Pod-animated-1.gif" alt="" width="900" height="600" /></p>
<p><strong>The end product is not just strong; it’s finished with a light tan, frothy top layer called crema.</strong> This delicate foam has a lot going on. As we sifted through information on chemistry, fats, oils, proteins, roasting temperatures, and optimal extraction pressures that influence the appearance of crema, our heads spun a bit.</p>
<p>In our testing, however, we found that the mouth-feel of the espresso is satisfying and the taste is what you&#8217;d expect from a $5 espresso at a coffee shop.</p>
<p>The Nespresso company markets about 30 pod varieties with exotic names based in Italian and Turkish. Independent companies market additional options as well as reusable pods that can be filled with your own ground coffee at home.</p>
<p>The pods, or capsules, as Nespresso calls them, are primarily made of aluminum which can be recycled. Because the used grounds must be separated from the aluminum, it’s pretty difficult to do at home. However, Nespresso will send you a free recycle bag that you can fill with up to 200 capsules and then drop off at any UPS location to shipped backed to Nespresso free of charge.</p>

<p><strong>In our testing, the Nespresso machine was the fastest to produce a finished product from turning the machine on to taking the first sip of coffee.</strong> While the espresso was just outside the top three in terms of temperature, at 171 degrees, it didn’t seem to be a deal-breaker because the small shots are meant to be enjoyed quickly or mixed with another hot beverage like steamed milk.</p>
<p>The machine itself is expensive, priced at just under $200 when we published this article, and the pods are more expensive per cup than using a traditional brewing method. That being said, it is a high-class machine that looks and feels top-of-the-line while consistently producing a product that would otherwise be very difficult to accomplish at home without a full-blown espresso machine.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Nespresso Citiz makes espresso complete with a light, foamy layer of crema on top.</li>
<li>Coffee varieties from Nespresso and other producers, along with the ability to use your own espresso blend, have greatly increased options since the machine was first introduced.</li>
<li>It is a high-end product with an high price tag that we feel is justified and well worth it for serious coffee connoisseurs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mr. Coffee, arguably the biggest name in the American home coffee maker market, offers a great machine that will get you into the K-Cup system at a very reasonable price, around $60.</strong> The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FJPSLJC?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mr. Coffee &#8211; K-Cup Brewing System</a> brews both K-Cups and your own ground coffee with the included K-Cup filter.</p>

<p>Instead of a lever that opens to reveal the K-Cup compartment, the Mr. Coffee pod compartment slides out completely and you pop the pod into the chamber before sliding it back in. A bit of care needs to be taken because this exposes the small sharp needles that pierce the pods during brewing.</p>
<p>The Mr. Coffee has one setting for brewing, and it lacks any different size settings. While the Mr. Coffee machine doesn’t have extra features, the straight-forward operation and entry-level pricing make it worthy of consideration.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EI7DPS0?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; Single Serve Scoop Coffee Maker</a> functions in much the same way as the Black+Decker Brew &#8216;n Go but with a higher quality design and the addition of a strong setting. Made of stainless steel, the Hamilton Beach looks sharp and durable. The mesh scoop filter, also made of steel, can be used to spoon coffee out of the bag and then directly into the machine for brewing.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4059 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_HamiltonBeach.jpg" alt="hamilton beach coffee maker" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_HamiltonBeach.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_HamiltonBeach-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_HamiltonBeach-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_HamiltonBeach-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_HamiltonBeach-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_HamiltonBeach-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_HamiltonBeach-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_HamiltonBeach-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_HamiltonBeach-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>As mentioned with the K-Elite’s strong setting, a single cup of coffee can be made stronger by slowing down the extraction process. Much like allowing a tea bag to steep a bit longer, more flavor is released from coffee that is exposed to hot water for a longer period of time. The Hamilton Beach has a “bold” setting that functions in this manner and produces a cup that does indeed taste stronger.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of speed, the Hamilton Beach excels.</strong> It brews a full cup of coffee quicker than any other machine, when combined with the heating cycle, and it’s just one second slower than the Nespresso, which brews a cup half the size. However, at 167 degrees, the end product is substantially cooler than the coffee from other single-cup coffee makers we tested.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart &#8211; SS-700 Single Serve Brewing System was made by the popular kitchen appliance company to rival the newer Keurig machines. In our testing, it closely mirrored the Keurig &#8211; K-Elite in performance. The Cuisinart was one second slower in the heating cycle, but two seconds quicker to brew. It was also just one degree cooler than the K-Elite. Since our testing, this model has been replaced by the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014W1C2VM?th=1?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SS-10</a> model, and we&#8217;ve updated links throughout our review to the new one.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4060 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Cuisinart.jpg" alt="cuisinart coffee maker" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Cuisinart.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Cuisinart-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Cuisinart-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Cuisinart-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Cuisinart-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Cuisinart-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Cuisinart-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Cuisinart-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Cuisinart-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The Cuisinart includes many of the same features we fell in love with in the big Keurig machine: a water filtration system, push-button for hot water, and the “auto-on” capability. The Cuisinart will brew licensed K-Cups as well as alternative pods, and it is compatible with the My K-Cup system that lets you use your own ground coffee.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart advertises five temperature settings, but when we used our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-digital-meat-thermometer/">known-accurate digital thermometer</a> to check the coffee set at 168 and 172, (the lowest and highest setting, respectively) we found just half a degree of difference.</p>
<p>We were also less impressed with the LED screen, blue backed instead of full color, and the maximum brew size of just 10 ounces. The old Keurig 2.0 system had half a dozen settings between 4 and 30 ounces. These shortcomings, combined with the lofty price tag of $220 held the Cuisinart back in the larger competition.</p>
<p>Another machine that failed to impress is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018UQ5AMS?th=1?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Keurig &#8211; K-Classic Coffee Maker</a>. One of the longest-lived Keurig models, the Classic does a fine job of brewing K-Cup coffee into one of three different sizes. But that’s all it does.</p>
<p>Knowing that so much more is now possible with the Keurig brand in terms of size options, functions, and design, it’s hard to justify investing in the older model when the newer models are available for about $50 more.</p>

<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The single-cup coffee maker is a great machine for quickly and conveniently making one cup of coffee, right when you want it. A lot has been written about the environmental impact of single-use pods that have been popularized by the Keurig system. It is also clear that K-Cup coffee is significantly more expensive than traditionally brewed drip coffee.</p>
<p>We understand both of these concerns, but for the purposes of this review, we sought to declare the best single-use coffee maker on the market today. <strong>After two weeks, many cups of coffee, and more than a few jitters, we can declare that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0788F3R8X?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Keurig K-Elite Series Coffee Maker</a> is the best single-cup coffee maker.</strong></p>
<p>The Keurig K-Elite accommodates more brewing sizes and completes the brewing process quicker than all the other machines we tested. The next generation features like its charcoal-based water filtration, “auto-on” programmability, and on-demand hot water make the machine incredibly versatile and easy to use.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to stay away from pod-based systems, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005MF9C/?tag=ybdkeu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker Brew &#8216;n Go</a>. The Brew n’ Go is essentially a smaller version of a traditional drip coffee maker with a reusable mesh filter and a travel mug that fits the machine perfectly. It has one button, it does one thing, and it does it very well. Coffee made with the Black+Decker was consistently hotter than any other machine we tested.</p>
<p>At the opposite end of the spectrum is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MFC73AZ/?tag=ybdkeu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nespresso &#8211; Citiz, our favorite high-end machine</a>. The Nespresso Citiz makes espresso that is reliably strong and delicious. It looks sleek and modern, and we felt a little spoiled to have it simply sitting on the counter. The Nespresso pods are even recyclable, and while that does require a bit of an effort, we are grateful for it.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s obvious at this point that the Keurig is for you, we might also suggest checking out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-keurig/">review of the best Keurigs</a> to see how their other offerings (including all-in-one latte machines) fare against the Elite.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We tested 22 different bottles over several weeks in order to determine the best pick in each frequently-used category.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent several weeks subjecting 22 water bottles to rigorous testing that included washing, carrying, performing leak and stress tests — and, of course, drinking. Of our five categories, we found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004PXWG4G/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klean Kanteen &#8211; 20-Ounce Insulated</a> is the best water bottle due to its wide mouth, performance, versatility and sleek design.</p>

<p>With all the different types of water bottles — plastic, metal, glass, insulated or not — it can be confusing to pick the best one for your needs. In addition to our top pick, we’ve identified four runner-up options to give you plenty of choices to pick from, including a collapsible version.</p>
<p>Each bottle material has its own strengths, and knowing the advantages of each will help you find a bottle you&#8217;ll be happiest with. The only type of bottle to keep drinks hot <em>or</em> cold are vacuum insulated bottles. Every other type does not, and these other ones all form condensation on the outside when you put cold water inside. Check out the breakdown below for more differences:</p>
<p><a href="#best-insulated-water-bottle">Vacuum insulated bottles</a> are the best way to keep your water super cold for an entire day, or to keep beverages hot for an impressive five hours. These insulated bottles have two inner chambers, one for the water and then one surrounding that with a vacuum channel. This proves to be a very effective method for insulation, but these weigh more because of it.</p>
<p><a href="#best-glass-water-bottle">Glass water bottles</a> eliminate plastic or metal tastes and chemicals / BPAs. Being able to see how much liquid is left without having to pick up or open the bottle is a nice perk. All were covered in a silicone sleeve for drop protection (no bottles cracked or shattered in our drop tests) but glass and silicone will not insulate your water. Condensation formed on all glass and silicone surfaces even though the silicone sleeves helped improve grip.</p>
<p><a href="#best-stainless-steel-water-bottle">Stainless steel bottles</a> are an effective, low-cost option. They’re non-reactive, BPA free, and lightweight compared to glass or their insulated stainless steel counterparts. You can&#8217;t put hot water in these as directed by the manufacturers (and you&#8217;ll burn your hands). But if you just need something for short amounts of time and don’t care about insulation, it’s tough to beat the value. Some folks prefer glass to avoid the metal smell or taste, but we found no issue with tastes on these bottles at all. We also tested one aluminum bottle, which is a bit lighter but otherwise similar.</p>
<p><a href="#best-plastic-bottle">Plastic water bottles</a> are geared towards sports and workouts. Even if you&#8217;re not using it for those purposes you can still benefit from their sporty design features. Three of the bottles we tested had a flip-top lid that lets you drink using one hand, which we loved. They&#8217;re also lightweight compared to glass and insulated bottles. Every bottle we tested was made of Tritan, a material claiming to be free of BPAs, estrogenic and androgenic activity. We still found these bottles to have the strongest smell though.</p>
<p><a href="#best-collapsible-water-bottle">Collapsible water bottles</a> are perfect if you&#8217;re traveling or hiking and space is very limited. They are incredibly thin and the lightest weight option by a large margin &#8212; collapsible bottles we tested weighed eight times less than insulated bottles, and four times less than our tested plastic bottles. These do have a smell but mostly go away after a few washes.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-chose">How we chose the best bottles to test</h2>
<p>There are a lot of water bottle options out there, so we started by narrowing our list of finalists by only selecting those that fit specific criteria. There are many materials and styles these bottles are made in, so we tested five of the most popular types.</p>
<p>We searched Amazon, Reddit, forums and other water bottle reviews to find the highest quality and most popular brands of water bottles.</p>
<p>A review on Outside Online cited a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GOF6TAU/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SIGG bottle</a> that outperformed anything we’ve heard of in terms of thermoregulation, so we had to add that to the test list as well.</p>
<p>Every bottle we chose fit these criteria:</p>
<p><strong>Water capacity:</strong> It held enough water to quench thirst, but it wasn&#8217;t too big that it would be cumbersome to lug around. Many brands have larger bottles at 32 and even 64 oz capacities.</p>
<p><strong>They&#8217;re well-reviewed:</strong> Other reviews that praised bottles, and bottles on Amazon&#8217;s best-sellers list were slightly favored.</p>
<p><strong>Fewer issues with quality:</strong> Any bottles that have a higher than average history of complaints on build quality, leaking or other functional qualities were omitted.</p>
<p><strong>They&#8217;re not too specialized:</strong> We avoided bottles that were designed for very specific tasks, such as cycling.</p>
<p><strong>They&#8217;re not knockoffs:</strong> Whether it&#8217;s a knockoff or rebrand, many of these are actually the same exact bottle so we didn&#8217;t test duplicates. See more detail below.</p>
<h3>Knock-off and rebranded water bottles</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2991" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles.jpg" alt="two different rebranded bottles side by side" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>If you shop for water bottles online or in many retail stores, you&#8217;ll notice many brands with products that look identical. For example, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MIRA-Insulated-Double-Vacuum-Stainless/dp/B00XK4BCZ0/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mira</a> bottle we tested seems to have the same design as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Modern-Vacuum-Insulated-Bottle/dp/B01GKGEZUI/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Simple Modern</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ICONIQ-Stainless-Vacuum-Insulated-Bottle/dp/B01BFX24XG/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ICONIQ</a>, and the popular <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Swell-Womens-Teakwood-Water-Bottle/dp/B00M00OPZ4/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">S&#8217;well</a> to name a few.</p>
<p>The popular Hydro Flask looks to have the same design as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vacuum-Insulated-Mouth-Stainless-Bottle/dp/B0181FY83K/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">321 Strong</a>, Glacier Point, and Fifty Fifty.</p>
<p>Some Redditors explained the source of the many knock-offs of popular water bottle brands out there: most knock offs are just rebrands that come out of the same factory as the originals. So we assumed their performance to be the same and avoided testing any rebranded products.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more that goes into a great water bottle than meets the eye! We put our 22 finalists through an extensive series of tests to see which would come out on top. Those tests included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thermal insulation test</li>
<li>Hot water test</li>
<li>Leak and drop test</li>
<li>Condensation test</li>
<li>Usability test</li>
</ul>
<h3>Thermal insulation test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2835" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures.jpg" alt="testing water bottle temperatures with thermometer" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Since drinking room-temperature water isn&#8217;t something most people prefer, we tested every bottle for its ability to keep water cold. For the bottles that were designed for it, we tested their ability to keep water hot too.</p>
<p>We tested temperatures with an <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-digital-meat-thermometer/">instant-read thermometer</a> so the bottles only needed to be opened for a short amount of time during temperature testing.</p>
<p>Just for good measure, we tested the vacuum insulated bottles as well as the uninsulated bottles with cold water: glass bottles, plastic bottles, collapsible plastic bottles and stainless steel bottles. Starting with cold, 42°F water, we let the bottles duke it out in a temperature controlled room  and measured the temperatures along the way.</p>
<p>The cold water in uninsulated bottles rose a whopping 20°F in the first hour and coasted to room temperature after just five hours.</p>
<p>Insulated bottles, on the other hand, fared much better. It took about 20 hours for all of the bottles to reach near room temperature, which is very impressive! This means you can be sipping on ice-cold water throughout the course of a normal 8 or 10-hour day using an insulated bottle.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2976 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900.png" alt="water bottle cold water test chart" width="900" height="584" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900.png 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-610x396.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-885x574.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-360x234.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-375x243.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-414x269.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-295x191.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-180x117.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-320x208.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
It&#8217;s clear from the poor rank of the 10-ounce Sigg in this test that a big factor in keeping your drink cold is how much water is inside. With cold water (or ice), the more you can keep inside, the better it will stay cold.</p>
<h3>Hot water test</h3>
<p>Four of our five vacuum insulated bottles were suitable for use with hot water. We tested the Klean Kanteen, SIGG, Hydro Flask, and the Mira bottles. We added boiling water to each bottle, and adjusted water levels until each reached 196°F, then checked on them in even intervals.</p>
<p>We removed the lids and tested temperatures with the same instant-read digital thermometer we used on the cold water test. Hot water returned to room temperature much faster than the cold water did, but these bottles performed according to manufacturer promises.</p>

<h3>2018 Updates: 32oz bottle test</h3>
<div id="visualizer-18685-1906119914" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-18685"></div>
In 2018 we tested our new contenders in another heat retention test. This time, we picked a standard size (32 ounces) and tested with an uninsulated stainless steel bottle as a control. Water started at a rolling boil, but by the time we pre-filled and blended the water between the bottles to get a fair comparison the average temperature was 184.</p>
<p>In this test, it was once again the narrowest-neck bottle that took top position. Unlike the narrow mouth on the Mira bottle from our first lineup, Klean Kanteen&#8217;s Classic 1.7-inch opening is wide enough to fit full-size ice cubes, but it still gives an edge in insulation performance. 160 degrees after 12 hours is toasty, even on the edge of piping hot.</p>
<p>The other standout in this test is YETI, with the heavy (and expensive) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072BVN7JB/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rambler Bottle.</a> If you want top insulation with a wide-open mouth, YETI was only four degrees lower than the Klean Kanteen after a full twelve hours, compared to more than 20 degrees difference in the other wide-mouth bottles.</p>
<h3>Leak and drop test</h3>
<p>A bottle that leaks is not much more useful than a lidless cup, so we tested each bottle for leak potential. Thankfully, none of the bottles leaked with normal use and vigorous shaking or twisting, so we decided to do some drop tests to see how they stand up to some abuse.</p>
<p>We filled each bottle to 75% capacity, then dropped it from standing position three feet from the ground on its bottom, then once again on its top, and finally we pushed it off a table about three feet tall.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, all bottles remained leakproof after being dropped. All stainless steel bottles dented to some degree, and the uninsulated steel variety dented the worst, causing them to wobble when placed on a flat surface.</p>
<p>We expected the sport bottles with seemingly fragile flip caps &#8212; like the Embrava, Under Armour and the Thermos &#8212; to break or at least leak after they were dropped, but they did not. During one drop, the Embrava&#8217;s lid actually shifted off the cap threads a bit and took some force to unscrew &#8212; yet it still remained leakproof after being put back on.</p>
<p>While dropping the glass bottles, we were bracing ourselves for shattered glass everywhere with each drop, yet no bottles ever shattered. The silicone sleeves did a good job of absorbing the drop impact.</p>
<h3>Condensation test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2836" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles.jpg" alt="condensation buildup on bottles" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Condensation forms on the outside of cold water bottles because cooler air around the bottles can&#8217;t hold as much moisture as warmer air, causing the moisture to condense. This matters because it will affect grip on the bottle, as well as potential to damage electronics you&#8217;re storing in the same bag as your water bottle if enough moisture is formed.</p>
<p>Every uninsulated bottle had condensation form on the outside of the bottle when there was cold water inside. Even the glass bottles with silicone covers had condensation form on top of the covers.</p>
<p>The amount of moisture was consistent between the bottles, but varied by day, depending on the humidity. If you plan to transport bottles with laptops or other electronics, the safest option is to use a vacuum insulated bottle or room temperature water.</p>
<h3>Usability test</h3>

<p>Each bottle went through usability testing, to see how it stood up to regular use.</p>
<p><strong>Ice:</strong> We wanted to know if it was possible to add ice and how easy it was to add water. We used standard ice cubes from a freezer&#8217;s automatic ice machine. About five of the bottles we tested didn&#8217;t have mouths wide enough for ice or for cleaning with brush. Some could only fit one at a time, while many wider mouth bottles could be filled with multiple cubes at once.</p>
<p><strong>Loops and grip:</strong> We took bottles out on trips over the course of a few weeks to test how easy each was to carry. Loops in the lid made it much easier to hold a bottle at the same time as groceries, bags or keys, whereas bottles without any loops forced you to dedicate a hand to it. Loops and clips make it easy to hang bottles from a backpack too.</p>
<p><strong>Cupholders:</strong> Larger bottles and most collapsible bottles we tested were not made to fit in cupholders. Most fit fine, but some barely made the cut. We tested the bottles in our cars for fit.</p>
<p><strong>Cleaning:</strong> Before the first use and after multiple refills, we washed each bottle by hand with a bottle brushing, hot water and dish soap. This proved fairly easy for most bottles, but a few caused problems with a spout that was too small, or just because the bottle was too long.</p>

<p>After testing a variety of sizes over the last three years, the best insulated bottle is from Klean Kanteen, either the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Klean-Kanteen-Insulated-Stainless-20-Ounce/dp/B004PXWG4G/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">20-ounce wide mouth</a> if you need a compact bottle or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SA2XNWW/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">32 ounce classic</a> if you want to keep beverages cold or hot all day long.</p>
<h3>A smaller insulated bottle</h3>
<p>The wide mouth of the 20-ounce made it easy to fill with ice and to drink out of, and its slim design made it easy to fit in cupholders and bottle compartments in most backpacks. The wider mouth is a slight compromise in insulation, but for a smaller bottle you might not notice the difference since you&#8217;ll be refilling long before your ice is gone.</p>

This rugged Kleen Kanteen also held up well when we subjected it to our drop test.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0093ISEPI/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>The big loop lid makes it easy to carry with a few fingers or loop onto bags with a carabiner. If you don&#8217;t care for this feature, wide mouth Klean Kanteen bottles can also take the totally leakproof <a href="http://www.kleankanteen.com/products/cafe-cap?variant=19736711878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cafe Cap 2.0</a> twist-open lid. We tested this design in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/#how-we-tested" rel="noopener">travel mug review</a>. We liked it better than cheap flip-up lids, though it&#8217;s not as good as other mugs for one-hand sipping and has a lot of parts to clean.</p>
<p>This bottle fared well in our drop tests with minimal damage to both the bottom and the lid. In the insulation tests it ranked 2nd for cold water, and 3rd for hot water. One downside of any steel bottle is that the mouth gets hot to the touch after letting it bake in the car on a hot day.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SA2XNWW?th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klean Kanteen-Classic 32-ounce</a> is a great water bottle for storing and sipping ice-cold water without as many refills. The opening is about half an inch narrower than the wide mouth on Klean Kanteen&#8217;s mug-size bottles, which means it&#8217;s a little more tricky to pack with ice, but still much easier than the wine-bottle shaped MIRA and S&#8217;WELL bottles.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re filling with ice water or some other beverage, this insulation will keep it cold (or hot) for longer than any wide-mouth bottle. Klean Kanteen also sells this same bottle design with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Klean-Kanteen-Insulated-Stainless-Growler/dp/B00X6ZNOAO" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">with a clamp-down growler lid</a> for filling up at your favorite micro-brewery. (The Growler model also works with the standard lid.)</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3122" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/KKvsHF.jpg" alt="four other insulated bottles we tested" width="900" height="596" /></p>
<h3>Hydro Flask vs. Klean Kanteen</h3>
<p>The 32 oz. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K5ZRUZ8/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hydro Flask</a> is a strong runner-up. Hydro Flask ranked 3rd in our cold water test and 4th in the original hot water test, but they&#8217;re a very close competitor for our top pick. The loop on the cap makes it easy to pick up with one finger if your hands are full carrying other things and the grip on the cap makes it easy to open and close the lid.</p>
<p>We interviewed loyalists for each brand, and they all have glowing accounts of how great the bottles are. They also rave about how easy it was to get a replacement cap or sometimes even a free replacement bottle after a dramatic accident.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between Klean Kanteen and Hydro Flask is in the availability of different neck shapes. Hydro Flask uses wide-mouth openings for sizes from 18 to 64 ounces, with the narrower &#8220;standard&#8221; mouth is only available in 18, 21 and 14 ounce bottles. Klean Kanteen has almost the opposite selection, with their &#8220;classic&#8221; narrow-mouth design available in sizes from 12 up to 64 ounces, with wide-mouth options in 12, 16 and 20 ounces.</p>
<p>Since the narrower mouth is better at insulating while still making ice fairly easy to add, and the 32 ounce Klean Kanteen is more affordable, we think Klean Kanteen has the edge overall. If you&#8217;re carrying a bottle packed with ice for sipping cold water on a hot day, the temperature difference is going to be less important and you should feel free to buy whichever bottle has the cap and styling you prefer.</p>
<p>Both of these brands also makes a spectrum of durable powder-coat colors that should satisfy anyone, but the availability of your favorite color might change from month to month. If you can&#8217;t find the color you like in stock, it&#8217;s probably worth checking the other brand.</p>

The 25 oz. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H9F72H1/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mira bottle</a> performed best in the cold water test. It likely gets a bump in performance due to its relatively small cap design &#8212; the main area where there isn&#8217;t vacuum insulation and where external temps would seep in.</p>
<p>The smaller opening of this bottle also comes with a downside though &#8212; it&#8217;s slightly awkward to drink out of since it&#8217;s sized perfectly to hit your nose with each sip. In the hot water test, it was not a surprise that the Mira ranked second. The 25 oz. bottle we tested was a bit on the larger side for cupholders, so if you opt for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0764P6DR2/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mira&#8217;s 17 oz. bottle</a> it would be a nicer fit.</p>

We also liked its latch mechanism, but unfortunately it's intended only for cold beverages (not hot liquids).</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E6O7CAC/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>As another great option geared for sports, we liked the 24 oz. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E6O7CAC/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Under Armour bottle</a>. It ranked fourth in our cold water test, but is by no means a poor performer given its other perks. This bottle features a spring-loaded flip cap and silicone grip makes it easy for one-handed operation while running or driving. It even has a latch to ensure the bottle stays locked during transport in your backpack or gym bag. One downside is the manufacturer says this bottle can&#8217;t be used with hot water, likely because of the plastic components in the lid.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GOF6TAU/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SIGG Thermo</a> performed best of the small bottles in our first hot water test, sadly, it&#8217;s becoming difficult to track down. Specifically designed for tea drinkers, the SIGG has a built in metal filter, if you won&#8217;t ever use that feature you can remove it for hot water or coffee. You have to separate the lid by unscrewing it which is not as simple as it should be, but it is an option. We looked at the larger versions in Sigg&#8217;s Classic series, but most owners agree they&#8217;re better as a thermos (using the cup that slides over the base of the bottle) than as a bottle to drink from.</p>

<p>Our top pick for glass bottles was the Takeya Classic 22 ounce. We loved the large cap threads around the top of the bottle, which makes it easy to open and close the cap without missing the threads.</p>
<p>This bold and simple design of the cap helps prevent it from damage when dropped too. In our drop tests there was minimal cap damage, and the silicone sleeve surprisingly prevented the bottle from shattering. The sleeve design on this bottle makes it easy to see the remaining water levels too.</p>

<p>Just like the other glass bottles we tested, there&#8217;s no insulation, but there&#8217;s also no lead or chemicals and it&#8217;s completely dishwasher safe. However, this bottle&#8217;s perfectly sized for easy holding and drinking, and the silicone grip makes it even more secure if you&#8217;re using it for sports.</p>

The silicone sleeve isn't just for looks — it also helped the Ello survive our impact tests.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BUUW476/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>We ranked the 20 oz. Ello bottle in a close second place, largely due to its simplicity. It gets the job done without features that are prone to issues. Like the Takeya, it has large threads in the cap for easy opening and closing of the lid. Its large loop on the cap lets you carry the bottle with multiple fingers, distributing the weight for comfortable carrying for longer periods of time.</p>
<p>This cap design also helped spread the impact nicely in our drop test that left no noticeable damage on the bottle. Like the other glass options, we have lots of options in silicone sleeve design and color too.</p>
<p>The little drinking spout on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B9DJWTM/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Life Factory</a> bottle might be convenient to some, but there was no other hole to let air in as you drink from it, so you basically have to waterfall from the little spout to take a sip. Although this bottle didn&#8217;t leak in our tests, the mini spout cap is very prone to popping off so you don&#8217;t want to throw this into a bag that you can&#8217;t keep an eye on.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007L6953Y/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CamelBak&#8217;</a> storable straw doesn&#8217;t have issues with potential leaks because it is easily folded back when not in use. The uncentered design of the cap loop can affect the outcome of a drop depending on how it happens to be dropped, but in our testing it fared well. The CamelBak is a well-designed bottle overall that&#8217;s easy to use, but the straw makes it pretty difficult to ensure a proper cleaning, putting it further down on our list.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard for the short <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PV9Y72W/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bKr bottle</a> to go unnoticed &#8212; it looks very well designed! This one&#8217;s basically famous for being used by celebrities and being covered in magazines. When we bought it, the price was $35; this is an astounding 2-3x the cost of the other glass options. The slanted cap made screwing the cap on particularly difficult, and the small spout makes it impossible to fit any ice or a bottle brush. The bKr bottle is definitely a design-centric purchase if you&#8217;re willing to put up with its issues and price tag.</p>
<h2 id="best-stainless-steel-water-bottle">Best Stainless Steel: Klean Kanteen &#8211; Classic</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3081 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen.jpg" alt="best stainless steel bottle" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The Klean Kanteen was an easy #1 pick out of the three finalists. The mouth was much bigger, easier to fill with ice and water and more pleasant to drink from. It also had a cap with bigger threads to more easily open and close the bottle.</p>
<p>Its lid was the best of the steel bottles we tested, but a bit squeaky sounding and not as smooth in opening and closing as the insulated or glass bottles. For those who want options, this brand has many cap options you can buy separately, like a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0083F0TQ4/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">sport cap</a> or a sippy cap.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079911D89/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Stainless Steel: Kleen Kanteen - Classic</h3><p>Large cap threads, a mid-size and a polished design make the Kleen Kanteen - Classic a pleasure to drink from. This bottle also uses high-quality materials that make it seem more polished than our other contenders.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079911D89/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>You also can&#8217;t really appreciate the importance of the bottle&#8217;s mouth size until you&#8217;re trying to aim it under your fridge&#8217;s water dispenser. Klean Kanteen sells a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F3JJDBA/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">version of this bottle with a mouth that&#8217;s even wider</a>, but the classic is noticeably wider than the other two bottles we tested. It&#8217;s easy to sip from, but still easy for adding ice, too. All three stainless steel bottles are very basic products and similar in concept, but the Klean Kanteen is built with better materials and feels like a more polished product, making it our clear winner in this category.</p>
<h3>The other metal bottles we tested</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3119" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles.jpg" alt="two other stainless steel bottles we tested" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The bottom of all of these bottles were dented in our drop test, which caused a few to wobble on the table. However, all remained leakproof afterwards. None of these were made to insulate liquids, and all had condensation running down the outside. These are a good cheap route to go if you just need to keep water cold for shorts amount of time.</p>
<p>The aluminum <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006PTIVTW/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SIGG</a> bottle is lightweight, but it has a tiny cap and threads. This made for a slightly clumsy opening and closing, and was the only bottle in this category that couldn&#8217;t fit ice in the mouth unless it was crushed. The aluminum dented slightly on the bottom in our drop test but still sat perfectly flat on a table. Even though it can&#8217;t fit ice, this bottle felt a little more polished than the Cheeki bottle.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BYGAAUE/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cheeki</a> was the largest stainless steel bottle we tested, perhaps contributing to the amount it was dented in our drop test. This bottle was noticeably uneven and even wobbled on the table after this test. Its mouth was large enough to fit ice cubes in, but the usage of the flip top lid is a bit awkward because of its small size and poor design. In terms of quality of materials, this bottle was easily the worst when you examine the cap material, design, and loop material.</p>

<p>We loved the Thermos &#8211; Intak, ranking it our top plastic water bottle. The flip top lid and single-handed use were pretty big factors that helped set this model apart. It&#8217;s tough to beat that convenience.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This bottle&#8217;s the only one that has a textured design built into the bottle to help improve grip &#8212; great for when you&#8217;re using this for sports since this bottle builds up condensation with cold water inside. </span></p>

The spout has a cap that locks into the lid, which is a bit difficult to snap in each time, but it works to keep it out of the way. This bottle features a loop that keeps the lid attached to the bottle when you remove the lid for refilling too, something not present on the Embrava or Contigo or Thermos.</p>
<p>Although the the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B011LC85PM/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Embrava</a> and the Contigo also had single-handed operation, the Embrava was slightly on the small side, with six ounces less capacity than the top ranking Thermos. Embrava&#8217;s next size up is a whopping 32 ounce bottle, which is a bit on the large side. However, we appreciated the spout&#8217;s added air vent in the cap for easier drinking. The flip cap was surprisingly strong in our drop test too. If you prefer a slightly smaller bottle than the Thermos and can get past Embrava&#8217;s design aesthetics, this was a close runner up.</p>
<p>Both the CamelBak and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NCDE8Y/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Nalgene</a> had large threads for an easy opening lid and a wide mouth for cleaning and adding ice. However, the Nalgene had pretty bad plastic smell, even after a few washes. It looks like many other owners of this bottle had this issue too, although many reported no smells. Perhaps they vary by bottle or manufacturing batch, but this factor, combined with a very cheap looking lid, pushed this bottle further down our list.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A74ZU18/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo Autoseal</a> has a unique button you hold on the back to open the drinking spout. This bottle was leakproof when the button isn&#8217;t held, but it&#8217;s far too easy for that button to be pressed when thrown into a bag. Having to put your mouth on the bottle proved to be a little weird, and almost like a toddler&#8217;s sippy cup, but it has an air valve so you can drink without having to waterfall.</p>
<p>These bottles are not for hot beverages. If you&#8217;re looking for a hot beverage bottle take a look at our vacuum insulated stainless steel pick above. All five bottles we tested were made of the copolyester, Tritan, which is a trademark of Eastman Chemical Company. This material is popular because it&#8217;s impact resistant, free of BPAs, as well as estrogenic and androgenic activity. However,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> every bottle we tested, including the collapsible plastic bottles, were made from BPA-free plastic.</span></p>

<p>Our top pick was the Vapur &#8211; Element bottle. This bottle has a flip-top cap for easy access, but it also closes securely with an audible click and will not pop off accidentally in your bag. The Vapur and the Tap were the only two we tested with mouths wide enough for ice cubes and for a brush to fit inside for thorough cleaning.</p>

It's durable and made with quality materials. We also like its vibrant color options.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007UU6JI0/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>This was a 0.7L model, and you can get the most of that capacity by first blowing up the bag to expand it before adding water. Materials and construction on this bottle are excellent and should last for many years of use. In addition, it&#8217;s light weight and easily folded, which makes it great for taking on runs, hikes, or stowing away into luggage or carryons when traveling.</p>
<h3>The other collapsible water bottles we tested</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3121" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles.jpg" alt="three other collapsible bottles we tested" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Our second pick for collapsible bottles was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B575B96/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Tap</a>, which was sold in a pack of two. Like the Vapur, it has high quality construction and has a wide mouth for ice cubes and for cleaning with a bottle brush. Cleaning is much harder without a wide mouth since it wouldn&#8217;t clean well in a dishwasher. This bottle has a carabiner for convenience, but is only pushed to second place because lack of a convenient spout when compared to the Vapur.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012H5QDYW/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aquabod</a> is a unique bottle since you can roll it up, secure it, then stash in your gym bag or backpack until you&#8217;re ready to use it. It&#8217;s also the only collapsible one we tested made of silicone. The bottle has a neat spout designed to limit how much water comes out, but both the cap and the carabiner felt cheap compared to the others.</p>
<p>Although all these bottles have some flop to them when you drink, the Aquabod was extra floppy since there&#8217;s less structure to it, forcing you to use two hands to drink most of the time. The flop also makes it difficult (but not impossible) to put this bottle into a backpack&#8217;s bottle pocket, making clipping with the carabiner the way to go.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t need a carabiner, you might appreciate the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0076ZSR3Y/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Platypu</a>&#8216; more utilitarian design, and slim center for easier handling. Its mouth was too small for ice or a cleaning brush, so you might have to boil it or do lots of manual shaking to get it clean. The only reason to go with a Platypus is to utilize the push-pull cap option they have. For us, we would rather just go with the Tap bottle with a carabiner and wider mouth.</p>
<p>All bottles had a slight smell &#8212; plastic or otherwise, before the first wash. You might have to wash it a few times or soak it in vinegar and water to get rid of most of the smell and taste. If you&#8217;re very sensitive to smells, you may want to consider another bottle material altogether.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">The bottom line</h2>
<p>What better way to stay hydrated throughout the day and your workouts than by bringing along a bottle? There are so many <em>types</em> of water bottles and seemingly endless varieties within those that it helps to narrow down your search first.</p>
<p>We found it best to start your search by thinking about what you&#8217;ll be using the bottle for most.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ll be stowing a bottle in a bag which may contain electronics or other moisture-sensitive items you want to keep away from condensation, a vacuum insulated bottle is the best option for you. Specifically our top pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004PXWG4G/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klean Kanteen</a>. This is the only type of bottle suitable for hot beverages. This bottle is also our overall top pick too, because of its wide mouth design and easy usability and maintenance. This brand also has some well-loved lid options to fit your needs like the new <a href="http://www.kleankanteen.com/collections/accessories/products/cafe-cap?variant=19736711878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cafe Cap 2.0</a>, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0093IKZGY/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Flip D-Ring</a> lid.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re on the move or prefer something lighter, something made of plastic might be the best fit for you. For extreme portability at the cost of some utility, our top pick for collapsible bottles was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007UU6JI0/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vapur Element</a>. If you&#8217;re just hitting the gym or just want something lightweight and convenient to use at your desk, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002VJX4C4/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos Intak</a>.</p>
<p>Although all the plastic bottles we tested were BPA-free, some still had an odd smell. If you&#8217;re particularly sensitive to that kind of thing and don&#8217;t care about insulation, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EAIW5MY/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klean Kanteen &#8211; Classic stainless steel bottle</a> is a good option for you, thanks to its wider-than-normal mouth and easy-to-use loop cap.</p>
<p>And if you don&#8217;t mind a little weight and like the clear look and vibrant designs that come with glass bottles, then we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003DTLNY2/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Takeya Classic</a>. Glass is totally safe for the dishwasher, and is void of any smells or concerns about chemicals and tastes we have with the other bottles. Even if you&#8217;re a bit of a klutz, our tests showed these all are capable of surviving a few drops.</p>
