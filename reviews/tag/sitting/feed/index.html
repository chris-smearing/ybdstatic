				<description><![CDATA[We tested the highest rated and most popular flip chairs and selected Your Zone Bed as the best flip chair. It's the most comfortable and easiest to convert from a living room chair to a bed for overnight guests.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e tested the highest-rated flip chairs to find out which one was the most versatile and comfortable. We chose <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L6YW0YI/?tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Your Zone Bed</a> as the best flip chair. Its flexible frame cushioned by quality foam allows you to transform a compact, upright chair into a lounger and, when needed for overnight guests, a futon-like bed that both adults and kids will find comfortable and supportive.</p>

<h2 id="what-is">What is a flip chair?</h2>
<p>A flip chair is also known as a convertible or folding bed mattress. It’s composed of a repositionable metal frame, covered with a thin layer of polyurethane foam or polyester fiber and encased within a layer of foam that’s generally four inches thick. The frame and foam are fit into a polyester cover, similar to a cushioned patio lounger. The cover is usually removable for cleaning.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23578" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1335" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-1000x668@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-768x513.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-885x591.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-810x541.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-1000x668.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-320x214.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-885x591@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-320x214@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>When laid out completely flat on the floor, the frame can be used as a temporary bed for overnight guests or for kids&#8217; sleepover. The frame is divided into three sections, which allow you to fold it up into a lounger with a head rest or a compact chair that can fit in a small living area or bedroom. Since the folded-up chair has no legs — usually just non-skid feet — it’s usually only about 8 inches up off the floor.</p>
<p>Flip chairs are popular with students who have small dorm rooms or people who live in studio apartments, where space is limited. They’re also great for kids’ sleepovers or for just hanging out and watching television or gaming.</p>
<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected flip chairs to test</h2>
<p>Despite flip chairs’ popularity with students and parents, there aren’t many manufacturers who make them. Some high-end furniture companies sell their version of a flip chair, but they’re more expensive than what you can find online.</p>
<p>Flip chairs are available in several sizes, but we focused our search on the standard size, which is 6-½ feet long when completely flat and 28 inches wide. That&#8217;s narrower than a twin-size bed, but similar to a camping bed. (Some Amazon reviewers of flip chairs actually do take them on camping trips, since they fit inside a tent and are more comfortable than sleeping on hard ground on a pad or sleeping bag.) The standard flip chair size is the one that’s most often purchased for dorm rooms and sleepovers, as it can be easily stored and unfolded when needed.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, flip chairs can be pricey. Although they’re not constructed of expensive materials, and sometimes the foam is not the highest quality, flip chairs can be priced at $200 or higher. We selected four flip chairs that are in the more reasonable $100 range.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L6YW0YI/?tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Your Zone Bed</a> flip chair is very similar to the other flip chairs we tested, but it’s a lot more comfortable. Its metal frame is sandwiched between two thick layers of foam, which cushion the bottom of the flip chair when it’s folded out flat. This extra foam gave an additional measure of comfort when we tested it as a bed. Also, the upper half of the foam is covered with a polyester-fiber mesh that softens the rough texture of the foam.</p>
<p>Much like other flip beds, Your Zone’s ultra-suede cover has two zippered sections: A long middle section and a headrest. None of the flip chairs’ covers have a zipper on the lower third. Consequently, the middle and upper sections can be machine washed, and the lower third can only be spot-cleaned. This section should be less prone to getting stained, but it&#8217;s something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Your Zone has five positions, which are adjusted by lifting the headrest until it locks into place. To unfold it, the headrest is pushed down to the middle section and released. When flat, Your Zone’s frame has a slight curvature that flattens when you lie down. This buckle gives the foam added flexibility, so it feels somewhat like a bed mattress.</p>

<p>For the next position, the headrest needs to be folded over, creating a pillow (albeit, a hard one), which shortens the 6-½ foot bed by 14 inches. This second position was always the most uncomfortable with all of the flip beds we tested.</p>
<p>Third and fourth positions turn the flip chair into a lounger, which is ideal for watching television or gaming. Both give good back support, but the fourth position is a bit more elevated and more comfortable.</p>
<p>For the fifth position, the headrest is fully upright, and the bottom third folds up and onto the middle section, transforming it into a chair. It’s low to the ground, but Your Zone’s flexible foam has some give to it like sofa cushions, and we found it to be the most comfy for watching TV.</p>
<p>The Your Zone Bed flip chair is priced comparably with the other flip chairs we tested — a little over $100 — but we found it to be better constructed for comfort. If you’re looking for a versatile piece of furniture for a small space or a sleepover, this is the flip chair you should get.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Your Zone Bed flip chair is a versatile piece of furniture that can change from a comfy chair to a temporary fold-out bed anywhere and any time an extra bed is needed.</li>
<li>It’s priced about the same as other flip chairs, but it’s better constructed for comfort.</li>
<li>The Your Zone Bed flip chair is great for a dorm room or studio apartment where space is limited or for kids’ sleepovers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best Choice Products &#8211; SKY1814</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VQYBXV4/?tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Best Choice Products</a> flip chair has a substantial frame that resembles a lawn or patio lounge chair. It has a pristine polyurethane foam that feels like memory foam and looks brand new. However, when the flip chair is laid flat into the bed position, the foam has an odd crunchy texture and crackles when it’s pressed down.</p>
<p>Although the Best Choice was comfortable as a bed and as an upright chair, there was no flexibility in its foam or frame, which made every other position uncomfortable. Its small non-skid feet needed to be screwed into the frame, which wasn’t difficult to do. However, the feet are screwed through the bottom of the chair’s cover, so should you ever need to wash it, the feet need to be unscrewed first; a design feature we found inconvenient.</p>

<p>In appearance, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IR61GL0/z/tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Giantex</a> is almost identical to the Your Zone Bed and Best Choice Products. It has five adjustable positions, a removable ultra-suede cover (erroneously advertised as cotton) and is approximately the same length, height and width. Three of its five positions, however, were hard and unyielding — even napping on it was unpleasant.</p>
<p>When we inspected underneath the cover, we discovered that its frame is a metal checkerboard shape, which may account for why it’s such an uncomfortable chair/bed. More disturbing was the condition of the foam: Dirty with debris and wood bits, as though it had been dragged along a factory floor. Clearly, Giantex doesn’t use high-quality foam for its overpriced product.</p>
<h3>Magshion &#8211; FCOF27</h3>
<p>Described as a folding bed mattress, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LS1OXEO/?tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Magshion</a> flip chair is actually just a foldable futon. Its polyurethane foam is divided into three equal sections and covered with a polyester-cotton cover that’s available in sixteen colors. It’s slightly shorter and narrower than other flip beds, and since it has no frame, the Magshion can’t be used as a chair unless you’re leaning up against a couch or wall.</p>
<p>It’s available in five sizes, and although the single size that we tested was $80, the other sizes are absurdly expensive for what’s little more than a lawn-furniture pad.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>A flip chair is a fun and convenient furniture option for a small room or apartment. Although their metal frames are sturdy, the foam will lose its density over time, so we wouldn’t recommend replacing a bed mattress with a flip chair. However, it’s great for short-term use or sleepovers, and we like how the flip chair can be transformed in seconds from a lounger to an upright chair.</p>
<p>The best flip chair that we tested is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L6YW0YI/?tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Your Zone Bed</a>. Its flexible frame sandwiched between thick foam proved to be comfortable in all of its five adjustable positions. Whether you want to nap, hang out with friends or just lounge around with your dog or cat, the versatile Your Zone Bed flip chair will suit your needs.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected sit-up pillows to test</h2>
<p>A sit-up pillow really has one purpose: give you back support while you’re reading or watching television in bed or on a couch. But after we read through Amazon consumer reviews, we learned that people also buy sit-up pillows to sit upright in bed after surgery or to help relieve chronic back pain.</p>
<p>The sit-up pillows we decided to test were recommended by reviewers for correcting posture while they were lounging to support back and neck muscles. But the pillows had to be comfortable, too; nobody enjoys sitting against a hard piece of foam.</p>
<p>We chose pillows that were stuffed with shredded memory foam, since it can be both firm and plush at the same time. People who buy a sit-up pillow for back pain often buy a bed wedge pillow, so we tested one of the most popular wedge pillows to see how it compared to traditional sit-up bed pillows</p>

<p>Many of the hundreds of models and styles of sit-up pillows look identical. During our testing we discovered that they’re not all alike. The following features of the best sit-up pillow will help you decide which one is right for you.</p>
<p><b>Size: </b>Most sit-up pillows have a similar shape: triangular with two armrests on each side. If you’re looking for a sit-up pillow that gives you both lower and upper back support, you’ll need one that is as tall as your entire back: The top of the pillow should reach your shoulders at the base of your neck. A shorter sit-up pillow will only support your lower back muscles, and you’ll feel the strain on your upper back muscles after a few minutes.</p>
<p>Two of the pillows we tested are available in several sizes. Before purchasing a sit-up pillow, we recommend measuring the length of your back and comparing it to the height of the pillow. We found that the extra-large size (24 inches) gives better back support to a tall person than the standard size (18 inches) does.</p>
<p><b>Long armrests: </b>Many sit-up pillows have short, stubby armrests that only reach as far as your elbows. Depending on the length of your arms, the short armrests may not even touch your elbows, which means you need to keep your arms elevated when you’re reading. Look for a sit-up pillow that has armrests that reach the base of your wrists. The extra length will support your elbows so you can hold a book and also cushion your arms when you’re watching television or just resting.</p>
<p><b>Materials: </b>All of the sit-up pillows we tested had a polyester cover, usually an ultra-suede or velour. Except for one of the pillows we tested, their covers can be removed and washed.</p>
<p>The best sit-up pillow is stuffed with shredded memory foam, which is often encased within its own separate cover. As we discussed in our reviews for the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-cooling-pillow/#important-features">best cooling pillow</a> and the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-pillow-for-side-sleepers/#features">best pillow for side sleepers</a>, the memory foam should be CertiPUR-certified. <a href="https://certipur.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CertiPUR</a> tests polyurethane foams used in bedding for hazardous contaminants. Look for a label on the sit-up pillow that it’s been CertiPUR certified; otherwise, you could be breathing in toxic gases emitted from the foam.</p>
<h2 id="prepping">Prepping a sit-up pillow</h2>
<p>Many Amazon consumers are surprised that their sit-up pillow isn’t ready for immediate use when it’s delivered. Manufacturers compress the sit-up pillow, roll it and vacuum-seal it in plastic before shipping. When the pillow arrives, it needs to be released from the plastic, laid out flat and, as suggested by instructions, allowed to expand 24 to 48 hours.</p>
<p>We found, however, that the pillows fully expanded overnight. Although it’s not stated, we suspect that the 24-to-48-hour time period is to allow for off-gassing. Memory foam is notorious for its pungent chemical odor, which eventually dissipates. Since the majority of sit-up pillows are stuffed with memory foam, it’s best practice to let the pillow air out — we aired the test pillows on an outdoor patio — for two or three days.</p>
<h2 id="best">Best Sit-Up Pillow: Linenspa</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073DJFYB1/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Linenspa</a> was, by far, the most comfortable sit-up pillow we tested. Stuffed with shredded CertiPUR-certified memory foam, the Linenspa feels supportive and plush at the same time. Imagine your most comfy chair or sofa, and you’ll get a sense of what it’s like to settle into the Linenspa.</p>
<p>We tested the generously stuffed extra-large size, which gave full-back support while we sat in bed. The Linenspa has long (15 inches) and extra-wide (10 inches) armrests — the widest of all the pillows we tested — and they accommodated our forearms all the way to the palms of our hands.</p>
<p>The Linenspa is well made with strong stitching and thick fabric that’s been dyed a richly hued deep blue. (It’s also available in stone gray.) Unlike the other pillows we tested, the Linenspa doesn’t have a zipper for removing the cover. After testing, however, we decided that being able to remove the cover isn’t important, because once it’s been washed, the cover will shrink somewhat and be difficult to stuff the pillow back inside, especially into the armrests.</p>
<p>The Linenspa has a strong handle so we could easily drag it from the bedroom to the living room. We tested it on the couch, and it was slightly less comfortable, because its size takes up half the space of the sofa cushion. But once we shifted our position and sat more upright — as we were supposed to do — we never wanted to leave.</p>

Stuffed with CertiPUR-certified memory foam, we detected almost no unpleasant odors while using it.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073DJFYB1/?tag=sitpil-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Finally, we tried the Linenspa while sitting on the floor. Although the pillow does stay upright on its own, you do need to lean up against something if you want to use it for support. We did this same test with the other pillows, and we simply didn’t find any of them comfortable on the floor.</p>
<p>There was almost no off-gassing from this pillow, and although some Amazon reviewers complain about a heavy dye odor, we detected no strong smells from it.</p>
<p>The Linenspa is priced at $50, which is about average for a quality sit-up pillow. For $10 less, It’s also available in a smaller size, which is about one-third the size of the extra-large. For children and teens that size makes sense. The extra-large is quite heavy to lug around, so the standard size might also be better for the elderly who are bed-ridden.</p>
<p>Unlike the other pillows we tested, the Linenspa feels exceptionally durable. It supports upper and lower back and corrects posture while cushioning you in comfort.</p>
<p><b>Key takeways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Linenspa provides full support to upper and lower back and is also the most comfortable of the pillows we tested.</li>
<li>Its filling is made of shredded CertiPUR-certified memory foam, so it’s safe from hazardous contaminants.</li>
<li>The Linenspa’s armrests are extra-long and extra-wide, so you can rest the entire length of your arm.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the standard size <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0733ZCSR9/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Milliard reading pillow</a> is too small for a tall person, it gives excellent support to middle- and lower-back muscles. It looks and feels like a floppy stuffed toy, so we were surprised at how firm the Milliard was when we propped it against the bed headboard and couch cushion. Although its dangling arms barely extended past our elbows, we gathered them to our sides and comfortably rested our arms on them.</p>
<p>The Milliard is stuffed with shredded CertiPUR-certified memory foam, and if you want a firmer pillow, Milliard will send additional filling upon request. It has a soft polyester velour cover, which can be removed for washing or spot-cleaning.</p>

The standard size is too small for a tall person, but the extra-large size is just right.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0733ZCSR9/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Milliard is available in two additional sizes: petite (14-inches tall) for a child and extra large (24-inches tall) for a tall person. The Milliard runs about $10 more than the Linenspa for the extra-large size, but it&#8217;s also a quality sit-up pillow that we recommend.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Milliard may seem too soft and floppy, but it gives surprisingly good support to middle- and lower-back muscles.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s stuffed with CertiPUR-certified memory foam, so you can feel confident it won&#8217;t emit toxic gases.</li>
<li>The Milliard extra-large size is $10 more than the Linenspa, but it&#8217;s also an excellent option.</li>
</ul>

<h3>mittaGonG</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GJBW5ZM//tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">mittaGonG reading pillow</a> gave good support to the lower back muscles, but because it’s only 20-inches high (the only size available) and not generously stuffed near the top, it can’t reach the upper back or neck. We found the mittaGong comfortable for watching television in bed, because we could lean back against the headboard. However, because of its short armrests, it was tiring to keep our elbows propped up to hold a book up for more than 10 minutes.</p>
<p>The mittaGonG seemed well made with a nice velour case and strong stitching. It’s stuffed with shredded memory foam, but it’s not CertiPUR-certified. Without the CertiPUR certification, you can’t trust what gasses might be emitted from the mittaGonG’s memory foam.</p>
<h3>Hit Notion &#8211; Husband Pillow</h3>
<p>Most reading pillows are known as “husband pillows,” apparently because they provide security, comfort and support. (Recently they’ve been renamed “boyfriend pillows.”) Hit Notion’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WLBH2T/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Husband Pillow</a> is one of the most popular on Amazon and is available in a rainbow of colors. It’s about the same size as the mittaGonG pillow, so it gives good lower-back support. A detachable neck roll is included, and it bolsters the neck but not the upper back.</p>
<p>The Husband Pillow’s armrests were splayed too far apart, so we could only rest our elbows and no other part of our arms comfortably. It’s a well-constructed pillow, and style-wise, we liked the two large buttons that connect the head roll to the top of the pillow. The Husband Pillow is also stuffed with shredded memory foam, and like the mittaGonG pillow, it’s not CertiPUR certified.</p>
<h3>X-tra Comfort Bed Wedge</h3>
<p>The bed wedge is popular with people who suffer chronic back pain, since its wedge shape promotes a completely upright posture and spine alignment. However, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U6HMK78//tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">X-tra Comfort</a> bed wedge is a misnomer, since it was the most uncomfortable of the pillows we tested. The bed wedge is designed solely for the bed; on the couch it was like leaning against a wood plank.</p>
<p>The X-tra Comfort wedge is made of two extra-stiff pieces of memory foam (not shredded, not CertiPUR), covered in a cheap-feeling velour case. The large wedge is intended for back support; the purpose for the smaller wedge is a mystery. The company’s website shows photos of placing the wedges under the model’s knees. We tried it, but elevating legs and feet as illustrated put strain on the lower back.</p>
<p>It’s also suggested that the wedge can be used as a sleeping pillow. Perhaps, if you enjoy sleeping on a rock. There are a number of bed wedges on the market, so pass this one by.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you love reading in bed, binging on Netflix or just lounging around on a lazy Sunday morning, you might be bolstering yourself up with extra pillows, which can strain your back muscles and neck.</p>
<p>We selected the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073DJFYB1/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Linenspa</a> as the best sit-up pillow for providing full-back support and cushy comfort. Its extra-long and extra-wide armrests support your entire arm rather than just the elbow, and it’s the only pillow we tested that was so plush we never wanted to get up. The Linenspa is well made with quality fabric and strong stitching, and at $50 for the extra-large size you’re definitely getting your money’s worth.</p>
<p>We also liked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0733ZCSR9/?tag=ybdsitpil" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Milliard</a> reading pillow, which feels soft and floppy but gives excellent support to the middle- and lower-back muscles. The standard size is too small for a tall person, and though its extra-large size is $10 more than the Linenspa, it&#8217;s also a great option for providing full back support in bed or on the couch.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We tested the top kid and adult bean bag chairs for durability, comfort and style and found that the Lumaland was the coziest and sturdiest. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent four weeks rigorously chilling, cuddling and sleeping on eight of the top-selling bean bag chairs on the market. We tested durability, washed the covers and researched safety of filling materials and in the end, found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073VQSJ45/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lumaland &#8211; Luxury Bean Bag Chair</a> to be the best bean bag chair. Lumaland stood out because of its shredded foam filling and quality microsuede cover. All our testers loved this bag’s back support and how easy it was to change the cover making machine washing a breeze. For a kid-sized bean bag, we found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008AE0WV0/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Big Joe &#8211; Dorm Bean Bag Chair</a> stood out from the competition because of its comfort, easy-to-clean cover and lightweight design.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We began our research by consulting online reviews from respected retailers like Amazon, Target and Walmart. User reviews from these sites were used to find out which features are important to consumers, and to determine the leading bean bag chair brands. We also read subreddits such as /r/furniture/, where consumers discussed which bean bag chairs had proved to be good purchases.</p>
<p>After determining which bean bags received a high number of positive user reviews, we narrowed down our list by excluding luxury bean bags that were over $200. We excluded luxury bean bags because our research found similar enthusiasm from reviewers for luxury and midrange ($50-$150) versions, so we chose bean bags that would deliver the most value.</p>
<p>Next we researched technical components of bean bag filling materials. We found the two most popular filling materials were polystyrene beads or shredded foam. It was important that our list of finalists contain bean bags filled with both types of material, so that we could put the two most popular materials to the test.</p>

<p><b>Filling material</b>: All of our bean bag finalists were filled with either a type of expandable polystyrene (EPS) bead or shredded foam. EPS is the same material used in disposable coffee cups and packaging peanuts. It is a good material for bean bag chairs because it is lightweight and can hold its form for several years.</p>
<p>EPS is not biodegradable, but EPS beads may be recycled. Bean bags that use recycled EPS beads have a shorter lifespan than those that use non-recycled EPS beads. Unfortunately, this means that consumers who want to “go green” and use recycled EPS beads may end up having to refill their bean bags sooner than those who opt for non-recycled EPS beads.</p>
<p>Only one of the bean bag chairs we tested specified whether its EPS beads were made from recycled or non-recycled material. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008AE0WV0/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Big Joe &#8211; Dorm</a> uses <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0055DXQS0/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Megahh Beads</a>, which is Big Joe’s proprietary formula. The company claims this material has no recycled components. Our other bean bag chairs did not specify whether their EPS beads were made with recycled or new material.</p>
<p>Shredded foam is also popular as bean bag chair filling because of its high density and comfort. This is a heavier material that often requires the consumer to break apart large foam pieces by massaging the foam within a cover. If the foam is not broken up enough, irregular-shaped foam chunks can be uncomfortable when sitting. However, when broken in correctly, this material provides a high degree of comfort.</p>
<p><b>Cover material:</b> Durability, comfort and style are all important considerations when choosing a bean bag cover. We tested bean bags with microsuede, cotton, vinyl and polyester coverings — all durable materials that minimize tearing and bleaching.</p>
<p>Half of the bean bags we tested had removable covers which could be washed or switched with ease. This removability is especially important for microsuede or cotton covers, which are best cleaned in the washing machine. Spot cleaning is often adequate for bean bag chairs with vinyl or polyester covers.</p>

<p>Removable bean bag covers use zippers, therefore zipper quality is very important to the overall removability of the cover. More secure bean bags use double zipper systems that ensure the bean bag cover does not gradually slide open.</p>
<p><b>Size: </b>How much floor space are you willing to devote to your bean bag chair? Bean bags are available in a wide variety of sizes. Typically, child-sized bean bag chairs are under three feet wide, while adult bean bags usually range from four to six feet.</p>
<p><b>Structure</b>: The traditional bean bag is a structureless bag of beads, but there are now more options for those who want a more structured seat. Structured components such as armrests and cup holders may be especially desirable for those planning to use their bean bag chair for long periods of time, such as gamers.</p>
<p><b>Weight</b>: Our testers lugged bean bags up and down stairs, so trust us, lightweight bean bags are a plus. While lightweight bean bags filled with EPS beads make life easier when rearranging furniture, heavier foam can provide more comfort to some users.</p>
<p><b>Aesthetics</b>: The wide range of bean bag covers available means that a bean bag can be a stylish component to a room. Brainstorm which colors and textures would work in your space before beginning your bean bag chair quest.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bean-bag-testing.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Our bean bag finalists were cuddled, squished, bounced and kicked during four weeks of rigorous comfort testing by six different testers. Our testers incorporated all eight bean bags into their daily life. A comfort questionnaire was completed after the first and fourth week of use, so that any changes in the bean bag’s comfort would be noticed. In addition to comfort testing, we also took careful notes on the ease of each bean bag’s assembly and how easy it was to wash the cover.</p>
<h3>Assembly and sizing</h3>
<p>All of the shredded foam bean bags required an inner bag full of foam material to be broken apart and then put inside a cover. This assembly was simple, taking only about five to ten minutes. Foam bean bags take three to seven days for the foam to completely expand. During this period we sat, fluffed and flipped over bean bags multiple times to ensure foam was completely expanded before comfort testing.</p>
<p>The bean bag chairs filled with EPS beads did not require assembly. However, the majority of our testers noted that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F8FM7ZC/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ECR4Kids &#8211; Classic</a> felt like it needed more beads than it came with. If you find your bean bag chair a bit “deflated,” additional <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bean-Bag-Refill-Beans/dp/B00AZWPAJE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1526947541&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bean+bag+beads" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EPS beads</a> can be purchased online and added to your bean bags at home.</p>
<p>At the end of week one and week four, each bean bag’s widest and tallest dimensions were taken. We gathered this information to see if the bean bags would lose their structure or flatten out after intense use. Encouragingly, none of our bean bag finalists’ dimensions changed significantly. However, EPS beads usually lose their structure over the course of the first five years, so if you buy this type of bean bag you may need to purchase bead refills at a later point.</p>
<h3>Comfort</h3>
<p>During week one and week four of comfort testing, testers answered questions regarding neck and back comfort, how easy getting in and out of the chair was, presence of any off-gassing odor and overall quality of the bean bag. The testing revealed no significant changes to any of the bean bags’ comfort over the course of four weeks. The most significant difference noted by our testers was the dissipation of initial chemical odors from packaging.</p>
<p>During the course of our testing, we found that our testers were split on whether they preferred EPS beads or foam filling. If you are not able to test which filling material you prefer, we recommend considering whether you want a lightweight or stationary bean bag chair. Bean bags filled with EPS beads are much easier to move, while foam bean bags stay put like other classic furniture pieces.</p>
<p>Both musty and chemical odors were noted by our testers for multiple bean bags in our week one comfort testing. However, these off-gassing odors disappeared for most of our finalists by week four. The noted exception to this was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B015QJJJHY/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fugu &#8211; 4XL</a>, which maintained a very musty, “cardboardy” smell over the course of the four weeks. This odor was most likely due to the fact that the bean bag’s foam exploded from its package while it was being shipped. Further, we were unable to wash this bean bag’s cover because of a foam leak. The Fugu, like the other foam bean bags, came with its foam filling in a polyester inner lining that is then placed within an outer cover. This inner lining is not meant to be broken, however the Fugu’s sprung a leak.</p>

<p>Half of the bean bags we tested had removable covers that we washed in a washing machine.

As previously noted, we were unable to remove the Fugu’s cover because of a breakage in its inner lining.</p>
<p>The EPS bean bags did not have removable covers. Instead these brands recommended that the bags be spot cleaned as needed. We found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F8FM7ZC/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ECR4Kids &#8211; Classic</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008AE0WV0/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Big Joe &#8211; Dorm</a> models were exceptionally easy to spot clean because of their resilient vinyl and polyester covers.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073VQSJ45/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lumaland &#8211; Luxury Bean Bag Chair</a> ranked highest for comfort with all but one of our testers, plus it has an easy-to-remove cover and no odor. Our testers loved Lumaland’s shredded foam filling and microsuede cover. This bean bag’s price tag is under $200, meaning you can get a quality bean bag without breaking the bank.</p>
<p>The Lumaland is four feet wide, a size our testers found to be comfortable for one adult. It is also available in three foot and five foot diameters. Our testers ranked the Lumaland as one of the easiest bean bags to get out of due to its taller height at around 28 inches.</p>

<p>Straight out of the box, the Lumaland had no musty foam or packaging odor. Like other foam bean bag chairs, the Lumaland’s assembly requires foam contained in an inner polyester lining to be broken up and placed in its outer cover. While the foam had already puffed up slightly during shipping, breaking up the rest of the foam was quick and easy.</p>
<p>The Lumaland’s zipper quality made the cover easy to remove and replace, even when the inner foam was completely broken apart. This means cleaning the Lumaland is no problem for anyone with a washing machine.</p>
<p>The Lumaland’s foam filling makes it heavier than other EPS filled bean bags. This bean bag’s heaviness and quality means it is meant to be a more-or-less stationary furniture item.</p>
<p>Lumaland offers eight different color options for this bag’s microsuede covers. Half of these colors could be described as mature neutrals, meaning the Lumaland looks at home in an adult bedroom or living room.</p>
<p>This bean bag showed no signs of wearing or flattening after four weeks of intense use. This bean bag’s quality is apparent in its comfortable foam filling and outer microsuede cover. For under $200, the Lumaland is a great option for adults looking for a comfortable classic bean bag.</p>

<p>While the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008AE0WV0/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Big Joe &#8211; Dorm Bean Bag Chair</a> may be marketed for college students, it is also a top choice for children. It can comfortably fit a wide age range of children, yet is under three feet wide. The Big Joe’s versatility comes from its structure, which includes arm- and backrests.</p>
<p>The Big Joe had the firmest structure of all of our bean bags. Our testers appreciated this firmness and rated this bean bag chair as the most comfortable for kids. While the Big Joe is less cuddly than other unstructured bean bags, it offers more support.</p>
<p>The Big Joe’s structure is ideal for children and teens who play video games because of the increased back support. Also, the Big Joe comes equipped with a drink holder and side pocket that could be useful for gamers.</p>
<p>Big Joe is filled with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0055DXQS0/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Megahh Beads</a>, the company’s own proprietary polystyrene bead, which our testers found comfortable. Unlike with other kids’ bean bags, our testers did not want more or less beads inside. However, as noted earlier, polystyrene beads lose their structure over the course of years and need to be replaced. Additional Megahh Beads, which are fully recyclable, can be purchased for under $20.</p>

<p>This bean bag chair was also the easiest to move because it is lightweight and has a built-in handle. This bean bag chair is only about four pounds, meaning that even a child could move it. The bean bag’s tough nylon-polyester blend fabric is waterproof, stain resistant and durable. This means the Big Joe could be easily taken and used outdoors.</p>

While the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P21XE32/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sofa Sack</a>’s quality microsuede cover ranked well with our testers, our testers cited disappointment in the chair’s foam filling. Our testers complained that the Sofa Sack’s foam was too hard to snuggle into. Multiple testers noted that the bean bag chair was comfortable for laying down flat, but did not offer any back support when sitting in an upright or slightly reclined position.</p>
<p>The Sofa Sack came with a slight off-gassing odor, which dissipated after the first week. Its cover was very easy to remove and replace, which made cleaning simple. Overall the Sofa Sack’s cover quality was good, with tough zippers and microsuede material.</p>
<p>Because of its five foot diameter and foam filling, this bean bag is very difficult to move. While its cover has the quality of a good piece of furniture, its inner foam is lacking in comfort. The price difference between the Sofa Sack and Lumaland &#8211; Luxury is under $50, so if possible we recommend springing for the more comfortable Lumaland.</p>

<p>Our testers complained that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F8FM7ZC/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ECR4Kids &#8211; Classic Bean Bag Chair</a> needed more of its EPS bead filling material. This bean bag chair also had a tendency to fill up with air, and then decompress when sat on. At 35” wide, this bean bag is best suited for kids 12 years old and under.</p>
<p>This bean bag chair’s best aspect was its tough vinyl cover, which was very easy to spot clean. This vinyl cover did not rank high for aesthetics with our testers, but definitely did the job for durability and stain resistance. This small bean bag is also very lightweight, meaning this bean bag could easily be moved for indoor and outdoor use.</p>
<p>Overall, we recommend this bean bag as a solid choice for those with kids 12 and under because of the bags light weight, tough cover and easy cleaning. However, you may want to buy extra EPS bead filling to give your kids extra comfort.</p>
<h3>Chill Sack &#8211; 2-Foot Round</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-12800 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Chill-Sack_Lifestyle.jpg" alt="Chill Sack placed on area rug" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Chill-Sack_Lifestyle.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Chill-Sack_Lifestyle-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Chill-Sack_Lifestyle-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Chill-Sack_Lifestyle-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Chill-Sack_Lifestyle-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Chill-Sack_Lifestyle-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Chill-Sack_Lifestyle-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Chill-Sack_Lifestyle-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Chill-Sack_Lifestyle-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Chill-Sack_Lifestyle-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Chill-Sack_Lifestyle-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Chill-Sack_Lifestyle-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Our testers appreciated the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P21WAXM/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chill Sack &#8211; 2-Foot Round</a>’s quality foam filling material, but some were frustrated with the bags small size. The Chill Sack is only two feet wide, and is suitable only for children under five years old.</p>
<p>This bean bag is safe for small children because it does not use chokable EPS beads and has a secure inner bag of foam. The removable microsuede cover is easy to remove and replace to machine wash. Two of our testers noted a slight musty odor initially. However, this disappeared over a week. Overall, this bean bag chair is a good choice for those with very small children.</p>

<h3>Fugu &#8211; 4XL</h3>

<p>The Fugu &#8211; 4XL Bean Bag Chair was the largest bean bag chair we tested. We found that after 3-7 days of use this bean bag measured about 6” wider than the advertised four feet. This is because of a breakage of the inner polyester lining that held the foam.</p>
<p>This massive bean bag chair was rated as above average for comfort overall by our testers. However, this bean bag did not rate as comfortable as the Lumaland because of irregular chunks of unbroken foam inside. Though this was technically our fault, the foam inside this bean bag was very hard to break apart during assembly. Our testers detected foam chunks even after four weeks of intense use.</p>
<p>The Fugu also had the strongest odor of all of the finalists. The bean bag chair reeked of “cardboardy,” musty packaging material. To make matters worse, we were not able to wash the Fugu’s cover in the washing machine because of a leak of foam in the bag’s inner lining.</p>
<p>Because the Fugu’s foam had broken through its inner lining, we contacted the seller for a refund. We did not get a response, but a few days later we received a new bean bag. Fugu’s confusing return process and quality issues were a pain. Therefore, we recommend either opting for the similarly priced Sofa Sack &#8211; 5-Foot Round, or paying around $50 more for the superior Lumaland &#8211; Luxury Bean Bag Chair.</p>
<h3>Flash Furniture &#8211; Oversized</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-12803 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Flash-Furniture.jpg" alt="Pink Flash Furniture bean bag on floor" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Flash-Furniture.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Flash-Furniture-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Flash-Furniture-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Flash-Furniture-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Flash-Furniture-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Flash-Furniture-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Flash-Furniture-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Flash-Furniture-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Flash-Furniture-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Flash-Furniture-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Flash-Furniture-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Flash-Furniture-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Multiple testers cited wishing there were more beads inside the Flash Furniture &#8211; Oversized Bean Bag Chair. The lack of filling contributed to its just below average ranking for comfort overall. This bean bag chair was our only adult bean bag that was filled with EPS beads.</p>
<p>At 40 inches wide, this bean bag comfortably fits one adult. It arrived already at its full size, and no assembly was required. It also had no off-gassing odor straight out of the box.</p>
<p>This bean bag had a good quality cotton cover with tough zippers that locked to ensure EPS beads stayed inside. Because this cover is non-removable, Flash Furniture recommends spot cleaning the chair as needed. This is a pain because of cotton’s tendency to stain and absorb smells. We do not recommend this bean bag because it is a pain to clean and needed more filling.</p>
<h3>American Furniture Alliance &#8211; Child’s Large</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-12796 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance.jpg" alt="American Furniture Alliance pink bean bag" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The American Furniture Alliance &#8211; Child&#8217;s Large Bean Bag ranked lowest for comfort with our testers because of the cheap polyester outer material and the course EPS beads inside. While there was a good amount of beads inside the bag, our testers did not find these beads as comfortable as in other kid’s bean bags.</p>
<p>This bean bag had a slight chemically smell that dissipated over time. The outer cover is not removable and is hard to spot clean because the polyester material absorbs liquids and odors. At 32” wide this bean bag is a good size for kids 12 years old and younger, but does not deliver on quality and comfort.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The primary job of a bean bag is to be comfortable. Durability, style and low odor are big pluses as well. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073VQSJ45/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lumaland &#8211; Luxury Bean Bag Chair</a> delivered on all of these components. Its shredded foam filling was easy to break apart and ranked as the most comfortable by our testers. Testers also loved the softness of the bean bag’s outer microsuede cover. This cover is a breeze to machine wash because removing and replacing it on the bean bag is simple.</p>
<p>The Lumaland comes with no odor straight out of the package, and is large enough to comfortably fit one adult. The bean bag chair proves that a quality adult bean bag can be purchased for under $200.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008AE0WV0/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Big Joe &#8211; Dorm Bean Bag Chair</a> took our top spot for kids because it fits a wide variety of age ranges from small child to teen. This highly structured bean bag delivers on back support and is extremely lightweight. It is stain resistant and priced under $50, meaning parents can save more money for the college fund.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P21WAXM/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chill Sack &#8211; 2-Foot Round</a> is a quality option only for those with children under five years old. Its foam filling and microsuede cover ranked high for comfort, but the bean bag’s small size is limiting.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter four weeks of lounging at the park and beach, watching movies in a reclined position and experimenting with a neutral-posture office setup, we think the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017B9PPHA/?tag=ybdzero-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Timber Ridge</a> is the best zero gravity chair. If you’re willing to live with lesser-quality materials and a narrower seat, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0716DKHS1/?tag=ybdzero-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon Basics</a> is a good choice. For a canopy option to shield from the sun, we recommend the chair from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BEEFOBU/?tag=ybdzero-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Best Choice Products</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>As always, we began our journey with a search for enthusiasts and professional reviews. Sadly, even Reddit has barely any information about what’s good and bad about the various options, and review sites we found are pretty much copy-and-paste collections of affiliate links and advertising copy.</p>
<p>If you only hear a passing reference to zero gravity chairs and follow up with a Google search, you might be convinced that this is originally and exclusively a type of patio furniture.</p>
<p>In fact, there are some very nice-looking and expensive ergonomic and therapeutic chair designs, but we know that most consumers are not in a position to buy $3,000 chairs. (We hope that if you are, the retailer will let you sit in a bunch of them first to see how you like them. Let us know if you find anything out.)</p>
<p>To narrow our list of contenders, we set a budget of $150 and picked the top-selling models, eliminating designs that had fewer than 300 reviews on Amazon, Walmart and Target, or that appeared to be built the same way as other chairs. Reviews of these chairs average in the 4-5 star range without any clear lemons, so we were expecting this to be a tight race.</p>

<h2 id="what-it-is">What is a zero gravity chair?</h2>
<p>What would your posture be like if you didn&#8217;t weigh anything? What&#8217;s the most neutral position for arms, legs, spine and neck?</p>
<p>NASA tried to answer that question when measuring body positions of crew members aboard the Skylab space station and early shuttle missions in the &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s. The <a href="https://msis.jsc.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">man-system integration standards</a> were intended to help solve problems for crew members in space, but they&#8217;ve since been applied to designs on the ground, like <a href="https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2013/t_4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ergonomic car seats</a> and these &#8220;zero gravity&#8221; chairs.</p>
<p><a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/on-average/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Designing around the &#8220;average&#8221;</a> turns out to be a bad fit for some people, and NASA&#8217;s follow-up studies aboard shuttle missions have <a href="https://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/trs/_techrep/TM-2003-104805revA.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pretty thoroughly debunked the idea</a> that you could find one posture that would be perfect for everyone. That said, lying back with your hips bent and knees elevated has proven more comfortable than the slab-like position many recliners and lounge chairs offer.</p>
<p>The &#8220;<a href="https://www.humantouch.com/perfect-chairs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perfect Chair</a>&#8221; from Human Touch is one of the early examples of a furniture company applying the NASA standards to a chair design that promises relief for back pain and pressure points. It&#8217;s a pretty pricey chair, though.</p>

<p>Some brilliant and unknown engineer somewhere figured out how to make neutral-posture reclining work on a mass-production scale with bent steel tubing and plastic joints, and thanks to that clever manufacturing you can have a part of NASA&#8217;s legacy on your patio or in your living room for less than $50.</p>

<p>For four solid weeks, our tester family used these chairs in a living room and outside on the patio and lawn with guests. They&#8217;re all compact enough when folded to fit one or two in a trunk if you want to take them to the park or beach, though they&#8217;re much larger and heavier than <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-beach-umbrella-chair-tent/#best-beach-chair" rel="noopener">our favorite ultra-light chairs</a>. We manage to squeeze five of them in the back of a mini-van to take over to a friend&#8217;s move-in party.</p>
<p>One tester has some mild chronic back pain. He experimented with using some of these chairs in a home office: if you can support your laptop or monitor in a good position, it works. It&#8217;s more awkward than sitting on a balance ball at a desk, since the chair takes up so much space, but it&#8217;s a surprisingly comfortable setup so long as you&#8217;re not craning your neck to see a screen.</p>
<h3>Build quality</h3>
<p>With a piece of furniture that costs less than a C-note, expectations are low. That said, we did dock points for any problems with materials or quality control.</p>
<p>The biggest complaints are for models that cut corners: Belleze seems to have used inferior elastic and skimped on quality control. The Caravan Sports chair has joints that wiggle and fasteners that stick out. It&#8217;s not easy to see the problems when you&#8217;re just looking at the chairs, but after sitting on them all we started to notice the losers.</p>
<h3>Recline performance</h3>
<p>Reclining these chairs is basically the central purpose of their design. All the chairs require you to push out with your feet on the bar at the end of the footrest if you want to easily recline them; it’s not quite as easy as the lever on your grandpa&#8217;s recliner. On the better chairs, we found they offered a consistent and reliable way to ease the back of the chair down smoothly.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017B9PPHA/?tag=ybdzero-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Timber Ridge</a> is the only chair that really tries to get your knees elevated. Strictly speaking, the angle of recline isn&#8217;t a factor in the NASA neutral-body-position spec (since it&#8217;s built around floating astronauts rather than people sitting in a gravity-laden environment), but elevating the legs is one commonly cited benefit among those who really like these chairs.</p>
<h3>Locking mechanism</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11744" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/untitled-8.jpg" alt="Recliner locking mechanisms" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/untitled-8.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/untitled-8-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/untitled-8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/untitled-8-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/untitled-8-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/untitled-8-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/untitled-8-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/untitled-8-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/untitled-8-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/untitled-8-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/untitled-8-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/untitled-8-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Each chair has a locking mechanism that should prevent it from reclining or shifting back up unexpectedly. Of the chairs we tested, our three 17-inch-wide chairs use a simple friction lock to stop a tube from sliding, while the wider chairs (like our top pick) use a rack of teeth to allow a more secure grip.</p>
<p>The friction locks worked better or worse depending on how tight we could get them. Amazon&#8217;s chair and the Belleze use a knob that can be tightened more than the two-position lever on the Best Choice model, though if you want the chair to stay reclined half-way down you&#8217;ll have to make them pretty tight.</p>
<h2 id="best-chair">Top pick: Timber Ridge</h2>

<p>The Timber Ridge &#8211; Oversized XL Zero Gravity Chair doesn&#8217;t come at the bargain price of some other models, but it&#8217;s enough of an upgrade that at around a hundred dollars, we think it&#8217;s worth splurging on.</p>

Better materials, better design and a cupholder that stays with the chair when folded. The cost is double, but it’s a much better product.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017B9PPHA/?tag=ybdzero-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If you want to commit to a chair that gives you neutral posture for everyday use, this is definitely the model we&#8217;d pick. The seat reclines farther than any of the others; if you take the pillow off, your head is just below the level of your knees.</p>
<p>The colors and pattern of the Timber Ridge are a bit bolder than the other models, too, which means it might be harder to match with your decor.</p>

<p>One note on materials: the Timber Ridge uses padding in the seat and wood in the armrests. (It could be maple, but manufacturer/distributor <a href="http://www.westfieldoutdoor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Westfield Outdoor</a> doesn&#8217;t say what kind of wood it is.) These are nice touches that really make the chair look and feel nicer, but they do make this less ideal for patio use.</p>
<p>The padding dries in a few hours on a sunny day and the wood seems treated to repel water, but this chair just won&#8217;t handle long-term exposure to sun and rain as well as the plastic armrests and mesh seats on the other designs. There are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06VVBG8YJ/?tag=ybdzero-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">versions of this chair made from mesh and plastic</a> instead, if you like the design but need it to survive more weather; however, you don&#8217;t save much money.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Timber Ridge makes the best-built zero gravity chair with nicer materials and a padded seat.</li>
<li>The folding and reclining action of this design are much smoother than on the rest of the chairs.</li>
<li>A lock that&#8217;s solid and engages easily makes this a more trustworthy recliner.</li>
<li>The included cupholder works well and can actually stay attached when the chair is folded.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Amazon Basics &#8211; Zero Gravity Chair is a great example of Amazon&#8217;s branding strategy. They&#8217;ve taken a popular product, found a reliable manufacturer and ordered a special version with all the essential features in an affordable package.</p>
<p>With only one sample from each manufacturer represented, it&#8217;s difficult to say how variable quality control will be. But of the chairs we received, Amazon&#8217;s is just a bit better than the others in the budget price bracket. The folding and reclining action is smoother, and there are fewer loose threads.</p>

If the locking system were easier to use, at this price it might have taken our top pick.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0716DKHS1/?tag=ybdzero-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The locking mechanism on this model is a simple twist-knob that presses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cam lobe</a> against a sliding tube; it&#8217;s the same mechanism on the Belleze, but it&#8217;s easier to tighten on Amazon&#8217;s. It&#8217;s possible to twist the cam-style lock tight enough that you can sit up or shift your weight and the chair will stay in a half-reclined position. In comparison, the friction-sleeve lock on the chair from Best Choice will start to slip if you put any real pressure on it.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s model, whether by design or by some accident, reclines a little lower than the other budget models as well. The back goes down to the same 34-degree angle as the Timber Ridge chair, though this one doesn&#8217;t elevate the knees quite as much.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074L3WVBD/?tag=ybdzero-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">cupholder is easy to add</a>, but a matched-fabric canopy is not going to be so simple. We think the better design and quality control is more important, but if you&#8217;re going to use this as a beach chair and don&#8217;t want to bring an umbrella or other shade, the canopy on the Best Choice chair might be worth more than Amazon&#8217;s superior lock.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon Basics uses established manufacturers to make a bare-bones version of a popular product, and the formula works perfectly here.</li>
<li>This zero gravity chair reclines almost as well as the Timber Ridge but with less impressive materials.</li>
<li>The friction lock can be tightened as much as you need to secure this chair, but it&#8217;s not our favorite system.</li>
<li>No canopy or cupholder, but we think the better quality is worth that sacrifice.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Best Choice Products &#8211; Zero Gravity Chair is an attractive set of features on paper: for the same price as the other value leaders, you get an easy-to-use flip-lever lock, a built-in canopy and a detachable cupholder.</p>
<p>The value-added accessories are pretty good, but the core design of this chair isn&#8217;t our favorite. The friction-sleeve this chair uses to lock isn&#8217;t very secure, if you want the chair back to stay in position when you move around.</p>
<p>The canopy and cupholder aren&#8217;t better than traditional patio tables or umbrellas: the cupholder is a bit wobbly, and the canopy won&#8217;t keep you from getting sunburned. That said, they&#8217;re functional.</p>

<p>The cupholder tray gives you a slot for a tablet or magazine as well as a cell phone and two full-size cups. Sadly, it doesn&#8217;t have a place to stay on the chair when you fold it for storage; the canopy clips neatly to the back.</p>
<p>So far as we can tell, this is the same design as the <a href="http://www.qvc.com/for-the-home/bliss-hammocks/_/N-lgluZ1z13iec/c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bliss Hammocks design that shows up on QVC</a>, though without the variety of fabric patterns offered there.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the version Best Choice Products is offering <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XB4TH2O/?tag=ybdzero-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">in a two-pack for ridiculous prices</a> is more like our bottom-pick Belleze model than like this one. The twist-lock design and pinched-tube footrest joints are a giveaway, and at $34 per chair you could be playing a lottery, hoping to get one that doesn&#8217;t have problems like our Belleze chair does.</p>
<p>You can easily find the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074L3WVBD/?tag=ybdzero-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">cupholder accessory</a> to add on to other models, but a matching add-on canopy is going to be nearly impossible to get. If the canopy is a must-have, and you don&#8217;t need to lock your chair securely in a semi-reclined position, this is a good price.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Best Choice Products includes a canopy and cupholder to make your sunny-day reading that much more relaxing.</li>
<li>The friction lock is easy to engage with the flip of a lever, but it&#8217;s not very tight.</li>
<li>The quality of this chair is almost as good as the Amazon Basics model, though at these prices we wonder how consistent they&#8217;ll be.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put simply, Caravan Sports took a great idea and executed it poorly. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EAZ61VI/?tag=ybdzero-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infinity Oversized</a> chair is four inches wider than most, and the locking mechanism is a good budget version of the locking rail design that Timber Ridge uses.</p>
<p>The flaws are in whatever modifications the design team made to the lengths of the frame pieces and joints. We haven&#8217;t figured out exactly where the change is, but you have to push really hard with your feet on the footrest bar, much more than with any of the others.</p>
<p>If this were the only zero gravity recliner you ever tried, you would probably write off the whole concept. It&#8217;s hard to use and doesn&#8217;t recline very far, and the joints flex in a scary way if you put your weight on the armrests.</p>

<p>We picked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073XXPSZB/?tag=ybdzero-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Belleze &#8211; Zero Gravity Chair</a> to test because it&#8217;s available in a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073XYZW5L/?tag=ybdzero-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">two-pack for a very low price-per-chair</a>, and it includes a cupholder and canopy for the same price as the bare-bones Amazon chair.</p>
<p>Sadly, the quality here isn&#8217;t quite up to the same standards as the other chairs. The lock design is the same as the Amazon Basics chair, but it isn&#8217;t as smooth and it takes more effort to get it really locked.</p>
<p>The elastic support on this chair wasn&#8217;t as strong as on the other models, either, despite the 300-pound rated capacity. The final nail in the coffin? The canopy won&#8217;t stay in the clipped storage position: it pops out after a few minutes, flopping around as a pathetic indicator that nobody actually tested this feature after assembly.</p>
<p>Your mileage may vary, of course, but with the other options available we wouldn&#8217;t buy one of these chairs again, let alone a two-pack.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>We tested the range of quality that&#8217;s available for these chairs, and you definitely get what you pay for. At just over $100, the Timber Ridge zero gravity chair is made of nicer materials and is nicer to use in every way. Everyone who sat in this chair was impressed. It reclines father than the rest, and the cupholder doesn&#8217;t have to come off to put it away.</p>

<p>If you just want an inexpensive chair for your patio that you don&#8217;t want to worry about leaving in the rain, Amazon Basics has a good budget model to try. It&#8217;s relatively smooth and you can crank the lock knobs down to make it secure, but it&#8217;s definitely a step down from our top pick.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We spent 35+ hours researching and testing 16 products at our local beach in sunny San Diego to find the best beach umbrellas, chairs, and tents.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent more than 35 hours researching and testing 14 top-rated products at our local beach to find the best beach umbrella, best beach tent and best beach chair. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002CLQ1Q2/?tag=ybdbch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sport-brella</a> earned the title as best umbrella; its steel ribs and stakes made it feel durable and secure, while its two side vents allowed for great air flow. If you’re looking for a tent instead of an umbrella, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005LGV2PA/?tag=ybdbch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lightspeed Outdoors &#8211; Quick Cabana</a> is our top choice beach tent due to its ease of setup, ventilation and ability to comfortably fit either couples or families (four to five people). For lounging, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000A073BE/?tag=ybdbch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tommy Bahama &#8211; Backpack Cooler Chair&#8217;s</a> adjustability, versatility, comfort and moderate price made it our go-to beach chair.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>As Southern California natives who live blocks from the beach, we know a thing or two about what product features to look for in beach accessories. To confirm the features we deemed important, we scoured Amazon to find beach umbrellas, tents and chairs with an average rating of four or above. Then, we dug into the reviews to see what features people enjoyed or disliked in their beach products.</p>
<p>We also read through articles from sites like <a href="http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/topics/camping-and-hiking/best-beach-canopy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OutdoorGearLab</a> and <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-beach-umbrellas-chairs-and-accessories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wirecutter</a> to help narrow down our list of brands and products to test, and the features they should have. Though OutdoorGearLab was helpful in determining some of the top beach brands, they chose larger beach tents with $100+ price point. We opted to test more moderately priced, lighter beach tents since those are more convenient to the average beach-goer.</p>
<p>We tested some of the same models as The Wirecutter, and came to similar conclusions about the best umbrellas. However, we tested a wider variety of beach tents. Most of the beach tents we tested were on the larger side (typically seven to eight feet wide and just over four feet deep), while still a manageable weight, for those interested in sharing the tent with babies, children or furry friends.</p>
<p>Across the board, it is important to look for ease of transport and setup, weight, size, breathability, and durability in your beach accessories.</p>
<p>In an umbrella, you should also consider stability and size, as well as if it has a built-in sand anchor, telescoping feature, tilt mechanism and UV protection. In a beach tent it’s important to think about if you need an extended floormat. Finally, for a beach chair you should consider the weight capacity and if bonus features, like cupholders and pillows, are important to you.</p>
<p>When vetting beach chairs we also considered alternative seating methods like adjustable beach mats and inflatable lounge chairs, but opted against them as they didn’t provide the same level of support as traditional beach chairs.</p>
<p>After taking all of the above into consideration, here are the umbrellas, tents and chairs that made the cut.</p>

<h3>Beach umbrellas versus beach tents</h3>
<p>Both beach umbrellas and beach tents provide shade, so what’s the difference? Well, beach umbrellas are upright or semi-upright (in the case of the Sport-brella) canopies supported by (most commonly) an aluminum and plexiglass frame.</p>
<p>Beach tents are more enclosed structures with an open front. In beach tents you sit on fabric rather than directly in the sand. They are a bit more sheltered from the elements and, without good ventilation, can get a bit stuffy. However, beach tents are a more stable, easier to put up and lighter than beach umbrellas. Beach umbrellas offer shade, but are less of a shelter than beach tents. One isn’t necessarily better than the other ‒ it’s just a matter of personal preference.</p>

<p>Stability is one of the most important factors when choosing an umbrella. After all, you don’t want to be that person chasing their umbrella down the beach. We found the Sport-brella to be the most stable as it laid down and was anchored to the ground similar to a beach tent.</p>
<p>In addition to stability, you’ll also want to consider weight. The Tommy Bahama, Coolibar, EasyGo, and Sport-brella weighed 4 pounds, 4.6 pounds, 6.8 pounds and eight pounds respectively. Though the Coolibar was the second lightest, it was the most compact measuring only 47 inches. The next shortest was the Tommy Bahama at 50 inches. The longest was the Sport-brella at 58 inches.</p>
<p>The Tommy Bahama &#8211; Sand Anchor Umbrella has many convenient features, including an 8.5 inch built-in sand anchor. However, like many Amazon reviews noted, it isn’t the best quality. The first umbrella we ordered came with a warped top pole, which was unable to fit into the bottom section. The next umbrella came intact and was easy to install because of the sand anchor, but felt flimsier than other models, which could explain why it was the lightest of the bunch at only 4 pounds.</p>
<p>If you’re going to put a lot of wear and tear on your umbrella, we suggest purchasing a slightly more expensive, but higher quality model.</p>
<p>The EasyGo Umbrella also had a sand anchor, though it was only three inches long, making it harder to insert into the sand than the Tommy Bahama umbrella. However, the umbrella itself was much sturdier.</p>

<p>For umbrellas like the Coolibar Umbrella that don’t come with a sand anchor built-in, you’ll want to buy a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beachr-Beach-Umbrella-Anchor-Strong/dp/B014RQZZC0/ref=sr_1_5?s=lawn-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503981685&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=sand+anchor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">sand anchor</a> separately. It will make the umbrella easiest to install and stay put, but is an added cost.</p>
<p><strong>Test 2: Size</strong></p>
<p>The coverage of your umbrella also matters, especially if you have a large group. The largest umbrella is the EasyGo, topping out at eight feet in diameter. The smallest is the Coolibar measuring six feet in diameter. The other two umbrellas were seven feet. Every umbrella, with the exception of the Sport-brella, stood between seven and seven and a half feet tall.</p>
<p><strong>Test 3: Materials</strong></p>
<p>The majority of umbrellas are made with fiberglass ribs, an aluminum pole, polyester canopy and a handful of plastic pieces. The EasyGo and Tommy Bahama umbrellas are no exception. Though the Tommy Bahama does have the superior built-in sand anchor, the EasyGo felt sturdier overall when testing. The Sport-brella had steel ribs instead of fiberglass ribs, contributing to how sturdy it felt.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0023TQ9JM/?tag=ybdbch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coolibar</a> is unique in that the canopy is made from nylon &#8212; not just any nylon, but silver nylon that reflects the sun on the outside and blue nylon that absorbs remaining rays on the inside. This was effective for keeping the area underneath the umbrella cool and comfortable. The umbrella did smell strongly when it arrived, which we attribute to this material, but the smell will likely wear off over time.</p>
<p>Each of the umbrellas have UPF 50+ protection.</p>

That also means you don't have to dig a deep hole like with other umbrellas. And for extra durability, the Sport-brella features steel ribs rather than flimsy plastic that can degrade over time.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002CLQ1Q2/?tag=ybdbch-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If you don’t mind an untraditional beach umbrella, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002CLQ1Q2/?tag=ybdbch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sport-brella</a> is a great choice! Rather than standing up like a typical umbrella, it sits propped on the sand by two side flaps that descend from the umbrella body. The Sport-brella has two large wind flaps on either side for ventilation and includes stakes and tie-down cords for extra security.</p>
<p>The Sport-brella is easy to put up and is extremely sturdy. It’s also made of quality materials including steel ribs and polyester fabric. The only negative is its weight (eight pounds), but if you’re not planning on lugging it long distances or have a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-folding-wagon/" rel="noopener">folding wagon</a>, that shouldn’t deter you from choosing this umbrella.</p>
<p>If you’re trying to decide between a beach umbrella and a beach tent, this is a good hybrid option that provides a bit more ventilation than the latter.</p>

<p>Though the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0023TQ9JM/?tag=ybdbch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coolibar</a> was on the high end of the umbrella price range, if you’re willing to spend close to $90 on an umbrella instead of around $50, this is a quality investment. It’s light and compact, making it easy to transport.</p>
<p>Plus, its heavy canopy material, which is silver on the outside to reflect the sun and blue on the inside to absorb it, coupled with its dual-layer structure for ventilation, will keep you cool. Just remember, this umbrella is only six feet in diameter so it’s better for smaller groups.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested-tents">How we tested beach tents</h2>
<p><strong>Test 1: Convenience</strong></p>
<p>Beach tents are a great shelter if you plan on being in the sun for hours on end. However, we know they’re not the only thing you’ll be bringing to the beach. If you have a child or furry friend in tow, you’ll likely be lugging toys, food, water and towels with you as well. That’s why a beach tent must be light and easy to transport. We measured the weight of each item with a luggage scale and found that all the tents we tested were relatively light, between 4.2 and 6.2 pounds.</p>
<p>To test the ease of use, we set up and took down each tent multiple times and found the average setup time. We discluded the first set up, as this was a practice round to get familiar with each tent.</p>
<p>Each of the beach tents below, with the exception of the Coleman Daytripper, had a snap-up frame which made them quick to assemble — just be careful of smashing your fingers or getting hit in the face from the recoil (both of which may or may have not happened to us). The Coleman Daytripper had collapsible poles and was pitched more like a traditional tent, making set up and take down much more difficult.</p>
<p>The tents had stakes to attach them to the ground and either sand bags or pockets for extra weight. If you store your bags and other items in the tents in addition to using the stakes and sandbags, the tents should be tethered to the ground pretty securely.</p>
<p><strong>Test 2: Size</strong></p>
<p>Other than convenience, size is an important factor in determining which beach tent is right for you. The two biggest tents we tested were the Lightspeed and the Coleman. Both had floormats extend past the tent opening, though, as mentioned above, the Coleman required more assembly.</p>
<p>Though the Coleman and Lightspeed were measurably bigger tents, each of the tents we tested could only fit two beach chairs comfortably because of their shapes. The Coleman and Lightspeed both tapered off near the back. The Lightspeed could fit three (cramped) beach towels and the Genji could also fit three vertically, with the users’ legs sticking out.</p>
<p>Since chair and towel capacity didn’t vary much between tents, what it came down to was the number of people each could hold. The Genji Sports tent fit two to three people, the Pacific Breeze and Lightspeed fit three to four people and the Coleman fit four to five.</p>
<p><strong>Test 3: Comfort and features</strong></p>
<p>A tent with limited ventilation can restrict the ocean breeze and make your tent feel like it’s full of canned heat. That’s why we made sure to take into account how many windows or vents each tent had and where they were placed. As each of the windows was relatively large, we did not make the size of the windows a deciding factor. We also took into consideration the number of pocket flaps for easy storage of small items. All the tents we tested had fabric rated UPF 50+, so they were all even in that sense.</p>
<p>The Lightspeed had three windows, one on each side, to keep air circulating. That said, it did get a little warm inside on a hot day with little breeze ‒ this was true for all beach tents, and was the only thing slightly inconvenient about the Lightspeed. The Lightspeed tent also had two pockets inside to hold small valuables like keys or phones.</p>
<p>The Coleman was unique in that it has one very large window in the back, with a zipper that spanned three of the four sides. This allowed it to double as a door. The floormat could also be folded and zipped up like a secondary door, enclosing the tent completely. The Coleman also had four pockets. The Pacific Breeze had two windows on either side and one pocket.</p>
<p>The Genji Sports tent was the only option to have not only a large window, but mesh insets on the bottom of either side, allowing for ventilation from multiple levels. This is a nice addition for anyone who likes to lay down at the beach, as it helped provide all-around airflow from the bottom up.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a tent that can fit the average family (two adults and two to three children), the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005LGV2PA/?tag=ybdbch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lightspeed Outdoors &#8211; Quick Cabana</a> is the one for you! Its extended floormat provides four extra feet of (unsheltered) sand coverage for kids and adults to spread out, making this a great choice for larger families as it can fit around three to four people, and its three windows provide decent ventilation. If you have small children, this likely could squeeze two adults and two to three small children.</p>

Its three large windows help promote airflow, but it does take some practice to get it back in the storage bag.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005LGV2PA/?tag=ybdbch-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>It’s setup and takedown time was on par with the other contestants, ranging from one and a half to three minutes. However, its snap-up technology had more tension than the others, causing this tent’s setup to require a bit more muscle. The average person can set up this tent alone, but the recoil is more intense than the other brands, so make sure it locks before you let it go and be careful it’s pointed away from you when unlocking to avoid getting hit by the mechanism. Our only other complaint is that it was slightly more difficult to get back in the bag compared to the other tents.</p>
<p>In the end the Lightspeed is worth it if you have a group to shade and want that extra floormat space.</p>

We appreciated that it maintains a wide footprint toward the back for a comfortable two-person capacity.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CDFVK0O/?tag=ybdbch-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The lightest tent of the bunch, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CDFVK0O/?tag=ybdbch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genji Sports</a> tent is beautiful in its simplicity. It was the easiest to put up as it uncoiled evenly and the frame didn’t get caught on the fabric like some of the other options. The Genji Sports tent also had two mesh insets on either side, plus a window in the back for solid ventilation.</p>
<p>Unlike the other tents, it was equally wide in the front and the back, rather than tapering off towards the back. This allowed two people to be able to lay horizontally and be fully protected from the sun or vertically if they wanted to be in partial sunlight. Though it was shallower than some if its competitors, it didn’t make it feel small or cramped because though it was more shallow it wasn’t tapered off towards the back.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested-chairs">How we tested beach chairs</h2>
<p><strong>Types of beach chairs</strong></p>
<p>Beach chairs add comfort to your trip and can be tailored to fit any beach activity. Although both are suited for outdoors, leave your heavy, but comfortable <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-zero-gravity-chair/">zero gravity chair</a> at home. If you’re aiming for a relaxing day at the beach, a backpack chair may be fitting. If you want extra sun protection without an umbrella, try a canopy chair. And finally, if you’re looking for something light and practical try a compact chair; it’s also great for sitting around a bonfire!</p>
<p>Unlike a towel or blanket, beach chairs are typically water repellent and dry quickly. They’re also easy to brush sand off of, so you won’t end up with a soggy, sandy towel (and a very sandy car) at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Additionally, beach chairs with secure pockets will put you at ease since you’ll know that your valuables are safely tucked away and not at risk of falling out of a pocket or purse.</p>
<p>Learn more about the three beach chair categories we tested below:</p>
<p><strong>Backpack chairs:</strong> These chairs have a stiff rectangular frame with two straps, so you can throw them on like a backpack. They have higher backs so you can rest your head on the backrest or built-in pillow, and are also low enough to the sand to comfortably straighten out your legs. You can also adjust your seat to recline or sit up straight and enjoy a view of the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>Canopy chairs:</strong> If shade is important to you, canopy chairs come with a built-in canopy so you don’t need an additional umbrella or tent. However, they are larger and heavier than the other types of chairs.</p>
<p><strong>Compact chairs:</strong> No frills, these chairs are light, easy to transport and get the job done. If you’re just looking to get off the sand these are a great choice, but lack extra features like cup holders. These chairs are more commonly used for camping or backpacking.</p>
<p><strong>Test 1: Convenience</strong></p>
<p>Two major tests of convenience for beach chairs are how easy they are to set up and how easy they are to transport. Setup was relatively fast and simple across the board, with the exception of the Big Agnes, which required minor assembly.</p>
<p>Since the assembly time was relatively equal, we focused on weight and carrying method. Four out of six chairs averaged seven to nine pounds — a manageable weight — and had a convenient carrying method.</p>
<p>The two outliers were the Big Agnes and the Kelsyus &#8211; Canopy Chair. The Big Agnes was only 1.9 pounds and also had the highest weight capacity of an impressive 320 pounds, making it easy to transport and ideal for backpacking trips. However, its small size and bowl shape made it a less candidate for lounging on the beach. The Kelsyus was the heaviest at nearly 12 pounds, making it less desirable to lug from the parking lot to the shore.</p>
<p><strong>Test 2: Size</strong></p>
<p>Beyond the size of the folded chairs, the seat size is important. We measured the depth and back height of each chair, and the width from side-to-side or armrest-to-armrest at their widest point.</p>
<p>The Tommy Bahama &#8211; Cooler Beach Chair and Rio &#8211; Backpack Chair had the highest backs, 24.5 and 27.5 inches respectively. This, coupled with their sturdy frame and pillow, provided relaxing neck support. These two chairs were also a medium level from the ground, nine inches and 13 inches, which created a barrier from the sand while still allowing us to be close enough to have the full beach experience.</p>
<p>Though the measurements of the two compact chairs, the Big Agnes &#8211; Helinox and ALPS Mountaineering were similar, the shape of the ALPS chair was much more conducive to a beach environment. Its padded armrests and moderate price makes it a solid option if you’re looking for a minimalistic chair that could also be used for camping.</p>
<p>The larger sizes of the Rio &#8211; Big Guy Backpack Chair and Kelsyus &#8211; Canopy Chair, make these two good options for people taller than the average person. But, as mentioned, they’re also heavier than other options.</p>
<p><strong>Test 3: Comfort</strong></p>
<p>At the beach you want to be able to lean back and enjoy the sound of the crashing waves. Only two chairs allowed you to do that — the Tommy Bahama &#8211; Cooler Beach Chair and the Rio &#8211; Backpack Chair. Both provided neck support, a pillow and an adjustable back for ultimate comfort.</p>
<p>The rest of the chairs, though not as supportive, were relatively comfortable, with the exception of the Kelsyus &#8211; Canopy Chair. The bottom of that chair sagged and caused us to sink into it, making for a less pleasant seating experience than the rest.</p>
<p>The Big Agnes &#8211; Helinox, though comfortable in its own way, was not the relaxing comfort you look for at the beach. As it is made for backpacking and camping, it is small and light but lacks armrests. If you’re looking to invest in a backpacking chair, we highly recommend it, but for the beach it’s best to stick with something a bit larger and with more features.</p>

<p>Though it weighs nine pounds, the Quik Shade is very comfortable and supportive, unlike its competitor the Kelysus &#8211; Canopy Chair. It also has two cup holders and a side pocket for handy storage.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We sat on six seats for over 150 hours, after comparing 20+ units, in order to make our recommendation for the best overall stadium seat. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter out team spent 45 hours sitting on six seats for game-length durations, we selected the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SJS1DX8/?tag=ybdstad-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Picnic Time &#8211; Portable Ventura</a> as the best stadium seat. It’s comfortable, includes arm rests, has good back support and is easy to lug around. For those who don’t want to spend more on their seat than a ticket to the game, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HQEMPEC/?tag=ybdstad-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RIO Gear &#8211; My Pod</a> is a great budget option. If you&#8217;re big and tall, you might want one of the newest stadium seats, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079LCX4SD/?tag=ybdstad-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brawntide &#8211; Wide Stadium Seat</a>, which gives you more elbow room and thick, plush padding.</p>

<p><em>(Editor&#8217;s note: In October 2019 we tested two new stadium seats on the market to see how they compared with our top pick. We&#8217;ve now added the Brawntide &#8211; Wide Stadium Seat as one of our top picks. However, as of this writing, it&#8217;s back-ordered on both the company&#8217;s website and Amazon.)</em></p>
<h2 id="how-we-picked">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We spent a day combing online reviews, comparing models, and considering the use case for these seats. We looked at the bad reviews as well as the good ones in order to evaluate not just what made people happy about the cushion they sat on: but also what made them upset.</p>
<p>In the end, these were the factors that weighed into our choices and decision making:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comfort</li>
<li>Whether or not they had armrests</li>
<li>Durability</li>
<li>Portability (both in weight and design)</li>
<li>Price</li>
<li>Size: Would the seat work for most body types and weights?</li>
</ul>
<p>After considering the options and evaluating hundreds of online reviews, we made our selections, narrowing our choices to a final few seats across price and potential user types.</p>
<h2 id="six">Compare the best stadium seats</h2>
[table id=10 /]
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>To best replicate how people would really use these bleacher seats, we had to replicate a true game-going environment. So we tailgated for hours before each use, grilling some tasty game-day food on <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-gas-grill/">the trusty gas BBQ</a>, consumed frosty-cold beers from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">favorite cooler</a>, soaked up some sun, and then tested the chairs&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;or not. Unfortunately, we couldn’t justify doing that, but we dreamed of doing that, and hope you do similar when using these seats. Instead, we only replicated the seating environment, buying a plastic bench we could use for three hours, the average duration of most sporting events, inside our office.</p>

<p>We set up the benches and recorded a comfort “score” of 1-10 at the start, and then every subsequent hour thereafter, in order to see how the seats performed from a longevity perspective.</p>
<p>We treated the seats just like we would at a game, taking short breaks to run to the bathroom or stretch our legs, but we made sure to always reserve a three-hour window for sitting in order to best replicate a true game environment.</p>
<p>In order to save our backs, if a bench got an initial score of less than four, we immediately vetoed further testing. (And headed for our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-neck-and-shoulder-massager/">massagers</a> instead.) An uncomfortable seat is an uncomfortable seat: it’s not suddenly going to get better, only worse.</p>
<p>In addition, we always tested first thing in the morning, spaced out tests over several days, and tested three times each, in order to reduce the bias back fatigue or simply feeling bad one day might create.</p>
<p>The scores were the following:</p>
<p><a href="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/stadium-seat_comfort-scores.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3645" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/stadium-seat_comfort-scores.png" alt="stadium-seat_comfort-scores" width="880" height="606" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/stadium-seat_comfort-scores.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/stadium-seat_comfort-scores-610x420.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/stadium-seat_comfort-scores-360x248.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/stadium-seat_comfort-scores-375x258.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/stadium-seat_comfort-scores-414x285.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/stadium-seat_comfort-scores-295x203.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/stadium-seat_comfort-scores-180x124.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/stadium-seat_comfort-scores-320x220.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SJS1DX8/?tag=ybdstad-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Picnic Time &#8211; Portable Ventura</a> performed best, with a strong initial comfort score and best maintenance of that score, given great back support and armrests that provide additional comfort throughout.</p>
<p>The Stadium Chair also performed well but had no armrests and slightly more give in the back area that created fatigue over time, putting it in second place.</p>
<p>On the low end of the scale, the Guidesman and Portable Recliner Picnic Seat were each subpar and not worth testing for the full duration. The Portable Recliner felt slightly better than just the bench, but the Guidesman hardly made a difference.</p>
<p>It’s the cheapest model, so that’s somewhat to be expected, but you want to see some kind of difference in comfort when buying a seat, or why even buy one?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3595" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/carrying-backpack.jpg" alt="carrying-backpack" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/carrying-backpack.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/carrying-backpack-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/carrying-backpack-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/carrying-backpack-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/carrying-backpack-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/carrying-backpack-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/carrying-backpack-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/carrying-backpack-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/carrying-backpack-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/carrying-backpack-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Next, we looked at the portability of the seats. Weight matters, but if the seat gives you a method of carrying the seats that distribute the weight, it’s not as big of a burden.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SJS1DX8/?tag=ybdstad-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Picnic Time</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VKK3ESO/?tag=ybdstad-20">Naomi Home</a> seats came with a helpful backpack strap that made lugging them around a breeze, even if you look somewhat ridiculous when doing so. These seats were two of the heavier models we used, so the backpack functionality was a nice-to-have that makes carrying them around feasible for any age or strength level.</p>

<p>The Guidesman, RIO Gear &#8211; My Pod  and Portable Recliner Picnic Seat all came with small straps that connected on two points of the seats, offering something you could either grip with your hand or swing around your shoulder when carrying.</p>
<p>All on the lighter side, these loops do the job but will take up a hand or two if you’re thinking about carrying anything else into the game or lugging some things into a tailgate area from a far-away parking spot.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WX9PXU/?tag=ybdstad-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stadium Chair seat</a>, while comfortable, was also by far the heaviest seat, and also required you hold onto it by a bar. It’s not unmovable by any means but could become a bit of a pain if lugging it from far away or trying to juggle a toddler. In terms of overall portability, it was the worst of the units we tested.</p>
<p>To compare all of the above attributes side by side, we also included the following chart that shows the weight of each unit and how you&#8217;ll probably carry it.</p>

<p>For season ticket holders or frequent users, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SJS1DX8/?tag=ybdstad-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Picnic Time &#8211; Portable Ventura</a> is the best stadium seat. It&#8217;s comfortable for the longest duration of time, is easy to move around given the backpack functionality and comes in many different colors, so you can match the design to your favorite team.</p>
<p>The features the Picnic Time come equipped with definitely come with a price, as it’s one of most expensive units we tested. For most games where you won’t have a back, you’ll be paying more for the chair than the game. But if you’re going to use it over several years, you will definitely get value for the price.</p>
<p>One thing to consider about the Picnic Time is its adjustable arms. For a few people in our office, it was a bit snug: the 220-pound reviewer was pretty firm in the chair, and a couple extra hot dogs might make you want to take down the armrests. However, the seat can be adjusted so the armrests are lowered, which adds a few more inches of width.</p>

The armrests can be raised or lowered, plus it comes in a wide range of colors that you can coordinate with your home teams. </p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SJS1DX8/?tag=ybdstad-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>It makes more sense though to use the armrests, and if you&#8217;re unsure if you&#8217;ll fit,  sit in a chair and measure the width of your legs from end to end when in a comfortable position. If your leg-to-leg width measures greater than 17 inches wide, the Picnic Time will be too narrow.</p>
<p>We tested the Picnic Time again for this update, and although our tester is slim, he found it constricting. Also, the first Picnic Time we ordered was defective: The mechanism for adjusting the seat&#8217;s position broke after four tries. We returned it, and the second one performed better.</p>

<p>If you don’t want to spend $45-$60 for a stadium seat, the RIO Gear &#8211; My Pod Sports Chair is our budget pick.  It has worse back support, no armrests and slightly less padding, but overall is a serviceable option for someone who wants a backrest for the occasional game or event. It scored significantly better than the other seats in a similar price range.</p>

<p>The RIO was also the only unit which had a &#8220;strap-in&#8221; feature like this, which is an extra plus for anybody who&#8217;s especially wild when cheering on their favorite team.</p>
<p>In addition, the RIO comes with two heating packs and includes pockets on the front of the chair for storage, an extra benefit for those who find themselves in colder temperatures. And at only 3.5 pounds, the seat is light and the attached strap makes it easy to carry from your car to the game.</p>

<p>For this 2019 update, we tested one of the newest stadium seats on the market, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079LCX4SD/?tag=ybdstad-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brawntide &#8211; Wide Stadium Seat</a>. In fact, we prefer it to the Picnic Time, because it&#8217;s a full 5-inches wider without armrests, and its cushioning is much more plush and comfortable. However, because the Brawntide is so popular, it&#8217;s frequently out-of-stock on Amazon.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re big, tall or big and tall, this is the stadium seat for you. It&#8217;s 2-inches taller than other stadium seats, so if you&#8217;re over six-feet-tall, the back of the chair will reach the top of your shoulders, which gives you plenty of support in your lower back. The armrests are longer, extending to the wrists, so you don&#8217;t need to sit with your arms pinned back, as you would with most stadium seats.</p>

<p>The Brawntide has three layers of foam, so it&#8217;s ultra-comfortable; it&#8217;s like sitting in an easy chair. It has four pockets: a large zippered rear pocket for storing snacks or a sweatshirt or sweater, a side left pocket for a cell phone and two removable right pockets for water bottles or beverage cans. Like Picnic Time, the Brawntide has straps for attaching the seat to bleachers.</p>
<p>The Brawntide is about $10 more expensive than Picnic Time, but the extra width and thick padding are worth the cost. The company also sells standard-width seats and the standard and wide-size in two-packs. When they&#8217;re back in stock, we recommend checking them out.</p>

<h3>Nova Microdermabrasion &#8211; Stadium Chair</h3>

<p>Another recent release that we tested for this 2019 update is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BFCKTRJ/?tag=ybdstad-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nova Microdermabrasion &#8211; Stadium Chair</a>. Although you might think this is a skin-care company, Nova Microdermabrasion manufactures office chairs, beauty-salon chairs and equipment and a variety of home goods. It&#8217;s similar in size to the Picnic Time but not nearly as stylish.</p>
<p>Armrests and seat are well-padded, but the chair itself is too short and narrow, and since the armrests are not adjustable, you&#8217;re really need to squeeze yourself in. This stadium seat has a single, sewn-in pocket for a beverage can, and that&#8217;s about it for any extras. This is a bit of a bargain-basement stadium seat, but if you&#8217;re budget-conscious and slim-hipped, it could be an option.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WX9PXU/?tag=ybdstad-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stadium Chair</a> has the brand name to match its intent and is a quality chair with good comfort scores, especially at the beginning of the sitting period.</p>
<p>However, it was just below the Picnic Time in overall comfort, equal in price, and also is a bit harder to lug around, making it a second-best choice. It&#8217;s also the only model tested with a weight limit: if larger than 350 pounds, it&#8217;s recommended you go with another unit as the spring base may not be able to support you properly.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K6KP42I/?tag=ybdstad-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Trademark Innovations &#8211; Recliner Picnic Seat</a> didn’t survive the first minute of testing, scoring near the bottom in overall comfort. Even worse was that the zipper confused our second tester, who opened the seat and then tried to close it and broke the material on the first try. Overall, that put it pretty low on our totem pole.</p>
<h3>Naomi Home &#8211; Venice</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3601" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/red-chair.jpg" alt="red-chair" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/red-chair.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/red-chair-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/red-chair-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/red-chair-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/red-chair-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/red-chair-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/red-chair-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/red-chair-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/red-chair-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VKK3ESO/?tag=ybdstad-20">Naomi Home &#8211; Venice</a> has a similar build and price as the Picnic Time chair but isn’t quite as comfortable. It also has fewer color customization options, making it more difficult to match the chair to your favorite team.</p>
<p>On the positive side, the Naomi was the only chair we tested that had armrests in a large-sized option, so if you’ve got a wider frame, it’s probably the best option for the cost.</p>
<h3>Guidesman &#8211; Seat Cushion</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3602" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/flat-green-seat.jpg" alt="flat-green-seat" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/flat-green-seat.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/flat-green-seat-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/flat-green-seat-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/flat-green-seat-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/flat-green-seat-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/flat-green-seat-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/flat-green-seat-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/flat-green-seat-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/flat-green-seat-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013XQXY1O/?tag=ybdstad-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Guidesman &#8211; Seat Cushion</a> was the cheapest model we tested but barely performs better than the bench itself. The cushion didn’t feel at all more comfortable than our plastic bench, although it did seem like a slight upgrade over the above bleacher we also sat on.</p>
<p>It may make your backside feel a bit better at the end of the three hours, but it’s not a purchase we can recommend unless you plan to use the seat one time only.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The point of a stadium seat is to provide superior comfort over the duration of a ballgame: not leave you in pain at the end. If that’s the goal, then you’ll do your back and butt a favor investing for the long term. Overall, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SJS1DX8/?tag=ybdstad-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Picnic Time &#8211; Portable Ventura</a> is the best choice for a stadium junkie. It’s comfortable, easy to lug around, and it’s going to give you solid, reliable back support over a three-hour duration.</p>
<p>If you’re not willing to pay $40+ just to feel comfortable, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HQEMPEC/?tag=ybdstad-20">RIO Gear &#8211; My Pod Sports Chair</a> is a next-best option. You can buy a cushion for $10, but it won’t do much besides providing mental relief.</p>
<p>A slightly more expensive stadium seat, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079LCX4SD/?tag=ybdstad-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brawntide &#8211; Wide Stadium Seat</a>, is even more comfortable than the Picnic Time, thanks to its triple layer of foam and 22.5-inch width. The Brawntide, however, is very popular and often out of stock on both the company website and Amazon. But if you see it, grab it while you can.</p>
