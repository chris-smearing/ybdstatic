								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter four weeks of testing five best-selling models in the summer heat, we&#8217;ve concluded that electric coolers are not actually very good at keeping things cold. If you need to keep food at a safe temperature over multiple days, check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">review of the best coolers</a> that use ice instead of ineffective thermoelectric devices. But if you only need to keep drinks or your lunch a bit cooler while you&#8217;re driving, the 29-quart <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001MQ7DQ/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koolatron &#8211; P27 Voyager</a> is the best thermoelectric cooler in a disappointing lineup.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>After searching for reviews, we found that only a few sites have really compared and tested electric coolers. We relied on the comparison from OutdoorGearLab to set our expectations, which is to say we realized that many buyers aren&#8217;t happy with these coolers.</p>
<p>We searched for coolers that customers liked most, and found a set of five with fairly good reviews and a similar set of features. We wanted to compare with a 45-quart ice-filled cooler from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">cooler review</a>, so we settled on that size as a baseline.</p>
<p>We specifically looked for an upgraded or higher-tier cooler to compare with mainstream models, and settled on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077HXJS6H/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dometic &#8211; TC35-DC-A</a> because of its thermostat control. Dometic isn&#8217;t the only company selling a model like this, but they have a good reputation among RV and van enthusiasts.</p>
<p>We also bought two smaller coolers with high review counts — the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001MQ7DQ/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koolatron &#8211; P27 Voyager</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007ZYH4BM/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Igloo &#8211; Iceless 28 Quart</a> — that we could use as a comparison for the effect of cooler capacity on cooling performance.</p>

<p>An electric cooler is a bit like the traditional <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">insulated ice chest coolers that we&#8217;ve reviewed before</a>, but it uses a thermoelectric “Peltier” device to move heat out of the cooler rather than absorbing it into ice.</p>
<p>The device itself seems almost too good to be true: Electricity carries heat from one side of a semiconductor pad to the other. Interestingly, that means if you reverse the polarity of the power cable, most of these coolers will turn into heaters.</p>
<p>These are usually advertised as &#8220;ice-free&#8221; coolers, and that&#8217;s how we used and tested them. You could add sealed gel ice packs to an electric cooler to help it absorb more heat, but dumping in a bag of ice can cause electrical shorts and isn&#8217;t recommended.</p>
<h3>Limitations of electric coolers</h3>
<p>There are two factors that limit the effectiveness of an electric cooler: the thermoelectric mechanism itself and the effectiveness of insulation.</p>
<p>The bigger the device and the more amperes of current you push through it, the more heat it can move. There are limits, though: Most thermoelectric systems can only change the temperature on one side by 30 or 40 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the problem of getting rid of all that heat on the outside: All the models we tested use an aluminum heatsink and fan to dissipate the heat once it&#8217;s on the outside of the cooler. Better performance would require larger, more complex heat-dissipation systems.</p>
<p>Coolers for drinks and snacks have another major hurdle to overcome. Even when the cooler has good insulation, If you’re opening the lid constantly, the heat rushing in makes efficiency quite poor.</p>
<h3>Power draw of electric coolers</h3>

<p>The coolers we tested are designed to only use 5 amps of 12-volt power, which is about the same draw as one headlight. That&#8217;s low enough that it won&#8217;t kill your battery over a short stop.</p>
<p>The battery for our tester&#8217;s Honda Odyssey minivan is rated for two hours of reserve capacity at 25 amps, so we could theoretically run one of these coolers for 8 hours before the battery would hit the bottom quarter of reserve life. You don&#8217;t ever want to go that low on the same battery you&#8217;re starting your vehicle with, though.</p>
<p>On a dedicated deep-cycle battery you can get away with more use, but most of us don&#8217;t have one of those in the car. These coolers are really only designed for active cooling while you&#8217;re driving or when you have access to a 120-volt AC outlet. (120-volt operation requires <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009PUQ3C/?tag=ybdecool-20">a separate adapter</a> not included with most electric coolers.)</p>
<h2 id="pros-and-cons">Pros and cons of electric coolers</h2>
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Electric coolers don’t require making or buying ice to keep lunch and drinks cool (or hot) while you&#8217;re driving.</li>
<li>No ice means no water soaking into your lunch.</li>
<li>Thermoelectric coolers are far less expensive than compressor-type refrigerators.</li>
<li>Fewer moving parts means that these coolers should be more reliable (or at least easier to repair) than refrigerators.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>An electric cooler won&#8217;t chill enough to protect raw meat on a hot day.</li>
<li>Most models aren&#8217;t as easy to clean as a good ice chest.</li>
<li>A thermoelectric cooler needs to run constantly, so it actually drains your battery faster when parked than a 12-volt compact fridge would.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vs-regular-coolers">Ice chests vs. electric coolers</h2>
<p>For the sizes that we tested, manufacturers rated the cooler performance at 40 degrees lower than the temperature outside the cooler, but that assumes a lot of things.</p>
<p>if you need to keep food (or anything else) below 40 degrees, you’d be better off using ice. When surrounded with ice, perishables are protected from heat for two or three days. So long as your food is in a waterproof container, even melted ice will typically keep food at safe temperatures for another day or so.</p>
<p>If you’re only keeping drinks chilled, or if you’re transporting something like medication that’s safe up to room temperature, an electric cooler will help you out without the constant re-stocking that makes ice inconvenient.</p>
<p>Adding frozen gel packs can help level the playing field between electric and regular coolers, but of course that still requires you to have access to a freezer.</p>
<h2 id="vs-fridges">Electric coolers vs refrigerators</h2>
<p>The key advantage that a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072MLT6QW/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">12-volt refrigerator like this 50-watt model from Dometic</a> has over a thermoelectric cooler is that it can keep your food cold even in extreme conditions.</p>
<p>Refrigerators use a coolant (like R-22, the modern replacement for Freon gas) that changes from liquid to gas inside a coiled metal tube. That process sucks all the heat out of your fridge very efficiently. A compressor makes that gas liquid again for another pass through the coil, and as the process repeats indefinitely, it can move an amazing amount of heat.</p>
<p>This phase-change system still works well on an incredibly hot day, but all those moving parts make a 12-volt fridge more expensive than a thermoelectric cooler.</p>
<p>Thermoelectric coolers will chill your drinks or help keep your lunch cold while your AC is on while you&#8217;re driving, but they need a constant supply of power. Reading <a href="http://campinnforum.com/community/threads/12v-120v-freezer-fridge.3816/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user testimonials about real-world use of 12-volt fridges and freezers</a>, it&#8217;s clear that the more expensive systems are more efficient at keeping things cold, but they still need extra battery capacity to be worthwhile.</p>
<p>Another big difference between an electric fridge and a thermoelectric cooler will be the built-in thermostat. A fridge cools quickly in short bursts to maintain a steady average temperature, while a thermoelectric cooler will need to run constantly and still not hit 40 degrees Fahrenheit on a hot day.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Internal size:</b> The size of a cooler is usually measured in quarts. The best way to keep food cool is to pack the cooler&#8217;s space full of pre-chilled or frozen beverages, so pick a size you&#8217;ll really use.</p>
<p><b>Shape:</b> Most coolers are roughly box-shaped, but some are designed to fit in between front bucket seats if you have that configuration in your vehicle.</p>
<p><b>Door orientation: </b>Coolers can be made to open upward, like an ice chest, or sideways, like a fridge. Some can work in both positions, but generally the top-opening models are the most versatile and popular.</p>
<p><b>Dividers and shelves:</b> If you have food that should be stored at different temperatures, large full-featured coolers should come with slide-in pieces that will help you keep specific items closer to or farther away from the cooling element.</p>
<p><b>Power draw:</b> Your vehicle&#8217;s battery has some reserve capacity, but you don&#8217;t want to risk getting stranded by using that all up. Higher power means better cooling power, though available models we looked at only differ by about 20 percent.</p>
<p><b>Thermostatic control: </b>A built-in thermostat will turn a premium cooler on and off to try and maintain a set temperature. This will save power if you&#8217;re only using it in an air-conditioned car or on a cloudy day, but in a heat wave it&#8217;ll be running full-time anyhow.</p>
<p><b>Drain plug: </b>This isn&#8217;t as critical a feature as it is for regular ice-filled coolers, but it still makes rinsing out an electric cooler much easier.</p>
<p><b>Heating mode:</b> Most thermoelectric coolers can be switched from chilling to heating simply by reversing the polarity of the power plug, moving heat into the cooler instead of out. This is a nifty perk if you&#8217;re delivering lunches, but our test crew agreed that they&#8217;d rarely use it.</p>

<p>We set up our group of coolers on the patio for six days of 90-plus-degree weather. Each cooler was loaded with a pack of hot dogs, a pair of yogurt cups, and a water bottle. All items were refrigerated to about 40° F before we loaded up the coolers, but the coolers themselves had been sitting in 80° outdoor temperatures.</p>
<p>The coolers were running off of household electrical power for this test, which required the use of adapters not included with most coolers.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re storing or transporting perishable food for more than a few hours, 40 degrees is the hottest temperature that will still stop bacteria from multiplying and keep your food safe.</p>
<p>We checked temperatures with an instant-read probe thermometer in the morning and afternoon, but we also tracked changes over the week with two SensorPush wIreless data-logging thermometers.</p>
<p>For a control, we loaded the top-ranked model from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">review of the best coolers</a>, the ORCA &#8211; 40 Quart Classic, with 20 pounds of ice and checked its temperature at the same time.</p>
<div id="visualizer-24388-1803291175" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-24388"></div>
<p>The first day of the test was overcast, with temperatures starting at 80 degrees and dropping to the mid 70s. This is close to the conditions inside the back of a car or truck, and the coolers did not perform as well as we&#8217;d hoped. After two hours, temperatures in most of the coolers stabilized at a mere fifteen degrees colder than outside air. The high starting temperature of the coolers just couldn&#8217;t be overcome by the thermoelectric systems.</p>
<p>As expected, the temperatures in the evening were much better, finally dropping down below 40 and even freezing in one unit when outside temperatures were in the 60s overnight. But that&#8217;s still not the performance necessary to keep perishable items like potato salad safe if you have to unplug when you&#8217;re stopped.</p>
<div id="visualizer-24394-581466607" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-24394"></div>
<p>When we looked at the temperatures from the two data-log thermometers, it was clear that the insulation and cooling power of these coolers is insufficient for use outside on a hot day. As soon as the sun hit the spot they were sitting at around 10 a.m., the temperature would climb above 50 in a better cooler or all the way up to 70 in a cheaper cooler. Things only dropped again when outside temperatures fell below 70 overnight.</p>
<p>We weren&#8217;t expecting these coolers to perform well in the hot sun, but look at these results and think about what conditions you&#8217;ll actually be using your cooler in.</p>
<p>Ice and bear-proof insulation like you&#8217;ll find on <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">the best coolers we&#8217;ve reviewed</a> are still far superior to a small thermoelectric device when it comes to keeping the heat out of your food.</p>
<p>That goes double when you consider that ice doesn&#8217;t need electricity to do its job. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009PUQ3C/?tag=ybdecool-20">A 120-volt adapter</a> will help if you&#8217;ve got power hookups or a hotel room overnight, but that&#8217;s not usually an option if you&#8217;re camping.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001MQ7DQ/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koolatron &#8211; P27</a> has the best combination of size and performance. With the best cooling performance on a 90-degree day, this 29-quart cooler will help keep your food and drinks cool.</p>
<p>Koolatron makes a wide range of electric cooler sizes, from a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JLNBW4/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">tiny six-pack chiller</a> to a full <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000Q754E4/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">45-quart party cooler</a>. We picked the P27 based on reputation among reviewers, and it didn&#8217;t disappoint. This cooler is an ideal size for family road trips, holding a two-liter bottle along with a few days&#8217; worth of snacks.</p>
<p>This cooler kept coldest on hot days during our test, but it&#8217;ll still allow the contents to get up around 50 degrees sitting outside on a 100-degree day. That&#8217;s fine for chilling drinks and a packed lunch you&#8217;re going to eat the same day, but if you&#8217;ve got your vehicle parked in the sun for any amount of time it won&#8217;t keep dairy products safe.</p>

<p>If you do want to keep food below 40 degrees in this cooler, there are a few essential tricks you&#8217;ll need to use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t leave the empty cooler in the car when it&#8217;s parked in the sun; take it with you so it starts out at room temperature rather than baking-hot.</li>
<li>Use frozen water bottles and gel packs whenever you can to help absorb heat on a hot day. Yes, that makes this a barely-upgraded ice chest, rather than a truly iceless cooler, but it will help keep your food safe. Don&#8217;t dump ice inside or get this cooler wet, though.</li>
<li>Make sure there&#8217;s some room for air to move inside the cooler and chill everything evenly. If you want to sort the items from most temperature sensitive to least sensitive, that will help too, but watch out for items sitting beside the chiller fan getting frozen.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&#8217;re just carrying lunch and a drink every day, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00009PGNS/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">18-quart Koolatron P-20</a> is a better buy, since it&#8217;s slim enough to fit between the front seats of a van or truck with bucket seats. But if you&#8217;ve got room for this bigger cube-shaped cooler, it&#8217;s more versatile.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking at buying anything bigger than the P27, you&#8217;ve got to seriously ask yourself if mediocre cooling performance will be worthwhile. Thermoelectric coolers are an excellent choice for drinks, but milk and other quick-spoiling food will need extra ice packs or some different kind of cooling solution.</p>
<p>One final note about quality: While we don&#8217;t have any complaints about the electronics or operation of this cooler, the Koolatron label was not applied carefully at the factory. Also, the plastic slide-lock is pretty stiff and flimsy. There was also tape residue on the side of the cooler we bought. This is a good cooler, but it&#8217;s not a shining example of quality control.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The size and performance of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001MQ7DQ/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koolatron &#8211; P27</a> is better than the other models we tested.</li>
<li>While the Koolatron is better at cooling than the others we tested, it&#8217;s still no match for a 100-degree heat wave even when plugged in.</li>
<li>This cube-shaped cooler can sit so the door opens to the side or from the top.</li>
<li>For taking drinks and food on a small picnic, this is excellent.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a cooler that has a bit more room, the 45-quart  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072PRFQL3/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wagan &#8211; EL6244</a> has the right features and design to make the most of thermoelectric technology.</p>
<p>Compared to the size of the Koolatron &#8211; P27, the Wagan is just less than double the length. The lid opens in two sections, and you also get a set of wheels and an expanding handle to help cart all your drinks around.</p>
<p>With enough carrying capacity for two full 24-pack flats of beverage cans, this is a great cooler for tailgating. Note, however, that if you fill this cooler completely with warm beer or soda, it will probably never be able to cool them as well as it all off the way a refrigerator wcould. Always chill your food or drinks at home before you pack an electric cooler.</p>

With wheels, divider shelves, and a drain, this is one of the better-designed coolers we tested. Cooling performance was third-rate, though.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072PRFQL3/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Like every other model we tested, the temperature spikes we measured inside this cooler during the hottest parts of the day were extreme. On a 100-degree day, the thermoelectric components can only keep the contents of this cooler at 54 degrees.</p>
<p>If you just want to keep your beverages at a more refreshing temperature without dealing with ice, it&#8217;ll do just fine. If you want to pack this with food and take it to a party, make sure you carefully pack the most perishable items next to a frozen water bottle or ice pack.</p>

<p>Other extra features that make this cooler stand out are removable dividers and a drain plug. The drain probably hurts insulation a bit, but it&#8217;s very nice for easy clean-out after a longer trip. The dividers make all the difference when you&#8217;re trying to keep your perishable items close to the chiller unit and want to fill up empty space with heat-absorbing frozen water bottles.</p>
<p>Another perk is built-in storage for the power cord: Tthe standard arrangement on most models is a little pig-tail electrical cord sticking out the side or a flush-mount socket, but Wagan tucks all the connections inside a pop-open door on the lid. The lid itself might crack if you let this cooler roll around in the back of a truck, but it keeps electrical connections safe from damage and keeps your cord from getting lost.</p>
<p>Despite the bigger size and extra features, the Wagan usually sells for about $15 less than the half-size Koolatron. It&#8217;s tricky to suggest that this is going to be a better pick for most people, though, since it did get 6 degrees warmer on a hot day.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072PRFQL3/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wagan &#8211; EL6244</a> is a bigger, better-equipped 45- quart cooler.</li>
<li>The lower price of the Wagan reflects performance, cooling is in the middle of the pack.</li>
<li>Wheels will help you move food and drinks around when you reach your perfect picnic spot.</li>
<li>Internal dividers are great at keeping your food and drinks separate.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077HXJS6H/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dometic &#8211; TC35-DC-A</a> is a cooler with extra features that might justify its cost among a select group of buyers, but in terms of pure functionality it’s not doing much extra. The main feature to note is a thermostat, which will allow you to fine-tune the internal temperature and save power.</p>
<p>Dometic is well-known for their RV and trailer accessories: Ffrom fridges to air conditioners, Dometic products are all designed to make life on the road a little bit more luxurious. Compared to the full-power portable freezers Dometic sells, the TC35 is just not all that compelling despite the lower price.</p>
<p>The Dometic kept our lunches cooler than the Wagan, but not as cold as the Koolatron.</p>

<p>The one extra feature that separates it from the rest of this lineup is a digital thermostat: you can set a range of temperature controls to fine-tune the cold (or heat) from the thermoelectric plate.</p>
<p>With a seven-step range between freezing and 60 degrees Ffahrenheit when in cooling mode, this is the kind of control that might make the Dometic really useful when transporting something temperature-sensitive that can&#8217;t freeze and can&#8217;t get too hot.</p>
<p>That kind of control sounds great, but like a speedometer on your minivan that goes up to 300 miles per hour, it&#8217;s misleading. The ability of this cooler to hit anything below 50 degrees is dependent more on the outside temperature than on the controls.</p>

It was pretty good at keeping things cold, but not good enough to justify the price.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077HXJS6H/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The lid on the Dometic seals securely, which is great for insulation performance, but the spring latch is pretty stiff, and our tester accidentally left the lid cracked open during one afternoon of testing because he didn&#8217;t push down hard enough.</p>
<p>Dometic was the only manufacturer to include an AC 120-volt power adapter with their cooler. Cheap 5-amp adapters are easy to source, but it was a nice touch.</p>
<p>Dometic&#8217;s build quality is actually right in line with the higher price you&#8217;re paying, which is nice to see. Everything about this cooler is a little bit more rigid and carefully finished. Where other coolers feel like boxes of plastic with cooling modules glued to the side, this feels like a product someone set out to design.</p>
<p>That said, a nice-looking cooler that doesn&#8217;t keep your egg salad sandwich from spoiling on a hot day isn&#8217;t where we&#8217;d recommend spending extra money. The Wagan is just as nice to use, if you don&#8217;t need a thermostat to keep your cooler from freezing.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000Q754E4/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koolatron &#8211; P95</a> is a larger 45-quart version of our 29-quart top pick, and it has one nice feature that sets it apart: aA two-position shelf that keeps food and drinks organized in layers or sections for easier access. That&#8217;s especially handy if you&#8217;re using this cooler so the door opens sideways, like a fridge.</p>
<p>Unlike the P27, though, the P95 had terrible cooling performance. Given that it&#8217;s probably the same components in a larger box that shouldn&#8217;t be too surprising, but the other large coolers performed better.</p>

<p>With the smallest internal capacity and the lowest price, the Igloo &#8211; Iceless 28 Quart cooler was also able to get our test lunch to the lowest temperature on an overcast summer day. The Igloo was truly freezing cold at 25.9 degrees on a 65-degree afternoon.</p>
<p>That performance was followed up with a flop, though, as the Igloo failed to get below 64 degrees on the following 97-degree day.</p>
<p>The cooling element had built up some frost during the extra-cold day that we assumed might account for some of the poor performance. Even after the frost was thoroughly melted the next day it was clear that the Igloo just didn&#8217;t have the insulation to keep its cool.</p>
<p>If your requirements are flexible and you just want a cheap cooler, the Igloo is not a bad design overall, with a useful carry handle and a good-looking exterior. Don&#8217;t set anything heavy on the lid, though, or the head-dissipating fan inside will start to rub on the plastic shroud.</p>
<p>The Igloo is the only cooler that we tested which fits comfortably between the front seats of our tester&#8217;s minivan, but that&#8217;s not enough to make it a good buy. After thorough testing, we&#8217;d check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U6YTMRM/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">small coolers from Wagan</a> before we&#8217;d settle on the Igloo for this role.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After thoroughly testing these electric coolers side-by-side with our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">best-in-class ice-filled cooler</a>, we&#8217;re fairly disappointed in all of them.</p>
<p>Despite claims that an electric cooler can get 40 degrees below ambient temperatures, we mostly saw temperatures that would quickly lead to spoiled food over the course of a long trip. You also need to supply 12-volt power constantly to keep things cold, or treat the electric cooler like a regular cooler and pack it with frozen items anyhow.</p>
<p>If you only need to keep pre-chilled food and drinks cold while you&#8217;re driving on long trips, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001MQ7DQ/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koolatron &#8211; P27 Voyager</a> is the top performer. This 29-quart model stayed coldest throughout our testing, and it&#8217;s a useful size for carrying picnic-sized meals.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for something a little bit bigger, the 46-quart <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072PRFQL3/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wagan &#8211; EL6244</a> has wheels, dividers and a drain feature that makes clean-up easier. It sacrifices cooling performance, but the price is also slightly lower.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After a full year of testing eight wiper brands in the rain and sun, we found out the real differences between wiper brands. The best windshield wiper is the Rain-X Latitude: It wipes well and fits most cars.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter a full year of testing eight top-rated windshield wipers in the rain and sun on a Toyota Corolla, we concluded that most wiper brands give you basically the same performance. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015JTJNQI/?tag=ybdwiper-20">Rain-X &#8211; Latitude</a> wins our pick for best windshield wiper. The Rain-X install bracket provides near-universal compatibility, which makes buying the right blades much easier. If you have a windshield that common wipers won&#8217;t fit well, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JU5VUK/?tag=ybdwiper-20">Bosch &#8211; Icon</a> line features different wiper curvatures that should help prevent fit-related problems.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>We spent days combing the web for clear indications of what makes a superior wiper. The few reviews we found presented mostly anecdotal evidence: basically, people put new wiper blades on their cars, and they’re happy, unless the blades don&#8217;t fit.</p>
<p>Bad fit can lead to streaks or even gaps in wiper coverage, so finding wipers that could match the fit of factory-original wipers was at the top of our checklist.</p>
<p>Many enthusiasts comment that their vehicles don&#8217;t work well with universal-fit wipers bought from the auto-parts store or gas station. The more prestigious your car, the more likely enthusiasts are to recommend buying replacements from the dealership.</p>
<p>Consumer Reports used to run tests of different wipers across their extensive fleet of test vehicles, but they gave up trying to find &#8220;better&#8221; wipers and now <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/wiper-blades/buying-guide/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simply recommend frequent replacement</a>.</p>
<p>Wirecutter has picked up where Consumer Reports left off; their comparison review is the only one we found that actually attempts to rank wipers against each other. We checked out all the top picks from the Wirecutter review, as well as some alternates they mentioned but didn&#8217;t test.</p>
<p>Finally, we went to Amazon and other retailers to find the top-rated and most-purchased wiper blades. We specifically looked for high overall scores to test the best blades against each other.</p>
<p>The negative scores on popular wipers (there are always negative reviews) pointed to some consistent problems that cause frustration. Streaks and noise are the most common complaints, which could result from dirt, but they&#8217;re also signs that wipers don&#8217;t fit a windshield well.</p>
<p>We selected a price range from $6 to $25 in order to compare premium and budget picks across a variety of popular types.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-wipers">Types of windshield wipers</h2>
<p>There are only a few categories of windshield wipers, based on the shape of the support bracket that presses the wiper blade evenly against the windshield.</p>
<p><b>Traditional support:</b> This wiper design is still very common and pretty much the same as it&#8217;s been for decades. The support bracket is actually a &#8220;tree,&#8221; with one large support holding two smaller supports that each press on four smaller brackets.</p>
<p>All of these pieces can swivel toward or away from the windshield to adjust to its contours, so the pressure of the wiper arm is evenly distributed around curves. The pressure points themselves do tend to wear faster than the rest of the blade, though.</p>

<p><b>Beam support:</b> This new support design is becoming standard for  luxury-class vehicles and upgrade trim packages., This bracket uses one long band of curved spring steel, rather than a set of swiveling arms, to maintain even pressure.</p>
<p>The beam design looks nice, and its low profile helps prevent snow and ice from building up and freezing your wiper. This type of wiper also minimizes aerodynamic drag at speed.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s almost always a rubber &#8220;spoiler&#8221; fin on the back of beam wipers to keep all that airflow from causing the blades to lift off when you put your foot down.</p>
<p>If your windshield has a tighter or flatter curve than the beam-support bracket is made for, the pressure won&#8217;t be as evenly applied across the wiper edge. Generally, though, wiper blades are flexible enough so this only happens in extreme cases.</p>
<p>Companies like Bosch claim that beam wipers made as original equipment for specific cars fit the contours of a windshield better. If that’s true, then any replacement blades you buy would have to be  comparable.</p>
<p><b>Hybrid support:</b> Most manufacturers also sell wipers that are closer to the look of a beam-type support but keep the traditional equal-pressure arms under a sleek cover. We didn&#8217;t test this type of wiper since it&#8217;s basically just a more attractive version of a traditional bracket.</p>
<p><b>Other designs for snow and ice:</b> Beam-type wiper blades are about as good as it gets for preventing snow and ice problems. If the wiper uses a traditional support system, the manufacturer can cover up the holes and gaps in the frame so that snow and ice can&#8217;t freeze the moving pieces together.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We used each of the eight wipers on a Toyota Corolla for approximately four weeks of testing in real-world conditions in southern California. After that break-in period, we tested each wiper to see if it still held up well and wiped away water cleanly.</p>
<p>Wear and tear on a wiper&#8217;s thin rubber blade is caused by several factors; baking in the sun&#8217;s ultraviolet-spectrum rays is the most damaging, followed by  oxidation from the air. We left all eight sets of wipers out in the sun for an additional 20 weeks to see what would happen to the rubber.</p>

[table id=248 /]
<p>We tested on a car with a J-hook connector, which is fairly common, but even if you have a wiper arm that everyone makes adapters for it&#8217;s best to check with a parts catalog for the correct length before you buy your wipers. We also checked each brand specifically for wipers compatible with the VW Beetle, Land Rover, and Honda Civic.</p>
<p>Rain-X won points here for selling a wiper with a near-universal adapter. For most cars on the road, you&#8217;ll only have to look up the lengths you need when buying.</p>
<p>Most parts catalogs are fairly easy to use, but bigger manufacturers like Bosch have four or five different styles of wipers that will fit your car. They don&#8217;t tell straight up &#8220;this is for cheapskates&#8221; or &#8220;these should be as good as you can get,&#8221; you&#8217;re mostly left to infer that after looking at prices on a retailer listing.</p>
<p>Of note is the Aero website: Aero has a vehicle-compatibility widget, but it has been broken every time we checked. The AERO wipers for J-hook cars are easy to find, but if you have some other type of attachment system you&#8217;re in for some detective work if you want to buy these wipers. They have installation instructions for a &#8220;Multifunction&#8221; wiper, but if you want to buy it you&#8217;ll have to search for your car model on Amazon, or figure out a comparable model AERO has an Amazon listing for.</p>
<h3>Wiper life and durability</h3>
<p>In theory, better rubber means better wiper life. But after testing eight different models side-by-side, it seems clear that the premium-replacement market is using basically the same rubber on most models.</p>
<p>Sunlight and oxygen are the big aging factors, but another source of damage is ice, especially if you&#8217;re living in an area where scraping windshields is a daily chore before driving. Sand, road salt and gravel can also damage rubber wiper blades.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002Z9QXK/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PIAA&#8217;s Super Silicone</a> wiper has the only significantly different compound we tested, and buyer reports insist their lifespan is much longer. However, we saw no difference in our one year test.</p>
<h3>Streaks</h3>
<p>After the break-in period, we looked for evidence of better or worse performance when it came to actually clearing away water. To keep your windshield streak free, you need even wiper contact.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t see any streaks when we tested with these blades. That&#8217;s not to say they&#8217;re all perfect, though: The ability of a wiper to maintain contact is partly determined by a good match between the shape of the windshield and the design of the support. Even though we didn&#8217;t get streaks or skips with a particular wiper on a particular windshield, it doesn&#8217;t mean everyone will have the same luck.</p>
<p>With beam-type supports, the curvature of the springy backing and the flexibility of the wiper edge have to be just right to get even pressure across the entire wiper blade. If you like beam blades, Bosch bends them in three different curve profiles to help get a better fit. You can check which blade is recommended for your vehicle on <a href="https://www.boschautoparts.com/en/auto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bosch&#8217;s website</a>.</p>
<h3>Chatter resistance</h3>
<p>When your wiper sticks to the windshield rather than gliding smoothly, it can start to make an unpleasant rubbing sound that&#8217;s usually called &#8220;chatter&#8221; in reviews.</p>
<p>Chatter is caused by blades sticking, but the underlying cause is usually uneven pressure. In our tests, beam-type wipers were all prone to some chatter when new or after we cleaned the windshield.</p>
<p>After the break-in period, the problem improved, and none of the wipers were loud enough to be annoying. In our tests, the minor chatter we saw did not leave streaks or gaps in wiping.</p>
<h3>Ice and snow performance</h3>
<p>We didn&#8217;t run tests with this group in ice and snow, but the major factor for winter driving is having wiper blades freeze from collected snow and ice. Beam-type blade supports don&#8217;t have as much structure to catch snow, so they’re always less prone to problems.</p>

<p>Of all the wipers we tested, the premium-brand <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015JTJNQI/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rain-X &#8211; Latitude</a> wipers seemed the most questionable value in the beginning. But after we checked the Rain-X compatibility and saw how many different vehicles they support with this wiper, we started to warm up to the brand. An easy installation secured Rain-X&#8217;s position.</p>
<p>Rain-X is one of the few brands that sells a beam-support wiper with an included bracket for a full range of wiper-arm types. Basic instructions are included on an insert in the box, but the video installation guides on the Rain-X website are even more thorough in covering the different install procedures for each type of wiper arm.</p>
<p>This wide compatibility means that if you&#8217;re buying new blades, the only question you really need to answer when locating the right Rain-X wiper is length. In comparison, other brands present you with entirely different wiper types for various attachment systems. We love that we can recommend the Rain-X wiper blade and know people will be able to install it easily.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a big enough car nerd to remember which attachment system your cars and trucks use, there are other windshield wipers that would be a better value.</p>

Instructions are easy to follow, and the cost is fairly low. The water-repellent treatment doesn't last long, but it's a perk. The only downside is if your windshield has curves that are tricky to fit.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015JTJNQI/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Rain-X is best known for their liquid windshield conditioner. Applying silicone oil (dimethylpolysiloxane) as a water repellent makes a lot of sense, and many good windshield washer fluid formulas include it.</p>
<p>Putting that treatment on a wiper blade as a hard coating, though, is a less obvious method of application. These wipers do leave some silicone behind for a few weeks, but after that they&#8217;re pretty normal beam-style wipers. If cost were the biggest difference, we&#8217;d say spend the money on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MXMCDYX/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a bottle of Rain-X</a> instead of upgraded wipers.</p>
<h3>Possible fit issues</h3>
<p>Some user reviews report streaking problems with the Rain-X wiper blades. In our four weeks of testing and a follow-up test after a year in the sun, we didn&#8217;t see any streaks.</p>
<p>It seems likely that the streaks reported by these users were caused by uneven contact between the wiper edge and the windshield.</p>

<p>Beam-support wipers can&#8217;t respond as well to curvature in the middle of the wiper path, but we&#8217;ve also seen reports of a bad fit with traditional support brackets. If you&#8217;re having difficulty with streaks, the Bosch &#8211; Icon wipers have a better reputation for perfect fit.</p>

<p>If you find that other beam-type wiper blades don&#8217;t clean all of your windscreen effectively, we suggest trying the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JU5VUK/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bosch &#8211; Icon</a> beam-type blades.</p>
<p>Bosch is one of the few manufacturers to make their beam-type wipers with a different bend radius for different cars. The driver&#8217;s side almost always gets an &#8220;A&#8221; curvature, since it&#8217;s a wide wiper working on the flattest part of the windshield.</p>
<p>For the passenger side, Bosch designates a B or sometimes an original equipment (OE) specific curve to match shorter wiper blades to a tighter curve.</p>
<p>Even pressure across the edge of the wiper is essential to good performance, but Bosch also sells their wipers with specific brackets to fit different wiper arms. If you&#8217;ve got a German or British automobile, there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ll need the OE variant.</p>
<p>In a few cases, even the adapters included in the Icon package won&#8217;t fit your car. So it&#8217;s important to always <a href="https://www.boschautoparts.com/en/auto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check for compatibility on the wiper manufacturer&#8217;s website</a> before you buy.</p>
<p>While Bosch does have a complete database of automobiles with links to each wiper that will fit your vehicle, the company doesn&#8217;t fully explain the differences between their products. The Icon line is popular and easy to find at parts stores or online; but if you have a car that Bosch doesn&#8217;t make an Icon wiper for, it&#8217;s hard to say what your next-best fit will be.</p>

If you see streaks with other brands, Bosch is worth a try. There are three different models (A, B and OE) for each length, check the Bosch website to see which is right for your vehicle.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JU5VUK/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>When buying auto parts online, remember that Amazon&#8217;s compatibility database is often inaccurate. Always check the manufacturer&#8217;s compatibility list if you&#8217;re doubtful about what length or attachment system you have.</p>
<p>We should note that the installation for the Bosch adapters wasn&#8217;t as intuitive as expected. If you throw away the cardboard on the back of the box, you might have difficulty finding Bosch’s installation instructions elsewhere since they have so many wiper types.</p>
<p>Bosch’s wiper is definitely the sleekest of all the beam-type blades we tested. If you want blades that look great, this is probably your best bet.</p>

<p>In use, these Bosch wipers work very well. We didn&#8217;t have any concerns with squeaking, streaking or wear. That said, these are premium wipers that cost nearly four times more than other brands.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t need the specialized fit of Bosch wipers, their cost is  hard to justify. Had it been easier to find the right blade for particular vehicles, Bosch would probably have taken first place in our round-up. As it is, we hope we won&#8217;t have to use the clunky vehicle selection system on Bosch&#8217;s website again.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JU5VUK/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bosch &#8211; Icon</a> wipers are the best-looking blades we found.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;ve got a windshield with curves that other wipers can&#8217;t follow, Bosch probably fits better.</li>
<li>This is a premium wiper, but it&#8217;s not the most expensive we tested.</li>
<li>Performance from the Icon is very good, and this is the most-recommended brand we found.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000PL2IAY/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bosch &#8211; Excel+</a> is the premium version of Bosch&#8217;s traditional wiper design. At about double the price of economy designs like Anco, these wipers aren’t cheap.</p>
<p>Excel+ wipers are better built than budget wipers, though, and since they&#8217;re fairly easy to find, they&#8217;ll almost always be less expensive than a brand-specific original part.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re lucky, these are even nicer than the wipers that came with your car for far less money than you&#8217;d pay at the dealer&#8217;s parts counter.</p>
<p>With a traditional support bracket compared to the beam supports on our top picks, the Excel+ won&#8217;t be quite as good in the snow. Plenty of drivers get by with wipers like the Excel+ in snowy places, but beam designs are a nice upgrade.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002Z9QXK/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PIAA&#8217;s Super Silicone blades</a> have an amazing reputation among car enthusiasts as long-lasting wiper blades. Some claim that they last decades longer than rubber wipers. Those reports are difficult to verify, because it’s very rare that any two cars (even if owned by the same person) would get exactly the same exposure to the sun.</p>
<p>PIAA also claims that the silicone from their wipers will leave a water-repellent coating on your windshield. In theory, this is similar to the coated Rain-X blades; the effect, however, should be longer-lasting, since the silicone oils come from the blade itself and are not just a coating.</p>
<p>We like the PIAA blades, and it&#8217;s clear that they care about making them well. <strong>PIAA also includes a cleaning and silicone treatment wipe with the wiper that will help boost the water-repellent effect while you&#8217;re breaking in the blades.</strong></p>
<p>In a side-by-side test, a PIAA blade running on the PIAA treatment and the Rain-X blade running on Rain-X performed the same. Both wiped well, and the water was obviously beading up and rolling off more easily than on an untreated area.</p>
<p>If we take for granted that the silicone blades will survive two years instead of one year, they&#8217;re a better value than Rain-X or Bosch. Lifespan is only a part of what&#8217;s important, though: you still need to make sure they fit well.</p>
<p>The Super Silicone wipers were a good fit on our car, but note that the Super Silicone model only works with a J-hook attachment. PIAA includes four different sizes so you can get an exact fit; but if you want silicone blades with a vehicle that uses other attachment systems, your best bet is the more expensive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004BT8DMI/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PIAA &#8211; Si-Tech</a> blade.</p>

<p>For a reasonable price, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000CD6GLM/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Valeo &#8211; Ultimate</a> wipers should work just as the premium brands for most people. Valeo isn&#8217;t a name you&#8217;re likely to recognize, but like Bosch, this French company is making original parts for cars worldwide.</p>
<p>We like these beam-type wipers very much, and they performed well. The look of these &#8220;ultimate&#8221; wipers is really the only place we had issues: Valeo uses a thinner rubber spoiler fin on the top side of the wiper, so you can see the painted steel (and even what looks like a batch number) underneath.</p>
<p>As an original equipment manufacturer, Valeo makes wipers to fit a wide range of cars, so <a href="https://www.valeoservice.us/en-us/catalogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check their fit guide</a> if you have something different than the typical J-hook attachment system.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018R88VM/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Denso &#8211; First Time Fit</a> wipers are pretty ordinary, and Denso probably made the factory-original wipers on our test car, a Toyota Corolla.</p>
<p>If you want a real factory-original equivalent part, Denso is the second-largest original equipment parts manufacturer in the world. The First Time Fit line is designed explicitly to give you the right parts without bulky adapters.</p>
<p>These wipers are well-made, and Denso has parts to fit a wide range of vehicles. For the amount we paid, though, the benefits of beam-type wipers in the snow (and in terms of looks) make those models an obvious upgrade.</p>
<h3>Anco &#8211; AeroVantage</h3>

<p>When we looked closely at all of the wipers we tested, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009IK742/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anco &#8211; AeroVantage</a> was the only design that showed obvious cost-cutting. Where other brands use through-hole rivets to support the back-and-forth pivot of the support arms, Anco uses bent-over tabs.</p>
<p>Anco&#8217;s rubber blade also seems like it might be cut from a longer extruded piece and clamped in place with the steel supports and backing, compared to the more secure molded rubber on other wipers. This design allows the blade to slide back and forth as much as an inch along its track.</p>
<p>These blades wiped well in our test, and that makes their incredibly low price enticing: They go for about half the price of most wipers and a quarter of the cost of the PIAA blades. The security of the other wipers definitely feels worth the extra money, though, and should mean more even pressure on trickier windshields than ours.</p>
<h3>AERO</h3>

<p>If you like the low-profile beam shape but you&#8217;re not especially picky about special coatings, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RW7X1QE/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AERO &#8211; Premium All-Season windshield wiper blades</a> are a great buy. At less than $20 a pair, you get a great high-end look and the same good wiping performance as most of the other blades we tested.</p>
<p>We passed on making AERO a runner-up for a few reasons. The J-hook attachment style is popular and works on our test vehicle, but AERO doesn&#8217;t make it easy to buy their Multifunction Wiper model with a universal adapter. There are listings on Amazon (the main retailer for AERO) for some vehicle-specific models, but they all use the same images as the J-hook version, so it&#8217;s hard to tell what clips they include.</p>
<p>AERO has a 10 percent rate of one-star reviews on this item, which is not far outside the norm. The majority of purchasers seemed to have the same great experience we did, but some reviewers found that these wipers skip entire sections of their windshields.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Good windshield wipers can make the difference between seeing well in bad weather and not seeing at all. Windshield wipers can last for a very long time, but if you notice any reduced visibility, and washing the blades doesn&#8217;t help, it&#8217;s time to buy new blades.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re buying a windshield wiper because your old blades are falling off, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015JTJNQI/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rain-X &#8211; Latitude</a> blades are a nice upgrade from most original equipment and should fit nearly any car. Make sure to check or look up the length of your current wipers so you know which blades to get.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been unhappy about streaks and noises from other wiper blades, it&#8217;s worth checking out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JU5VUK/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bosch &#8211; Icon</a> blades. They&#8217;re designed in three different curvatures to fit different window shapes, and they&#8217;re a little bit sleeker than the Rain-X blades.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e took four top-rated car seats and asked six experienced parents to size them up. After two months of testing and a thorough debrief, our team picked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BRQWV8H/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Britax &#8211; B-Safe Ultra</a> as the best infant car seat. Easy-to-use installation and harness adjustment features make this a great seat to work with and you get extra installation flexibility with European-style shoulder belt routing. If you&#8217;re looking for advanced crash protection features, the Britax is no slouch, but we also like the compact <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VHVID1O/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cybex &#8211; Aton2</a> for its extra features.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Shopping for car seats can be a nightmare. The number of brands is staggering and they all seem to be offering different approaches to keep your baby safe.</p>
<p>We spent three weeks checking reviews from the top baby product test websites, like Wirecutter, Consumer Reports and BabyGearLab. Some of the models mentioned in those reviews have been replaced with new designs, so we talked to retail associates at two local BuyBuyBaby stores and looked at video coverage from baby product trade shows.</p>
<p><strong>We honed in on the $200 price bracket as the best value.</strong> If you spend $180–230 you can get some premium features that trickle down from more expensive seats. Spending more than that doesn&#8217;t seem to get you more features than the Britax has, while the sacrifices you make at a lower price point are pretty big losses in convenience.</p>
<p>The features we prioritized when shopping were all related to daily use: adjusting the fit of the harness, moving the seat from one car to another, and using the seat &#8220;bucket&#8221; without its base (like you would in a taxi or Uber).</p>
<p>We compiled a list of 15 car seats and inspected them in-store before purchasing our test lineup. We also checked Amazon buyer reviews and looked for recall notices.</p>

<p>Put simply, if you want to move a baby in a car, you need a purpose-built car seat. <strong>If you&#8217;ve done your planning for delivery day, you&#8217;ve probably already found out that hospitals and birth centers won&#8217;t let you take a baby home unless you have an approved infant car seat.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to plan ahead and make sure you buy and know how to install your car seat a few months before your due date. You don&#8217;t want to be caught off guard if baby arrives early!</p>
<p>There are two main qualifications for a seat that will protect a newborn. First, the car seat has to be rear-facing (and in the back seat). In a crash, the force of baby&#8217;s weight has to be spread out along the padded back of the seat, not just into the straps. Most states require rear-facing seats for the first two years, and many safety experts advise keeping your kids rear-facing for as long as possible.</p>
<p>Second, the seat has to recline quite low, but not too low. Official specs range from 35 to 40 degrees incline. Recline is necessary so a newborn’s head won&#8217;t just flop down onto their chest, but if it’s too low the momentum in a crash would just go into the shoulder straps instead of the back of the seat.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible to move your baby to a less-reclined seat once they have enough neck strength, but typically a baby won&#8217;t be able to sleep comfortably sitting up — most people keep the reclined position until their baby is too big for an infant car seat.</p>

<strong>Extra crash-protection features:</strong> Most car seats will make claims about design considerations that specifically go above and beyond the baseline crash test performance allowed under federal regulations. Sorting through these claims, and linking up claims with tested results, is tricky at best.</p>
<p><strong>Installation aids:</strong> The more readily apparent benefits come from systems that make securing your car seat to the anchors in your car quick and simple. Clips and belt-paths are color coded, and safety labels point out exactly what to do for an installation. Most seats in the same price bracket have comparable features, but not all are created equal.</p>
<p><strong>Options for no-base installs:</strong> If you find yourself taking a car seat in a taxi, Uber or your mom&#8217;s car, will you be able to secure the carrier without the base? European standards include the option to wrap the shoulder belt around the front of the carrier for easier and more secure installs — you never know when you may need it.</p>
<p><strong>Seat size and adjustment:</strong> Most parents don&#8217;t know exactly how big their baby is when they buy a car seat, so it&#8217;s important to have a seat that can fit a range of heights. It should also be easy to adjust the seat straps to grow with your baby.</p>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> If you leave the car seat installed in a car all the time, this may not be a critical feature. But if you&#8217;re lugging one of these carriers around for extended periods of time, you may appreciate saving a few pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Materials:</strong> All the big car seat manufacturers target parents with exclusive materials and patterns. We didn&#8217;t find anything ultra-luxe like flame-retardant-free wool in the $200 price bracket we tested.</p>
<h2 id="crash-testing">A word about crash tests</h2>
<p>Crash test results are an interesting wrinkle in car seat safety. The National Highway Transportation Safety Agency (NHTSA) has rules about minimum car seat protection and they test car seats extensively to help make every seat on the road safe, but many car seat manufacturers claim safety features that aren&#8217;t related to the core set of crash test measurements.</p>
<p>After running a four-year pilot study, the NHTSA determined that &#8220;<a href="https://one.nhtsa.gov/Laws-&amp;-Regulations/Child-Passenger-Safety/Regulations-Safety-Standards-and-Safety-Rating-Program-for-Child-Restraint-Systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a rating program based on simulated crashes would not provide practicable, readily understandable, or meaningful information to consumers.</a>&#8221; Thus, if you see a safety &#8220;rating&#8221; on a car seat at a retailer or in a review, it&#8217;s not based on a standardized test that&#8217;s recognized by the NHTSA.</p>
<p>Review publications like Consumer Reports have chosen to run crash tests themselves. These tests are looking at factors outside the scope of federal regulations to see if they can find differences between car seats. An example is side-impact testing: some review tests are designed to show an absolute worst-case scenario of a vehicle sliding sideways at 30 miles per hour and colliding with a stationary object exactly on the door next to a car seat installed in a side seat.</p>
<p>Nobody&#8217;s saying that side-impact performance isn&#8217;t something worth paying attention to, but you should spend more time reading an instruction manual and finding a way to install your car seat in a center seat than you do combing through crash test results.</p>
<p><strong>Learn about how the anchors in your car and attachment systems on your car seat work together to make a tight, secure installation.</strong> That, and driving safely, are the best things you can do to protect your children.</p>
<p>The NHTSA does <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/car-seats-and-booster-seats/clasificaciones-de-facilidad-de-uso" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provide a rating on how easy a car seat is to use</a>. They look at instruction manuals, installation features, labels and harness restraints. We tested four car seats for ourselves, and the official scores line up closely with our assessment.</p>
<h2 id="convertible-car-seats">What about a convertible car seat?</h2>
<p>A convertible car seat makes sense in a lot of ways. You buy just one seat and can use it in different positions for years — maybe even until your child is tall enough to use a seat belt without a booster.</p>
<p>A convertible can replace three different car seats and that&#8217;s a big money saver. You also get all the safety benefits of a larger seat, and if you want to spend money on premium features you only have to spend it once.</p>

<p><strong>The downside, though, is literally huge.</strong> The back of a convertible is so tall that when it&#8217;s reclined in rear-facing mode for an infant, it takes up a lot of extra room. In anything but a minivan, it&#8217;s a tricky fit.</p>
<p>In our experience, this even makes it difficult to get convertibles to recline far enough for use with newborns. Unless your vehicle has legroom to spare, a dedicated infant car seat makes far more sense for the first year.</p>
<p>Once your baby is big enough to sit in a more upright rear-facing position that won&#8217;t take up all your legroom, these tall-back designs make a lot more sense. You&#8217;re usually ready for this shift when your baby is one year old, but follow manufacturer instructions about height and weight limits.</p>
<p>If your family is continuing to grow, separate infant, toddler and booster seats can be a good way to get the most value out of your purchases. <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-booster-car-seat/">Check out our review of forward-facing booster seats for big kids here</a>.</p>

<p>We asked a team of five moms and one dad to try out these car seats. They compared ease of installation and fit with their babies, plus we tested each of these car seats with our universally-compatible double strollers.</p>
<p>We installed the carriers in cars with and without bases, and our lead tester&#8217;s family used them all to carry B.J. — a chunky-monkey little newborn — during shopping trips and outings for two months.</p>
<h3>Installation of the car seats</h3>
<h3>[table id=216 /]</h3>
<p>For testing, we installed car seats in four different vehicles: a compact sedan, minivan and two SUVs. Obviously, the more space between the seats, the easier installation was. The &#8220;Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children&#8221; (LATCH) system is a nearly universal standard that makes attaching seats pretty similar across vehicles.</p>
<p>There are some perks and quirks that differentiate each system, but our biggest takeaway is that you should get a car seat with some easy-to-use tension aid for secure installation. The Cybex is a good example, with a giant tensioning lever that makes sure the belt or latch strap is extra tight without all the knee-on-seat gymnastics you&#8217;d need to get the same results with some other systems.</p>
<p><strong>In comparison, the basic strap-mounted tensioner that Graco uses on all their seats requires too much work to get tight, and even more work to remove.</strong> Our lead tester has used that system on four different infant seats and convertibles, and he&#8217;s ready for this bare-bones style of LATCH strap to just disappear.</p>
<p>All the car seats we checked provide a mechanism for leveling out the base when on an angled car seat, and they all provided a nearly identical degree of adjustment. Sadly, many cars have seat padding that&#8217;s even more dramatic than these systems account for and you may still find yourself adding rolled up receiving blankets, towels or pieces of pool noodle under the car seat base to help level it out.</p>
<h3>Length and leg room</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20315" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/installed-seat-space.jpg" alt="car seat length" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/installed-seat-space-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/installed-seat-space-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/installed-seat-space-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/installed-seat-space-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/installed-seat-space-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/installed-seat-space-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/installed-seat-space-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/installed-seat-space-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/installed-seat-space-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/installed-seat-space-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/installed-seat-space-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/installed-seat-space-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/installed-seat-space-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/installed-seat-space-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/installed-seat-space-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/installed-seat-space-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/installed-seat-space-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/installed-seat-space-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
Installing a car seat in the back also often means losing some leg room in the front; about the only way to get around that is to drive a minivan. We checked the length of the seats in a few different positions, and found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VHVID1O/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cybex &#8211; Aton2</a> gives you the most space.<br />
When resting on level ground as in the photo above, the Britax has a slight edge over the Chicco, but if you adjust the recline angle for a newborn the difference basically disappears.</p>
<h3>Installation without a base</h3>
<p>This is where the better seats start to distinguish themselves. Britax and Cybex both provide a &#8220;euro-style&#8221; belt path. This means that if you&#8217;re installing the car seat with a three-point retractable shoulder belt, you can actually wrap the shoulder belt around the front of the seat and use the retracting mechanism to make it more secure.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in a situation where you have the car seat and not the base, this extra level of security is a big deal. H-clip accessories (provided with the Chicco and Graco) can help make a conventional belt path more secure, but most of us will struggle holding everything in place to get the belt tight. The wrap-around installation is even more secure and much easier to do by yourself.</p>
<h3>Fit and tension of harness</h3>
<h3>[table id=215 /]</h3>
<p>All of the models we tested except for the older Graco have a front-adjusting harnesses. On basic models like the Graco &#8211; Snugride 30, you have to adjust the fit of the harness from the underside of the seat, which is awkward at best. Graco has addressed this with a front adjustment on the Snuglock 30.</p>
<p>Once you move up to a quick-release tension system with an adjustment strap in the front, it&#8217;s easy to tighten and loosen the harness every time you take baby in the car. Just pull the &#8220;tail&#8221; of the harness with one hand while you check for fit with your other hand. Releasing tension to make unbuckling easier was simple for all of these systems.</p>
<p>The other adjustment that you&#8217;ll need to make periodically, though, is harness height. Straps should always start at a level just below your baby&#8217;s shoulders to pull them down into the bottom of the seat.</p>

<p><strong>Britax is the only manufacturer we found that sells a seat with a no-rethread harness in this price bracket.</strong> When your baby hits a growth spurt, that lets you quickly and easily adjust shoulder harness height without having to take apart the seat.</p>
<p>Rethreading isn&#8217;t very difficult if you read the directions carefully and pay attention to which slot you&#8217;re coming from and which slot you&#8217;re moving to — but it takes time and you have to take your baby out of the carseat. Any feature that helps you keep up and stay sane is well worth considering.</p>
<h3>Weight and age range</h3>
<p>How do you know when your baby is too big for a car seat? This is one of the tricky parts of purchasing your car seat: you may not even know your baby&#8217;s sex when you purchase a car seat, let alone how tall they&#8217;ll be at six months of age.</p>
<p>Weight and height ranges are prominent in the specs for these car seats, but in almost every case you&#8217;ll find that the reason you have to stop using a carseat is that your child&#8217;s torso is too tall, regardless of how short their legs may be.</p>
<p>We checked the car seats for &#8220;seat back length&#8221; in the chart above by measuring along the back-board where your baby&#8217;s spine rests, from the bottom of the seat to the rim of the seat. Note that manufacturers typically consider a seat too small when your baby&#8217;s head comes up to an inch before the head comes up to the top of the back-board part of the seat.</p>
<p>Legs can stick out of a carseat without any issues, but if the head is within an inch of the top level of the carseat, your baby is growing up fast and ready for a bigger car seat.</p>
<p>The other factor to consider is the width of the cushions included. The Cybex &#8211; Aton2 has the biggest, fluffiest cushions and the second-narrowest &#8220;bucket,&#8221; which makes it the best fit for tiny babies. One of our testers, A.M., seemed entirely too small in the Graco and Chicco.</p>
<h3>Stroller compatibility</h3>
<p>Sadly, this is an area where combinations of strollers and car seats are either fine or not good at all.</p>
<p>We looked at compatibility across all the major stroller and car seat brands, and there&#8217;s a pattern: the strollers from big-name manufacturers like Britax, Graco and Chicco just don&#8217;t work with other car seat brands.</p>
<p><strong>If you want compatibility with a stroller that doesn&#8217;t come from your car seat manufacturer, there are still options.</strong> A few third-party stroller manufacturers like Joovy and Contours have done a good job of providing universal fit adapters: this means you can put nearly any car seat into a cradle and strap it down securely.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers also provide click-in compatibility with adapters for a wide range of brand compatibility. It&#8217;s not free, but it gives you all the convenience of a made-to-fit travel system. One of the top picks in our review of the best double strollers, the Contours &#8211; Options Elite, makes adapters to fit all major car seats.</p>

<p>Picking a winner from this group of award-winning car seats was actually easier than we thought it would be. After comparing all of the features and using the car seats, our testers nearly all said the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BRQWV8H/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Britax &#8211; B-Safe Ultra</a> is the car seat they&#8217;d choose to take home.</p>
<p>The Britax is a bit bigger than the others we tested. At 11.5 pounds, it&#8217;s the heaviest, and at 26.5 inches it&#8217;s the longest carrier front to back. We didn&#8217;t have trouble fitting it in our tester&#8217;s Corolla, though, even in a side seat behind the driver. Yes, there was more leg room with the Cybex, but when it&#8217;s in the base the Britax is slightly shorter than the Chicco despite giving more room to grow.</p>
<p>The Britax seat is also the deepest when measured from the bottom to top where your baby&#8217;s back will rest, so there&#8217;s more room to grow before you need to move up to a bigger seat.</p>
<p>Installing the B-Safe base is a breeze. Coming from three years of using various Graco seats with fiddly strap-mounted tensioners, one tester admired the way Britax lets you pull on two independant LATCH straps directly. This gives a little bit more control and feedback than tying them together in a single pull-strap, like Chicco does, or forcing you to rely on a lever, as Cybex does.</p>
<p><strong>The NHTSA rates this a 24 out of 25 for ease of use — and an easy-to-use car seat is a safe car seat.</strong> Labels are clear, instructions are well-written, and the important installation and adjustment components are color coded and easy to use.</p>

The B-Safe Ultra has easier strap adjustment, better options for temporary installation in Grandma's car or an Uber, and a great look and feel. This isn't a compact or lightweight car seat, but it's top-rated for easy installation and adjustment.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BRQWV8H/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Britax provides two key features on this model that are still rare at this competitive price point.</p>
<p>The first is an adjustable-height harness system. Instead of taking your car seat apart after every growth spurt, you can just slide the adjuster up and down to one of six positions. No complicated buckles, no forgetting to thread the straps through the head rest pad, no excuses. The Britax is the only car seat we found in this price bracket with a no-rethread harness.</p>
<p>The second distinct feature is the European-style belt path for installing without the base. If you only ever use your car seat in one car, maybe you&#8217;ll never use this feature. But that one time your spouse leaves you at home to spend the afternoon with Grandma and the base is still in the minivan, you&#8217;ll be thankful for the option.</p>
<p>There are other safe ways to install a car seat without a base (always check the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions to see your options). But wrapping the shoulder belt around the front of a car carrier is so much quicker, easier and more secure it&#8217;s hard to believe this isn&#8217;t a standard feature for every car seat.</p>
<p>Both of these features are missing from the base-model B-Safe 35, and the better seat belt path option is still missing on the Elite, so we&#8217;d definitely recommend spending the $30 or so to upgrade to the Ultra.</p>
<p>The padding inside this top model of the B-Safe line is plush and smooth. In our tests, we didn&#8217;t have any difficulty wiping off spit-up and snacks, but it&#8217;s also easy to remove the cover for washing. We liked the shoulder strap pads better than most, since they don&#8217;t have exposed snaps, seams or velcro to leave an impression on baby&#8217;s neck.<br />

<p>The flip-up sun shade feels just a little bit more luxurious, and it offers better coverage than any other shade except Chicco&#8217;s zip-on accessory extension.</p>
<p>If you want a little bit more in the way of safety-conscious design, the Britax &#8211; Endeavours is the same as the B-Safe, but the base has an anti-rebound bar bolted on for about $60. (Yes, it&#8217;s literally the same base with an added part. No, you can&#8217;t buy the bar separately.)</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Britax &#8211; B Safe Ultra packs in nearly every convenience feature for a reasonable price.</li>
<li>With no-rethread adjustment, you have no excuse not to keep shoulder straps at the correct level as your baby grows.</li>
<li>This base is easy to install: the carrier connects and disconnects easily.</li>
<li>A European-style shoulder belt path makes this carrier easier to install securely, even without the base.</li>
<li>The sun visor provides ample shade.</li>
<li>This is a bigger, heavier car seat, which is a good thing for safety.</li>
<li>Gets a near-perfect score for ease of use from the NHTSA and from our testers.</li>
</ul>

<p>For something a little different, we looked to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VHVID1O/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cybex &#8211; Aton2</a>. This dark horse contender comes from Germany, and it comes with distinctive features that set it apart. It wasn&#8217;t the most convenient to use every day, so it narrowly missed top spot, but it&#8217;s still a car seat we like.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about how compact this car seat is: at just less than nine pounds, it&#8217;s not the lightest seat we tested, but it&#8217;s close. It&#8217;s definitely the easiest to fit in a compact car, though, with a design that maximizes the amount of space you have between seats.</p>
<p>The Aton line also has a base that&#8217;s easy to install, with a large flip-up lever that presses down on your LATCH straps to suck the base tight into your seat. You can get the same effect by pushing down on a base and pulling hard, but some people will prefer this mechanical advantage. The NHTSA gave this car seat full marks for installation.</p>
<h3>Extra safety features</h3>
<p>Cybex includes two features that are rarely seen in the U.S. market at any price. The first is a &#8220;load leg&#8221; feature that sticks out from the base. This leg is designed to absorb forward inertia in case of a head-on crash. The LATCH tethers will do a great job of preventing a car seat from flying forward, but as the seat cushion underneath compresses there&#8217;s still room for momentum to rock the seat forward, then rebound.</p>

<p>The other unique feature is a &#8220;linear side-impact protection&#8221; (LSP) system. These are two plastic wings that snap out, only for use when you install the Cybex in a side position next to a door or panel — never when seated beside a person or another car seat. The LSP is designed to absorb side impact energy which would otherwise cause the seat to bounce off the car door or other side panel.</p>

<p>Videos of European <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLUU4CcuyAY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crash tests like this one</a> are pretty convincing. That said, you can still have a safe car seat without these features and U.S. safety agencies aren&#8217;t currently testing them: The Cybex is tested and approved with these two features folded in, and U.S. standards don&#8217;t currently test side impacts.</p>
<h3>Also best for smaller babies</h3>
<p>The Cybex &#8211; Aton2 is also slightly better for the tiny infants like A.M. who get lost in bigger car seats. The seat bottom was the second-narrowest we tested and has a nice fluffy insert to help keep baby in place.</p>
<p>Cybex also gives you a &#8220;newborn insert&#8221; that fills in some space in the bottom of the seat. This helps the harness fit small infants better and makes the angle of your baby&#8217;s body a little bit flatter to help out baby&#8217;s developing neck.</p>
<p>You should never deliberately recline a seat past the level indicator on the base since that changes the way the harness and seat can absorb weight in case of a crash. This car seat was designed with the newborn insert in mind, so you can rest easy.</p>
<h3>The drawbacks</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cybexdock.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
There were a few things that kept this car seat from taking top spot.</p>
<p>The mechanism that keeps this car seat locked in the base is a bit tricky to work with. There&#8217;s a two-step removal procedure, where you have to lift the foot end of the carrier out of the base before the head latch will unlock. It isn&#8217;t that hard to repeat once you learn the feel of it, but four of our testers said it was a deal-breaker after seeing a demonstration.</p>
<p>The harness on the Aton2 requires you to re-thread the shoulder straps as your baby grows. That&#8217;s not unusual, especially at this price point, but the fact that the Britax manages to provide a non-rethread harness at a similar price is a real bonus.</p>
<p>Also, the sun visor on the Cybex is fairly small and doesn&#8217;t extend far enough to prevent low-angle sunset glare when used in a stroller. This isn&#8217;t a dealbreaker, and many parents will use a blanket or stroller canopy when the carrier isn&#8217;t in the car, but it&#8217;s annoying that you can&#8217;t get just a few more degrees of rotation out of the shade.<br />

You don't need all these extra features to have a safe car seat, but it sure can't hurt. The infant insert is also great for smaller babies and this takes up less of your front row legroom than any other seat available in the U.S.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VHVID1O/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
All things considered, this is a quirky little car seat that has a lot to offer at a competitive price. If you can afford to spend a little more, the Aton Q adds a bigger sun canopy and non-rethread harness adjustment, but the tricky carrier release latch is still the same. The Aton2 is a great car seat for those with small cars, small babies, or who want the peace of mind that comes with buying the latest safety features.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re looking for cutting-edge safety features, the Cybex &#8211; Aton2 has extra protection at a reasonable price.</li>
<li>This is also the best fit for cars without legroom to spare.</li>
<li>The base is easy to install with a nifty strap-tensioning lever system.</li>
<li>Sadly, you&#8217;ll still have to re-thread the shoulder harness as baby grows.</li>
<li>An infant insert may help smaller babies ride more comfortably.</li>
<li>This is also one of the lighter car seats we found, less than nine pounds.</li>
</ul>

Chicco&#8217;s car seats are great and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B078T4LL67/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KeyFit 30 Zip</a> is no exception. We don&#8217;t want the ranking in this review to be overstated: if it weren&#8217;t for a few features that made other car seats easier to use in specific cases, this car seat would have been very close to the top pick.</p>
<p><strong>The biggest point holding back the Chicco from ranking higher is the lack of a better option for seat belt routing when you don&#8217;t have the base with you.</strong> The fact that you get the European-standard belt-path feature along with a no-rethread harness adjustment on the Britax makes it just that much better.</p>
<p>The Chicco is the shallowest seat we measured measured along the back-board part of the seat, with 17.5 inches of room for your baby&#8217;s torso to grow compared to Britax&#8217;s 19.6.</p>
<p>Many reviewers give this car seat top marks, but all of our testers preferred the installation and safety features of other seats. The NHTSA rates this car seat a 19 out of 25, docking points for label clarity and the harness system.</p>

We tested the upgraded Zip model so we could see what the premium features are like to use, and the additional foot cover and visor extension are nice to have on chilly days. If you&#8217;re just going to buy some other privacy or cold-weather cover, there&#8217;s not much reason to spend extra on this upgrade, but child passenger safety technicians will give you bonus points for sticking with factory-designed accessories that have been fully tested.</p>

The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D7DGNSC/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Graco &#8211; Snuglock 30</a> is a budget-friendly, lightweight car seat that will keep your baby safe. This is a minor update of the seat our lead tester had been using for his two children and there&#8217;s really nothing about this car seat that was missed. The extra couple of pounds you&#8217;ll have to carry with a Cybex are well worth it when it comes to plush materials, easy installation and other quality-of-life improvements.</p>

Buying a car seat is intimidating. It&#8217;s hard to know which features are most important and which features are going to come in handy unexpectedly. When you&#8217;re buying, you probably don&#8217;t even know how big your baby will be yet.</p>
<p><strong>Five out of our six testers picked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BRQWV8H/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Britax &#8211; B-Safe Ultra</a> as their favorite car seat.</strong> Britax brings features you&#8217;d usually only see on $300 or $400 car seats down to an affordable price, and it&#8217;s one of the easiest seats to work with.</p>
<p>For a runner-up, we also like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VHVID1O/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cybex &#8211; Aton2</a>. This seat doesn&#8217;t have all the convenience features of the Britax, but it makes up for it with two innovative crash-protection features that are rarely seen in the U.S. car seat market. Cybex also made their car seat light and compact, which could be a real plus for those with small cars to squeeze in and out of. The Aton2 base takes some practice to get used to, but if you want these features it might be worth the learning curve.</p>

<h2 id="difference">The difference between a handheld and car vacuum</h2>
<p>Car vacuums are similar to handheld vacuums in terms of portability, but they are specifically designed to clean the interior of a car effectively. You <i>can</i> use any <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum/">handheld vacuum</a> to clean your car, but car vacuums are specifically designed to allow you to get into tight spaces, with specialized attachments for spaces between and underneath your seats, behind your pedals and in door pockets. Plus, most car vacuums will come with brushes to clean dust in the air vents and console spaces without leaving scratches.</p>
<p>Car vacuums also need to be powerful enough to get all kinds of dirt. Think stubborn sand from the beach, mud and rocks from hikes, ground up crumbs compliments of your toddler or hair left behind by your beloved pet. We chose to test dedicated car vacuums or handheld vacuums that have attachments specifically designed for your vehicle.</p>
<p>So who can use a car vacuum? If you have kids or pets, a car vacuum is a must-have. If you clean your own car, or want a handy instrument to keep your car spotless in between professional cleanings, a car vacuum is for you.</p>
<h2 id="selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>There are many car vacuums available, so we spent hours narrowing down the best on the market.</p>
<p>We checked out subreddits, considered the findings from reviewers like Wirecutter and automotive websites, as well as vacuum specialty sites. Once we had input from the car and vacuum professionals, we were able to determine which features consumers value the most in a car vacuum. We found that consumers and car detailers alike consider power to be the most important factor in choosing a car vacuum. Other considerations are battery life and run time (for cordless models), and ease in reaching narrow spaces in a vehicle.</p>
<p>Based on our research, we looked for car vacuums that met our key metrics, such as a powerful suction, thanks to a strong motor and adequate air watts, strong battery and useful attachments to get to hard-to-reach dirt. For cordless vacuums, we looked at models with lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries (as opposed to NiCd batteries) because Li-ion batteries have higher power density, resulting in longer lasting power. We also considered customer feedback on the vacuums and filtered out any models that seemed to have recurring issues.</p>
<p>With these details in mind, we selected eight finalists to review. Over the course of six weeks, we put them through a series of tests to judge their performance and ease of use.</p>

<p>Considering whether you need a cordless or corded vacuum? It really all depends on your circumstances. If you are cleaning your car in a garage with an AC outlet nearby, a corded vacuum may be for you. You don’t need to think about charging the vacuum, nor do you have to worry about the vacuum losing power as the battery loses its charge (this is a complaint many consumers have voiced about battery-charged vacuums). Corded options often (but not always) boast more powerful suction. Corded versions come in sizes small and large (like the Armor All), whereas cordless models tend to be more compact.</p>
<p>If being tethered to an electrical outlet sounds like an inconvenience to you or you plan to use your vacuum on the go, a cordless model may be more suited to your needs. You can use the cordless vacuums essentially anywhere, but unlike the corded option, you do need to remember to keep it charged. In our testing, we found that cordless vacuums made it easier to get into the deepest places in our cars without a cord getting caught in the car door or on a tire. The cordless options we tested gave us plenty of time to clean one car. With close to 20 minutes of running time, the Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot allowed us to get most of the way through cleaning a second car before we needed to recharge it.</p>
<p>As a third option, some car vacuums, such as the Baabyoo, plug into the 12-volt outlet in your car. This makes the vacuum super convenient for cleaning your car and offers a consistent power source. However, 12V outlet functionality limits you to using the vacuum only in your car.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3><b>Suction power</b></h3>
<p>Power is key to ensuring that you have enough suction to get the job done in a timely manner. Who wants to vacuum the same mess over and over again to get it cleaned up? Different manufacturers measure power in different ways (amps, air watts and/or air flow). We looked at cordless vacuums that ranged from 15 to 35 air watts, which refers to the amount of watts it takes to carry a unit of air through the vacuum, as well as corded vacuums with motors that boasted at least 4 amps.</p>
<h3><b>Attachments</b></h3>
<p>Consider all the nooks and crannies in your car, from between the seats and the door side pocket to the heating/air vents that collect dust. You need a vacuum that can get to all of them.The attachments on a car vacuum are very important since you need to clean many different areas and materials — from plastic and burl wood, to leather, fabric and carpeting. Did each vacuum have a tool to get in between seats and a brush clean the console without leaving scratches?</p>
<h3><b>Wet/Dry vs. dry</b></h3>
<p>Wet cleaners have a trap for water so that you won’t damage the electrical components of the vacuum while sucking up wet messes. Standard (dry) vacuums don&#8217;t have that protection, so they can short-circuit if you try to suck up moisture. Whether to select a wet/dry vacuum or dry-only vacuum depends on your needs and what kind of messes you deal with on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<h3><b>Tank capacity</b></h3>
<p>Tanks will vary in size, meaning that you may need to empty the tank more or less often. We found that all the car vacuums we tested had sufficient tanks to clean your entire car, even with significant dirt, sand and food crumbs. If you have a space for a larger machine like the Armor All, it boasts the largest tank of all the vacuums we tested (at 2.5 gallons).</p>
<h3><b>Weight/Size</b></h3>
<p>It’s important that car vacuums are lightweight and convenient, so we considered whether any of the vacuums were too large, heavy or unwieldy. The vacuums we tested ranged from the light Baabyoo, weighing in at 2.5 pounds, to the heaviest of the group, the 7-pound Armor All.</p>
<h3><b>Battery runtime</b></h3>
<p>For cordless vacuums, how long can you run the vacuum before you need to recharge? Most batteries will power the vacuum consistently for about 10-15 minutes total, so will that be enough to get through cleaning your entire car before it turns off? With turning it on and off as we worked through our cars, we found that this is typically enough time to get the job done. Our top choice, the Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot, lasted closer to 20 minutes and it didn’t lose much power. That’s because it is powered with a 20-volt lithium battery.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Suction</h3>
<p>The suction of a car vacuum is key. To test each one, we spread an eighth of a cup of sand on the same car mat and counted how many passes it took to clean up the mess. We also tested cereal crumbs with each machine and then generally worked around the car to suck up residual dirt and dust on and in between the seats, on the floorboard, behind the gas and brake pedals, and in the console and air conditioning vents.</p>
<p>We found that all the vacuums were able to tackle the messes pretty well, but some just did so more efficiently. We found that sand was the most challenging debris for the vacuums to fully clean, so this became our key comparison test. The Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot cleaned sand in just two to three passes, whereas some others took five to seven passes to fully get the sand up from the car mat.</p>
<h3>Attachments</h3>
<p>We also tested the attachments on each vacuum to see how well worked in a car. All the vacuums we tested had brush and extension attachments, which are essential to fully clean your car.</p>
<p>Several of the machines including the Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot, the Black and Decker &#8211; CHV1410L and the Dirt Devil have the crevice tools and brushes attached. This means that you don’t need to go searching for attachments, which adds to the machines’ convenience. You can just flip the tools up or down depending on what area of the car you need to clean.</p>
<p>Several other vacuums we tested have hose attachments that connect with the body of the vacuums and then stretch into the car for cleaning. These vacuums are effective as well, though it sometimes takes a little more maneuvering to get the body of the vacuum situated in a place that allows you to get the hose and connected attachments where you need to clean in the car.</p>
<h3>Ease of use</h3>
<p>Ease of use can mean a lot of things — for example, how comfortable is the vacuum to use and how convenient are the attachments to use? How easy is it to get to the spaces you needed to clean — sometimes at awkward angles?</p>
<p>Based on our testing, we found that cordless vacuums are easiest to navigate in and around our cars. The cords on the corded vacuums can get caught on the car tires and in the doors as you reach into our car.</p>
<p>With that said, we found that vacuums with the longest cords provide a better cleaning experience than those with short cords. At 18 feet, the Bissell has the longest cord, which makes a huge difference in allowing you to access all the places you need to vacuum in a car. The Armor All has the shortest cord of the group (only 10 feet), which means that in most cases, an extension cord is needed.</p>
<p>We also looked at how the collection bins and filters worked on each of the vacuums and determined which were the most difficult to disassemble and clean. Most were fairly straightforward once we figured out how the vacuums opened. We had a bit of concern about the Armor All. While it worked well to clean spills — including wet and dry messes — you have to switch out the filter for wet versus dry material. It’s not difficult, but if you forget to switch the filter out, you can short out the motor.</p>

<p>By the time we finished our testing, the leader of the pack was quite clear. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IOEFBKS/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot</a> had the strongest suction at 35 air watts and did the best job on tough dirt and sand.</p>
<p>Its wide mouth was effective on car seats and mats, while the attached crevice tool and brush allowed us to conveniently get into the smallest crevices in the car. The pivot design made it so that the vacuum could clean at odd angles, which minimized the craning and stretching we had to do. We found it much more comfortable to clean with than the fixed nose of the Black and Decker &#8211; CHV1410L model.</p>
<p>We love that the crevice tool and brush, which can get to hard-to-reach spaces, is attached to the machine. You can also purchase an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DP737HW/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">additional Car Accessory Kit</a>, which includes a flexible hose that stretches up for 4 feet, large brush attachment and storage bag. While the vacuum itself has an attached brush attachment that we found more than adequate, these extra attachments might come in handy for the most fastidious car owner.</p>
<p>This model is a battery-powered product, which in the end, we felt was most convenient for cleaning a car. The vacuum’s power stayed strong for about 20 minutes before it needed a recharge. This was plenty of time to clean the car effectively without feeling the need to hurry.</p>

Its pivot design meant we could reach every crevice of the car.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003LZQGN6/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>While this vacuum boasts strong power and convenience, it also has a three-stage filtration system to help trap allergens. The Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot also boasts a translucent bagless dust collector so that you can see the dirt you have captured, and how much space you have left before needing to empty it. We found that the dust collector had plenty of space left over after we finished our vacuuming sessions.</p>
<p>When we cleaned out the vacuum’s collection bin, the process was straightforward. You can simply empty the contents into the trash, or depending on the mess you just cleaned up, you can also wash the plastic in the sink to get it fully clean. Once you are done, the vacuum can also be folded in half for convenient storage.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The pivot design on the Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot helped us get into corners and odd angles of a car. The vacuum was also ergonomic and comfortable to use.</li>
<li>It cleaned sand and other dirt with the least amount of passes, thanks to its powerful suction.</li>
<li>The battery lasted as long as we needed it and did not lose power along the way.</li>
<li>The machine has plenty of capacity for dirt, was easy to clean out and has a triple filtration system to ensure that you aren’t breathing the dirt and dust you are trying to clean.</li>

<p>Our favorite car vacuum with a cord was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002KCMH7A/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissell</a>. It provided strong suction with a 4-amp motor and effectively cleaned up the sand we spilled in just three passes. It was the only vacuum we tested with a rubber attachment, which makes capturing pet hair easier.</p>
<p>We loved that the Bissell is effective in cleaning <i>all </i>parts of a car. Its wide suction area is great for car mats and seats, while its hose and attachments allow you to get into the nooks and crannies. This is unlike some of the other vacuums we tested, like the Black and Decker &#8211; CHV1410L, which has a narrow opening, making it take much longer to thoroughly clean the mats and seats in a vehicle.</p>
<p>The cord on this model is 18 feet, which makes a significant difference in accessing all areas of the car. It is significantly longer than the other options we tested, including the shortest cord of the pack, on the Armor All, measuring in at only 10 feet. If you have a garage with an AC power outlet that is accessible to your car and you don’t want to have to worry about charging your car vacuum before using it, this model is an excellent option. It also has a cord wrap system for convenient storage.</p>
<p>Not only is it powerful with a conveniently long cord, but the Bissell also has a large collection bin so that you can clean your car multiple times without having to empty it. The section of the vacuum that collects the dirt is clear, so you can see when it is getting full. It pops off easily for emptying. This vacuum also boasts a HEPA filter, which is important for cutting down on allergens that you may breathe in while vacuuming your car.</p>

<p>At 4.7 pounds, this model is a little heavier than some of the other options, including our top pick, the Black and Decker -BDH2000PL Pivot, which is only 3 pounds, but it still felt comfortable to hold while we cleaned. Because this model has a hose that attaches to the vacuum body, you can use the hose with attachments throughout your car, without having to constantly move the base of the vacuum.</p>

<li>The Bissell &#8211; Cleanview Deluxe provides strong — and consistent power — to take care of even the biggest messes or the most stubborn dirt.</li>
<li>The wide suction area is great for seats and mats in your car, while the attachments do a good job in the hard-to-reach areas.</li>
<li>You don’t need to worry about charging the battery before use.</li>

<p>Editors note: The item we originally tested was the Vacplus, which has been out of stock since November. We found an identical rebrand of it from a company named Baabyoo, which we&#8217;ve replaced mentions of Vacplus throughout the article with.</p>
<p>At a budget-friendly price, we liked the functionality of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTYLV9G/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baabyoo</a>, which plugs into the 12V power outlet in your car. This was one of the more compact vacuums of the group we tested, but it packed plenty of power to clean sand, crumbs and more. If you experience wet and dry messes in your car, this is a great option for you, as it will seamlessly handle either type of spill.</p>
<p>We found the power on the Baabyoo adequate to get the job done and because it plugs into a 12V outlet in your car, you don’t have to worry about periodically needing to charge it. In addition to trying this vacuum on sand, we cleaned wet mud from the car and found that it did well on wet messes, which makes it a good option for those who often find themselves at the beach, on hiking trips or those with children who are spilling milk or juice. If a spill or mess happens while you are away from your home or on a road trip, you can still use the vacuum without needing a wall outlet or battery charger.</p>
<p>In addition to offering consistent suction, this vacuum has several attachments that are very effective in reaching between car seats and capturing dust in car consoles. All the attachments fit with the vacuum in a nylon zipper bag, making storage of this model in your car or trunk simple and convenient.</p>
<p>We found one user that had a problem with the attachments staying attached, but he reported back later on that the company saw the review and replaced his defective unit.</p>

It’s powered by your vehicle’s DC V12 power outlet, which means you don’t need to worry about charging it before use.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTYLV9G/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Cleaning the machine — even with wet messes — was straightforward. The collection bin pops off and can be rinsed with water and soap when needed. The collection bin is not clear, on some of the other models like the Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot, Holife or Bissell models, so you do have to check from time to time to ensure that you haven’t filled the vacuum with dust.</p>
<p>A drawback of this machine is it can <i>only </i>be powered by a 12V outlet. If you want to use your car vacuum for other spills from time to time in your garage or elsewhere, you may want to consider a traditional corded vacuum model or one with a dedicated battery charger.</p>
<p>As our budget selection, this vacuum is priced around $20. It offers a great bang for your buck if you wish to keep a dedicated car vacuum in your vehicle.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Baabyoo provides strong and consistent power to clean your car, using the 12V outlet in your vehicle.</li>
<li>It cleans up wet/dry messes.</li>
<li>A convenient nylon bag comes with the vacuum for storage.</li>
<li>It is the most budget-friendly option at around $20.</li>

<p>We loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00445L290/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carrand</a> for its attachments, which were very clearly designed for the car — more so than any of the other car vacuums we tested. It even has an attachment to buff the console. It also has several attachments to clean cup holders, air vents and the console without leaving scratches.</p>
<p>This vacuum had very strong suction, taking care of our sand test in just two passes. The Carrand is bulkier than some of the other options. The vacuum itself sits on the ground, with a hose to reach into your car for cleaning. Since this is a corded model, you are tethered to your garage’s AC outlet. The length of the cord is on the shorter side at 12 feet, so an extension cord might come in handy depending on how close you can get your car to your power outlet.</p>
<p>The machine blows warm air, which the company describes as a minimal resistance design that allows air to ﬂow more freely for more cleaning power. We didn’t have any problem with the air flow — it did not seem to cause allergies, but those who are very sensitive to dust might want to take this feature into consideration.</p>
<p>The main drawback we found with this particular model is the storage for the attachments, which is at the side of the base of the vacuum. As we reached into the car to vacuum a seat, the movement of the hose knocked the attachments loose onto the garage floor. Even despite the attachment storage issue, anyone who is concerned about getting every possible nook and cranny of their car will still want to consider the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00445L290/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carrand.</a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZYVDGFK/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Holife &#8211; Hand Vacuum Cleaner</a> is a strong contender in the car vacuum arena. It is easy to use and picks up all kinds of dirt with ease. We were able to tackle the sand we spread out as part of our testing, as well as cereal crumbs and even a few stray chips in the car, thanks to the large suction opening. The large opening also made it possible to vacuum our car mats and seats efficiently.</p>
<p>The attachments for this model are not connected to the vacuum itself but they are easy to connect and they allow you to reach the smaller spaces of the car. The machine is relatively light, so it made maneuvering through the car easy.</p>
<p>The dirt and debris that you pick up shows through the clear collection bin so that you can see when you need to empty it. Emptying the bin took a little bit of figuring out with several pieces to disconnect, but once we figured it out, the process wasn’t too cumbersome. The Holife can handle wet and dry messes and the collection bin can be washed out with soap and water to clean up after cleaning wet messes. The vacuum comes with two washable filters, which is great because you can reuse them over and over.</p>
<p>While the vacuum picked up all kinds of dirt effectively, we did notice that that the Holife seemed to lose some of its suction as the collection bin filled up and the battery wore down.</p>

<p>The largest of the models we tested — the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003M2F7NI/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Armor All </a>— will hold plenty of dirt and grime in its 2.5-gallon container. During our testing, it proved powerful enough to aptly pick up dirt, cereal and dust in the car. The attachments also allowed us to dirt in between our car seats effectively. It also handled wet spills like water and mud.</p>
<p>This vacuum is significantly larger than most of the vacuums we tested, with the exception of the Carrand. The garage where we tested this machine is tight on space and we found it difficult to move the vacuum around the car in the limited space. It was easier to pull the car out into the driveway and use an extension cord (the cord that comes with his machine is quite short at only 10 feet long).</p>
<p>While we found this hard to use in tight spaces, if you have a large garage or need a small shop vac that will double for cleaning your car, this is a great option. If you are only looking for a convenient car vacuum, there are other smaller options, such as the corded Bissell or the cordless Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot, which we felt were easier to maneuver and had just as strong suction. If you need a small wet/dry vacuum, the Baabyoo or Holife are also solid contenders.</p>
<p>While we found that this works well to clean wet and dry spills, you have to switch out the filter for wet versus dry material, which can be a bit of an inconvenience. It is something to be aware of because if you forget to swap the filter before cleaning up a wet spill, you risk shorting the motor.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002D47XOM/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; Scorpion</a> is one of the more budget-friendly options in the group of car vacuums. It has a streamlined design which is comfortable to hold, though the machine felt heavier than some of the others. It is also very loud.</p>
<p>The power of this vacuum was acceptable. Because it is corded, you don’t need to worry about ebbs and flows of power. The cord measures 16 feet, which is long enough, though we had to do some maneuvering at times during our testing. In terms of suction, it took about four passes to collect the sand we spread out and did a good job on crumbs as well. The crevice tool worked in between the seats, and we liked that it was connected, so we didn’t have to go looking for the right attachment.</p>
<p>After some use in our car, however, we turned the vacuum back on and it sprayed out a burst of dust that hit us in the face. While we liked other aspects of this car vacuum, this turned us off to this model entirely. We checked to see if other reviewers experienced the same and we found several who wrote about this problem, blaming a poorly constructed filter.</p>

<p>We expected the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006LXOJC0/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black and Decker &#8211; CHV1410L</a> to be one of the easiest vacuums to use and liked that it was light and compact. However, we were disappointed with its power and overall effectiveness in cleaning a car. The long “nose” of the machine made it more difficult to get at different angles in our car. Also, because the nose doesn’t have a wide opening, it takes longer to clean the larger sections in our car, such as seats and mats.</p>
<p>While some of the other machines took care of the sand we spilled in the car in just two to three passes, we found that this model was not as effective. Despite repeated passes of the vacuum, we could never quite get all the sand out of the floor mat with this model.</p>
<p>While the power was lacking on this model, we did like that the Black and Decker &#8211; CHV1410L has an attached brush to easily clean the console and dusty areas of the car without scratches. Still, it was just not as effective as the other machines actually capturing all the dust.</p>
<p>Another feature on this model that we liked is that the lithium battery charger automatically shuts off when the battery is charged. This is a great safety feature and it also allows you to conveniently store the machine on the charger without worrying about draining the battery. But in the end, the lack of suction and design flaws for cleaning a car made this our least favorite of the car vacuums we tested.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>There are many variables when it comes to choosing a car vacuum. Do you want a cordless or corded model? Do you need a vacuum that can also work on wet spills? These decisions will depend on your garage set-up and what messes you’ll typically be cleaning up.</p>
<p>After testing eight of the top car vacuums, we feel that the cordless models are the most convenient to use in a car. While the batteries don’t last forever, we found that most of the models we tested last long enough to get the entire car clean before needing a recharge.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IOEFBKS/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot</a> is our favorite model when it comes to power, ergonomic design and effectiveness in picking up even the most ground-in dirt. During testing, the pivot design allowed us to comfortably get to dirt in hard-to-reach spaces. It has a crevice and brush tool attached, which is convenient as you are working through your car, and both tools did a good job getting at dirt and dust. In addition, if you want additional attachments, you can purchase them as add-ons, giving you the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>We also feel confident recommending the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002KCMH7A/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissell</a> if a corded car vacuum fits your needs. This model is sturdy and powerful. Its wide mouth is effective on seats and mats, while its attachments do a great job with dirt in the deepest crevices of a car.</p>
<p>And last, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTYLV9G/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baabyoo</a>, which plugs into a car’s 12V power outlet, is our budget pick, which as a bonus, can handle both wet and dry spills.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>We’re a hands-on kind of people at Your Best Digs, and our lead editor for this project has worked on his own cars for as long as he’s been driving.</p>
<p>Automotive diagnostics is a wide and complicated field, though, so we also worked with a local expert. Scott McLain is the owner and manager of <a href="http://www.temeculaautocare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Temecula Accurate Auto Care</a>, and he helped us narrow down the long list of scan tools and asses their value for real diagnostic work.</p>
<p>We focused on scanners with essential functions like live data readouts and graphs. We capped our budget at $100 per scanner, which eliminates the upper tier of scanners with built-in oscilloscopes and security system programming. However, we still found some impressive features that will help you complete a fix without investing in features most car owners won’t ever need.</p>
<p>As always, we prioritized models with good review scores on sites like Amazon and brands that have a good reputation among enthusiasts on Reddit and other car forums above those that were as cheap as possible. Warranty support is also a consideration, and we looked for tools that can download firmware updates when new features or fixes come along.</p>
<p>The flexibility and power of smartphone or PC-connected diagnostics is amazing, and we took a long, hard look at what’s available for the enthusiast mechanic who wants to get maximum flexibility and power. We chose a variety of Bluetooth-connected OBD-II adapters, and prioritized compatibility and simplicity in our picks.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-obd2">What is ODB-II?</h2>
<p>OBD-II is the second generation of a government-mandated <a href="http://www.oneminuteinfo.com/2014/02/can-bus-obd-ii-explained-for-dummies.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“On-Board Diagnostic” communication system</a> for automobiles. This standard has been in place in the U.S. since 1996, and since 2006 international systems are nearly 100% compatible.</p>
<p>The system is built around the emissions monitoring and testing systems that are required by many states in the U.S. If you’ve ever been offered a “pre-test” at a smog shop before you pay for the official test that’s sent to your state registry office, OBD-II is the system that says “this car should pass an emissions test” or “this car has a problem.” Any OBD-II scanner can show you these “emissions readiness” details monitored by your car.</p>
<p>While it doesn’t cover everything, OBD-II has grown to include data on most of your engine’s vital systems. It monitors electronic controls and sensors, and will trigger the “check engine light” (technicians call it the “malfunction indicator lamp” or MIL) if there’s a serious problem.</p>

There’s a 16-pin connector in your car, always located somewhere near your steering wheel, that lets an OBD-II scanner connect to the onboard system. In addition to the emissions-test readiness report and details on what code triggered a warning light, some scanners can also listen in on the data being sent from the sensors to give live readings or a graph of those values over time.</p>
<p>Our expert, Scott McLain, emphasizes the tricky balance a scan tool represents for a DIY-er. “It comes back to knowing what’s good data and what’s bad data; you can see what happens [looking at graphs of conditions in a malfunctioning car], but you’ve got to know what the data means.”</p>
<p>Scott warns that there’s also a false sense of economy that can come with owning a scan tool. “People come to me sometimes and say ‘this code means this is the problem, here’s a part I bought, put this in for me.’ Sometimes it’s that simple, but weird stuff happens on cars. Rust damage… rodent damage… a lot of people don’t want to pay to do real diagnostic work, but there might be nothing wrong with that part. Instead, there might be a computer error because of a broken ground wire in the trunk.”</p>
<p>A scanner can definitely point you in the right direction, though. Scott acknowledges the value of an OBD scan tool for someone who wants to find out more about what’s going on inside their car: “A check engine light on your car is like your car is running a fever; it’s a symptom. A mechanic needs to find out what’s behind that. With a graph, you can actually see what the computer sees; sometimes you can watch the voltage sweep on a control signal and see if there’s a glitch.”</p>
<p>After you successfully diagnose and correct a problem on your car, the OBD-II scanner’s most essential function for a do-it-yourself mechanic is to reset the system by clearing the trouble codes.</p>
<p>Most scanners can also access the “freeze-frame” data that’s recorded when a code is first set, so you can replicate the conditions from the initial fault (speed, engine temperature, etc.) and make sure the problem doesn’t come back under some certain conditions that you didn’t see when you were working on it.</p>

<p>If you’re working on a project car or if you want to avoid trips to the dealer at all costs, you may want a way to read codes for other systems that aren’t covered by the OBD standard.</p>
<p>Other systems include anti-lock braking, airbag and tire pressure monitoring. These systems almost always use the same network for communication as OBD, but with different protocols and proprietary codes that won’t show up on a generic scanner. If you buy a scanner designed to read, for example, Ford’s brake-system diagnostics, then you’ll have an extra menu option that shows you those codes.</p>
<p>Three of the scanners we tested included some extended diagnostic access. BlueDriver comes with an impressive compatibility list, while the OBD Fusion app only has modules for some Ford, Mazda and Toyota/Lexus vehicles and requires in-app purchases for each model year you want to scan. The Innova 3030g2 lists ABS support for some models, but in our tests it didn’t read one of the popular cars it was supposed to support.</p>
<p>Compatibility is the trickiest part of picking a tool for extended diagnostics. Generally, shop tools your mechanic buys are expensive because they guarantee compatibility. A repair shop will probably have tools like a Snap-On Verus or OTC Genisys, and those manufacturers make their money on specific compatibility modules and updates for new cars every year.</p>
<p>PC software is typically the cheapest way to get access to all the hidden programming the manufacturer codes in the various networks and controllers. The realm of brand-specific control and diagnostic software is a scary place, though, full of eBay-sourced USB cables and (often) pirated software. There’s some good software and quality equipment out there for many brands of cars, but be careful, and don’t expect miracles to be cheap.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-scanners">Types of scanners</h2>
<h3>Stand-alone scanners</h3>
<p>This is the most common type of tool used for OBD code-reading, a handheld computer that reads your car’s diagnostic data and gets power through the car’s data port.</p>
<p>This is the type of reader you’ve probably seen at a parts store, and we tested models that cost less than $70. Screen sizes, button layouts and features vary.</p>
<h3>Smartphone connected scanners</h3>
<p>This is a fairly new type of OBD scanner, but they’re becoming very popular. Most Wi-Fi or Bluetooth scanners are based on an integrated circuit made by Elm Electronics, called the ELM327. The adapter itself is just an interpreter between your car and your smartphone; the display, logging and resetting of diagnostic data is handled by an app.</p>
<p>That said, not all adapters are created equal.</p>
<p>On the bargain side of things, there are cheap adapters all over Amazon, eBay and pretty much everywhere else you can find cheap electronics. These are mostly Bluetooth adapters that only work with Android and Windows platforms, though there are USB and WiFi-connected adapters as well.</p>
<p>Cheap adapters are almost all based on the ELM327 design, but Elm charges $15 just for the chip in bulk, so it shouldn’t be surprising if a $9 buy-it-now-bargain doesn’t use a genuine chip.</p>
<p>Specialized designs from companies like Carista, PLX Devices and OBDLink are designing circuits around new, 100% legitimate versions of Elm’s chip, which means lower power draw and a larger buffer for data transmission, along with a few new commands. These adapters are more likely to use the new Bluetooth Low Energy and Bluetooth 4.0 standards, which also brings iPhone compatibility. (Older iPhone adapters needed to set up a Wi-Fi network, which means you can’t use your OBD adapter and a Wi-Fi internet connection at the same time.)</p>
<p>Other manufacturers, like Lemur, Bosch and OBDEleven use their own proprietary chip (so they don’t work with universal apps like OBD Fusion or Carista) that reads extra codes like the airbag systems, ABS, central locking and security controls, and whatever else these wizards can coax out of your car’s systems. These adapters are generally also keys to unlock their respective apps, making the app a free download and the adapter more expensive.</p>
<p>Compatibility and feature sets run a huge gamut in the smartphone world. Some apps, like <a href="http://www.forscan.org/faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FORScan</a> (Android only) and <a href="https://caristaapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carista</a>, will give you an immense amount of power over certain cars with a good universal adapter. Others, like <a href="https://www.automatic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automatic</a> or <a href="https://www.verizonwireless.com/connected-devices/hum-by-verizon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Verizon’s Hum</a>, focus more on value-added features like Onstar-style roadside assistance services. Still others, like<a href="https://obdeleven.com/content/7-app-and-features" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> OBDEleven</a>, will give you a very specific set of features for one brand of cars and require both a proprietary adapter and software purchases to unlock features.</p>
<p>Fortunately, nearly any adapter/app combination will give you access to emissions readiness and engine diagnostics codes, just like a good stand-alone scanner.</p>
<h2>The scanner gave me a code, now what?</h2>
<p>If you decide to go with a scanner that only gives you the name of a trouble code (let’s say you get code P0100) and doesn’t offer any built-in interpretation, you’re still on your way to finding a fix. You can plug the code into a web database like OBD-codes.com or Repairpal.com and find out that there’s a problem with a mass airflow sensor.</p>
<p>For this example code, Repairpal.com has a good amount of information, and might even tell you more than a high-end diagnostic tool. OBD-codes.com also includes pictures and a more thorough description of the part, though the diagnostic steps are more terse. DTCsearch.com gave us much less general information about the MAF system, but it does describe the exact conditions that would trigger a code among a few different makes.</p>

<p>If you’re a wrench monkey who enjoys pulling covers off to see what’s happening, these sites are more tools in your toolbox that can help you diagnose how severe the problem is and can help you decide what to do next.</p>
<p>It never hurts to have a service manual on hand for a vehicle that you want to work on yourself. If you’re okay with reading pages on a tablet or laptop you should check to see if your local library has access to Chilton or Haynes online manuals, it’s not uncommon to get free access with your library card.</p>
<p>More expensive scanners, like the BlueDriver or Innova’s 3030g2, include access to a repair database. Innova will make you pay per-vehicle for access to repair guides through their RepairSolutions PC application and website, while BlueDriver gives you in-app access to the Identifix database through their app. We haven’t done a direct comparison of all these manuals, but Identifix sells their Direct Hit subscription service for $179 monthly, so the fact that BlueDriver includes access for an unlimited number of cars in the $99 adapter purchase makes it a value leader.</p>

<p>These are the top features that we checked for and tested on each scanner:</p>
<p><strong>Freeze frame data:</strong> This is a special memory area in your car’s diagnostic system that will record the precise conditions of the car when a fault code triggers the check engine light. All but the most basic readers (like the Autel &#8211; MaxiScan MS300) should be able to show you this data.</p>
<p><strong>Live data:</strong> This function will let you see engine performance information, either as a real-time update of numbers or as a graph. We gave half-points in this category for numerical readouts, and a full point for a graphed plot of the data.</p>
<p><strong>Save data:</strong> This an option that lets you record and play back a readout or graph. This is useful if you have an intermittent problem that doesn’t generate a code. The option to save data also comes with ways to print, download, or otherwise share the data your scanner finds. On a smartphone diagnostic app, this feature is almost always available with a GPS overlay, so you can see what’s happening at specific locations in a test drive.</p>
<p><strong>Mode 6:</strong> Often labelled mode $06 or “Onboard Monitor,&#8221; this is one of the ten modes programmed into your car’s diagnostic system. Mode 6 functions are related to live data readouts, but these are the specific internal tests that your car is doing to decide whether things are okay or if it should notify you via the check engine light. This system wasn’t originally designed to be readable by humans, but some scanners include a translated readout of the hexidecimal-coded values. It’s a popular way to find out if the engine has any misfire or compression problems on a particular cylinder, or other data that might indicate a problem but isn’t severe enough to trigger a check engine light.</p>
<p><strong>Evap test: </strong>This is a specific mode $08 command that tells your car to start a test of the “evaporative emission control system” (mechanics call it “evap” for short) that prevents fuel from evaporating out of your tank and contributing to smog. Triggering this test won’t fix anything by itself, but once you do fix a problem with the fuel system it’s nice to be able to manually trigger a test. This way you can verify your fix right away, without waiting a few days (or longer) for your car to run it automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Troubleshooter functions:</strong> These give you a set of recommended fixes for problems detected by the scanner. This feature is tricky to score, since the advice given is only valuable if the diagnosis is precise enough to pinpoint a specific problem. We gave the Innova scanner a half-point here, since it will only look up fixes in Innova’s database if you pay a subscription fee.</p>
<p><strong>Airbag codes:</strong>  These are only visible to a scanner that’s looking for them, and we were pleasantly surprised that BlueDriver was able to see and reset our test code without any issues. OBD Fusion was not able to see any airbag codes on our test vehicle, even with the $9.99 optional diagnostic module that’s available for matching model-year Toyotas. We gave it a half-point because it might be able to read codes for your car.</p>
<p><strong>ABS codes:</strong> These are also proprietary and sometimes tricky to read. Innova’s 3030g2 is supposed to read ABS codes for Domestic and Toyota vehicles, and OBD Fusion has an in-app purchase for 2007 Toyotas, but neither tool was actually compatible with our test car. We only gave those scanners half a point. BlueDriver, once again, was the only scanner to see the test code.</p>
<p><strong>Firmware updates:</strong> These aren’t required for a general-purpose scanner, since the OBD-II system is a written-in-stone specification and any scanner should be able to read the check engine light of any car that’s compliant. Still, it’s nice to know that a manufacturer can fix bugs. The possibility of support for a new feature that comes along in a few years is also encouraging, though it’s not likely you’ll see any major revisions on a sub-$100 tool.</p>
<h3>Smartphone extras</h3>
<p>There are some tricks and hacks available through a newer car’s electronic control systems that might be accessible with the right combinations of adapter hardware and software.</p>
<p>For example, take the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frYnlrCdea0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Volkswagen “hatch pop mod.”</a> With parts from an enthusiast parts supplier like ECS tuning and the Carista or OBDeleven app, you can add a hatch open remote to a VW Golf that didn’t come with that feature from the factory.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, this kind of non-diagnostic programming is only going to be available with a software package running on a smartphone or computer connected by a USB or Bluetooth adapter. Software exists for nearly every modern vehicle type (since the dealership has to program your vehicle when they set it up or it work on it) but the cost and complexity of that software package varies.</p>
<p>Going back to our Volkswagen example, Rosstech LLC sells the famous VCDS software and USB interfaces that unlock all kinds of programming control, but at a $199 starting price, it’s definitely not an impulse buy. Carista represents a new generation of enthusiast modification software, using a modern smartphone interface and low-cost Bluetooth adapter hardware.</p>
<p>We tested the Carista app on a recent-model Toyota minivan, and found that it gives an interesting array of programming options for things like lights, key remotes and climate control. Carista didn’t do anything beyond basic OBD-II reporting on our primary test car, a 2007 Corolla. Other than the Carista-branded Bluetooth adapter, only the Android-only BAFX adapter worked with the Carista app.</p>
<p>From online comments, it looks like Carista is blocking compatibility with adapters like those from Veepeak because of possible problems with a non-genuine ELM327 interface chip; the fact that the less expensive BAFX adapter is not blocked makes the situation a bit baffling. The Carista-branded adapter is the only one we tested, then, that offers both iPhone compatibility and the extended Carista “mod” functions. The other adapters work very well for OBD-II diagnostic work in apps like OBD Fusion.</p>

<p>Working with expert diagnostic technicians, we built a battery of tests that cover functions of diagnostic scanners.</p>
<p>First, we unplugged a set of sensors on our test car to trigger error codes and test the ability of these scanners to read and reset codes.</p>
<p>Don’t try this at home unless you’re confident you know what you’re unplugging and what it might break<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Unplugging the oxygen emissions sensor tripped a P0031 emissions system code, which triggers a check engine light. This is the kind of code that you can read and reset with any functional OBD-II scanner,</p>
<p>Unplugging an airbag-related seat occupancy sensor triggered the airbag warning light on the dash and generated a B1650 “body code”. This is a special code that’s not included in the ODB system, and is only read and reset by scanners with manufacturer-specific programming.</p>
<p>We also unplugged a brake system fuse under the dash to trigger a P0504 code for the anti-lock-braking system. Again, this falls outside of generic compatibility and requires a specialized tool to spot.</p>
<p>We ran the car for a few minutes with all these sensors unplugged, then turned off the engine. We scanned for codes with the engine off and the key in the on position, as most guidelines suggest for diagnostic scanning of stored codes.</p>
<h3>Interface</h3>

Beyond using the scanners to look up a controlled malfunction code, we explored other functions of the scanners by running live readouts (where available available) and exploring the other menu functions.</p>
<p>We took points away for scanners that are hard to use or confusing, and added points when we found the menu options and buttons intuitive. Hotkeys for frequently-used functions are a nice feature that gave a few scanners a leg-up here.</p>
<p>Note that we scored the interface usability separately from the number of features available. For example, the Innova &#8211; 3030g2 scored fairly high since it tells you what it can with minimal menu-searching and makes it relatively easy to check and clear codes. The Autel &#8211; MS300 is also a simple scanner, but the dim one-line-at-a-time readout did not fill us with joy.</p>
<h3>Speed</h3>

<p>We recorded how quickly the scanner reported the trouble codes, timed from when we plugged in and turned the key until a code identification or definition was displayed.</p>
<p>For the universal Bluetooth and wifi adapters we used the OBDFusion app to test scanning time.</p>
<p>We also used Torque’s adapter information page to find the average update speed after one minute of connection time running a live graph.</p>

<p>Lemur Vehicle Monitors is a tiny company located on the tiny island of Newfoundland off the eastern shore of Canada, but their BlueDriver app and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bluetooth adapter</a> is one of the biggest things that’s happened to automotive diagnostics in decades.</p>
<p>It’s not that BlueDriver is a revolutionary idea; plenty of other companies are selling Bluetooth adapters that work with a specific smartphone app. Some of those other solutions are even offering similar features. What’s big about BlueDriver is how simple and well-integrated it is.</p>
<p>Where other companies will sell a limited app with add-on modules that open up enhanced diagnostics, or a subscription-based app that means you’ll pay over and over again to keep using the hardware you’ve bought, BlueDriver is a one-time hardware purchase. You can install the app for free on as many devices as you want, and the adapter will unlock all the functionality, service bulletin and recall databases and vehicle-specific modes.</p>
<p>It’s a solid adapter, too. This system uses the new Bluetooth 4.0 protocols, so it’s compatible with both Android and Apple’s iOS devices so long as they’ll run Android 4,0 or iOS 7.0 or higher. (That’s pretty much every device made since 2012.)</p>
<p>The fact that this is a one-app adapter is a disappointment, since there are some other apps like Carista and Torque that have interesting features BlueDriver doesn’t cover, but the disappointment fades when you see that the app and adapter connect right away and work seamlessly with each other.</p>

If your car is on the long list of models supported, this scanner can show you the most elusive trouble codes and reset them. The live display and report sharing functions are best-in-class, too. There’s even a flashlight button!</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Lemur has good info on what data their app can and cannot see for a specific vehicle on <a href="https://www.bluedriver.com/questions#block-faq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this compatibility list</a>. This is the kind of detail we like to see. Definitely check out your car on a compatibility list before you invest in a tool like this to see what you will or won’t get. We checked against a list of the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/news/top-20-most-popular-used-cars-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top-selling cars in the U.S.</a>, and the only top-ten omission was Chevrolet airbag and tire-pressure compatibility.</p>
<p>This isn’t going to replace a $5,000 scan tool, but it might replace one that cost you $500. It doesn’t include a tablet, so if you don’t already own or want one then a tablet-style scanner from Autel or Launch might be a better purchase for serious diagnostic work. There’s a pretty good chance you do own a compatible device, though.</p>
<p>In use, the fact that this scanner found and reset every code we tried to generate on our 2007 Toyota Corolla was very impressive. Airbag codes are notoriously difficult to read and reset, and just unplugging the occupant sensor or seatbelt sensor cables on your front seats will trigger them. If you work on car stereos or upholstery, this is a killer app.</p>
<p>We were also impressed to see the way BlueDriver keeps a record of every car you connect it with and logs the date, time and any trouble codes it finds.</p>
<p>The one feature of the better stand-alone scanners that didn’t show up in BlueDriver is a trigger for the mode $08 evaporative system test. This isn’t an essential feature, since it’s a test your car will do automatically after a certain amount of time (specific conditions to trigger the test vary), but it would make this a more valuable tool for someone fixing a problem right before taking a car in for emissions testing.</p>
<p>That said, the most impressive feature of this system is the updates that Lemur has rolled out. They’ve added more and more vehicles to the extended diagnostics compatibility list, and if some breakthrough new feature or mode comes along it’s quite possible that BlueDriver will be updated to support it.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Lemur &#8211; BlueDriver turns your smartphone into a top-notch scan tool with a long list of essential diagnostic features.</li>
<li>Extended diagnostic functions for many popular cars makes the price tag easier to swallow. Not every car is included, but for $99 it’s an impressive list.</li>
<li>The flashlight button on the main screen is brilliant.</li>
<li>There are a few feature we’d ask for, and compatibility with universal-adapter apps like Carista or Lap Timer would also be nice.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-wired">Best wired scanner: Launch &#8211; CReader V+</h2>

Of all the handheld scanners that don’t need a smartphone, the Launch &#8211; CReader V+ isn’t the most feature-complete we tested, and it’s also not the least expensive. When we asked our expert diagnostic tech which of the seven handheld scanners he’d take, though, he went for this one.</p>
<p>This scanner is built on the same hardware platform as some of Launch’s more expensive scanners, as well as the slightly-cheaper CReader 4001. There are a few upgrades that bring the price up $12 or so from the 4001 (which we also tested.)</p>
<p>The basic functions are all here: freeze frame data and code-reading with basic definitions, of course, but also a color graph that can display two parameters simultaneously.</p>
<p>The bonus features offered on the V+ that set it apart from the other scanners include:</p>
<ul>
<li>On-board monitoring readouts, including Mode 6 (Mode $01, $02, $06 and $08 data were visible for our test car)</li>
<li>O2 sensor test reports</li>
<li>A dedicated evap test system ($08) trigger command</li>
</ul>

<p>These screens might be very helpful to some owners, and might never get activated by others. Scott McLain, the service technician who helped us test these scanners, noted that he’d always pay a few dollars more to get the evap test commands: it’s the kind of function that really comes in handy if you ever have to work on related parts.</p>
<p>We’ll note than the CReader V+ is listed on the LaunchTechUSA website as a USA-sold product, and you might get slightly more traction with their service department if you own a V+ rather than a grey-market 4001. The update available from LaunchTechUSA’s website applied to our V+ scanner without a hitch.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The CReader V+ packs all the features you can ask for into a fast, powerful budget-priced scanner.</li>
<li>You can save a bit of money with cheaper scanners if you don’t think you’ll ever do more than scan and reset codes, but graphing live data on the big color screen is well worth an upgrade.</li>
<li>There aren’t any extended features like ABS or airbag compatibility, but the universal functions included are all top-notch.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-other-finalists">The other finalists we tested</h2>
<h3>Apps</h3>
<h3>OC Tech &#8211; OBD Fusion</h3>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/obd-fusion-obd2-vehicle-scan-tool-diagnostics/id650684932?" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OBD Fusion from OC Tech</a> is a really, really close competitor for BlueDriver. Available for iPhone and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">for Android</a>, this app is a bargain if you want OBD scan functionality on your phone or tablet.</p>
<p>The place that BlueDriver really breaks away from OBD Fusion is in compatibility and extended diagnostics. OBD Fusion has support for things like airbag and ABS codes on a few cars, but even if the cars you work on are supported, you need to purchase those modules for each model year you want to work on.</p>
<p>Our test car is included in the listed range, but when we checked in the app we were disappointed to learn that none of the extended features would work. Score one for BlueDriver.</p>
<p>OBD Fusion was one of the first OBD scan apps (once known as Touchscan, which is still the name of OC Tech’s Windows software) and is still one of the best. The real strength it has over BlueDriver is that it will work with almost any OBD-II adapter: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or even USB. There are some great adapter hardware companies making products based on the ELM327 circuit, and OBD Fusion supports basically all of them.</p>
<p>The “universal” compatibility is both a feature and a curse. Connecting to your adapter requires jumping through a few hoops, and if you buy a faulty adapter that has problems or spotty compatibility with the extended diagnostic options, it’s hard to know where to start looking for a fix.</p>
<p>OCTech recommends and sells OBDLink hardware, which will give you pretty much guaranteed compatibility (these adapters are modified to support extended diagnostics on SW CAN &amp; MS CAN systems from Ford and GM). The new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JFRFJG6/?tag=ybdobd-20">OBDLink MX+</a> even works with Apple’s iOS devices, unlike older versions. The downside to this route is that you&#8217;re not saving anything over the pay-once BlueDriver package once you start adding extended diagnostic upgrades to OBD Fusion.</p>
<p>The case where we’d recommend OBD Fusion and an adapter like the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YVHGTBM/?tag=ybdobd-20">Carista &#8211; Bluetooth adapter</a> over BlueDriver is if you want to use a Bluetooth adapter for other apps, like <a href="http://www.gps-laptimer.de/compatibility/ios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harry’s Lap Timer</a> for track-day telemetry or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YVHGTBM/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carista</a> for modifications and extended diagnostics on a car that’s supported by that app. A combination of all these adapters and apps will let you do things that BlueDriver can’t, but it can be a headache trying to figure out exactly what works and how.</p>
<h3>Torque Pro</h3>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.prowl.torque" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Torque Pro by Ian Hawkins</a> is another old standby in the world of car-diagnostic apps, this one for Android only.</p>
<p>If you want the very least expensive way to do scary things with your car’s diagnostic system, Torque lets you ask for display of custom Parameter IDs, which means you can set up a display of things like a gear position or transmission temperature or battery monitors for your Prius.</p>
<p>That flexibility is partly dependent on the fact that Torque isn’t just an app designed for people doing automotive diagnostics; it’s an app designed to give you access to everything that your Bluetooth OBD adapter can possibly do. There isn’t much novice-friendly information available, but there are programming wizards developing plugins for the app that can do crazy things with bi-directional control of your engine systems. (<a href="https://torque-bhp.com/wiki/Plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This is a list of some available plugins</a>, but it’s not complete.)</p>
<p>Torque’s built-in OBD scan function spotted the ABS code that even the Innova ABS scanner and OBD Fusion’s extended diagnostic module weren’t able to read, so it’s not software that’s easy to dismiss. The fact that the interface is programmed to give you control of everything rather than being designed by someone who knows what makes a good diagnostic scanner is hard to overlook, though, and if you don’t own an Android device there’s not much incentive to go buy one just so you can use this app.</p>

<p>For a universal smartphone adapter that checks <em>all</em> the boxes, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YVHGTBM/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Carista adapter</a> is basically your only choice. Designed to be an adapter that works flawlessly with <a href="https://caristaapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carista’s companion app</a> (which also supports many of the less-expensive ELM327-based adapters), this adapter opens up nearly universal compatibility.<br />
Unlike BlueDriver’s proprietary system, this adapter will connect with <a href="https://www.scantool.net/touchscan/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Touchscan</a> on a Windows PC or <a href="http://www.gps-laptimer.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harry’s Lap Timer</a> on an iPhone, and it’s compatible with Carista’s modification and service tricks.<br />
On our test car, Carista wasn’t able to do anything but basic OBD diagnostic scans, so BlueDriver still has an edge for compatibility, but if Carista does include features for your car you might be able to do things (like reset oil-change reminder or calibrate climate control settings) that BlueDriver just can’t do. This adapter works very well with OBD Fusion, and that’s probably your best bet for adapter/app combinations if you don’t want to be lock in with BlueDriver.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073XKQQQW/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OBDcheck BLE</a> is the latest and greatest from Veepeak, adding iPhone compatibility over Bluetooth by upgrading to a Bluetooth Low Energy transmitter.</p>
<p>Despite to promise of expanded compatibility, this adapter is actually pretty disappointing, since Carista refuses to work with it. We tried a number of permutations of pairing and power-up sequences, but Carista seems to be blocking this adapter.</p>
<p>This adapter works fine in OBD Fusion, and if running that or some other broadly-compatible app is your goal then this is an affordable adapter that works with iPhones. It’s not really cheap enough to make it the winner over the Carista adapter, though, when that app represents such a dramatic expansion of features.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005NLQAHS/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BAFX &#8211; 34t5</a> is one of the most popular adapters you can find, and while we were initially skeptical about its quality it turned out to be the second-most compatible.</p>
<p>BAFX uses Bluetooth 3.0 protocols, so it’s only going to be useful with Android or Windows software. It worked flawlessly with Carista running on a Samsung Galaxy S5, though, and it was the fastest hardware to return a diagnostic report in our tests.</p>
<p>So long as you’re not using an Apple device, this is an economical and speedy choice.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WPW6BAE/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veepeak &#8211; VP01</a> is one of the older smartphone adapters, from before Bluetooth 4.0 protocols opened up the world of easier iOS compatibility. The Wi-Fi transmitter means it works with nearly any software platform you can imagine, even older laptops without Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Sadly, Wi-Fi transmission of OBD diagnostic data means that this adapter will kill your internet connection while you’re scanning your car, since your phone assumes you’ll get internet over Wi-Fi. (There are workarounds to use cell tower data and Wi-Fi at the same time, but it’s not simple.) That’s not the end of the world for diagnostic work, but if you were thinking about using this adapter to set up a virtual dashboard to monitor everyday engine performance, it basically kills any streaming music or navigation functions.</p>
<p>This adapter also seems to be blacklisted by the Carista app, and it’s by far the slowest hardware we tested.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UJV3E12/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Foxwell &#8211; NT301</a> only offers graphing one data value compared to Launch’s two, but there are a few features that might get you to consider spending the $25 extra it’ll cost.</p>
<p>For one, the NT301 allows recording and printout of the live data it reads. There are three recording slots, and recording can be triggered manually or set to automatically start when a diagnostic code shows up in the OBD system. Some mechanics will prefer more graph options over recording, but there are situations where it would be nice to have a scanner watching for values when you’re busy with some other part of your troubleshooting.</p>
<p>The NT301 also scores points for an easy-to-navigate interface, with a few more buttons that don’t ever leave you wondering which one to press. An I/M (smog check) readiness hotkey is a nice touch.</p>
<p>Foxwell lost some points, though, for speed. This scanner took 25% longer to complete a scan than our top pick, and it’s also one of the most expensive scanners we tested.</p>
<p>Still, if you want to print a graph, trigger evap tests, and keep your scanner separate from your smartphone, Foxwell’s NT301 does come in at $30 less than BlueDriver.</p>
<p>We upgraded this scanner to version 2.22 using the <a href="http://www.foxwell.com.au/nt301-software-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NTWonder</a> Windows-only software from Foxwell’s website. This software also allows you to print out freeze frame data or any values you’ve recorded.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WP4KY24/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CReader 4001</a> seems to fit in a bit of a grey area in the Launch product lineup. It’s not a model officially sold in the US by LaunchTech USA (the only authorized distributor if you’re buying something you want US warranty coverage for) and it isn’t on <a href="http://www.crecorder.com/website/index.do?method=welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRecorder.com</a> either. That means no updates, even though there’s a USB port on the bottom of the scanner.</p>
<p>This isn’t a big disappointment, though, since the 4001 doesn’t offer much in the way of specialized functionality. Software upgrades are always nice if they’re offered, but for OBD-II code reading an update is unlikely to change anything. At worst, you might miss out on new definitions for codes that get added as the system evolves, and you could always look those up online.<br />
We wondered if the V+ might be faster or show more detailed graphing information than the 4001, but it really does appear to be exactly the same hardware with a few more features enabled or disabled by the software they run.</p>
<p>The fact that this is the second-cheapest scanner we tested makes it an easy value recommendation, but the V+ is probably worth another $12 for many shadetree mechanics.</p>
<h3>Innova &#8211; 3030 g2</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-10868 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2.jpg" alt="Innova - 3030g2" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2-1500x1001.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Innova’s software suite that connects to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009JCU1ZO/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">3030g2</a> (often just listed as “3030g”) has probably the most sophisticated workflow we tested. Sadly, that also means it’s the most tied to an internet connection and a Windows computer (sorry Mac users.)</p>
<p>Innova’s PC software is called <a href="https://www.repairsolutions.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RepairSolutions</a>, and after you’re finished running the code checks with the handheld scanner, that’s where almost all the magic happens. This is a web service, so you’ll need a PC with internet access to do anything more than a basic code check.</p>
<p>Once you’ve created a RepairSolutions account and installed the drivers for your scanner, Innova allows you to do some basic paperwork: you can view and print reports for vehicles you’ve scanned and access technical service bulletins or recalls for those vehicles. This also lets you log miles between check-ups if you’re buying a scanner for vehicles you take care of, and it gives some “preventative maintenance” recommendations based on the age of the vehicle.</p>
<p>An upgraded subscription account ($9.99 per vehicle, or $39.99 for five cars) gives you access to recommended diagnostic and repair instructions from Innova’s database. (Pro accounts even let you print itemized repair costs.) This is less than the cost of a subscription on ChiltonDIY.com or buying a hard copy of a manual, and having repairs matched to specific codes is a real plus. It’s still going to cost more than using a library subscription to a Haynes or Chilton database and using RepairPal.com to look up codes and fixes, though.</p>
<p>The fact that Innova ties the diagnostics to VIN instead of car type also means that you can’t double-up your investment the way you can when buying a service manual and sharing with a friend who owns the same car.</p>
<p>The real killing blow for our opinion of the 3030g2 was that it failed to even scan for the ABS code in our test. ABS features command a price premium, generally only showing up in $150+ tools, and our car was listed as compatible on the <a href="https://www.innova.com/en-US/Product/Detail/3030g" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Innova compatibility checker</a>. If you get lucky and this tool can scan an ABS code for you, its value goes up, but without a live readout, the diagnostic utility is still less than it should be at this price.</p>
<p>The 3030g2 makes sense as a purchase for a maintenance completionist who likes to have stand-alone tools that create neat, organized reports. Paying extra for repair walkthroughs doesn’t make this a great value, but it does make it more like an entry-level shop computer than just a diagnostic reader.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007XE8C74/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Autel &#8211; AL319</a> is a simple scanner that presents basic OBD-II information without any other fluff. There are only two real interface buttons (scroll and enter) and a hotkey that will take you directly to an emissions pre-test report. If you just want to test cars for problems before you go to a “smog shop,” this scanner will give you the goods.<br />
The fact that you can read freeze frame and live data will help if you ever need to do any real troubleshooting, but this is definitely not a feature-rich solution like the graphing scanners from Launch.</p>
<p>Autel offers updates for the AL319 as separate download packages that require use of their MaxiLink II Toolkit PC software. This installer needs to be run from an administrator account, but the download was relatively easy to find.</p>
<p>The availability of updates means that this scanner has a thorough list of diagnostic trouble codes and you won’t be as reliant on looking those up somewhere else, but in the age of smartphones and RepairPal.com that’s not as important as it once was.</p>
<h3>Ancel &#8211; AD310</h3>

<p>The interface for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5EA74I/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ancel &#8211; AD310</a> is not the worst we used, but the monochrome LCD definitely reminds you that you’re working with a 1990s-era tool. The fact that the “back” button is on the right-hand side of the arrow keys is also something that annoyed us on a few occasions.</p>
<p>This was the only scanner featuring a USB port that doesn’t come with a Mini-USB-B to USB-A cable in the box. Fortunately we have plenty on hand from the other scanners.</p>
<p>Ancel was also the one of the few manufacturers that requires a registration — verified by email — in order to download an update. The form on their site gave an error when we tried to register (and we haven’t heard back from their email support staff), so we tested with the software version that shipped on the scanner.</p>
<p>The fact that the Ancel has up and down arrow keys almost gives it an edge over the nearest-rival Autel &#8211; AL319, and it’s 14 seconds faster than our top pick to run a scan, but on the whole we’d rather have the easy-reading color screen and an update tool we can actually use. Fortunately, the better-equipped <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WP4KY24/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Launch &#8211; CReader 4001</a> is cheaper than either of these.</p>
<h3>Autel &#8211; MaxiScan MS300</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001LHVOVK/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MaxiScan MS300</a> is, in a word, spartan. The only things this scanner can do are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell you what code triggered a check engine light</li>
<li>Reset the check engine light</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t know what a P0440 code is, you’ll have to look it up yourself; there’s a booklet and a CD included with code definitions just in case you’re stuck in 2004 and can’t use Google to check any codes you find.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you own a car long enough, you’ll see a check engine light. There are people, probably most people, who when faced with that inevitable scenario should immediately call a mechanic. (Hopefully one you already trust; if not, there’s Yelp.)</p>
<p>Then there are the other people. The other people want to know. The other people want to be sure that the problem really is something that only a professional can handle, and these people (admire or pity them, they won’t mind) need an OBD-II scanner.</p>
<p>If you’re in this second group and you love the way your smartphone connects you to more information than you ever imagined, then the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BlueDriver app and Bluetooth adapter</a> from Lemur Vehicle Monitors is definitely the scanner you should check out. The <a href="https://www.bluedriver.com/questions#block-faq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">compatibility list</a> for extended diagnostics (ABS, airbag codes, tire pressure monitors…) doesn’t include every car, but it probably includes yours.</p>
<p>For that even smaller set of people who do their own fixing but also sneer at smartphones, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZYTDKP3/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CReader V+ from Launch</a> doesn’t depend on Bluetooth or cell phone batteries. This scanner gives you access to basically every feature that falls under the universal OBD-II standard, so if there’s a check engine light you’re more than covered.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter 20 hours of installing and testing three different types of garage door openers, hundreds of open/close cycles and consulting with expert installers to learn what issues cause long-term problems, we chose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758L67KP?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chamberlain &#8211; B500 Series</a> as the best garage door opener for residential use. Chamberlain’s B550 is an ideal model for most do-it-yourself types, with a worry-free belt drive and all the features you’ll need right out of the box. For a German-engineered opener — and a higher price tag — look to our runner-up, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BMVRMY8?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sommer &#8211; Direct Drive 1042V001</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>We know plenty of anecdotal stories about openers in our own homes and in the garages of our friends and relatives, but we spent a long week digging on internet communities like /r/homeowners/ and the <a href="https://www.garagejournal.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Garage Journal</a> forum to see what other people have to say about the openers they install and use.</p>
<p>We talked to our contractor friends at <a href="https://www.buildzoom.com/contractor/k-t-younger-construction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KTY Construction,</a> garage door installers at <a href="http://crownsgd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crown Door</a>, and three different contractors who work with <a href="http://thegaragedoorhero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Garage Door Hero</a>.</p>
<p>After checking a few facts, we found out that Chamberlain Group, Inc. now makes the majority of openers in the US. This includes well-known brands like Liftmaster and Sears’ private label Craftsman.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Chamberlain has a good reputation among installers and homeowners. Sadly, the same cannot be said for the only major competitor, Genie. The general consensus is that durability and quality of materials used in Genie’s residential-class openers have degraded significantly in recent years, and it was hard to find an expert who didn’t warn us about that when we asked about the brand.</p>
<p>We decided not to test a Genie opener, since they’re very similar to Chamberlain models except in the reputation for build quality, and they’re not competitive in pricing.</p>
<p>To see how the other brands stand up to the market leader, we chose a newcomer to the market; Skylink has <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/11/review-skylink-atoms-garage-door-opener/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made a name for themselves</a> selling their compact “Atoms” openers with tight integration into the Skylink <a href="https://geekdad.com/2016/12/atoms-garage-door-opener/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DIY security/smart-home system</a>.</p>
<p>We also tested a Sommer direct-drive model, since it represents probably the only significantly different option you’ll have in the world of residential garage door openers. Sommer has very positive buzz in homeowner discussions and a lifetime warranty is always a good sign, even if it does come at a price premium.</p>

<h2 id="do-you-even-diy">Can you install an opener yourself?</h2>
<p>After working with three different types of opener systems and talking to three installers, we’d say there are a few essentials you need if you want to DIY:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Construction know-how.</strong> If you can’t climb up on a ladder and add a brace between studs to mount the bracket above the door header, then hire someone to do this job for you.</li>
<li><strong>Supplies and tools.</strong> Chamberlain’s kit doesn’t even include the lag bolts or angle iron you’ll need to hang the motor end, so a basic familiarity with construction fasteners and where to get them is essential. Beyond a ladder, you should have a measuring tape, wrench set and a good screwdriver. A stapler and a drill or impact driver are also must-have for running wire and driving lag screws.</li>
<li><strong>A helping hand.</strong> It’s possible to lift and install an opener motor yourself (the Sommer Direct-Drive is easiest in that case), but it isn’t fun. At the very least you’ll probably need a big cardboard box or a stool to raise the back of the rail so you can clear your door springs when you hang the front end.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve got a free afternoon, tools and supplies, then installing a garage door opener isn’t especially difficult. If you’re replacing an existing opener, it shouldn’t take more than four hours.</p>

<p>If you search on Yelp or talk to general contractors and property managers, it’s pretty easy to find garage door installers with good reputations. These are the guys installing, repairing and maintaining residential and commercial doors all around you, so they know how to keep your door rolling.</p>
<p>Retailers like Home Depot and Amazon also have “professional installation” services they sell, but from what we can see, they&#8217;re not much different from calling up a pro from Yelp. There’s a lower chance of getting stuck without service or warranty recourse if you go through a bigger company, but you can save some money if you cut out the middle-man.</p>
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>An installer can do the job quickly and efficiently and will have all the materials ready to get the job done.</li>
<li>If you’re buying the opener hardware from your installer, there’s usually a service warranty included in case anything ever goes wrong.</li>
<li>The installer’s opener, if you buy it, typically has a long one-piece track that is said to be more reliable and durable than the bolt-together track that comes in retail packaging.</li>
<li>An installer will also be able to maintain and service your door, including adjustment of the track, joints and spring balance. All our experts said this is the #1 key to keeping your door running for a long time.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>An installer will often try to sell you an opener, and in that case, you’ll probably have fewer choices than you would if shopping for your own.</li>
<li>An installer won’t do electrical work for you, so make sure you have a ceiling outlet tested and ready to go before you call.</li>
<li>If you want to install something exotic like a Sommer Direct-Drive or a Jackshaft opener, some installers will turn down the job or offer no warranty even on the installation labor.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-install">How to install a garage door opener</h2>
<p>Installing an opener on a door that has never had a motor before will take a few extra steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Spring balance will probably be biased toward making your door open by itself once you unlock it. That’s nice for saving you work when opening by hand, but it means a motorized opener is fighting the spring every time it closes the door, and that’s extra wear on the motor over decades of opening and closing. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KiZvXfMCmgs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It’s not really that complicated to tweak spring balance</a>, but if you’ve got any doubts about your ability to do this safely then it’s definitely worth paying a pro.</li>
<li>Make sure you have an electrical supply where you need it. For our test install, we had to swap a lamp base for a receptacle: we tried a <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Leviton-Porcelain-Lamp-Holder-with-Pull-Chain-and-Outlet-R60-09726-00C/100357030" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">lamp-holder-with-outlet solution</a> but found that the plug would fall out of these receptacles easily and we don’t recommend them. You might be able to fit a receptacle in your ceiling electrical box, but with a smaller ceiling box designed for lamp bases, you may need <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000HEHCAU/?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a specialized adapter</a>.</li>
<li>If you have a finished ceiling rather than exposed joists or rafters, then locating the studs is going to be a must for hanging the opener. The installer we worked with uses <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002CU7MS4/?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">perforated angle iron</a> for hanging the opener motor and attaching the front of the rail to the wall above the door, which made all adjustments easy.</li>
</ol>
<p>After you find your power and structural options, or if you’re replacing an existing opener, the step-by-step guides included with the openers are thorough and clear. Assemble the rail, assemble the drive system, hang the door end of the rail, hang the motor, attach the door bracket and wire in the safety and control switches.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Motor power and door weight</h3>
<p>A garage door can weigh quite a bit, but nearly all rolling-door systems are designed with a large, carefully-tensioned spring that will keep the door “balanced.” If your opener is disconnected and you pull the door halfway open, it should stay there and not move. If you’re installing a new opener or replacing an old one, checking the balance of your door is a good first step to making sure your opener will work well for a long time.</p>
<p>Because the spring carries the weight of your door, for the majority of residential door installations the common ½ HP motor is more than enough power. At the very top of the open position the door is often resting on the track, though, and an especially heavy door (with wooden panels, for example) might benefit from a bigger ¾ or 1 HP motor.</p>
<h3>“Trolley” openers</h3>
<p>These all work in pretty much the same way, with your choice of a belt, chain or worm-gear shaft driving a trolley up and down a track that you install on your garage ceiling.</p>
<p>The majority of openers sold and installed are chain-drive, and typically that’s the only option on the most economical models at your hardware store. Belts are more common on models with all the bells and whistles, advertised as <a href="#how-we-tested">quieter than chains</a>. Worm-gear driveshafts are less common and require periodic greasing to keep them running quiet and smooth.</p>
<h3>Direct-Drive openers</h3>
<p>Sommer makes an opener system that mounts the motor directly to the trolley moving up and down the track, so the only moving part is the drive wheel itself. These are more expensive than the pulley-drive “trolley” openers, but they’re made in Germany and come with a lifetime warranty. This system is also one of the few that still uses a mechanical limit “stop” that tells the motor when to stop pushing, which will reassure the traditionalists who distrust the control circuits in other openers.</p>
<h3>Jackshaft openers</h3>
<p>If you have room (recommended clearance is almost a foot from the edge of your door to the wall), a “jackshaft” opener like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BS28SP8?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Liftmaster &#8211; 8500</a> lifts your door directly from one side of the spring-balanced axle that makes your door easy to open and close. The advantage here is that you don’t need track and drive systems installed overhead, so setting it up should be much simpler and cleaner if you have space on the wall. (There are also <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002P5RDDK/?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">adapters</a> to get around clearance problems <a href="https://www.garagejournal.com/forum/showpost.php?p=3396232&amp;postcount=18" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like two-door installations.</a>)</p>
<p>Do note that a jackshaft system requires extra tuning to keep the cable from unwinding and potentially causing the door to fall. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002P5PVXE/?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pusher springs</a> are recommended to make sure your residential door will never get stuck at the top and cause a dangerous accident by free-falling.</p>
<h3>Battery backup</h3>
<p>Most garage door openers on the market are now available with a battery upgrade, and if the power in your area is especially unreliable it might be worth the cost.</p>
<p>We asked our installer contacts for opinions about batteries, and they noted that the biggest downside to batteries is that they will need replacing. Customer reviews online confirm that five to six years is a typical life for a backup unit, even if your power never goes out when you need to open the door.</p>
<p>If your garage door is the only way in and out of a building, make sure that you have some kind of mechanical emergency release system in place, even if you opt for a battery backup in case of power outages. A keyed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AOREGHQ/?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“vault lock” emergency release</a> is quick to install and gives you a secure way to manually open the door from the outside even if your opener motor is malfunctioning.</p>
<h3>Remotes and keypads</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10834" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/remotes-and-keypads.jpg" alt="remotes and keypads" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/remotes-and-keypads.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/remotes-and-keypads-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/remotes-and-keypads-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/remotes-and-keypads-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/remotes-and-keypads-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/remotes-and-keypads-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/remotes-and-keypads-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/remotes-and-keypads-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/remotes-and-keypads-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/remotes-and-keypads-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/remotes-and-keypads-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>One of the only differences between manufacturer model numbers is the package of accessory remotes and panels included in the box you get.</p>
<p>It’s definitely cheaper to buy a package with all the components you want than to pick and choose redundant replacement parts, but you may have no choice if you want a compact single-button remote and an outdoor wireless keypad, for example.</p>
<p>Sommer was the only manufacturer that didn’t have a package with a code-entry keypad, and that’s definitely the feature that we missed most. If you don’t want to set up internet-enabled opening, a keypad on the outside of the door is a great backup just in case a family member locks you out of the house.</p>
<h3>Lighting options</h3>
<p>Other than the Atoms models, garage door openers all have sockets for standard a21-size lightbulbs. We tested models with two sockets, but some less expensive models will only take one.</p>
<p>Note that while incandescent bulbs are hot and inefficient and CFL bulbs are ugly, some LED bulbs can <a href="#how-we-tested">interfere with opener remotes</a>.</p>
<h2 id="wi-fi-garage">Smart hubs and compatibility issues</h2>
<p>Chamberlain Group (which includes Liftmaster and some other names) are integrating the “MyQ” smart garage system into their hardware, and it was included with the B550 opener we tested. All of the new opener motors from Chamberlain’s brands are compatible with the system, but if you don’t see a “Wi-Fi” logo on the motor housing, then you’ll need to add the “<a href="https://www.chamberlain.com/smartphone-control-products/smartphone-connectivity/myq-home-bridge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyQ home bridge</a>” to make it work.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10840" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor.jpg" alt="Nexx garage sensor installed" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor-1500x1001.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Nexx Garage is an example of a third-party device that adds the same functionality. The hardware is a compact Wi-Fi-connected box that comes with one sensor so it knows when your door is open or closed. There’s also one set of wires to emulate a button push on your garage door opener’s wall panel and trigger the motor.</p>
<p>This is where the compatibility tricks come into play: Chamberlain’s MyQ openers don’t use a simple normally-open switch to trigger the motor, so Nexx Garage won’t work with Chamberlain hardware out of the box. <a href="http://nexxgarage.com/not-compatible-openers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexx Garage is currently offering a free bridge</a> that uses a wireless remote signal to trigger your MyQ opener, but it’s much easier to try working within Chamberlain’s walled garden if that’s the opener motor you want.</p>
<p>Nexx Garage is fairly easy to install: screw one side of the magnetic sensor to the wall above your door and screw the other side to the top of your door next to it. The included screws weren’t tough enough to get through the aluminum skin of our tester door, but a drill helped them out. There are also brackets included if you don’t have room at the top of your door, but the suggested mounting position worked well for us.</p>
<p>So long as you don’t have a Chamberlain opener, the button-push wires can go straight into your motor control connectors where your wall switch wires go. (There’s a small jumper wire included so you can test that this method works to trigger your opener, or you could test with a paperclip before you buy a Nexx Garage.)</p>
<p>The apps we tested, MyQ and NexxGarage, are nearly identical in functionality and setup. Even with a mediocre Wi-Fi signal out in the garage we quickly got both systems working and haven’t had any problems.</p>
<p>The app is great for checking on how often your door has opened during the week or opening/closing for a friend or a delivery guy without giving away your keycode. We linked NexxGarage to Google’s Assistant, but other than voice control there isn’t much it adds.</p>
<p><a href="https://ifttt.com/create" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IFTTT</a> recipes are the most powerful way to leverage a smart garage door. IFTTT can do things like open your door when you reach the driveway or turn off some security systems and turn on your smart lightbulbs when you get home and open the door.</p>
<p>Right now Chamberlain’s MyQ system supports IFTTT if you pay a (small) subscription fee; Nexx Garage includes it for free, though it’s “in beta testing.”</p>
<p>IFTTT opens up an insane number of “that’s cool, but why?” possibilities. The number of things that <i>could </i>trigger your door to open/close is overwhelming, but we can’t think of many that would be really useful. (The weather, maybe? An RSS feed publishing door statistics on your blog?)</p>
<p>If you’re the kind of person who worries at lunchtime whether you closed the door when you left for work in the morning, then this system might bring you peace of mind. Wi-Fi enabled opening and monitoring is a nice feature to have when it’s included (as in the Chamberlain systems), but we’re not sure it’s worth the extra purchase for the other openers we tested. If you buy a system like the Sommer without a keypad, buying an accessory keypad is probably a smarter first upgrade than the internet modules.</p>
<p>The one feature that we didn’t test, which seems <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YULBRWK/?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">exclusive to Gogogate</a>, is integrated video along with door monitoring. Gogogate says they can integrate most IP security cameras into their garage door app directly, and that’s a cool feature if you’re already buying smart security cameras for your home or if you have a rural security gate that’s inside your Wi-Fi range.</p>
<h3>Long-term testing update</h3>
<p>In our long-term testing, we did use the Nexx Garage smart system to remotely open a garage door (from another country!) after both of the Sommer remotes had been left inside our detached garage. (The Sommer doesn&#8217;t come in a package with a code-access keypad like the others do.) Getting notifications on your phone that the door has been left open for longer than ten minutes was cool at first, but we turned it off after working all day in the garage one weekend.</p>
<p>The status on the Nexx Garage app is occasionally wrong when you first open the app, but it&#8217;s always correct when you refresh it. We haven&#8217;t had any Wi-Fi connectivity issues, but we did see a one-day <a href="https://myqcommunity.chamberlain.com/chamberlainmyq/topics/myq-outage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outage of the Chamberlain MyQ system</a> recently (they said in an email that they lost power to servers). So far, reliability has been good for both systems, but not good enough that we&#8217;d say you should replace your remotes and access panels with a smartphone app.</p>

<p>We started with a blank slate: a single-car garage with a finished ceiling and a locking manual-open handle on a sectional roll-up door.</p>
<p>We worked with a pro installer from Garage Door Hero to set up the Chamberlain opener, and then our tester took it down and installed the other two systems himself.</p>
<p>Install difficulty is graded on two scales: ease of assembling and installing the hardware, and ease of understanding the instructions. Sommer’s system is remarkably easy to work with compared to the weight and complexity of the pulleys and fasteners of the other systems, but a critical step in the assembly of the drive unit <a href="https://www.sommer-usa.com/uploads/4/0/7/6/40760403/missing_fastening_bolt_sommer_direct_drive_openers.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is missing from the version of the installation instructions included in our box</a>.</p>
<h3>Motor speed and noise</h3>
<p>We tested the speed of each motor and the amount of noise they made. Looking at the test results, it’s clear that the number of seconds you save going with the fastest model and the change in noise is not going to be significant to most people.</p>
<p>We tested the noise level when opening and closing the door using an LEQ-A scale with REW measurement software. We also tested the noise level when the motor was disconnected from the door and the level of noise made by the door being opened and closed by hand.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the door itself is by far the main source of noise, so if you want to get “whisper-quiet” operation you’re better off looking into door maintenance than a different drive system.</p>
<p>That said, the door definitely makes more noise when it’s moving quickly, so if quiet operation is your goal, the slow-and-steady Sommer wins by a nose.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>We tested the door closing mechanism for resistance to intruders and for the safety features that prevent the door from closing on a person or object.</p>
<p>Each opener was secure against prying or lifting when closed, with no give or slack once the opener had been set to close the door completely during the final step of the installation process. If you notice a door that has a gap or any looseness when closed, you should be able to re-train the opener’s stop limit; check your owner’s manual.</p>
<p>Each opener system has a switch on the wall panel inside that allows you to “lock out” opener remotes or wall switches and prevent any remote entry.</p>
<h3>Safety sensors</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10838" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor.jpg" alt="safety sensor" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>If you can’t get your safety sensors aligned, your garage door opener will not work. We actually had more trouble with the highly adjustable clips on the Chamberlain system than the bare-bones brackets that came with the Atoms opener, though once we got them aligned we didn’t have any issues with sunlight or any other interference preventing the door from closing.</p>
<p>Once the sensors were aligned we did both standard safety tests: the doors did not close if there was an object in the doorway blocking the light beam of the sensor, and the doors all auto-reversed when they hit an object.</p>
<h3>Remote range</h3>

<p>We took our opener remote down the block to see how far away you need to be to get the door to open.</p>
<p>Chamberlain was the only manufacturer who listed a range number in marketing materials, and we only managed to get 10 percent of the claimed range, even with the bulky three-button remotes included. We checked and the LED bulbs we were using are on <a href="https://www.liftmaster.com/catalogresourcesv3/en-us/shared/files/tucmanuals/led%20bulb%20compatibility_011714.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the recommended list</a>. It’s possible that our issues would be solved with new batteries, but the range with the remotes as they came out of the box was sufficient.</p>
<p>The Skylink and Sommer remotes are compact key-fob-sized models, which we appreciate (especially when using the garage remote on a motorcycle), but there are compromises to get the compact package:</p>
<p>Skylink’s opener never managed to pick up remote signals from farther away than 60 feet. That’s more than enough to sit in your car in front of the door and open or close it, but if you second guess a button press while driving up because you’re not sure you were close enough you can start yourself down a frustrating stop-start cycle that will definitely add unneeded stress to your life.</p>
<p>The Sommer antenna was definitely getting interference from the smart LED bulbs we tested; with the bulbs in, it would barely pick up a signal from twenty feet away after the light turned on. Without any bulbs installed the opener would work from approximately the same 70-foot radius as the Chamberlain opener.</p>
<p>Update: we tried <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Sylvania-Value-Line-LED-Light-Bulb-A19-Soft-White-60-WE-E26-2-Ct/175179097" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">these Sylvania LED bulbs</a> in the Sommer, and the interference problem went away. If you can’t find those, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IHHVZTW/?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genie advertises bulbs that should be compatible with “most systems”, but they’re <i>very</i> expensive</a>.</p>
<h3>Smart features</h3>
<p>We tested the MyQ system integrated into Chamberlain’s opener and the add-on Nexx Garage system by setting them up with smartphone control. Our Wi-Fi coverage in the garage was good enough for the test, and we never noticed connection problems with the openers even when a laptop wasn’t getting enough signal to stream music.</p>

<p>There are times when it feels like cheating to pick the market leader as the “best” product in a category, but for most people, there’s really no reason not to pick the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758L67KP?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chamberlain Belt Drive system</a>.</p>
<p>Chamberlain will sell you this garage door opener with any one of a dozen configurations, and that’s one of the reasons we like it. Whether you buy the <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Chamberlain-1-2-HP-Chain-Drive-Garage-Door-Opener-HD210/206211732" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$110 Home Depot special</a> or the <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Chamberlain-1-1-4-HP-Smartphone-Controlled-Ultra-Quiet-Strong-Belt-Drive-Garage-Door-Opener-w-Battery-Backup-MAX-Lifting-Power-B970/301951467" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$238 system with an upgraded motor, battery backup and LCD wall panel</a>, the opener should install and behave in predictable and consistent ways. It might be a bit of a pain trying to find exactly the combination of features you want (you can’t get the feature-encrusted wall panel without an upgraded motor and bulky three-button remotes, for example), but at least you know you’ll be able to find the parts separately.</p>
<p>If you don’t see the B550 for sale, the <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Chamberlain-1-2-HP-Smartphone-Controlled-Heavy-Duty-Chain-Drive-Garage-Door-Opener-with-MED-Lifting-Power-C455/301951508" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">C455</a> has a nearly identical set of features but with chain-drive. We asked our installer, Jesus Rodriguez, which system he preferred, and he says that he hasn’t had any specific problems with any of the Chamberlain systems. “If you have a problem, it’s usually a problem from the start. Once an opener is set up right, we don’t really have problems with them.”</p>
<p>Installation for this system was fast and straightforward. Chamberlain does not include lag bolts or hanging brackets with their openers, so if you don’t have exposed overhead joists to hang the motor from (or if they’re in the wrong place) you’ll want to pick up some <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/s/lag%2520screw?NCNI-5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">lag screws</a> and <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-1-1-4-in-x-48-in-Zinc-Plated-Punched-Angle-801337/204225757" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bracket material</a> at your local home improvement store.</p>
<p>Everything else about installing the Chamberlain is quick and by-the-book. We had a pro installer hang this model for us, and they finished in less than two hours (including time for remote programming and our incessant questions.)</p>

<p>The day after installing there was a problem with the electronic safety “eye” alignment, probably due to the springs on the clip-on bracket settling overnight. After rocking them back and forth, the receiver LED glowed a steady green again, and everything worked without a hitch.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi-setup was quick; for more details on “smart” functions see our comparison with the Nexx Garage system above. Chamberlain has basically ensured that you can’t use third-party Wi-Fi adapters with their openers by changing the way wall switches send control signals, and that means you have to use Chamberlain’s MyQ app if you want smart features with this door opener. The downside there is that Chamberlain charges $10 per year to enable Google Assistant or IFTT compatibility, and that’s just <i>sad</i><b><i>.</i></b></p>
<p>We know that the people who want programming features like IFTTT compatibility are the same people who will refuse to buy products with pay-walls, so it’s a baffling decision. That said, it’s cheaper to buy a Chamberlain opener and subscribe to the IFTTT feature for a few years than it is to buy any competing “smart opener” systems.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Chamberlain is the market leader for a reason. The B550 Opener is solid and well-designed but still priced competitively.</li>
<li>Any installer or service technician will know exactly how to set up or troubleshoot this opener.</li>
<li>If you’re looking for info to do your own troubleshooting, Chamberlain has good documentation and most of the online discussions will be about a similar model.</li>
<li>This opener was the fastest we tested.</li>
<li>The remotes and keypad work flawlessly, even with cheap LED bulbs.</li>
<li>Wi-Fi “smart” app control works great with quick, easy setup.</li>

<p>First, the bad news. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BMVRMY8?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sommer’s &#8211; Direct Drive 1042V001</a> is the most expensive opener we tested, and it has the fewest accessories or perks. The install manual isn’t as easy to navigate as the others, and there’s even <a href="https://www.sommer-usa.com/uploads/4/0/7/6/40760403/missing_fastening_bolt_sommer_direct_drive_openers.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a part / design update that didn’t get included in the manual</a> shipping with those parts. This opener also had interference problems with a common LED lightbulb brand we tried.</p>
<p>With that out of the way: we really like this garage door opener, and if we had to re-install an opener every week this is the one we’d pick each time.</p>
<p>Many cantankerous old men talking about garage doors on the internet complain about the disappearance of mechanical limit switches, the part that tells your opener when to stop opening or closing the door. That’s fairly easy to program into the new-fangled electronic controllers, but it warms the cockles of our hearts to see that Sommer is still using a fail-safe mechanical system.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BMVRMY8?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sommer-direct-drive-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sommer-direct-drive-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sommer-direct-drive-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sommer-direct-drive-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sommer-direct-drive-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sommer-direct-drive-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sommer-direct-drive-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sommer-direct-drive-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sommer-direct-drive.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Runner-up: Sommer - Direct Drive</h3><p>This is a different way to open a garage door, and we love the ingenuity of the design. There’s a price premium and some quirks, but if you just want an opener that will last forever, then this is the one to get.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BMVRMY8?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>There are exposed moving parts and nylon gears on most garage door openers that need to stay tight, lubricated and precisely aligned in order to keep the system from wearing, chattering or jumping. (You also need to keep cats and birds from getting caught in the belt or chain.) Sommer keeps the moving parts to a bare minimum with one directly-driven metal sprocket that follows a precisely-tensioned metal chain hidden inside the rail.</p>
<p>The snap- or bolt-together rails of the other systems aren’t exactly awful designs, but the C-channel system Sommer uses is designed to stay in perfect alignment with the same tension that holds the chain up. If you have any doubts about tension in five or ten years, the system is easy to check and adjust.</p>
<p>Sommer managed to come out of our testing as the quietest opener, but that’s mostly because it’s the slowest. Unless you’re opening a brand-new door made with impossibly smooth joints on a perfectly-designed track, the door itself is going to be louder than any opener motor or drive mechanism, and the faster you open it the louder it will be.</p>
<p>While the other systems give you electronic eyes with brackets that snap onto a standard-size door roller track, Sommer makes no assumptions about your door and gives you brackets to screw into the wall. Aiming them was actually easier than it was for the Chamberlain system, and on our track, the clips took far more effort to snap on than we expected, so that’s another mark in Sommer’s favor.</p>
<p>This opener should work flawlessly with any third-party “smart” opener system like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J8JI9HY/?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nexx Garage</a>, and you can buy it <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Direct-Drive-3-4-HP-Garage-Door-Opener-with-Smartphone-Controller-1042V002/206417603" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bundled with Gogogate</a> at the Home Depot. That’s yet another price premium compared to the all-included price of Chamberlain’s system, but at least they won’t charge you a subscription fee to turn on IFTTT.</p>
<p>The one comment in a customer review that worries us slightly is a note from a user who has seen carbon buildup on the metal electrical contacts on his system. The contacts should be self-cleaning, so it’s hard to say what went wrong in his case. Spraying the contact point with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006LVEU/?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Deox-IT</a> every few years definitely wouldn’t hurt.</p>
<p>In the long run, the risks of something going wrong with a drive gear or belt on a conventional system are much higher, but it is something to watch for, and some people might be uncomfortable with a charged 24V DC rail overhead.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Sommer’s Direct-Drive one of the most expensive openers on the market, but the engineering quality might be worth the money in the long run.</li>
<li>A lifetime warranty means this is an opener you’d probably consider taking with you if you move, and it’s the easiest to disassemble and re-install.</li>
<li>No keypad or Wi-Fi accessories at this price, but they’re simple to add if you need those features.</li>
<li>Some surprise undocumented design updates and LED compatibility issues did make our install experience less than perfect.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M3OC32L?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Skylink &#8211; Atoms AT 1612</a> is not a bad opener. It’s a compact and simple design compared to our top pick, but the design emphasizes meaningful features at the expense of not looking like the garage door opener you grew up with.</p>
<p>If the cable-car-style sliding trolley had been a little bit more overbuilt, or if the optional Wi-Fi module and “smart” wall control were included at this price, the Atoms opener could maybe unseat Chamberlain.</p>
<p>As it is, there are too many concerns about the long-term life of all the lightweight parts and not enough reassurances that Skylink is going to be around in twenty years to sell you new ones.</p>
<p>Skylink has carefully thought through the install package and included niceties like lock-washers, lag bolts and extra bracket material that Chamberlain simply refuses to provide. The clear, simple alphanumeric programming and troubleshooting codes are also superior to the ‘count-the-flashes’ system Chamberlain uses.</p>
<p>While we were unimpressed by the range of the remotes included, it’s sufficient and we like how compact they are. The keypad is as good as anything we’ve seen, and the safety “eye” transmitter/receiver clipped on (with some effort) and worked immediately without any aiming or tweaking headaches.</p>
<p>The fact that the lightbulb is built-in is also a refreshing change from the old bring-your-own philosophy of the incandescent era. It’s not the brightest LED setup we’ve seen, but it’s great that you don’t need to guess about compatibility.</p>
<p>If you’re looking at this opener as part of Skylink’s security system, they checked all the right boxes for this component and you won’t have any compatibility headaches. For anyone else, we’re still not sure it’s worth choosing over the opener everyone else is buying.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you have a garage door opener that’s died or if you’re installing a brand new one, it’s incredibly confusing trying to navigate the maze of features and specifications for the models available.</p>
<p>We went with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758L67KP?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chamberlain &#8211; B550</a> for a few reasons. It’s easy to find and purchase online, and every installer or repair guy in the US will be familiar with this design. The hardware is well-built and the system has proven dependable for millions of owners.</p>
<p>The price on the B550 is also right in the sweet spot: this has all the features available in Chamberlain’s ½ HP lineup without a battery backup, so it’s often priced lower than less-common ½ HP models that don’t have Wi-Fi modules.</p>
<p>If you don’t like the snap-together rails and nylon pulleys of residential openers and you don’t have room for a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BS28SP8?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jackshaft opener</a> beside your door, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BMVRMY8?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sommer’s Direct-Drive</a> system is worth a look. There are quirks and a price premium that kept this model from making top pick, but it’s a well-designed piece of hardware with a lifetime warranty.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter 30 hours of research and four months of in-house testing with eight top products, we feel confident recommending the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748TR6Q1/?tag=ybdhandvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson &#8211; V7 Trigger</a> as the best handheld vacuum. While priced significantly higher than its counterparts, the Dyson’s long-lasting lithium battery, V7 digital motor and two tiers of radial cyclones give it a leg-up on our other finalists.</p>
<p><i>[Editor’s note: We originally reviewed the </i><i>Dyson &#8211; V6 Trigger</i><i>, but since we started testing, the </i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748TR6Q1/?tag=ybdhandvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Dyson &#8211; V7 Trigger</i></a><i> arrived on the scene and we tested this too. The newest model beat out the other finalists when it came to power, run time, and ease of use. Therefore, we still recommend the Dyson V7 as our number one pick.]</i></p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>There are at least 72 handheld vacuums currently on the market, so our first job was to narrow down the competition to a handful of finalists. We scoured subreddits like /r/VacuumCleaners/ and considered the findings from reviewers like Wirecutter and Consumer Reports. Once we had input from the professionals, we were able to ascertain which features rank the highest in a handheld vacuum. <strong>Power is key when deciding which handheld vacuum to purchase, and run time and battery life are also important considerations for cordless handhelds.</strong></p>
<p>First, we looked for handheld vacuums that met our key metrics, such as a superior filtration system and a powerful motor. Then, we filtered out handheld vacuums that had fewer than 200 reviews on Amazon. We also considered the reviews themselves and filtered out any models with a recurring theme of battery power loss or malfunctions. While we generally avoid selecting finalists from the same brand, the two Black + Decker units that we selected have completely different features and design, so we deemed it worthwhile to test both. With these details in mind, we selected eight finalists to review. Over the course of several months, we put them through a series of tests to judge their performance and ease of use.</p>

<h2 id="features-to-consider">Important features to consider</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lithium battery</strong> &#8211; Compared to NiCd batteries, lithium batteries boast a higher power density (meaning they can hold more energy and have longer runtimes). Lithium is the lightest of all metals and provides the highest energy densities. Lithium batteries are less likely to fade and cause your vacuum to lose suction during use.</li>
<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> &#8211; If you frequently use a handheld vacuum, the last thing you want is to give yourself carpal tunnel from heavy lifting. Even if you don’t develop a syndrome, a lighter weight vacuum is always easier to maneuver and carry around the house.</li>
<li><strong>Pet hair brush/tool</strong> &#8211; While many of the handheld vacuums we tested had a brush tool, we found that pet hair gets caught in brushes with nylon bristles. The vacuums with silicone tools for picking up pet hair were much more effective.</li>
<li><strong>Attachments/extensions</strong> &#8211; If you wish to purchase a vacuum, the likelihood is that you desire to use it for more than one task. For instance, a brush attachment is more effective at removing pet hair, while a crevice tool is ideally suited for cleaning car seats. If a car is your main target, <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-car-vacuum/">car vacuums</a> are more likely to have attachments you need there.</li>
<li><strong>Comfort</strong> &#8211; You can say all you want about suction power and attachments, but comfort is a key component in finding a tool that is the most practical for you to use.</li>
<li><strong>Corded vs. cordless</strong> &#8211; Corded vacuum cleaners have a longer run time and can continuously perform until the job is done (not just the ten minutes of a cordless handheld). Even the corded models with extra-long cords can be a hassle if you’re trying to reach the inside of your car or just want to zap a mess quickly. Consider the pros and cons and choose the type of model that works for you.</li>
<li><strong>Cyclonic action</strong> &#8211; This sounds a bit like marketing fluff when you first read about it, but cyclone technology really does provide stronger suction power and therefore, cleaner floors. The downside is that these types of vacuums are generally sold at a much higher price point.</li>

<p>Even with the highest quality brands, consumers have reported that their cordless handheld vacuum doesn’t hold a charge after a certain length of time. <strong>This so-called “memory effect” in rechargeable batteries is more accurately referred to as a voltage depression or deletion.</strong> While the phenomenon is indisputable, there is debate over the cause. Without delving too deeply into the science behind the occurrence, voltage depression can happen when you consistently recharge a battery before it runs out. This can cause it to “remember” a lower capacity and drop the voltage and capacity over time. It is a well-known feature of NiCd batteries, less noticeable in NiMH batteries and recently acknowledged to also occur in lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p>Is there anything you can do about it? You may be able to recondition the battery by running it down to the 90% discharge point (or to a cell voltage of 1.0 V) followed by a charge cycle several times. However, if the voltage depression is due to overcharging (charging it for too long) or improper storage, you can expect it to permanently operate at a reduced capacity. Unless the manufacturer clearly states that the model can be kept on the charger, you should be prompt about removing it once it is fully charged.</p>

<p>Over the course of four months, we used the handheld vacuums for odd jobs around the house. We sucked up coffee grind spills in the kitchen, cracker crumbs on the couch and cleaned up ground-in dirt from the welcome mat. Vacuuming our car interior was an especially effective method of testing the finalists, with a constant supply of sand in the mats and Cheerios in the car seats. We emptied canisters and removed and replaced filters. We tried out the various attachments. In short, we tested the usability and ergonomics of each finalist on a wide variety of spaces including hardwood floors, carpet and upholstery.</p>
<p>While using each finalist on a task, we considered how comfortable it felt to hold and whether or not it could navigate tight crevices (such as in a car) as well as larger areas (like a floor rug). One of the first things we first noticed was that a difficult to empty canister could put us off a handheld vacuum quickly. Most people grab a handheld vacuum for a task because they want to clean up a mess in a matter of minutes. <strong>Fiddling with a complicated or hard to clean out waste canister seemed to defeat the purpose of using a faster clean up method in the first place.</strong></p>
<h3>Power and suction capabilities</h3>

<p>In order to test the power of each vacuum, we used incremental weights (up to 16 ounces, at which point it became unwieldy) to see how heavy of an object it could lift. To create disposable weights, we used a bag of pinto beans, plastic baggies and a digital kitchen scale.</p>
<p>Then we turned around and tested the vacuum at the 90% discharge point to see if there was a power drop. For example, the Dyson has a run time of 30 minutes. We used it for 27 minutes, then went back and retested the power with the same method as before.</p>
<p>The cordless vacuums using lithium batteries claim fade-free run time, but we found that they did in fact lose suction as they ran out of power. The question then became how much. <strong>At the 90% discharge point, the Dyson could pick up 12 ounces of weight versus 16 ounces at full capacity.</strong> On the other hand, the Black + Decker cordless models could only pick up five ounces at the 90% discharge point. At full capacity, it could pick up 16 ounces.</p>

<p>Since so many of the finalists could pick up 16 ounces, we devised a new test to determine which vacuums had the most power. We used a ruler to measure the distance it took to suction up a handful of Cheerios.</p>
<p>While we had used the handheld vacuums to pick up sand, debris and dust around the house and in the car interior, we also devised a specific test to compare suction capability. We used baking soda to mimic dust and dry oatmeal to mimic debris, and ground both into short pile Berber carpet. <strong>All of the finalists performed well in this test, easily picking up the dry oatmeal and effectively removing the baking soda powder residue from the carpet (using brush attachments when available).</strong> However, we found that real life messes posed more of a problem to clean up and we rated our finalists accordingly.</p>
<h3>Sound</h3>
<p>We tested the sound output of all the finalists. If you’re cleaning up after kids and pets, you don’t want to wake the baby or send Fido scurrying into the other room. We used a sound pressure level meter to measure and record the amount of decibels when held one inch from the motor. The Dyson &#8211; V7 Trigger was practically whisper quiet compared to the others, at 89 dB. We were also impressed with the HoLife &#8211; Portable, which was the second quietest handheld vacuum at 91 dB. The Dirt Devil was the loudest at 109 dB.</p>
<h3>Run time and charging ease</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-12979 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data.png" alt="charging and runtime data" width="2000" height="1860" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data.png 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data-610x567.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data-768x714.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data-885x823.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data-1500x1395.png 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data-295x274.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data-1000x930.png 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data-360x335.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data-375x349.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data-414x385.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data-320x298.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data-885x823@2x.png 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>For the cordless models, we felt it imperative to test the run time after a full charge. Dyson is upfront about the run time, citing 30 minutes for regular use and 6 minutes in MAX mode. MAX mode gives you even stronger suction for those particularly challenging areas. We found this to be accurate when testing. <strong>We also cleaned the car using a mix of Powerful and MAX mode as necessary (the boost mode is especially helpful in tight crevices), which gave us about 18 minutes of run time and was ample to complete the task.</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to charge time, you can use the cordless vacuums before they are fully charged to quickly clean a mess, but you aren’t getting the maximum results. For example, we tested the Dyson’s weight limit after using it for 27 minutes (90% of its run time on a full battery). On a full charge, it could pick up the highest limit we tested: 16 ounces. In instances where a full charge was not indicated by the turning on or off of a light, we referred to the manufacturer’s specifications. For the vacuums that did have an indicator light (such as the Black + Decker &#8211; 20V MAX FLEX), we tested the charge by running it until the battery lost power and then replaced it on its charging base. Then, we timed how long it took for the light to turn on or off, indicating a full charge.</p>
<p>Finally, we considered the ease of use when charging. The Dyson &#8211; V7 Trigger simply plugs in to the power cord whereas the other cordless models need to be balanced on a stand. This no-fuss charging was just one of the design features we liked about the Dyson. The charging base for the Black + Decker &#8211; 20V was also convenient, with a wide, flat base that made it unlikely to tip and the ability to organize the many attachments that come with this model. The vacuum and base are designed to store all your attachments in one place, so they are ready when you need them. On the other end of the spectrum, the HoLife &#8211; Portable could tip over easily, so you need to make sure the model is upright.</p>
<h3>The pet hair test</h3>

<p><a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">Vacuuming up pet hair</a> from hard surfaces isn’t difficult, but it becomes significantly more difficult to remove when it’s embedded in your carpet or upholstery. Pet beds are notorious pet hair magnets and simply throwing them in the washing machine doesn’t solve the problem. According to <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/washing-machines/dont-let-pet-hair-ruin-your-washer/">Consumer Reports</a>, pet hair tends to clump and stick to the wet fabric, drain pumps and sides of the wash cylinder, too. This means your washing machine and plumbing systems have to work harder, making a vacuum a better choice.</p>
<p>Four of our finalists include brushes that are specifically designed for pet hair removal. In order to find out which handheld vacuum is best for pet owners, we took the Bissell &#8211; Pet Hair Eraser, Black + Decker &#8211; 20V MAX FLEX, Dyson &#8211; V7 Trigger and Shark &#8211; Pet Perfect to task on a canvas dog bed that belongs to a Golden Labrador.</p>

<p>Labradors have a double coat: a soft, downy undercoat and a thicker guard coat. They shed their coats twice a year, but in temperate climates such as San Diego (where we tested), you can expect to find hair on your upholstery throughout the year. The light color of Golden Labrador hair makes it show up more easily, so it was a good measure of the finalists’ suction power.</p>
<p>Each of the handheld vacuums we tested on pet hair were able to remove the hair, so a more accurate comparison was done by considering ease of use rather than the end result. <strong>It was quickly evident that the vacuums with rubber nozzles required less effort and repetitive motion.</strong> The rubber attracts and loosens pet hair from the fabric, whereas hair gets caught in the regular bristle brushes and never makes it into the canister.</p>
<p>Our top pick for pet hair, the Black + Decker &#8211; 20V MAX FLEX, is easily portable, lightweight and uses cyclonic action to separate dust particles and pet dander from the air flow. This renders a continuous suction power, which combined with the rubber nozzle attachment to loosen pet hair, removed pet hair easily. It performed best on the stubborn areas where pet hair gathers, such as the piping trim.</p>
<p>The Dyson &#8211; V7 Trigger is another top performer, with enough power to easily remove hair, cyclonic action for pet dander, and a mini motorized tool to agitate and loosen embedded hair. While pet hair does get caught in the brush bar (unlike the rubber nozzle of our top pick for pet hair), the brush bar slides out so you can easily clear obstructions.</p>
<p>For a budget option, the Bissell &#8211; Pet Hair Eraser is a great option with its rubber contour nozzle and a cyclonic cleaning system to help eliminate allergens. Its nozzle spans four inches across, so it makes quick work of an entire pet bed, but made it difficult to reach into the piping trim and corners.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Dyson &#8211; V7 Trigger</h2>

<p>The Dyson brand is famous for its digital motor and cyclonic action. In fact, it was Sir James Dyson who invented the concept. With a reputation that precedes it, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748TR6Q1/?tag=ybdhandvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson &#8211; V7 Trigger</a> does not disappoint. Dyson invented the first cyclonic vacuum cleaner, and its increasing popularity has spawned several imitators. Dyson’s basic concept uses two cyclones. The first creates a vortex that spins at about 200 mph and flings large particles out of the air into a dust-collecting cup. The second, tucked inside the first, creates a cyclone that can reach 900 mph, which can spin out and collect even the smallest dust particles.</p>
<p>Despite a high price point, we felt it was worth every penny. Radial cyclones are arranged in two tiers to increase airflow and create a vortex that spins at an incredibly high speed, then spins it out into the filter. This allows it to capture more fine dust, which was clearly evident when we vacuumed a mattress, window blinds and a computer keyboard. <strong>The dust was so fine on these surfaces that it wasn’t visible on the surfaces themselves, but you could clearly see material in the collection container after the job was done.</strong></p>

The V7 Trigger lives up to Dyson's reputation for innovation, power and design. It's pricier than the others, but worth it.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748TR6Q1/?tag=ybdhandvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>In addition to strong suction, the Dyson’s point and shoot design made it the most comfortable to handle. The trigger releases instantly, so you aren’t fussing with an on/off switch and battery power is only used for vacuuming. When vacuuming a car interior and moving from area to area, we found this a great tactic for conserving enough battery to get the entire job done in one go.</p>

<p><strong>One of the features that makes the Dyson so convenient to grab and go is its hygienic one-touch bin emptying</strong>. With the models that require you to twist off the waste bin lid, the pressure of releasing it could sometimes cause dust to scatter over your hand and the container you’re emptying it into. The Dyson doesn’t have this problem because it empties out downward with the pull of a lever.</p>
<p>The canister of the V6 model tended to stick, but they improved this feature with the V7 release. Rather than pushing downward with two thumbs, you pull the lever upwards to drive out trapped dirt and debris without getting messy.</p>
<p>One downside we did notice in tight spots (such as a car seat) is that because of the angle of the nozzle, you sometimes had to turn your arm around to get the correct angle. Also, the V6 model gave you the option to lock the trigger for continuous suction, but the redesigned V7 trigger must be compressed at all times.</p>
<p>The Dyson V7 has slightly less power than the V6 on normal mode, with 28W suction power on the V6 versus 21W suction power on the V7. However, on MAX mode the performance is the same: 100W. We verified this in our testing, with the V7 giving us the same results as the V6 on MAX power mode.</p>
<p>The V7 improves upon its predecessor with a longer run time (a total of 30 minutes) and reduced noise. We recorded the V6 at 97.2 dB. The V7 has been acoustically engineered to reduce volume and improve sound quality, which we verified with a lowered decibel level of 89.3 dB.</p>
<p>Similar to the V6, the V7 comes with a crevice tool and a combination tool which was soft enough to vacuum dust on a keyboard. In addition to the tools offered with the V6, the V7 also includes a mini motorized tool for pet hair.</p>
<p>The mini motorized tool effectively removes pet hair from furniture and upholstery. The beater bar of this tool unlocks so you can easily clear obstructions. With the V6, we resorted to the stiff brush attachment to remove pet hair, and hair tended to catch in the brush rather than actually reach the waste canister. If you’re a pet owner, the mini motorized tool is a helpful addition to your pet cleaning arsenal.</p>
<p>The Dyson also has attachments available for purchase. We tested the stiff bristle brush, which we found helpful to agitate sand on carpet or in the trunk area of a car. We used the mattress tool to slow-vacuum our mattress. The attachment allowed us to get into the seams and crevices, and we were impressed/disgusted with the amount of material it picked up after vacuuming the entire mattress surface. (If you suffer from allergies, you may want to use a model with whole system HEPA filtration such as the Dyson &#8211; V8 Absolute we feature in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuum review</a>.)</p>
<h3>Dyson V7 Trigger vs. V8 Absolute</h3>
<p>If you’re wondering about the difference between the Dyson V7 Trigger and the Dyson V8 Absolute, let us help clarify. The V7 Trigger is technically the newest model, although the two models were released within months of each other.</p>
<p>Even though the V7 and V8 both have the new quick release connection, the V7 can’t be used as <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">a stick vacuum</a>. The wand will connect, but there is not enough electrical output to power a motorized brush. The V8 Absolute is a stick vacuum which can use the most attachments. The V8 Absolute converts to a handheld as well, so it’s the most versatile between the two. Only the V8 Absolute has HEPA filtration.</p>
<p>Both the V7 and V8 have the new bin dispenser, which cleans the cyclone as you empty it. The V8 will run up to 40 minutes and the V7 will run up to 30 minutes. The V7 has 100 air watts of suction and the V8 has 115 air watts of suction.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to purchase a stick vacuum, we highly recommend the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IENFJ14/?tag=ybdhandvac-20">Dyson &#8211; V8 Absolute</a>. However, it does come with a $499* price tag. If you’re looking to accomplish the typical tasks of a handheld, we recommend the Dyson &#8211; V7 Trigger, as it is (strangely) the newest model of Dyson handheld and less than half the price of the V8 Absolute at $192.*</p>

<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If price isn’t a consideration, choose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748TR6Q1/?tag=ybdhandvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson &#8211; V7 Trigger</a>. It has the most cleaning power of the finalists we tested and captures even the smallest dust particles.</li>
<li>While all of the cordless models claimed fade-free suction, the Dyson was the only model we tested that had minimal power drop at the 90% discharge point.</li>
<li>The ergonomic design means that it fits conveniently into the palm of your hand, and has a balanced weight distribution so it’s comfortable to use.</li>
<li>For stubborn messes, the Dyson has a MAX power mode to give you even more suction power.</li>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JILGZOC/?tag=ybdhandvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black + Decker &#8211; 20V MAX FLEX</a> has many of the features that won us over on our top pick, including a lithium battery with 20 minutes of run time, cyclonic action and strong suction. The design is cordless, ultra-compact and easy to cart around. The Black + Decker offers the greatest amount of flexibility in cleaning projects, with a bevy of attachments and a charging station to hold them all.</p>

<p>You could tailor the cordless vacuum to tackle any task, simply by switching out the attachment. The stick vac with pivoting floor head attachment helps you reach rugs or ceiling fans easily. The four foot flexible hose attachment allowed us to get in hard to reach areas, which is essential when maneuvering around a vehicle with multiple car seats. At only 3.2 pounds, it’s the lightest cordless handheld we tested. This makes it easy to hold with one hand and use the flexible hose to reach just about anywhere. It also comes with a long crevice tool and a two-in-one nozzle/brush attachment.</p>
<p>If you’re a pet owner, you may have heard of the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/5379906/remove-pet-hair-with-rubber-gloves">rubber glove hack</a> for picking up pet hair from upholstery. The pet hair brush attachment for the Black + Decker mimics this technique and improves upon it. A rubber nozzle and fingers grip even the peskiest hairs embedded into the fabric and easily remove them. Best of all, the hairs didn’t stick to the nozzle, so they actually ended up in the waste canister for fast disposal.The dust canister removes easily: you simply unlock it, twist and empty out the contents. Both the removable bowl and filter are washable.</p>
<p>The Black + Decker is a solid recommendation, but it doesn’t take first place since the battery does lose power at the 90% discharge rate, and it’s a fairly big drop. Close to the end of its run time, it could only pick up eight ounces of weight as opposed to at least 16 ounces on a full charge.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The rubber nozzle attachment on the Black + Decker &#8211; 20V MAX FLEX has strong hair-gathering ability and made this model the most effective at dealing with pet hair.</li>
<li>Multiple attachments, including a four foot flexible hose, means that it can handle a wide variety of tasks, even tidying your hardwood and carpet floors as easily as an upright vacuum.</li>
<li>It is lightweight and ultra compact, so you can easily bring it anywhere, making it as portable as it is functional.</li>
<li>Cyclonic action and a three stage filtration system keep the motor running at top performance and prevent dust and dirt from escaping.</li>

<p>The Dirt Devil does have a few cons, the biggest one being that it is very loud. We didn’t really need a sound meter to tell us this, but the meter shows that it reads nine decibels above the second loudest handheld vacuum we tested. Secondly, the force and direction of the exhaust system means it tends to blow air right at you as you vacuum. At this price, however, these cons may be small considerations.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Dirt Devil &#8211; Scorpion has strong suction and plenty of power with a seven amp motor.</li>
<li>You don’t have to worry about run time or charging with a corded model, and an extra long cord gives you enough freedom to finish the job without changing outlets.</li>
<li>An integrated crevice tool flips down and locks into place, so you don’t have to search for it in the middle of a task.</li>
<li>At less than four pounds, you can pick up and go wherever the mess takes you.</li>

<h3>Black + Decker &#8211; 16V MAX</h3>
<p>Black + Decker brought the original DustBuster handheld vacuum onto the market, and the model style is still popular among handheld vacuums. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006LXOJC0/?tag=ybdhandvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black + Decker &#8211; 16V MAX</a> is the latest version of the DustBuster, although the only thing it has in common with its predecessor is a recognizable silhouette. The newer model is sleeker and uses 50% less energy thanks to Smart Charge technology. It protects the battery with a high efficiency lithium charger that automatically shuts off when the battery is charged, so there’s no risk of overcharging. The Black + Decker models are the only finalists we tested that are designed to be stored on the charger, so they are always at the ready.</p>
<p>In comparison with the Black + Decker &#8211; 20V MAX FLEX, the 16V has less power and doesn’t have a stick head attachment for use on the floor, making it less multi-purpose. On the other hand, it has a pick up and go design that makes it easy to quickly zap up household messes.</p>
<p>This cordless handheld can hold a charge for 18 months, and is ready when you are. While we used it too often to tell if it can hold a charge for an extended period of time, we appreciated the charging light which indicates when the charge is complete. This is important, because for best results, you need to run this handheld on a full charge. <strong>The Black + Decker suffers from power loss as the battery runs down, despite advertising fade-free battery power.</strong></p>
<p>Another mark against this model was the need to remove the filter in order to empty the canister, making quick pick-ups less efficient. However, everything about this model is a vast improvement from the old school DustBuster of the 80’s.</p>
<h3>Shark &#8211; Pet Perfect</h3>
<p>There’s a lot to like about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0037HHFMO/?tag=ybdhandvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Pet Perfect</a>, such as a strong suction and a wall-mountable charging stand. It takes nearly double the amount of time to charge than our other finalists, but it delivers strong and consistent suction. Many Amazon reviewers used this to pick up kitty litter, which makes sense because it delivers strong and consistent suction using twister cyclonic technology, making it ideal for heavier debris such as kitty litter or pet food. We found the suction to be a little too aggressive when removing hair from the pet bed though, and we were concerned that the strong pull on the fabric (nearly sucking it into the canister) would damage the fabric over time.</p>
<p>The motorized beater brush on this vacuum uses a spinning action to pick up hair from all surfaces, and while hair did tend to get caught in the nylon bristles, there was no hair left on the pet bed. It didn’t make our top pick because the suction power fades out before the battery fully dies, and some consumers have reported permanent loss of suction power over time.</p>
<h3>Bissell &#8211; Pet Hair Eraser</h3>
<p>For a budget-friendly option that removes pet hair without any bells or whistles, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001EYFQ28/?tag=ybdhandvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissell &#8211; Pet Hair Eraser</a>. It has a cyclonic cleaning system and multi-layer filtration like the more expensive models, and a rubber nozzle that attracts pet hair. <strong>Even stubborn pet hair was easily removed with the rubber nozzle, combed fingers and strong suction.</strong> An extra long cord means you can reach your furry friend’s favorite spots with no trouble.</p>
<p>It’s best used for removing pet hair and isn’t as multi-functional as our other finalists. A wide nozzle and no attachments means it really only serves the one purpose.</p>
<h3>Eureka &#8211; EasyClean</h3>
<p>If you’re purchasing a handheld vacuum primarily because it can be a hassle to clean carpeted stairs with a full size vacuum, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006HUYGM/?tag=ybdhandvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; EasyClean</a> is perfectly designed for this task. With a 20 foot cord and a three foot flexible hose attachment (and a crevice tool for the end of the hose), it can easily reach anywhere you need to clean. The Eureka has a special riser visor that flips up, so you can clean the face of your couch or the horizontal part of your carpeted stairs easily.</p>
<p>It’s a powerful little machine, with two motors. One motor is dedicated to suction and the other to moving the rotating brush. We found it especially useful on carpeted areas, but you do need to be careful as fine dust can restrict airflow and decrease the performance. At six pounds, the Eureka is the heaviest handheld we tested, so it’s better suited for specific jobs such as staircases.</p>
<h3>HoLife &#8211; Portable</h3>
<p>Our favorite thing about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZYVDGFK/?tag=ybdhandvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HoLife &#8211; Portable</a> is how quiet it is, allowing us to vacuum without waking up a sleeping baby (and around a toddler who hates loud noises). It’s also the only finalist we tested that can be used on both wet and dry spills, because in real life, messes don’t conveniently fall into wet or dry categories and are often a mixture. Finally, it has the longest run time of any of the cordless models at a full 30 minutes. While it takes three to five hours to fully charge its lithium ion battery, we found we could use it in under an hour of charging, with little difference in performance.</p>
<p>On paper, the lightweight design, lithium battery and cyclonic power rival that of the Dyson. However, in practice, it didn’t fully live up to our expectations. It performed well in our power test and was able to pick up the heaviest bag that we tested (16 ounces). <strong>During daily usage around the house, however, we noted that larger pieces tended to fall back out of the nozzle once the power was turned off.</strong> It also required several passes to clean up debris and dust on household cleaning tasks. The latter complaint may be due to the angle of the nozzle, as we did fare better with a narrower attachment. However, a narrow attachment isn’t ideal for picking up more widespread messes or larger pieces of debris.</p>
<p>Our main complaint with the HoLife (and Amazon reviewers tend to agree) is the difficulty in removing the dust container from the collection container. It was so tricky to remove that at first, we thought the design required users to shake the debris out through the small filter hole or use water to wash it out. After consulting the instruction manual, it is clear that the parts do separate, but we were never able to remove the dust container.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>When it comes to handheld vacuums, choosing a cordless or corded model depends primarily on the tasks on which you will use it the most. We found cordless models to be the most convenient for cleaning up spills with speed and this made fade-free suction power and a decent run time (you don’t want to run out of battery power in the middle of a job) our primary considerations. The Dyson &#8211; V7 Trigger fits the bill in both of these aspects, with the additional bonus of being lightweight and ergonomically designed, making it our top pick.</p>
<p>We also feel confident recommending the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JILGZOC/?tag=ybdhandvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black + Decker &#8211; 20V MAX FLEX</a>, which was the most flexible with its multi-functional attachments. It could reach nearly anywhere with a four foot hose, and a rubber pet nozzle made it ideal for picking up stubborn pet hair. If you’re on a budget, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002D47XOM/?tag=ybdhandvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; Scorpion</a> gives you the most bang for your buck with a powerful motor and attachments to complete any job.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We spent months driving around with our six-year-old to find the best booster car seat to be Britax's Pioneer booster, even if it comes at a premium.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">E</span>very parent wants his or her child to be safe, comfortable and happy, especially when it comes to long car trips. We spent months driving our car around town testing seven of the most popular and highly rated booster seats available to find out which booster seat tops the list, and we&#8217;ve determined the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BYQSS4H/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Britax &#8211; Pioneer</a> is the best booster car seat overall. While this product is on the higher end of the cost spectrum, the old adage “you get what you pay for” certainly rings true. It has superior safety features including tether and anchor, an impact-absorbing base and a steel frame. These features are matched by its qualities of convenience like the ease of cleaning, a quick-adjust harness, the ability to recline and dual cup or snack holders.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>As a father of four, our primary researcher for this review has been using booster car seats for over 13 years. This experience gave him a good basis from which to begin his research.</p>
<p>Starting with customer reviews on retail websites like Amazon.com, we only selected booster car seats with exceptional ratings from a large pool of reviewers. We then turned our attention to reviewer feedback to learn from countless owners what they loved, hated and required from a booster seat.</p>
<p>We eliminated any contenders that had repeated complaints about important features, such as feeling too flimsy, too upright or uneven.</p>
<p>Supplementing this research with blogs and video reviews, we narrowed our list of contenders to seven strong finalists.</p>
<p>To top it off, we spent time looking into the physics of booster seat safety and how a child is impacted during a collision.</p>

<h2 id="need-a-seat">Does your child need a booster car seat?</h2>
<p>Child passenger safety laws are regulated at the state level and are subject to frequent change. Specific rules vary per state and usually include a combination of age, height and weight restrictions.</p>
<p>A helpful <a href="http://drivinglaws.aaa.com/tag/child-passenger-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digest of child passenger safety laws</a> is provided by AAA for all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico and Canada. We suggest you start there to determine the booster seat requirements for your child before purchasing a seat.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that although your child may meet your state’s requirements for not using a booster seat, it may still be a good idea depending on their size. Ensuring that your car’s seat belt rests on the center of the collarbone (not pressing into the neck or falling off the shoulder) is of primary importance in ensuring your child’s safety. Your child’s height plays a major factor in when you should graduate them out of a booster.</p>
<p>If your child happens to be too small or light for a booster car seat, they may benefit from safety inside the house: check out our review about <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-baby-gates/" rel="noopener">baby gates</a> for use throughout the house especially if you have stairs or off-limits areas for babies.</p>
<h2>How a booster car seat helps in a car crash</h2>
<p>A booster seat elevates your child so that he or she better fits the adult-size restraining belt that cars are equipped with. Both lap and shoulder placement of the seat belt is important when a crash occurs and pressure from the impact pushes the passenger.</p>
<p>The shoulder portion of the safety belt should be placed in the center of the chest and collarbone, and the lap portion should be low and tight on the lap (not up against the stomach or hipbone).</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BYQSS4H/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/britax-pioneer-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/britax-pioneer-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/britax-pioneer-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/britax-pioneer-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/britax-pioneer-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/britax-pioneer-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/britax-pioneer-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/britax-pioneer-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/britax-pioneer.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Safest Pick: Britax - Pioneer</h3><p>Steel reinforcement, tether and anchor system, and an impact-absorbing base make this a top safety choice.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BYQSS4H/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Improper placement of the belt can increase the risk of internal and external bruising, stomach, liver or spleen damage, or lumbar spine fractures. The use of a booster seat can reduce a child’s risk of crash-related injury by as much as <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-safety/how-to-use-childrens-car-booster-seats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">45 percent</a>.</p>
<p>The seat belt’s job is to diffuse and divert the force from a crash into the stronger areas of the body (the sternum, rib bones and pelvis), thus lessening the risk of damage to soft tissue and internal organs. Placing your child in a booster seat helps to ensure the safety belt does its job. This is important because improper placement can actually <a href="https://www.babycenter.com/0_booster-seat-safety_65758.bc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase injury</a> instead of protecting your child.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Worthwhile cost:</strong> Every parent knows that the expense of raising a child is immense, so looking for the best bargain on purchases is almost always preferred. But when it comes to child safety, most of us are willing to spend a little extra as long as our investment is worthwhile. A booster seat should provide a wide range of features without breaking the bank.</p>
<p><strong>Convenience for the child:</strong> A booster car seat should be as comfortable as possible for the rider. Features that factor into comfort include high armrests, adequate padding, storage for a sippy cup or snack and positioning that is not too upright (especially when dozing).</p>
<p><strong>Convenience for the parent:</strong> Moving car seats from one vehicle to another is part of parent life, and can be quite inconvenient if the transfer takes a lot of time and effort. Weight, size and tether/harness installation are all factors that play into these transfers. In addition, the process of buckling (and unbuckling) a child is another point to consider. Other convenience factors include the ability to easily remove the cover, machine washable fabrics, and the adjustability of the harness or shoulder-belt holes.</p>
<p><strong>Materials used:</strong> Is the car seat made entirely of plastic, or is there a metal framework to fortify the construction? Is the fabric durable and washable? In addition, does the flame-retardant material use toxic chemicals?</p>
<p><strong>Longevity:</strong> A car seat should last as long as possible and span the widest range of age, height and weight requirements to maximize your investment.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>To start, we asked our six-year-old researcher how he would rank his preference for a booster seat. Doing his best to set aside factors like color and “coolness,” he named his top three favorites to sit in as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006PB2CA4/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Evenflo</a>, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BYQSS4H/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Britax </a>and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007UYBOJU/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Graco &#8211; Backless TurboBooster</a>. Really though, his good opinion was granted among all of our candidates except the two that did not have adequate support for his arms (the Cosco &#8211; Topside and the BubbleBum).</p>
<p>His feedback raises an excellent point to consider when selecting booster car seats: it may be a good idea to get your child’s buy-in if you have narrowed down your selection to a few excellent options. Sometimes color, “cool” factor or simple intuition will do more to convince your child that a particular seat is best than anything you can say to persuade them.</p>
<h3>The comfort test</h3>

<p>One of the recurring complaints among booster car seat reviews is a hard seat and inadequate padding. To test the comfort, we not only sought insight from our six-year-old helper but measured the amount of padding on each seat.</p>
<p>This was done by placing a needle through the car seat cushion until it couldn’t go down any farther. We then measured the remaining space between the tip of the needle and our fingers to see how much padding is in each seat.</p>
<p>We also measured the height of the armrests from the base of the seats. The general rule confirmed by our vocal six-year-old kid is that the higher the armrests, the more comfortable the ride. We must note that the ones for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006ZISVSO/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cosco &#8211; Topside</a> are so low in relation to the height of the seat that they are barely usable.</p>

<p>The cushion of the BubbleBum, which is an inflatable booster seat and therefore could not be subjected to the “needle test,” was measured by pressing down on the seat and measuring the distance between the top and bottom. That’s why you see such a marked difference between the BubbleBum and the other booster car seats in the above chart. Feedback from our six-year-old researcher indicated that this cushion of air also resulted in more comfort, but that the additional comfort was neutralized by the fact that there was nowhere to rest his arms.</p>
<h3>The convenience test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6556" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Convenience-Factors-8.png" alt="convenience factors data chart" width="1800" height="1348" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Convenience-Factors-8.png 1800w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Convenience-Factors-8-610x457.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Convenience-Factors-8-1500x1123.png 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Convenience-Factors-8-768x575.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Convenience-Factors-8-885x663.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Convenience-Factors-8-300x225.png 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Convenience-Factors-8-295x221.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Convenience-Factors-8-1000x749.png 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Convenience-Factors-8-360x270.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Convenience-Factors-8-375x281.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Convenience-Factors-8-414x310.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Convenience-Factors-8-320x240.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>To measure the convenience of installing each of the car seats, we used a stopwatch to time multiple installations and averaged the results. These were performed on an easily-accessible middle seat of a minivan. Obviously, installing boosters in seats that are harder to access, such as the back seat of a sedan, would cause average setup time to increase.</p>
<p>All of the booster car seats we tested have coverings that are made of durable fabric that can be washable with mild soap and warm water. With the exception of the BubbleBum, these coverings can be removed from the seat to facilitate washing and drying.</p>
<p>We also weighed each seat, as a heavy seat is harder to transfer from car to car. The results for both of these tests are charted below.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that our top pick scored lowest in each of these convenience factors. While this weighed in our decision, we felt that safety and longevity are likely to be more important factors than the convenience of periodically installing or transferring booster car seats. If you are a parent who has to transfer a car seat more frequently than average, we suggest you read our best pick among the backless options in the section below.</p>

<h2 id="best-overall">Our top pick: Britax &#8211; Pioneer</h2>

<p>Because of the five-point harness featured by our top booster car seat, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BYQSS4H/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Britax &#8211; Pioneer</a>, the weight and height range are increased so that children can use this seat at an earlier age. All of the backless models we tested start at 40 pounds, while the Pioneer starts at 25 pounds.</p>
<p>State regulations vary, but all the safety advocates are quick to note that until your toddler is two years old, you should use a rear-facing seat. Convertibles are only made for front-facing use, so in almost every case you&#8217;ll need to use an interim rear-facing seat after your one-year-old is too big for an infant carrier.</p>

<p>Because the back can be removed, the car seat is convertible into backless one for the older kids who don’t want the stigma of a “baby seat.” While some kids prefer having a back on their seat, others might see moving to a backless booster as a sign of “getting big.” Our six-year-old tester, for instance, preferred riding in the backless varieties, not because they were more comfortable, but because he felt he had outgrown the backed models we tested.</p>
<p>With nearly three centimeters of padding, good armrest height, and simple to adjust harness, the Pioneer provides a comfortable car ride for your child. The fabric is durable and stain resistant/repellant and the safety features are second-to-none. These features include steel framing, a tether-and-anchor system, and an impact-absorbing base. These features prevent this seat from being used in the rear facing position though.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6620 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/britax-padding-closeup.jpg" alt="closeup of the Britax's padding" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/britax-padding-closeup.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/britax-padding-closeup-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/britax-padding-closeup-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/britax-padding-closeup-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/britax-padding-closeup-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/britax-padding-closeup-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/britax-padding-closeup-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/britax-padding-closeup-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/britax-padding-closeup-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/britax-padding-closeup-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>One other factor that helps to push this booster car seat into the first position has to do with its toxicity. Although we could not find any web research testing the toxicity of our particular seven-seat models, we were able to find research for car seats from some of the same manufacturers.</p>
<p>While we cannot absolutely verify that similar materials are used between these seats for each manufacturer, it is not an unreasonable hypothesis that this is the case. In <a href="http://www.ecocenter.org/healthy-stuff/reports/childrens-car-seat-study/report_summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the research</a>, it was noted that this brand has made immense strides in removing toxic chemicals from their products earning them a reputation as a more eco-friendly and naturally-based manufacturer.</p>
<p>On the downside, the Britax &#8211; Pioneer is heavy and bulky, making the transfer from one car to another a chore. If your situation calls for daily movement of the seat between cars, you may want to consider the lighter backed booster, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006PB2CA4/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Evenflo &#8211; Big Kid</a>. Installation of this seat is simple, but we should note some of the brand&#8217;s other models have a ClickTight system that allows setup just by buckling the seat belt instead of or in addition to using the lower latch system.</p>
<p>If your child is older and is no longer in need of a back or harness, you may want to forego the expense of this seat and choose our top pick for a backless booster, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BBYAF6S/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Affix</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our top pick, the Britax &#8211; Pioneer, has fantastic features that include steel reinforcement, an impact-absorbing base and sides and a tether/harness system to keep it securely in place.</li>
<li>Although heavier and bulkier than a backless option, safety and longevity features outweigh the inconvenience of transferring or installing a car seat and are worth the cost. If you need to transfer though, the latch system is simple to figure out.</li>
<li>The weight capacity spans from 25 pounds to 110 pounds, making it an investment in your kid&#8217;s safety that will last for many years.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the price of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BYQSS4H/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Britax &#8211; Pioneer</a> is beyond your means, or if your child is already more than 39 pounds, you may want to consider skipping to a backless booster. Our first choice in this category is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BBYAF6S/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Graco &#8211; Affix Backless</a>.</p>
<p>The easily-adjusted latch system in this product helps the booster seat stay in place firmly and securely. These anchors increase the safety of the seat in a car crash. They also make it more convenient for you or your kids to buckle the seat belt because the seat does not shift from side to side or create a gap by shifting forward. This product also comes with a belt positioning clip to properly adjust the shoulder strap for uour child.</p>

Unlike most other backless seats, its anchor system helps the seat remain securely in place.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BBYAF6S/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Weighing in at 5.6 pounds, with an installation time of just under 14 seconds, this booster transfers easily and quickly from car to car. It’s armrests sit at a good height but our six-year-old research assistant remarked that he preferred the coverings of the seat’s close relative, the TurboBooster. While this seat could do with a bit more padding , overall it is a comfortable ride at a great price.</p>
<p>Some reviewers on Amazon did indicate that this booster can tend to be more secure on one anchor than another, causing the seat to be slightly misaligned, but we did not experience this during our testing. If we had, it would quick to correct by pulling on the anchor strap to tighten the booster against the seat of the vehicle.</p>
<p>As a parent of four, our primary researcher in this review appreciates both the safety and the convenience of a booster that is anchored into the car.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Graco &#8211; Affix has simple to adjust anchor straps that keep the booster seat secure and centered.</li>
<li>Lightweight and backless, it transfers quickly from car to car and a one-handed latch system makes adjustment quick.</li>
<li>Backless boosters are for kids who are 40 pounds or heavier; if your child is lighter, you’ll probably want to invest in a booster seat with a back.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-for-travel">Best travel option: BubbleBum</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AQYZCXK/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6622 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/bubblebum.jpg" alt="the Bubblebum blowup seat" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/bubblebum.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/bubblebum-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/bubblebum-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/bubblebum-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/bubblebum-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/bubblebum-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/bubblebum-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/bubblebum-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/bubblebum-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/bubblebum-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></a></p>
<p>For a quick flight or for the babysitter to have on hand for local car trips, we recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AQYZCXK/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BubbleBum</a> as a great booster car for infrequent use. You can think of it as the “spare tire” of the booster world.</p>
<p>This booster weighs 0.6 pounds and installs in just under seven seconds by slipping the lap belt into the two holders. In addition, you can deflate it to pack it in a suitcase, and reinflate it in no time when you reach your destination. It has a belt positioning strap and clip to help ensure a safe and comfortable shoulder position.</p>
<p>Although we wouldn’t recommend with BubbleBum for long-term use in a car, we were surprisingly impressed with its ability to “get the job done” at such a light weight and small size. The beauty of an inflatable booster seat is that it packs well and is quickly inflated/deflated with minimal effort (just a few puffs of breath into the valve).</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AQYZCXK/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bubblebum-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bubblebum-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bubblebum-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bubblebum-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bubblebum-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bubblebum-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bubblebum-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bubblebum-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bubblebum.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Travel Option: BubbleBum</h3><p>Reduce check-in or carry-on weight with an inflatable seat. Great for keeping as a spare for infrequent use.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AQYZCXK/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>A few of the Amazon reviewers reported that their BubbleBum slowly deflated over long car trips, but we did not experience this. Our BubbleBum held its shape throughout hours of testing. It’s reasonable to assume that age might deteriorate the softer plastic of the BubbleBum over time, rendering it useless. Again, long-term is not our recommendation for this model.</p>
<p>With a smaller surface area than the other seats, the BubbleBum could potentially be uncomfortable with children who are especially wide on the back side. Its cover is not removable, but given how light it is, this doesn’t necessarily hinder the ability to wash and dry it as needed.</p>
<p>We were pleasantly surprised by how little effort was required to inflate the BubbleBum. In only required a few breaths of air, less than your average balloon, in fact.</p>
<p>At an extremely low price, it’s a great idea to have this back-up option for emergencies or for a relative or caregiver to have handy.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Weighing in at less than a pound, and able to be deflated and reinflated as necessary, the BubbleBum packs conveniently for travel.</li>
<li>The BubbleBum installs in no time by slipping the lap belt into the two holders on the seat’s sides.</li>
<li>Not recommended for long-term use, the BubbleBum lacks armrests, storage, or many of the safety features found among our other candidates.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Graco &#8211; Nautilus 65 3-in-1 Harness Booster Car Seat</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6623 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/graco-nautilus-65.jpg" alt="Graco's Nautilus 65 car seat" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/graco-nautilus-65.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/graco-nautilus-65-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/graco-nautilus-65-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/graco-nautilus-65-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/graco-nautilus-65-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/graco-nautilus-65-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/graco-nautilus-65-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/graco-nautilus-65-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/graco-nautilus-65-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/graco-nautilus-65-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Coming in at 26 pounds, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Y285W8G/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Graco &#8211; Nautilus 65</a> was a close contender to our top pick because it has so many of the same features. Among these excellent features are steel framing, impact-absorbing construction, adequate storage, tether and anchors, and the ability to accommodate smaller children (the Nautilus starts at 23 pounds).</p>
<p>As with the Pioneer, however, the safety features of the Nautilus 65 make it both bulky and heavy, weighing in at about 20 pounds. With an installation time of around 41 seconds, the transfer from car to car can be a hassle, especially if it must be installed in a harder-to-reach back seat. This one also has a removable and washable cover. The latch system on this model uses hooks so is a little more difficult only if you plan on moving it between cars often, and also prevents this seat from being used in the rear facing position.</p>
<p>Only slightly less comfortable to sit in than our top pick, the Nautilus 65 ranks just barely under the Pioneer and still makes an excellent choice for a safe, long-lasting booster car seat.</p>
<h3>Evenflo &#8211; Big Kid Booster</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6624 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/evenflo-big-kid.jpg" alt="Evenflo - Big Kid booster" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/evenflo-big-kid.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/evenflo-big-kid-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/evenflo-big-kid-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/evenflo-big-kid-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/evenflo-big-kid-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/evenflo-big-kid-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/evenflo-big-kid-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/evenflo-big-kid-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/evenflo-big-kid-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/evenflo-big-kid-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006PB2CA4/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Evenflo &#8211; Big Kid</a> is a lightweight (only 6.8 pounds) and easy-to-install booster that provides convenience and a comfortable ride for your child, though some additional padding wouldn’t be a terrible idea, in our opinion.</p>
<p>Its construction is entirely plastic, however, so the Evenflo is not as durable or safe as some of its competitors. The back helps with accurate seat belt positioning on your child’s collarbone and is easily removed if your child prefers a backless ride.</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s extremely lightweight, the Evenflo has a much more flimsy feel than its counterparts, but our six-year-old child liked the feel of the smooth cover and happened to be impressed because the particular model we tested was blue, his favorite color! (Parenting tip: check for color options on whichever booster you decide to purchase, and involve your child in the decision to gain a higher degree of buy-in.)</p>
<p>An inexpensive option, the Evenflo is a middle-of-the-line seat that fits the needs of those who have to transfer seats frequently, but still prefer a booster seat with a back. The cover is machine washable too.</p>
<h3>Graco &#8211; Backless TurboBooster</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6625 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/graco-backless-turbobooster.jpg" alt="Graco's backless booster" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/graco-backless-turbobooster.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/graco-backless-turbobooster-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/graco-backless-turbobooster-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/graco-backless-turbobooster-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/graco-backless-turbobooster-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/graco-backless-turbobooster-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/graco-backless-turbobooster-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/graco-backless-turbobooster-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/graco-backless-turbobooster-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/graco-backless-turbobooster-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007UYBOJU/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Graco &#8211; Backless TurboBooster</a> weighs in at 5.1 pounds and is similar in almost every way to its brother, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BBYAF6S/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Affix</a>, except that the armrests are padded with a removable and washable fabric, which our six-year-old child preferred. The material used for the seat is more prone to getting snagged however, and it lacks the anchors of the Affix.</p>
<p>Without the anchors for the latch system, this seat is more apt to slide out of place, and (annoyingly) to cover the seat belt buckle, which can frustrate the child or parent trying to buckle the belt. For an extra ten dollars, we recommend the Affix and its anchoring system over this product.</p>
<h3>Cosco &#8211; Topside Booster</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6626 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cosco-topside.jpg" alt="Cosco - topside booster " width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cosco-topside.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cosco-topside-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cosco-topside-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cosco-topside-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cosco-topside-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cosco-topside-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cosco-topside-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cosco-topside-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cosco-topside-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cosco-topside-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>With armrests that are too low to be useful and very little padding, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006ZISVSO/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cosco &#8211; Topside</a> is our least favorite contender among the seven finalists.</p>
<p>The Topside is lightweight (only 2.2 pounds), easy to install and inexpensive, but like several Amazon reviewers, we found that the hardness of the seat made long car rides uncomfortable for our child. This product is only washable by hand.</p>
<p>Though the Topside is a high-ranking choice on Amazon and other retail websites, we would recommend any of the other finalists before this booster seat.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you are looking to invest in a durable, safe, comfortable and long-lasting booster seat, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BYQSS4H/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Britax &#8211; Pioneer</a>. This seat is convertible from a five-point harness car seat to a backless booster as your child grows, which means you won’t have to purchase another seat as your child gets bigger. If your child is already more than 39 pounds, you may want to go for our top pick in the backless category, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BBYAF6S/?tag=ybdboost-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Graco &#8211; Affix</a>, which anchors into the seat and doesn’t slip or slide.</p>
