				<description><![CDATA[We blended over 30 pounds of produce in the most popular blenders on the market. Ultimately, we thought the Cuisinart - CBT-2000 blended the best for a mid-range price. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hether you’re making a fruit or green smoothie, you need a powerful blender that can pulverize gnarly seeds, tough leaves and stems into a silky-smooth drink. But with so many blenders on the market at different price points, it’s hard to figure out which one is right for you. Our professional chef spent 30-plus hours blending 30 pounds of produce to determine that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X3N9O58/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; CBT-2000</a> is the best blender.</p>
<p>We tested three price ranges of blenders and think the Cuisinart &#8211; CBT-2000 is the best all-around mid-range blender for making smoothies, soups and nut butter on a frequent basis.</p>
<p>If making smoothies or juices is part of your daily lifestyle — and you don’t mind spending substantially more money — then we recommend the high-performance <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-A3500-Programmable-Connectivity-Professional-Grade/dp/B075713NNL/?tag-ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vitamix &#8211; A3500</a>. Our low-priced pick, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0094B94BM/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cleanblend &#8211; 2001</a>, doesn’t have programmed functions and it isn’t great for processing nut butters, but it matched the Cuisinart and Vitamix in overall blending.</p>

<h2 id="selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>The initial phase of our research comprised of reading through posts on Reddit and Amazon to determine the primary reasons consumers are purchasing a blender and how much they’re willing to spend. We found that an overwhelming majority of people are looking for an inexpensive blender that can make fruit and vegetable smoothies.</p>
<p>However, the cheaper blenders for $50 or under don’t have the powerful motors that are needed to break down ice, fruit seeds and skins and sturdy vegetables into a palatable consistency. Another frequent complaint from consumers is that cheaper models simply don’t last long, especially if they’re used on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Vitamix’s marketing and “road show&#8221; promotions at warehouse stores have certainly worked in convincing people that a Vitamix will change their lives by significantly improving their diet. However, not everyone wants to spend $600 or more on a blender. So we looked at the wide swath of blenders on the market and divided them into high-end, mid-range and low-end price categories and see how consumers compared them.</p>
<p>We then cross referenced the blenders rated the best by consumers with the most recent reviews for blenders at Wirecutter, America’s Test Kitchen and Consumer Reports before deciding on the eight blenders we would test. Finally, since manufacturers are frequently upgrading — or sometimes just changing the appearance of — their blenders, we went to their websites to ensure we would be testing the latest model.</p>

<h2 id="who">Who should buy a blender</h2>
<p>Since 1933 when the Oster company introduced the blender to the world, it’s considered to be an essential kitchen countertop appliance. Initially, the blender was created for mixing alcoholic drinks and frozen desserts, but in the last several years it’s taken on a new role as the means for improving diet with fruit or vegetable smoothies and juices.</p>
<p>The build quality of a blender corresponds with its price. The more expensive, high-end blenders, are designed and built to last for years. On the opposite end of the scale, budget blenders ($50 and under) aren’t made well enough for long-term use, and their motors tend to burn out after a year or two.</p>
<p>There are many varieties, sizes and shapes of blenders, and deciding which one is right for you can be confusing. The type of blender you choose will depend on what you want to make and how often you plan to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Low end</strong> ($100-$199): Occasional use for blending frozen drinks and desserts. The blenders we tested in this category are the Cleanblend, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Countertop-1100-Watt-Smoothies-BL660/dp/B00939FV8K/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ninja</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BBL620SIL1AUS1-Furious-Blender-Silver/dp/B07GJ24VXV/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CXKTNDU/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Mid-range</strong> ($200-$399): Frequent use for blending smoothies, juices, nut butter, soups and sauces. These blenders are more advanced than the occasional-use blender and can handle a wider range of food and drink processing tasks. In this category are the Cuisinart and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004UJKKI4/?tag=ybdblender-20">Waring</a>.</p>
<p><strong>High-end</strong> ($400-$599): Everyday, heavy-duty blending for diet, weight loss and overall health improvement.  This type of blender would be excellent for raw-food, vegetarian and vegan diets. There are really only two high-end blenders, the fiercely competitive Vitamix and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blendtec-D725C3216A1A-AMAZON-Designer-Blender-Stainless/dp/B01FASW6OY/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blendtec</a>, and they both have several expensive models.</p>

<p><b>Power of motor:</b> Most manufacturers market their blenders’ ability to reach between 2 to 3.5 “peak horsepower.&#8221; This is a meaningless claim, as a blender will only reach its peak or maximum speed for a couple of seconds at the pulse function. You will also see a blender’s high RPM advertised (30,000 and upwards), which is also misleading since all blenders work at a high RPM. What’s important is whether the motor can sustain a high RPM without burning out.</p>
<p>A more accurate gauge is the blender’s wattage since you want the blender’s motor to have enough power to handle tough blending and grinding jobs. Think whole, hearty fruits and vegetables or nuts. The blenders we tested fell between 1100 and 1800 watts.</p>
<p>As stated by April Jones in <a href="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/article/287/Understanding-Blender-Specifications/print" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cooking For Engineers</a>, “Compare watts, not horsepower ratings. Higher watts mean smoother smoothies and a longer motor life.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Blender jar size and shape:</b> The majority of the blender jars we tested were 64 ounces, which is ample room for the blades to create a vortex that pulls food down into the blades and then pushes it backup for even distribution and blending. We found that jars were those with a slight tapering down to the blades. The tapering created a tighter and more efficient vortex for drawing up ingredients that settled to the bottom.</p>
<p><b>Blade position:</b> Seven of the eight blenders we tested had wing-shaped blades positioned in the bottom of the jar. The Ninja has a blade spindle with three sets of (wickedly) sharp blades evenly distributed. During our testing, the Ninja’s blade created a centrifuge that whirled ingredients but didn’t entirely pulverize them, and the spindle couldn’t reach ingredients in the lower part of the jar.</p>
<p>The other blenders had two to eight wing-shaped blades. The blades that were the most efficient in our tests had upward and downward prongs and the smallest gap between the tip of the blades and the jar. This position allowed the blades to grab ingredients from the bottom and sides without our needing to constantly scrape the insides of the jar.</p>
<p><b>Pre-programmed functions:</b>   The blenders that we found to be most convenient and easy to use had pre-programmed functions. These functions are at a set speed that the manufacturer considers ideal for blending smoothies, juices, soups, ice-crushing and self- or auto-clean. They can each be adjusted with a variable speed-control dial or button to increase or decrease speed as needed. Two of the low-end blenders, the Ninja and the KitchenAid, do not have adjustable speed control, and it was definitely a function we missed.</p>
<p>Both Vitamix and Blendtec have a single, all-purpose speed/time function for smoothies, but the Breville and Cuisinart have two different speeds and times for fruit and green smoothies.  All four blenders made great smoothies, but the blenders that had separate functions dedicated to either fruit or green were slightly better.</p>

<p><b>Hot-soup function: </b>It’s not a “must have&#8221; function, but it’s certainly nice to have. Half of the blenders we tested had a pre-programmed function for blending and then heating the soup to piping hot. (The three low-end blenders and the mid-range Waring do not have the soup function.) The Vitamix and Cuisinart performed exceptionally well, evenly blending and heating the soup in about six minutes. Blendtec’s soup function is programmed at three minutes, and the soup only heated to warm.</p>
<p><b>Noise:</b> Many consumers apparently have the hearing of bats, because complaints about the noise level of high-performance blenders are voluminous. To be fair, <i>all </i>of the blenders we tested were loud, ranging in sound from a high-pitched whine to the roar of a lawnmower. The quietest blender was the KitchenAid, which also has the lowest wattage (550), so there does seem to be a correlation between the blender’s power and its noise output.</p>
<p><b>Warranty:</b> If you’re spending a lot of money on a blender, then you’ll want assurance that it’s going to last, and if something fails, the manufacturer’s warranty will repair or replace the blender. The next most frequent consumer complaint is motor burn-out of the low-end blenders, usually after about a year, and the manufacturer’s limited one-year warranty no longer covers replacement or repair.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0094B94BM/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cleanblend</a> — our top pick in the low-end category — is the exception and has a remarkable <a href="https://cleanblend.com/pages/warrenty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five-year full warranty</a>. Vitamix and Blendtec are confident that their blenders are solidly built and have the most impressive warranties, <a href="https://www.vitamix.com/us/en_us/shop/10-year-warranty" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">10-year</a> and <a href="https://www.blendtec.com/pages/warranty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight-year</a>, respectively.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We carefully chose several tests that would equitably rate all three categories of blenders. All the blenders advertise that they are the best blender for smoothies, so clearl,y we needed to test that claim.</p>
<h3>Ice crushing</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17644" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice.jpg" alt="Crushed ice in a blender." width="2000" height="1335" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-1000x668@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-768x513.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-885x591.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-1000x668.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-320x214.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-885x591@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-320x214@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Our first test was a simple one: we added two cups of ice cubes to each blender and timed how long it took to pulverize the ice into a snowy consistency, which is necessary for for a properly blended smoothie. Half of the blenders had a separate “crush ice&#8221; function. For the blenders that didn’t, we simply turned the blender up to its highest speed.  All of the blenders pulverized ice to a powdery snow from three seconds (the Ninja) to one minute (Cleanblend).</p>
<h3>Fruit smoothies</h3>
<p>Most fruit smoothies contain several ingredients: a liquid (such as milk, almond milk, coconut milk), yogurt (usually Greek yogurt, but any style of unsweetened yogurt will do), fresh or frozen fruit and ice. The ingredients should be layered exactly from bottom to top as we’ve listed, since it allows the blender blades to grind the fruit first, then draw the ice down into the vortex to be pulverized and blended with the fruit mixture.</p>
<p>One of the most commonly used fruits is berries — strawberries, raspberries and blueberries. Strawberries and raspberries present a challenge for any blender because of their tiny seeds, which need to be completely ground up and integrated into the smoothie. We decided on <a href="https://www.blenderbabes.com/lifestyle-diet/diabetic/light-pre-workout-raspberry-smoothie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this recipe for a raspberry smoothie</a>; it’s simple but would also determine which blender is best for a seeded-fruit smoothie.</p>

<h3>Green smoothies</h3>
<p>The next most frequently blended smoothie is a green vegetable smoothie. These concoctions also have a milk of some sort in their ingredients and a combination of a green vegetable, such as kale or spinach, another vegetable or two and for sweetness, a bit of fruit. Kale is the heartiest of green vegetables, and it also can be a struggle for a blender to completely grind and pulverize the kale into a smooth green smoothie without any sediment.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.cookincanuck.com/kale-apple-green-smoothie-recipe-vegan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recipe for a kale-apple smoothie </a>tested how well each blender made green smoothies. We thought the apple added enough sweetness and so we omitted the agave. We also left out the flax seeds, since we wanted to focus on how well a blender did in grinding up notoriously tough kale.</p>
<p>As a general note for smoothies, make sure that you use only well-washed organic fruits and vegetables. The blenders blend the whole fruit and vegetable, including seeds and skins. You’ll be drinking them, and you don’t want to ingest pesticides or preservatives.</p>
<p>An egg-based sauce, such as mayonnaise, takes about 30 seconds to make in a blender, and if you haven’t tried it, you’ll be amazed at how easy it is and how much better it tastes than the bottled stuff.</p>
<p>One of our favorite sauces is Hollandaise, and made in the traditional way — whisking eggs over a pot of simmering water — but it’s a bit of a pain. <a href="https://toriavey.com/toris-kitchen/julia-childs-easy-blender-hollandaise-sauce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a blender, however, it’s simple</a>. Basically, it’s mayonnaise with egg yolks, lemon juice and hot butter instead of oil. There’s no cooking involved — other than melting butter in the microwave — and you pour the hot butter into the egg yolks spinning in the blender. Within seconds, the mixture emulsifies, and you have a thick sauce for vegetables or Eggs Benedict.</p>
<p>The Hollandaise test was quite eye-opening, because it highlighted the importance of the jar shape and blade position in each blender. The blender jars that were uniform in shape with no tapering failed the test miserably, because their blades couldn’t reach the egg yolks in the bottom of the jar. When the speed of the blender was increased, the vortex lifted the eggs up, but they weren’t contained tightly enough to bond chemically with the hot butter. The result was a thin buttery liquid that didn’t hold together as a sauce.</p>
<p>The one test that all of the blenders did well in was a simple tomato-basil soup. We used the <a href="https://www.vitamix.com/us/en_us/recipes/tomato-soup" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vitamix recipe</a>, because there weren’t many ingredients, and we wanted a soup that required no pre-cooking and took minutes to make. (If you want to make this recipe, only add one-half cup of water and not the two cups as instructed.) Although half of the blenders did not have the “hot soup&#8221; function, they all made a relatively smooth and fresh-tasting soup that could be heated up in a microwave.</p>
<p>The most daunting challenge for the blenders was peanut butter, since this really put their motors to the test. But also, again, the shape of the blender jar and blade position significantly contributed to the blender’s passing or failing this test.</p>

<p>Only two of the eight blenders we tested — the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X3N9O58/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BBL620SIL1AUS1-Furious-Blender-Silver/dp/B07GJ24VXV/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville</a> — succeeded at our first attempt. The Vitamix model that we tested had a wide, non-tapered blender jar, so the peanuts were too far spread out in the bottom of the jar for the blades to reach. The peanuts were finely chopped and got lodged beneath the blades. We consulted the instruction manual, and for this particular model, we needed to double the peanuts from two cups to four cups. We tried again, and the second time, the blades could reach the additional peanuts and process them into peanut butter.</p>
<p>Half of the blenders we tested had a self-clean function. This is a pre-programmed button that spins water and dish soap for up to one minute. The function begins at a low speed for a few seconds, then shifts into high speed for about 30 seconds, before finishing at a low speed for the final few seconds.</p>
<p>We did find the self-clean function effectively removed food residue from the top and sides of the jar to beneath the blades.</p>

<p>In the ongoing marketing battle between the most expensive blenders, Vitamix and Blendtec, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-A3500-Programmable-Connectivity-Professional-Grade/dp/B075713NNL/?tag-ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vitamix &#8211; A3500</a> wins hands down. The Vitamix’s powerful 1500-watt motor crushes ice cubes into powdery snow in seconds, purees and heats vegetables to hot soup in minutes and pulverizes entire fruits — seeds, core and fruit skins — and sturdy kale and other hearty greens into silky smoothies with no sediment.</p>
<p>Initially, we were a bit suspicious of Vitamix. There’s so much hype around it, and the product demonstrations at stores can be overbearing. Subsequently, we were a bit more stringent in testing Vitamix, but, except for one test, this powerhouse blender completely won us over.</p>
<p>So why is Vitamix so good? Let’s start with the smoothies, since they will most likely be a major consideration if you’re thinking about buying one.</p>
<p>Vitamix has a pre-set function for smoothies timed at a mere 50 seconds. The cycle begins at the mid-speed, level 5, for ten seconds, during which it draws down the ice to the blades and pulverizes it to powder. The cycle then speeds up to its highest level and processes the ingredients in 40 seconds. We were hypnotized by the cyclonic blur of the Vitamix’s vortex as the smoothies were blended.</p>
<p>No other blender we tested could beat Vitamix’s ability to grind the raspberry seeds in the fruit smoothie. The ground seeds had texture but not graininess. We strained the smoothie, and no seed bits were left behind.</p>
<p>Vitamix doesn’t have a separate cycle for green smoothies, but no matter, it worked exactly the same, and our green smoothie was silky with no sediment. Because of Vitamix’s marketing videos depict whole fruits and vegetables being processed, we threw in whole kale leaves, an entire apple — without coring or seeding — and un-cut stalks of celery. Vitamix processed it all without a struggle, and gave us a smoothie that was like a super-refined juice.</p>

<p>As we noted above, the soup function is a wonder, if you enjoy hot soup on a cold day, you can have it freshly made and piping hot in under six minutes. The tomato-basil soup we made in the Vitamix exploded with fresh tomato and herbal flavor, and although it was composed entirely of vegetables, the Vitamix blended it into a frothy emulsion that tasted creamy.</p>
<p>Making peanut butter was a little less stress-free. As we noted earlier, the width of the blender jar for this particular model necessitated our using a minimum of four cups of nuts; otherwise, the finely ground peanuts got lodged beneath the blades. When we added more peanuts on our second attempt, the Vitamix achieved peanut butter in about two minutes.</p>
<p>The only test that the Vitamix failed was the Hollandaise. For the sauce to emulsify, the eggs needed to be beaten for 30 seconds. But the eggs could not be tightly contained in the Vitamix’s wide blender jar, so they just whizzed around underneath the blades. We tried increasing the speed, and the vortex lifted the eggs up but again failed to beat them. When we added the hot butter, it simply splattered and never came together as a thick sauce.</p>
<p>The Vitamix has a great auto-clean function that’s preset at 35 seconds. It goes through three cycles that effectively washes away everything along the sides and bottom of the pitcher all the way up to the lid.</p>
<p>If we had one negative about the Vitamix’s design, it’s that the lid attaches to the blender jar by two plastic tabs. They’re made of the <a href="https://www.rawblend.com.au/assets/files/Vitamix-Container-Info.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">same tough Tritan copolyester</a> as the blender jar, but when we pressed down on the tabs, there wasn’t a click to indicate that we had actually fastened the lid securely on.</p>
<p>Of course, at $600, the Vitamix is certainly an investment. But if improving your diet is important, and blending smoothies or making fresh juices is part of your daily regimen, we believe it will be money well spent. Vitamix’s amazing and unique ten-year warranty is proof they’re confident this blender will last with everyday use.</p>

<p>If you don’t want to spend a good chunk of your paycheck on a Vitamix, but you do want a blender for a daily smoothie, there are several mid-range blenders to consider. During our testing, we found that a couple of the mid-range blenders performed nearly as well as Vitamix, and the differences in texture and consistency of their smoothies and soups were minimal.</p>
<p>At 1,677 watts, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X3N9O58/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; CBT-2000</a> has plenty of power. It has five pre-programmed functions, an LCD screen with a countdown timer and a variable speed dial that can be minutely adjusted from lowest to highest any time during blending. The dial also has a push-button “turbo&#8221; function that instantly increases the speed to high in short bursts.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart’s function for fruit smoothies is preset at 45 seconds and runs through various speeds at ten-second intervals, finishing with a final burst at high. Its fruit smoothie was nearly as perfect as the Vitamix’s with just a touch of miniscule seed bits.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart has a separate function for green smoothies with a longer time (one minute, 30 seconds) and the different cycle of speeds. Again, the Cuisinart’s performance matched Vitamix, blending the tough kale and apple seeds and core to velvety smoothness.</p>
<p>The soup function blends and heats the soup in six minutes, and it may not have had the creamy emulsification of Vitamix’s soup, but it was still perfectly smooth and nearly boiling hot.</p>

<p>As noted earlier, it was a chore to make peanut butter in <i>all of the blenders</i> we tested. The Cuisinart’s lowest speed finely chopped the peanuts in seconds, but as we increased the speed to form butter, the peanut bits splattered up the sides of the blender jar and lodged underneath the blades. We had to continuously scrape together the ground peanuts for about five minutes before they coalesced into a relatively smooth peanut butter.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart did not perform as well in making Hollandaise. Its blender jar is similar to the Vitamix and has almost no tapering at the bottom. Consequently, the blades couldn’t contain the eggs in a tight vortex, so when the butter was added, everything sprayed up without ever emulsifying.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart’s preset clean function is 30 seconds at medium speed, which worked fine for washing off smoothie and soup residue. But we needed to run the program twice to clean off the sticky peanut butter that was lodged underneath the blades.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart &#8211; CBT-2000 comes with an attractive recipe book that includes recipes for smoothies, frozen cocktails, soups, salad dressings and desserts. We were extremely impressed by the Cuisinart’s versatility, durability and its ease of use, and at under $300, it’s a great alternative to Vitamix.</p>
<p>We should note that the Breville &#8211; BBL910XL (“The Boss&#8221;) was one of our best contenders in the mid-range category. However, near the end of our test period, Breville abruptly discontinued this excellent blender, which is now <a href="https://www.breville.com/us/en/products/blenders/bbl910.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only available on the Breville website</a>.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Cuisinart &#8211; CBT-2000 can do virtually everything the Vitamix can, but it’s half the price.</li>
<li>Its powerful and durable 1677-watt motor blended velvety smooth fruit and green smoothies with barely perceptible residue from seeds.</li>
<li>The Cuisinart’s accurate, preset functions include hot soup, ice crush, auto-clean and two different programs for fruit and green smoothies.</li>
<li>It’s easy and convenient to use, and its versatility makes the Cuisinart “Hurricane Pro&#8221; one of the best all-around blenders you could buy.</li>

<p>Fans of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0094B94BM/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cleanblend &#8211; 2001</a> claim that it performs exactly the same as a Vitamix for a third of the price. Their claim didn’t entirely hold up, but the Cleanblend was far superior to the two other low-end blenders we tested. It has an extraordinarily powerful motor — 1800 watts — more powerful than the Vitamix, and excellent speed control.</p>
<p>Outwardly, compared to Vitamix, the Cleanblend looks simple. It’s very easy to operate and physically recalls a slightly squatter version of a 1970’s Waring blender. It has no pre-programmed functions and operates simply with an on/off switch. A center knob controls the speed levels and a second switch allows short controlled bursts.</p>
<p>The motor is quite heavy, but Cleanblend has further ensured the blender holds firmly in place, even at its highest speed, by adding four super-strong rubber anti-slip feet. A tamper is included, but we found it to be too short to reach more than half-way into the 64-ounce blender jar.</p>
<p>Since there is no program for crushing ice, we used the pulse switch. The Cleanblend’s pulse is a bit explosive, shooting crushed bits of ice upward like hail. It pulverized the ice in a minute, much slower than blenders with less wattage, and its consistency was granular rather than snowy.</p>
<p>Despite the propulsive nature of the ice, the Cleanblend did a beautiful job blending the fruit and green smoothies. After a couple of pulses to get the ice crushed, the speed control dial could be adjusted in small increments, gently increasing the speed from a true low to a pulverizing high. We enjoyed having an interactive role with the blender rather than just standing back and watching it do its automated thing.</p>

<p>We did need to add more liquid during the processing of both smoothies to keep the ingredients flowing. The raspberry smoothie that the Cleanblend produced had small bits of seeds. However, the kale in the green smoothie was completely liquified in 30 seconds and left behind no sediment when strained.</p>
<p>It took the Cleanblend only 30 seconds to process the tomato-basil soup (the Cleanblend does not have a function for heating the soup) and to whip the Hollandaise into a thick and creamy emulsion.</p>
<p>The blender’s only fail was the peanut butter. We began by pulsing the peanuts in short bursts, and half splattered upwards. We scraped it down and tried grinding the peanuts on low, but they constantly lodged underneath the blades. After several tedious minutes, all we got was a finely ground paste.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, Cleanblend’s <i>five-year full warranty</i> is unusual for a low-end blender. The company offers a full refund within 30 days, and for five years after that, they will repair or replace the blender. No other low-end blender has this kind of warranty.</p>
<p>Priced at $179, the Cleanblend &#8211; 2001 is slightly more expensive than the KitchenAid and Ninja. But neither performed nearly as well, and it’s still a fraction of the cost of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blendtec-D725C3216A1A-AMAZON-Designer-Blender-Stainless/dp/B01FASW6OY/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blendtec</a>, which it also out-performed. Cleanblend may not be a household name yet, but the quality of its blender and its thoughtful additions, like a flexible silicone spatula and nut-milk bag, and the company’s ace customer service are giving its competitors a run for the money.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004UJKKI4/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Waring &#8211; MX1200XTX</a> physically resembles the Cleanblend. It has two switches, on/off and pulse/variable, and a dial for adjusting speed. The blender jar has a slight tapering, so the blades’ wingspan reaches a couple of millimeters shy of the jar’s interior.</p>
<p>The variable switch is the default position (held down it engages the pulse function), and we found it took a bit of practice to adjust the dial to the right speed level. The lowest speed was a true low, a nice steady blending motion. The higher speeds (7 to 10) were actually too high, and the vortex spewed ingredients to the top of the jar.</p>
<p>The Waring gave us decent results, however. There was a bit of unground seed in the fruit smoothie, but the green smoothie had the same silky consistency of the Vitamix. The Waring doesn’t have a soup function, and we needed to blend the soup a little longer to get it from a gazpacho to a pureed consistency.</p>
<p>The close positioning of the blades, however, produced a luscious and thick Hollandaise, one of the best of our testing. We had the usual problem with the peanut butter — the peanuts were ground to a paste and lodged beneath the blades. The Waring doesn’t have a separate clean function, but it did the job at the highest speed.</p>
<p>The Waring is certainly a good blender, but the similar and cheaper Cleanblend is better.</p>

<p>As noted earlier, Breville abruptly discontinued its mid-range blender BBL620XL during our testing period, and based on Breville’s recommendation, we tested its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BBL620SIL1AUS1-Furious-Blender-Silver/dp/B07GJ24VXV/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BBL620SIL1AUS1</a> “Fresh &amp; Furious blender.&#8221; We were assured by Breville’s customer service that the Fresh &amp; Furious was a suitable substitute for the BBL620XL and had all the same features.</p>
<p>It short, it didn’t, and the Fresh &amp; Furious did not perform nearly as well. The Fresh &amp; Furious has 1300 watts, which wasn’t quite enough power to pulverize the raspberry seeds and kale. It does have two separate settings for fruit and green smoothies, and although both smoothies were well blended, they were filled with seed bits and sludgy green sediment. A second blending did not improve their consistency.</p>
<p>The Fresh &amp; Furious blender jar isn’t tapered at the bottom, and so we had the usual problems with a non-tapered jar. There is a one-half inch gap between the jar and the blades, so ingredients got stuck underneath the blades and along the sides and bottom of the jar. The Fresh &amp; Furious has an auto-clean function, but it couldn’t reach the food particles trapped along the two ridges that run the length of the blender jar.</p>
<p>The Fresh &amp; Furious has five speeds with minimal differentiation between the lowest and highest. The low speed didn’t create much of a vortex when blending the eggs for the Hollandaise, so we increased the speed to medium, and we got a decent sauce.</p>
<p>The Fresh &amp; Furious achieved a smooth, creamy peanut butter after eight minutes on the highest speed. As a precaution to prevent motor burn-out, the high speed automatically shuts off after two minutes, a feature we found annoying.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BBL620SIL1AUS1-Furious-Blender-Silver/dp/B07GJ24VXV/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BBL620AIL1AUS1</a> is certainly well made, and it’s a good all-around moderately priced blender. But if you’re looking for a low-end blender for making smoothies on a daily basis, we recommend the slightly less expensive Cleanblend instead.</p>

<p>For such an expensive high-performance blender, we were surprised at how poorly Vitamix’s main competitor fared. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blendtec-D725C3216A1A-AMAZON-Designer-Blender-Stainless/dp/B01FASW6OY/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blendtec  &#8211; D725C321A1A</a>’s control panel is entirely LCD touch screen, including speed control, which needs to be swiped left or right. Each function has a cute little icon, and every time you blend something, a message — such as “Ta-Da!&#8221; or “You should tweet this blend&#8221; — flashes. Without doubt, we were charmed by these amusing techno touches, but it proved to be a case of style over substance.</p>
<p>Two design flaws impacted the Blendtec’s performance: its blade and its pre-programmed functions. The blade is flat with two prongs each with two “arms&#8221; abouta one-half inch tall. The jar has almost no tapering, so there is a half-inch gap between the blade arms and the inside of the jar. There is a one-inch gap between the arms and the corners of the jar.</p>
<p>Consequently, the blade could not reach and process the raspberry seeds, nor could it pulverize the apple skin and core. In both tests, the smoothies were grainy and not pleasant to drink. We had the same problem with the peanut butter and Hollandaise. The blade chopped and spun the nuts into a paste that got stuck beneath the blade, and the egg and butter splattered and never emulsified.</p>
<p>In all cases, the timing of the pre-programmed functions was too short, the briefest being the soup function at three minutes, which gave us a decently blended but lukewarm soup. Of course, it could be argued that you can achieve the same results as Vitamix if you used the manual function. We tried, and it didn’t. But since the Blendtec is as expensive as Vitamix, its pre-programmed functions should work the same.</p>
<p>This particular model of Blendtec comes with a mini jar for single servings, which worked better since the jar is about a third of the width and kept the ingredients closely contained.</p>
<p>Like Vitamix, there are a number of Blendtec models, and they might perform as well as Vitamix. But the model we tested, the Designer 725, did not live up to the Blendtec reputation.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Countertop-1100-Watt-Smoothies-BL660/dp/B00939FV8K/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ninja &#8211; BL660</a> has three blades affixed to a spindle that fits into the bottom of the jar. After many complaints of injuries from the previous model, Ninja redesigned the spindle so it could be removed for easier and safer cleaning. (We will note that despite our efforts to stay clear of these razor blades, we got nicked twice.)</p>
<p>The largest blade is set in the center of the spindle with the two smaller blades positioned below. Presumably, this design allows the blender to crush ice at the top and distribute it to the lower blades for finer processing. The Ninja did crush the ice to a powdery texture and the smoothies had a slushy consistency.</p>
<p>With both smoothies, the fruit and vegetables were crushed at the blender’s initial burst, but they were not pulverized enough. Each had sediment and a crunchy feel on the tongue. The soup ingredients were well-blended, but again, there was substantial substance to the soup, like a finely chopped salsa. It was pleasantly palatable but not smooth. Blitzing the smoothies and soup additional time did not further process them.</p>
<p>The tiny blade at the bottom of the spindle could barely whip the egg for the Hollandaise, and it couldn’t distribute the ground peanuts upward to the wider blade, neither of which emulsified.</p>
<p>Two single serving blending cups are included, one with a traditional, removable four-pronged blade. A single-serving function is separate from the three speed levels. It’s basically a pulse function that needs to be pressed until the ingredients are processed. The resulting smoothie had a better consistency and was easier to use than the main blender.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CXKTNDU/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KSB1575CU</a> Diamond Blender had the lowest wattage of any blender we tested. At only 550 watts, the Diamond Blender’s motor clearly struggled in all of our tests. Not only did it take longer to blend ingredients, but it also didn’t have enough power to pulverize them to the smooth consistency we achieved with the Cleanblend. Raspberry seeds were left whole, and the green smoothie had a sludgy sediment.</p>
<p>The KitchenAid has five speeds, but we found that the lowest wasn’t a true low and splattered the egg and butter to the top of the blender jar and out the pour spout. The highest speed finely chopped the peanuts, but it didn’t have enough speed to convert them to butter.</p>
<p>The power switch is a big problem, because there’s no indication that it’s on or off. Several times during our testing, we thought the power was off, but when we picked up the blender jar, the blades spun and we barely avoided injury.</p>
<p>The KitchenAid we tested is the company’s recent upgrade of its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/KitchenAid-KSB1570SL-5-Speed-56-Ounce-BPA-Free/dp/B00DBQ1AIG/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KSB1570</a> blender, but it did not perform better than Cleanblend or the Ninja.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The type of blender you might consider purchasing is linked to your lifestyle and diet. The eight blenders that we tested ran the gamut from occasional blending (a couple of times a month) to frequent blending (twice or more a week) to daily use.</p>
<p>Many people think spending $50 for a blender is too much, and if they’re just using it for whipping up frozen margaritas on Cinco de Mayo, they’re probably right.  In most cases the old adage “you get what you pay for&#8221; applies to blenders. A powerful motor — 1500 watts — doesn’t come cheap, but our testing showed that it takes more than a strong motor to make a good blender. The shape of the blender jar and the blade position in the jar are equally important.</p>
<p>We chose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X3N9O58/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; CBT-2000</a> as the best overall, mid-range blender for making smoothies on a frequent basis. Its five programmed functions and precise manual control make this blender exceptionally easy to use.</p>
<p>At a whopping $600, our high-end pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-A3500-Programmable-Connectivity-Professional-Grade/dp/B075713NNL/?tag-ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vitamix &#8211; A3500</a>, pulverizes virtually anything edible into silky smoothies and creamy soups in minutes. Even if you used it several times a day, the Vitamix &#8211; A3500 is built to last for years, and its 10-year warranty is the best you’ll find anywhere.</p>
<p>Our low-end choice, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0094B94BM/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cleanblend &#8211; 2001</a>, doesn’t have programmed functions and is manually controlled, but its powerful 1800-watt motor liquifies fruits, vegetables and seeds nearly as well as Vitamix. It’s a great, affordable blender for frequent or everyday use.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>To narrow down our top immersion blender finalists, we undertook an exhaustive research process. Our team began by looking at top-reviewed products on Amazon, in which we analyzed standout features, price point and warranty. We expanded that search to sweep across other major retailers, including Best Buy, Home Depot, Walmart, Target and Macy’s. On each company’s website, we dug through customer reviews to find out which features are most important to people and what types of problems are most common.</p>
<p>Going beyond retail analyses, we read up on important differences between immersion blenders and other types of countertop mixers. To prepare for our testing, we watched videos from Sur la Table and chef <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3synzLVjkU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laura Kumin</a> that described how to properly use these nifty devices.</p>
<p>Finally, to pull in some crucial professional insight, we reached out to the local culinary experts at <a href="http://www.deckerbros.com/default.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decker Brothers Gourmet</a>, a maker of delicious all-natural soups in San Diego, California. Founding partner Chris Decker and chef Jeremy Wilcox shared that three speeds (low, medium and high) are plenty sufficient for an immersion blender. They prefer to stick with name brands (the commercial-grade <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Waring-WSB60-Heavy-Duty-Immersion-Blender/dp/B001CDRJO4/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1519942684&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=waring%2B16%22&amp;th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Waring 16” Heavy-Duty</a> is their product of choice), with cost and size being other top considerations.</p>
<p>As we compiled our findings, it became clear that customers hold many different opinions. Among review sites, no one seems to agree on which immersion blender reigns as the undisputed champ. However, we did find agreement on these two issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wattage is not a critical factor for effective performance.</li>
<li>Two speed settings — low and high — are plenty adequate. More variable speeds than that are unnecessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking all things into account, we refined our list down to seven contenders — four at a higher price range but capped at a reasonable $150— and three midrange models priced at under $50.</p>

[table id=111 /]
<h2 id="why-use">Why use an immersion blender?</h2>
<p>Immersion blenders are frequently referred to by different terms. “Hand blender” or “handheld blender” are most common, with “wand blender” and “stick blender” also coming into play. These terms all hit the mark. At its most basic level, an immersion blender is an electric motor that drives a shaft that spins a razor-sharp blade.</p>
<p>The primary reason to own an immersion blender is for convenience. Immersion blenders let you blend ingredients right in the pot rather than having to transfer to an upright blender or food processor, a task that can be extremely messy and unsafe when working with hot soups. These devices can also quickly blend up your morning smoothie directly in a cup. The main point is that immersion blenders are highly flexible and can eliminate the need to pull out more cumbersome appliances.</p>
<p>On top of that, hand blenders are super compact. And unlike <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-personal-blender/" rel="noopener">personal blenders</a>, also relatively small, these devices readily slide into a drawer.</p>
<p>Another major benefit is quicker and more effortless cleanup. With an upright blender or food processor, you need to disassemble and wash each component. That alone can be enough to discourage you from using it. With an immersion blender, you simply detach the shaft and give it a quick rinse. It’s a big time-saver, and the minimal effort means you don’t need to hold back from whipping up the tasty foods you enjoy.</p>
<p>With their convenience and versatility, immersion blenders pack a lot of bang for your buck. Low-end models start around $25-$30. Higher-end models are priced closer to $100, which can bump up to $150 when packaged with attachments, and can range over $300 for commercial-grade units. But you certainly don’t need to spend that much — you can find plenty of midrange options that balance function and style for less than $50.</p>
<h3>What they do</h3>
<p>The first immersion blenders were developed in Europe in the 1950s. Although features have modernized over the years, these handy kitchen gadgets still perform the same tasks they were originally designed for. Here are their four basic functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purée vegetables for soups, stews and sauces.</li>
<li>Blend ingredients such as frozen fruit and yogurt for smoothies.</li>
<li>Emulsify liquids to create salad dressings, mayonnaise and hollandaise sauce.</li>
<li>Whip desserts like meringue, mousse and — of course — whipped cream!</li>
</ul>
<h3>What they don&#8217;t do</h3>
<p>While versatile, an immersion blender can&#8217;t completely replace your countertop appliances. For one thing, most are not intended to grind ice; you’ll still need an <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-blender/">upright blender</a> to whip up a pitcher of frozen margaritas. And although you may see immersion-blender recipes for nut butter, be aware that a chopper cup attachment (not available with all models) is required.</p>

<p>First, since different manufacturers use different names to describe their parts, we’ll stick with the following terms for this article. The basic components of an immersion blender are:</p>
<p><strong>Motor Unit: </strong>This housing forms the upper half of the device.</p>
<p><strong>Grip:</strong> Located at the top of the motor unit, this is typically an ergonomic handle with a power button.</p>
<p><strong>Shaft:</strong> This is the stainless-steel blending arm that connects motor to head.</p>
<p><strong>Cage:</strong> Sometimes called a “guard,” this is the dome-shaped shield that covers the blade.</p>
<p><strong>Blade:</strong> This is the rotary blade that cuts and dices.</p>
<p><strong>Head:</strong> This term is usually used to refer to the cage and blade as a single element.</p>
<p>Now that we’re on the same page, here are the features our research steered us toward as we selected our finalists. With those immersion-blender terms in mind, let’s check out which features are most essential.</p>
<h3>Blending effectiveness</h3>
<p>A good immersion blender generates enough torque to create a powerful vortex within a mixing container. This movement circulates food through the blender’s rotary blade, ideally passing through the blade multiple times. For a silky smooth purée, you want a steady vortex that produces consistent particles. If too powerful, you may find the device unwieldy or experience significantly more splatter. If not powerful enough, you’ll be left with residual solids that require additional passes.</p>
<h3>Stainless-steel head</h3>
<p>After blending power, this is the next most important quality. Avoid less-expensive models with plastic cages, which can deform in very hot liquids. Stainless steel provides much better long-term durability due to its protective coating that resists scratching and corrosion as well as staining. Unlike plastic, stainless steel is inherently BPA-free and also less porous, so it resists bacteria and remains easy to clean. Plus, a  strong, rigid steel cage lets you really power down on pesky solids that resist your blade.</p>
<h3>Anti-suction head</h3>
<p>With the powerful torque created by their rotary blades, immersion blenders tend to suck the cage tight to the bottom of the mixing vessel. This is less a problem when blending in a narrow container, such as a tall cup or beaker. But for blending in a pot, suction can make it incredibly difficult to control the head’s path as you move it up and down while trying to sweep a steady, circular pattern<b>.</b> When the head becomes suddenly sucked to the pot bottom, you essentially need to stop, reposition and start again. If you don’t power down and instead try to pull free of the suction, it typically jerks the head clear of the surface and causes a splattery mess.</p>
<p>Strong suction — which frequently occurs at high speeds — can also cause metal cages to damage Teflon-coated cookware. A nylon-coated guard that lines the base of the cage will prevent such scratching and gouging. Unfortunately, such designs are rare, and only our Breville product includes this thoughtful protection.</p>
<p>When you use your immersion blender for the first time, try testing it in a pot of water — and probably not your favorite pot! This lets you get a feel for how it handles. If you hold the wand at a slight angle, it will help prevent suction; take care though, as this angle can also kick up more splatter.</p>

<h3>Ergonomic grip and speed controls</h3>
<p>You want the handle to provide a comfortable, natural fit to your hand. Better models come with a textured rubber grip that not only feels more welcoming than plastic, but also helps prevent slippage.</p>
<p>Immersion blenders are intended to be operated with one hand, as you usually need to hold the mixing container in place with your other hand. That means you want easy finger access to the power button, which activates the blade (for clarity, immersion blenders do not have an on/off switch — once plugged in, the unit is “hot” and ready to go). Some models come with two power buttons, typically for low/high speed or for regular speed plus a turbo boost. For either setup, you want to be sure your fingers can comfortably reach both buttons.</p>
<p>Newer products, such as our Braun and Philips models, are designed with a pressure-adjust trigger. By slowly squeezing the trigger, you can cycle through low to high speeds. Sounds great, but it can prove challenging to maintain consistent pressure and speed while also wrangling a pot of ingredients. That’s not to say pressure-adjust triggers are poor design, just that they take some practice to master.</p>
<p>Lastly, two more ergonomic factors, both interrelated, are weight and grip location. For weight, the unit should feel balanced in your hand, neither too heavy nor too light and insubstantial. Most high-end models achieve this. For grip location, you want the handle positioned at a point that offers firm, stable control. If located too high on the motor, the leverage can feel awkward.</p>
<p>For each of these ergonomic concerns — and especially if you plan to order online — your best bet is always to first visit a brick-and-mortar retailer and compare the feel of different products in person.</p>
<h3>Detachable shaft</h3>
<p>Motor units should not be submerged in water; you need to wipe that component down with a dry or damp cloth. The stainless steel shaft and head, however, need a thorough cleaning. Fortunately, most immersion blenders come with a detachable shaft that can be placed directly in the dishwasher. For the detachment mechanism, you want a design that easily disengages the shaft (usually by a button), so you can deposit it in the sink right after use. Also, be sure the shaft forms a rigid connection when attached to the motor as a single unit.</p>

<p>The good news is that cleaning stainless-steel parts is often effortless. Sometimes a quick rinse will do the job, with barely any scrubbing required. Of course, if you have a dishwasher, it’s always a good idea to power wash your blender shaft every few uses  for guaranteed sanitization.</p>
<h3>Immersion depth</h3>
<p>If you plan to make a lot of soups, or make other recipes in deep containers, then you’ll want to pay attention to immersion depth. This is the height the shaft can submerge below fluids without reaching the motor. Most manufacturers set this at the joint between motor unit and detachable shaft. Pay attention to that joint because you want to avoid products with joints that can trap food and make cleaning difficult.</p>
<h3>Reliable warranty</h3>
<p>As we pored over customer reviews, it was surprising to read more than a few complaints about motors burning out, some within just the first couple months. We have to wonder if some of these complaints are due to people not following manufacturer instructions, such as exceeding recommended run time or trying to dice items covered on the “do not chop” list.</p>
<p>Still, whether those reported motor burnouts were due to user error or not, you want to make certain your immersion blender comes with a solid warranty. In our research, we found most manufacturers offer a one-year warranty covering repair parts and labor; some offer product replacement but at the company’s discretion.</p>
<p>For our seven contenders, most warranty language includes the phrase “free from defects in material and workmanship.” They do not cover user negligence. So take time to read your manual, or you might have a battle on your hands, if you fry your motor by going beyond the recommended run time.</p>
<h3>Less-important features</h3>
<p>If you browse immersion blenders online, you’ll find that most brands tout multi-speed models as well as varying attachment packages. Don’t be swayed by these two factors, as neither is critical. Two to three speeds are all you need. As for attachments, while this is more a matter of personal desire, you  shouldn’t let it drive your decision on which blender is best. It’s also wise to look at the amount of storage space those attachments will take up.</p>
<h3>A few safety tips</h3>
<p>The instruction manuals for our finalists each include a hefty set of safety protocols. Here are the more critical guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never put your fingers near the blade when the unit is plugged in.</li>
<li>Know your product limitations (for example, do not grind ice cubes).</li>
<li>Before mixing hot ingredients in a pot, remove from burner and place pot on a stable countertop.</li>
<li>Respect the manufacturer’s maximum run time, which is typically about one minute.</li>
<li>After use, briefly run head in a bowl of water, then unplug and wash with a scrub brush.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Two factors guided the type of tests we conducted. First, to maintain a level playing field, we decided not to do any tests that required attachments beyond the main blending arm and beaker common to most packages. That basically meant no testing with a chopper cup attachment.</p>
<p>Second, we learned during our research that immersion blenders have no problem whipping (pastry frosting, whipped cream) or emulsifying (mayonnaise, salad dressings). The real challenge is grinding solid foods. Therefore, we focused on purée and blending tests.</p>
<h3>Soup purée test</h3>

<p>For our purée test, we made seven batches (one for each finalist) of butternut squash soup using 16 ounces of squash and 8 ounces of onions in a medium-size, 2.5-quart pot. Following a 20-minute simmer and just prior to blending, we noted that the squash remained at the bottom of the pot while the onions floated to the surface. This test challenged our seven contenders to draw all ingredients to their blade to deliver an acceptable purée.</p>
<p>We began our blending process by placing the immersion-blender head close to the bottom center of the pot. Starting at slowest speed, we gradually increased to mid-high speed over the first 10 seconds. During this initial main grind, we moved the blender head up and down while slowly tracing a circular pattern around the pot. The squash and onions quickly blended into a rich brown soup.</p>
<p>A preliminary test indicated 30 seconds was an appropriate point to stop and check for solids. Using that 30-second benchmark, we stopped blending and passed a slotted spoon (with 3/16” wide slots) back and forth to inspect for remaining food chunks. If the slotted spoon caught up partially ground veggies, we ran the blender for additional 5-10 second intervals (depending on residual amounts) until no solids were trapped by our spoon check. We then drained the soup in a stainless steel colander and measured the residual solids.</p>

<p>All of our contenders produced a well-puréed soup in under a minute, which seems perfectly acceptable for most home chefs. Completion times ranged from 35 to 55 seconds. Of our higher-end models, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008NCR0VY/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bamix &#8211; Pro-1</a> blender performed the fastest and yielded the least residual solids. Surprisingly, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004RF7QJW/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BSB510XL Control Grip</a>, which ranks high among many review sites, produced the least favorable results. We actually tested the Breville twice just to be sure, and both efforts showed the Breville struggled to attract and shred that one last remaining chunk.</p>
<p>Turning to our lower-priced models, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NQTE184/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 59766</a> hand blender got its work done quickest. Its blade yielded an exceptionally consistent purée. It’s worth noting that both the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005MMNBBQ/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KHB2351</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WIRLXUE/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Epica &#8211; Heavy Duty</a> did a fine job holding their own in this group of high-end and midrange products.</p>
<h3>Smoothie blending test</h3>
<p>While our soup purée test challenged finalists to grind ingredients in a large open pot, our smoothie blending test aimed to assess how well they could process solids in a narrow container. Our smoothie recipe combined one cup of frozen blueberries with half a cup of frozen bananas, plus some milk and yogurt. We allowed the frozen fruit to thaw in a beaker for five minutes, then put a stopwatch to the blend time. Similar to the purée test, we checked for residual solids at the 20-second mark; if fruit chunks remained, we continued to blend in 5-second bursts until all were removed.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11639" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/smoothie-blending-test-1.jpg" alt="Mixing frozen fruit in a plastic cup" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/smoothie-blending-test-1.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/smoothie-blending-test-1-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/smoothie-blending-test-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/smoothie-blending-test-1-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/smoothie-blending-test-1-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/smoothie-blending-test-1-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/smoothie-blending-test-1-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/smoothie-blending-test-1-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/smoothie-blending-test-1-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/smoothie-blending-test-1-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/smoothie-blending-test-1-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/smoothie-blending-test-1-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Each of our contenders delivered a strong performance, producing smoothies that were thick and creamy. Unlike grinding in the large-diameter pot (eight inches), the small-diameter beaker (four inches) helped the blenders efficiently trap and blend the fruit. None of our products left any measurable solids.</p>

<p>All seven immersion blenders completed the smoothie test within 30-40 seconds. Allowing for margin of error, plus a bit of subjective judgement, our contenders performed at near-equal level. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LZ5BOZF/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; ProMix</a> along with the Hamilton Beach and Epica models performed fastest, churning out thick smoothies in just 30 seconds. Each features a turbo boost, an advantage that pushed all three to the top. At the other end, we were surprised to again see the highly reviewed Breville finish with the slowest time (though at only 5-10 seconds difference, that’s really not much to complain about).</p>
<h3>Cleanability test</h3>

<p>To be honest, this wasn’t much of a test. All of our contenders rinsed off easily from both our soup and smoothie tests. That said, we did notice a few subtle differences.</p>
<p>The Breville’s brushed stainless-steel finish rinsed off easiest, with almost no scrubbing required. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M7VY9SH/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Braun &#8211; MultiQuick 9</a> allowed clear access above its adjustable blade, but we docked it a point because fluids can seep into its slip joint when submerged. We also docked a point from the Bamix, simply because it’s our only finalist without a detachable shaft. But to its credit, the Bamix’s removable blade does help with washing, whereas our fixed-blade models can make it tough to clean the topside of blade (mainly because you can’t see it).</p>
<p>KitchenAid received our lowest cleanability rating only due to its troublesome detachment mechanism that proved particularly difficult to unlock with wet hands.</p>
<h3>Suction and vortex control test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11505" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/vortex-control-ratings.png" alt="Chart showing vortex and suction control ratings" width="2000" height="1536" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/vortex-control-ratings.png 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/vortex-control-ratings-610x468.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/vortex-control-ratings-768x590.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/vortex-control-ratings-885x680.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/vortex-control-ratings-1500x1152.png 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/vortex-control-ratings-295x227.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/vortex-control-ratings-1000x768.png 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/vortex-control-ratings-360x276.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/vortex-control-ratings-375x288.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/vortex-control-ratings-414x318.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/vortex-control-ratings-320x246.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Speed is an important quantitative measure, but we also wanted to study our finalists’ qualitative performance. Specifically, we wanted to see how well each immersion blender could build and sustain a consistent vortex — and one commensurate with the speed setting. We also wanted to test for head suction, a critical factor that can greatly hamper performance and also damage cookware (see “anti-suction head” topic above).</p>
<p>Given that our soup purée test was timed for speed, it didn’t afford us much opportunity to study suction or vortex control. The chunky brown soup also obscured a clear view of the head. So for this test, we used the same 2.5-quart pot, but this time with only water. We filled the pot to 80-percent capacity (64 ounces), which set the water line an inch-and-a-half below the rim. Placing heads close to bottom center of pot, we then ran each immersion blender at low, medium and high speed, observing results for both suction and vortex control.</p>
<p>This performance test proved more telling than we expected. By taking time to closely observe each vortex, we gained a better understanding of which models could hold a controlled, swirling current. The test also revealed which blenders create suction; we really can’t place enough value on this second quality, because when the head sucks tight to bottom of pot, it completely throws off your momentum.</p>

<p>For sustaining a controlled vortex, all of our high-end models performed well. All four generated a vortex with appropriate power for the speed setting, and none caused splatter or overflow. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008NCR0VY/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bamix</a> produced the most consistent vortex, creating a well-shaped funnel without any splatter.</p>
<p>By contrast, our lower-priced models did not perform nearly as well. The Epica churned up a vigorous, frothing whirlpool at all three speed settings. In fact, its high speed was so powerful that it started to push water up and over the pot. The Hamilton Beach performed only slightly better, also too powerful for its speed settings, but the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005MMNBBQ/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid</a> formed and held a decent shape.</p>
<p>For our suction test, the Bamix again shined through as our standout winner. This appears to be a function of the four-pin, open-cage design that allows fluids to efficiently circulate while also preventing the rotary blade from sucking down. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M7VY9SH/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Braun’s</a> hand blender also performed very well, though we’re not exactly sure why because the MQ-9 has a solid cage similar to most other products; still, it exhibited only minimal suction at high speed.</p>
<p>None of our other finalists fared so well. For our high-end models, suction mainly occurred at highest speed. This includes the Breville that claims its bell-shaped base reduces suction. Of our lower-end models, KitchenAid was the only product not to create suction, but that was only at lowest speed.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Bamix &#8211; Pro-1 M150</h2>

    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bamix-blade-swap.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Bamix was founded in the 1950s by Roger Perrinjaquet, the very man who invented and patented the first-ever immersion blender. Derived from the French term &#8220;battre et mixer,” which translates to “beating and mixing,” Bamix only manufactures immersion blenders. For 60 years they’ve concentrated on engineering this one type of product, which helps explain why they do it so well.</p>
<p>Though it may not flaunt as much sleek stainless steel as our other contenders, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008NCR0VY/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bamix &#8211; Pro-1’s </a>outstanding performance convincingly pushed it to the top. Unlike most other cages that form a solid dome over the blade, the Bamix has a unique four-pin cage that is open at all sides. This design allows food to easily be drawn across the blade. We credit this design as the reason why the Pro-1 outperformed the competition. What impressed us most was how well it sustained a consistent, strongly defined vortex during our control test.</p>

Its quiet motor, comfortable grip and anti-suction head earned the Bamix our top pick.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008NCR0VY/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Bamix not only performs well, it’s also pleasing to operate. When we first powered up, we found ourselves awed by the low hum of the precision motor — it really does purr like a fine European sports car. We found the ergonomic grip fits nicely to the palm, and both speed buttons are properly located for comfortable finger position. The Pro-1 comes with only two speed settings, but its low and high speed are really all you need. At an inch-and-a-half under the next tallest model, it’s the most compact blender of the lot, making for efficient drawer storage.</p>
<p>It’s interesting that our top-pick Bamix is the only finalist not to come with a detachable shaft, meaning it needs to be cleaned by hand and cannot go in the dishwasher. Bamix has stayed with this same fixed-shaft design that has proven successful since its inception. On the plus side, this sealed shaft also allows the motor unit to be partially submerged, giving the Pro-1 the greatest immersion depth. It’s a bit more awkward to clean the head due to the motor being attached, but it’s certainly not a deal breaker.</p>
<p>And though the Bamix is our only finalist with a fixed shaft, it’s also the only product that features interchangeable blades. Each blade fits onto a piston located at the end of the shaft. Removing the blade actually simplifies cleaning. The Pro-1 package comes with four blades total, each with a specific function: chopping, blending, slicing and aerating. For our tests we used the four-pronged chopping blade, which has an irregularly shaped blade so that it can better connect with food particles.</p>
<p>Given that most brands offer only a one-year warranty, with a few rare two- or three-year exceptions, the Bamix 10-year warranty is pretty extraordinary. In fact, we called their support team just to confirm 10 years wasn’t a typo. Their rep explained that over the past 60 years Bamix has focused their efforts engineering a reliable AC motor, and they&#8217;re confident in offering a longer warranty. Additionally, should a repair or replacement part ever be needed, Bamis provides service in both the United States and Europe.</p>

<p>With its brushed stainless steel and elegant lines, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004RF7QJW/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BSB510XL Control Grip</a> inspires confidence right out of the box. Not only does its design look great, but the Breville also provides the most comfortable, natural-feeling grip of all our contenders. The rubberized grip contours right to the hand and has a single-button trigger. After a day of testing, we really appreciated this simplicity, because it prevents fumbling with multiple buttons or accidentally hitting a turbo button (which was easy to do with some other models).</p>
<p>The Breville offers 15 variable speeds, the most of any of our models. You adjust the speed setting from a top dial. Unfortunately, you can’t change speeds while in operation because you need one hand to press the trigger and the other to hold your mixing container. Even though you need to pause blending if you want to adjust speed, it’s nice to have that many settings.</p>
<p>At 16.25 inches, the Breville stands out as the tallest of our finalists. This extra length provides a full 8-inch immersion depth, second only to the Bamix. And when you’re done dipping deep, its quick-release side buttons let you detach the shaft in the sink with a simple two-finger pinch. In terms of weight, the Breville feels substantial but not at all cumbersome. Its build quality is top notch.</p>

<p>The Breville’s head design is the only model to integrate a scratch-guard for protecting cookware and the only model to come with a blade-guard for safer drawer storage. We also noted that the Breville’s head geometry is much more oblong than standard circular-shaped cages. That means you need a wide-bottom cup for making smoothies directly in the container, though you can of course just use the beaker.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding performance, we held higher hopes for the Breville based on all the positive reviews we had read. However, though the box claims the head is anti-suction, we experienced quite a bit of pull when set on the highest speed. And for whatever reason, the head also yielded slower purée and blend times than others. The Breville is indeed a solid product, but these test results held it back from earning our top pick.</p>

<p>If you’re more cost-conscious, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005MMNBBQ/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KHB2351</a> delivers solid performance for well under half the price of our higher-end top pick. Compared to our other two budget models, the KitchenAid scored highly, because it keeps things simple and intuitive rather than overcomplicating the design with unnecessary extra speeds or a turbo button.</p>
<p>In our food tests, it yielded a consistently blended soup and smoothie. It also performed much better in our suction and vortex control test. Unlike the other two midrange models, the KitchenAid formed a controlled vortex appropriate for its speed settings, and it induced significantly less suction.</p>
<p>The KitchenAid is our only finalist <i>not </i>to feature a trigger-like grip shaped to the hand — and that’s okay. The rubberized grip, monolithic in how the rubber seamlessly incorporates the power button, indents more than enough to offer a firm grasp. Compared to other models that you hold toward the very top, the KitchenAid’s grip is located about 80 percent up its total length. We found that this position provides great leverage for stirring ingredients.</p>

The full rubberized grip is also a nice touch — and all at a reasonable cost.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005MMNBBQ/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Of note, the KitchenAid blender is the midrange option within a three-series family. During our research, we noticed that this KitchenAid “KHB” series far outsells other immersion blenders at retailers beyond Amazon — and all three models have very positive customer reviews.</p>
<p>We agree with that consensus… mostly. Our one gripe with the KitchenAid is that its blending shaft was very difficult to attach and remove. The motor body and shaft each have a tick mark that needs to be aligned. At first, it required so much force to align the marks that we feared breaking the unit; it did eventually slide into place, but we truly had to strong-arm it.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005MMNBBQ/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KHB2351</a> offers straightforward design that gets the job done at a reasonable midrange cost.</li>
<li>Simple power button and speed dial help you safely focus on the task at hand.</li>
<li>Comfortable rubberized grip is located at a point that provides excellent leverage.</li>
<li>We hope KitchenAid improves the KHB2351’s detachment, but it remains a solid product for the price.</li>

<h3>Braun &#8211; MultiQuick 9</h3>
<p>Of all our contenders, the recently introduced <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M7VY9SH/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Braun &#8211; MultiQuick 9</a> blender offers the most unique feature: the shaft is designed with a slip joint that allows the blade to move up and down. This vertical movement is just under 3/8 inch and is intended to provide a more optimized grind. To be honest, we didn’t notice a significant improvement over our fixed-blade models. However, the adjustable blade does have the benefit of reduced food clogs and easier cleaning.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M7VY9SH/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/braun-mq-9-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/braun-mq-9-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/braun-mq-9-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/braun-mq-9-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/braun-mq-9-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/braun-mq-9-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/braun-mq-9-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/braun-mq-9-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/braun-mq-9.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Unique Piston Shaft: Braun - MQ-9</h3><p>Its slip-joint shaft, pressure-adjust trigger and robust attachments package make the MultiQuick 9 a solid choice, though at a higher price.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M7VY9SH/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Braun boasts lots of nice features: a pressure-adjust speed trigger, ergonomic grip and nicely balanced weight, plus a two-year warranty. It comes with the most attachments, but also the highest price tag. While we did appreciate its anti-suction performance during testing, we’re not big fans of the top safety button which is awkward to operate and only stays active for a couple seconds. Still, the Braun is a worthy choice if you’re willing to spend the extra money for its full set of gadgets.</p>
<h3>Philips &#8211; ProMix</h3>
<p>A newcomer to the scene, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LZ5BOZF/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; ProMix</a> was designed as a joint venture with a leading ergonomics company in Sweden. Like the Braun, the Philips features a pressure-adjust speed control, and it can also trigger a turbo boost when squeezed all the way. It’s the most slender of our finalists, though still nicely weighted and our only model with a titanium-coated blade. We appreciated the look and feel of the ProMix; it’s performance didn’t quite measure up to that of our top pick. The Philips is a great option, if you’re drawn to a pressure-adjust trigger but don’t want to splurge for the Braun.</p>
<h3>Hamilton Beach &#8211; 59766</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NQTE184/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 59766</a> includes a rubberized grip and well-designed detachment mechanism. During testing, it aggressively powered through foods and produced a very consistent purée. The Hamilton Beach features three speeds (low, medium and high) adjusted by a slider switch on the side. It has two power buttons, one for basic power, plus one for turbo — and this is where our main complaint lies. These two buttons are located very close together, and because the turbo button is larger than the standard power button, it’s way too easy to unintentionally press the turbo boost.</p>
<h3>Epica &#8211; Heavy Duty</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WIRLXUE/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Epica &#8211; Heavy Duty</a> made it in our test lineup due to its high number of positive reviews across online retailers. Right out of the box, we noticed the Epica has the most plastic parts of all our contenders and is the only model without a rubberized grip. Yet it has a nice substantial weight in the hand, and the stainless steel cage has a larger diameter and thicker gauge than our other two midrange models. Oddly, the Epica fell short not because it lacks power, but rather it has too much power that isn&#8217;t sufficiently harnessed. During testing, it sucked tight to our pot on all speed settings, and its high-energy vortex kicked up the most splatter.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Immersion blenders offer the convenience of direct, in-the-pot blending without taking up a lot of kitchen storage. A quality immersion blender feels comfortable in the hand, generates a strong yet controlled vortex and comes with a reliable warranty that ideally extends beyond one year.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008NCR0VY/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bamix &#8211; Pro-1</a> ticks all these boxes and serves as a perfect example of what the Bamix company continues to do best: produce high-caliber immersion blenders with Swiss precision engineering. Best of all, the Pro-1’s open cage avoids any suction whatsoever, giving you optimum control in either a stewpot or a smoothie cup.</p>
<p>For a quality alternative, consider the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004RF7QJW/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BSB510XL Control Grip</a> that combines exceptional ergonomics with a sleek brushed-aluminum finish. Or if you’re looking for an under-$50 option, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005MMNBBQ/?tag=ybdimrs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; 59766</a> delivers plenty of power with its straightforward design and simple controls.</p>

One of our favorite ways to utilize the berry is in a relish. It’s a great flavor to top toast, add to a parfait, top on baked brie topping, or use as a sandwich spread.</p>

<p>In doing our research, we had to make a decision about where personal blenders ended and where regular blenders began.</p>
<p>There are several great blenders out there, but they aren’t “personal”. Bigger blenders tend to offer the ability to blend for much bigger families and also more advanced features like the ability to make hot soup or deliver churn-free ice cream.</p>
<p>On the negative, they also tend to be much larger than average, take up a lot of space on your shelf, and run at much higher price points.<strong> We define personal blenders as single-serve units that allow you to blend and also consume your smoothie in the same container.</strong></p>
<p>Bigger blenders almost always require you pour from a bigger container into a smaller one, and for this reason, are harder to clean, more expensive, and a better model for a cooking professional or family than someone looking for that on-the-go boost with little maintenance and also, less-than-egregious cost.</p>
<p>Some of the models we considered had hybrid setups &#8212; a blending container that also doubled as a to-go cup, while also including a bigger base for family-sized smoothies.</p>
<p>We passed on reviewing most of these options in this round because they didn’t fit the “personal” archetype we aimed for, which most of the time meant little-to-no frills to allow for the most convenience at the lowest cost. However, we did do a test of all blender options in our more general <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-blender/">blender review</a>.</p>
<p>The exception to this in our blender set was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-S30-Personal-Blender-Black/dp/B00JS8S2IC/?tag=ybdpers-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vitamix &#8211; S30</a>, a $300+ blender that received such high marks in the personal blender category that it was worth considering despite containing additional attachments and a bigger price point.</p>

<p>Our main tester has owned a Hamilton Beach personal blender for almost two years, and also fits the archetype of the most common personal blender user. That is, they want a good tasting smoothie, but want it fast, and also don’t want have to work too hard for it… or have to work too hard afterward in cleaning it.</p>
<p>In addition, nobody in our test group had kids (or additional cooking wants), so there wasn&#8217;t much need for a much bigger or fancier blender.</p>
<p>We spent 40+ hours in total researching and testing personal blenders, comparing research from <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/blender-roundup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Reports</a>, <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/blenders/buying-guide.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNET</a>, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/06/single-serve-blenders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WIRED</a> and more in order to come up with our own criteria and conclusions from a starting point of existing, reputable data sources.</p>
<p>We also consulted with two team members with years of experience cooking and contributing to their own cooking blogs, <a href="http://shefsherry.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shef Sherry</a> and <a href="http://hungryhuy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hungry Huy</a>, for their opinions of what makes a personal blender stand out from the pack.</p>
<p>In our research, there were several high rated blenders that emerged, which made selecting the best of the best difficult. We ultimately ended up going with a final seven:</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="best">Compare the best personal blenders</h2>
[table id=11 /]
<h2 class="collapse" id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>In addition to pure blending power, the most obvious attribute of a quality blender, we also tested and indirectly came upon several other differentiating qualities that contributed to a seamless, quality experience&#8230; or didn’t.</p>
<p>First, the circumference of the blender bottle opening made getting some powders and fruits into the bottle difficult. My scooper for protein would have splashed protein all over my kitchen floor on the Oster Blue or Black+Decker models, which meant I needed to use a spoon, creating more dishes, or waste some of my expensive protein powder down the kitchen sink.</p>

<p>A wider opening means getting your favorite ingredients into the glass without a problem. Too wide and you’re impacting on the usability/portability of these bottles. Thankfully, none of the personal blenders really fell in that range. However, some did fall in the difficult-to-pack range, which added some annoyance to the process in terms of additional cleaning or wasted ingredients.</p>
<p>The next functionality aspect we looked at before we started blending was actual cup size. While we did want a personal, single-serve blender, we also wanted the option to blend a meal from these blenders… and not just a snack. If you only use personal blenders for a snack or small meal, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-51101BA-Personal-Blender/dp/B00KVZ27UA/?tag=ybdpers-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach</a> (14oz cup), <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BELLA-12-Piece-Rocket-Blender-Stainless/dp/B001E7XGX6/?tag=ybdpers-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bella</a> (16oz) and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tribest-Personal-Blender-PB-250-Complete/dp/B0034JU6W6?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ybdpers-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tribest</a> (16oz) models may work for you.</p>
<p>In addition to their inability to generate a full meal, smaller cups, on average, made blending more difficult for the motor and caused all three of these models stress when compressing several bigger fruits in a smaller area. Even if you don’t care about making a shake of 16 ounces or more, a bigger cup size is preferable for an improved blending experience.</p>

<p>Another characteristic worth thinking about is the sheer size of the blender. One reason people buy single-serve blenders is because they take up little counter space on average. However, this isn’t always true.</p>
<p>The Vitamax S30, although high powered, will take up a sizable amount of space in a small kitchen. Comparatively, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-51101BA-Personal-Blender/dp/B00KVZ27UA/?tag=ybdpers-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach’s inexpensive model</a> takes up very little and would be a worthy companion of any 300 square feet New York apartment.</p>
<p>We next looked at the noise levels of each blender. On average, each blender hovered around 100 decibels (dB) when we ran them against an average assortment of ice/frozen fruit and etc using a noise meter. For context, ambient noise is around 45 dB.</p>

<p>Tribest’s model screeched to the loudest levels, ringing in at 106 dB, while the expensive and efficient Vitamix came in at an efficient, less noisy 96 dB. In addition, the Vitamix, unlike the other blenders, has a speed setting, which means you can significantly reduce the noise of the blender at lower levels. Blending slower at the 4th level on the Vitamax brought the noise level down to 85 dB.</p>

<p>Once we had thought through all the main functions, it was time to start measuring blending efficiency. To best control amongst the seven, we used the exact same ingredients in each blender, and put them in in the exact same order against the blade &#8212; a pretty normal but fairly difficult test for each blender to run against, with several different ingredient types to challenge it.</p>
<p>From there, we timed how long it took to get to an even blend. An even blend was defined as the visual point at which the smoothie reached an even consistency with a single, common color and no uneven chunks.</p>
<p>The ingredients for the seven smoothies we blended were:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1871" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blender_INGREDIENTS-2.jpg" alt="Photo Credit Kimberly Lostroscio" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blender_INGREDIENTS-2.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blender_INGREDIENTS-2-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blender_INGREDIENTS-2-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blender_INGREDIENTS-2-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blender_INGREDIENTS-2-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blender_INGREDIENTS-2-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blender_INGREDIENTS-2-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blender_INGREDIENTS-2-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blender_INGREDIENTS-2-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blender_INGREDIENTS-2-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>In general, the blenders performed in line with motor power, with the 250 watt and below models, the Oster Blue, Tribest and Hamilton Beach all taking one minute plus to blend the concoction.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1088" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time.png" alt="blender-time" width="880" height="609" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-610x422.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-360x249.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-375x260.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-414x287.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-295x204.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-180x125.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-320x221.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The Oster Blue technically also required an extra ingredient shake in order to get it to perform, which likely had something to do with its narrow opening contributing to a less-than-optimal blending experience despite being on the highest end in wattage of the lower-end models. Over the long term, this is a common occurrence for lower-wattage blenders.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0163K1Z3G/?tag=ybdpers-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The NutriBullet</a> dominated the competition in terms of time to even blend, managing an impressive even blend time of 12.47 seconds, 18 seconds better than the next-closest result. As mentioned previously, the pure power of the NutriBullet’s 900 watt motor made it not only effective, but fun to use, too.</p>
<p>Depending on your want, time to blend might not be overly important. It’s nice to be able to blend in 12 seconds, but if you’ve got a minute, you can live with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-51101BA-Personal-Blender/dp/B00KVZ27UA/?tag=ybdpers-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Hamilton Beach</a> or <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/BLACK-DECKER-Fusionblade-Personal-Blender-Red-PB1002R/39791213" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker</a> models.</p>
<p>However, it’s going to be a pretty common occurrence for the Hamilton Beach, Bella and Oster Blue models to struggle out of the gate, which means more than just a slow smoothie &#8212; there are also some implications on the durability of the motor, as I’ve had one Hamilton Beach blender break in the past year after wearing it out from repeated uses and struggles to blend.</p>
<p>Comparatively, the higher powered motors of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-S30-Personal-Blender-Black/dp/B00JS8S2IC/?tag=ybdpers-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Vitamix</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0163K1Z3G/?tag=ybdpers-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NutriBullet models</a> feel sustainable (and the Vitamix has a five year warranty), so there’s a sense that you are also getting a better investment in the higher end, more powerful motors, too.</p>

<p>It’s not totally fair to rate the Vitamix exclusively on blend speed, either &#8212; of the models we tested, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-S30-Personal-Blender-Black/dp/B00JS8S2IC/?tag=ybdpers-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Vitamix</a> was the only one with blending speeds and a pulse option, giving you more flexibility in your end product if you’re looking for finesse in your personal blender.</p>
<p>My guess, if you’re the typical personal blender user, is that you aren’t, but in case you someday imagine that scenario, it could be something to look into investing in.</p>
<p>Finally, once the smoothie is enjoyed, you also have to worry about the fun part &#8212; cleaning. The wider mouth personal blenders made this the easiest process, allowing you to clean out the hard-to-get areas of the cup easily and without struggling if you happened to leave it on the table overnight.</p>
<p>Comparatively, the Hamilton Beach made it hardest given the blending cup and blending blade fit within the same apparatus, making it difficult to clean hard-to-get-to pieces of the blade if you forget to wash it out immediately.</p>
<p>For both cleaning purposes and convenience when building your smoothie, wider mouth openings are superior.</p>

<p>The bullet’s blending speed, at 12.47 seconds, is almost five times better than the group average of 58 seconds. The power makes blending fun, too &#8212; it might not make you healthier by default, but if it’s more enjoyable to do, it may make you more likely to reach for a smoothie than a sandwich.</p>
<p>The wide base also makes it easy to make shakes without mess and also clean up without pain. It’s a bit loud, but nothing out of the ordinary for such a powerful blender.</p>

Powered by the most powerful motor of the lower cost models at 275 watts, the Black+Decker blended our difficult concoction in just under one minute.</p>

<p>In addition, the Black+Decker has a two year limited warranty, a year longer than the rest of the cheaper models. On the downside, its 2 ½ inch opening made making shakes a little bit messier to clean up on average &#8212; but that opening shouldn’t be enough to shy you away from a purchase decision if you’re looking for a solid, reliable blender you can use day in and day out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-S30-Personal-Blender-Black/dp/B00JS8S2IC/?tag=ybdpers-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Vitamix &#8211; S30</a> blender was the most expensive model we tested, with an average price of around $350. While the Vitamix performed nicely on every point, very little about it warranted making it an expensive recommendation for the average personal blender user.</p>
<p>Unlike the other models, it also has a 40 ounce compact container that makes family blending possible. But if you want a personal blender, you probably don’t care about that use case for the most part.</p>
<p>Similarly, it has speed options and also a pulse option, giving you more precision. Yet again, though, that level of precision is rarely needed for the on-the-go smoothie. These options also make the Vitamix the biggest personal blender we tested &#8212; taking up considerable shelf space, which may come at a premium depending on where you live.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-51101BA-Personal-Blender/dp/B00KVZ27UA/?tag=ybdpers-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 51101AV</a> had been a constant in our kitchen for years, and at around $15, it’s great value for the price. You won’t go wrong with a blender like this, but you won’t go right, either. I used it consistently for 18 plus months and consistently went with my go-to of mixed fruit, protein and maybe a banana.</p>

<p>Enter these product reviews, and within the first five minutes with the NutriBullet, I realized what the Hamilton Beach was missing: power, fun, and ease. Even compared to its low priced comparable, the Black+Decker, it comes up short in several key areas: motor gusto, cup size, warranty, and ease to clean.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tribest-Personal-Blender-PB-250-Complete/dp/B0034JU6W6?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ybdpers-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Tribest -PB250</a> was one of our least favorite models. It had the second fastest blending speed, but was also priced at $70, had a narrow opening, and was the loudest model we tested. Very little about it seemed to warrant the $70 price point. If it had priced in the $30 range, it might be a different conversation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oster-BLSTPB-WBL-250-Watt-Blender-Travel/dp/B004P2OLB8/?tag=ybdpers-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Oster &#8211; BLSTPB</a> was another well-rated, low priced model at right under $20. It had some positive attributes, but it tested at the bottom of our time-to-blend list, taking 83 seconds to fully mix our recipe concoction. The narrow opening/bottle size was a likely contributor, and said size also made the Oster difficult to clean.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BELLA-12-Piece-Rocket-Blender-Stainless/dp/B001E7XGX6/?tag=ybdpers-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bella &#8211; 13330</a>&#8216;s brought it in the middle of the pack with a solid blending speed, opening circumference and ease to clean. However, it was slightly beat by Black+Decker in speed, cup size, and noise level, making it the 2nd best choice in that price range.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="long-term">Long-term testing notes</h2>
<p>We originally published this post in July of 2016. Although we had been using personal blenders for years, it was the first time we had used the NutriBullet Pro. We had read some reviews with concerns about the long-term durability of the product, so were interested to test it on a long timeline to see if we experienced the same problems.</p>
<p>Now three years later, we haven&#8217;t ran into issues with durability. We&#8217;ve been running the NutriBullet almost daily, and are still in love with its power and usability. Cleaning is a synch, it easily blends through difficult mixtures, and there have been no signs of wear and tear. In fact, at one point we started filming a video of the NutriBullet, and because of that, stopped using it daily and instead substituted the Oster. It was a nightmare in comparison, getting clogged almost every single time, causing spills, and in general, clearly showing why he had made <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0163K1Z3G/?tag=ybdpers-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the NutriBullet</a> our first choice in this post.</p>
<p>Another member of the Your Best Digs team has been extensively using our under $30 pick, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/BLACK-DECKER-Fusionblade-Personal-Blender-Red-PB1002R/39791213" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the </a>, and is still happy with the choice. She mentioned having to be cognizant of not overfilling the cup given the units less-impressive motor, but that&#8217;s to be expected for a cheaper unit. Overall, we&#8217;re still confident in that pick.</p>
<p>That said, if the Nutribullet or the other blenders on this list still don&#8217;t catch your fancy, we highly suggest you check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-blender/">larger blender review</a> for additional blending options.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[In the battle of powerhouse blenders, the Nutribullet comes in first, especially as a personal blender choice. If you want to get a little more versatile, the Vitamix has its perks, but isn't quite worth the price.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter spending 40 plus hours testing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-S30-Personal-Blender-Black/dp/B00JS8S2IC/?tag=ybdnutrivs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vitamix S30</a> and six of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-personal-blender/">the best personal blenders</a> on the market, we’ve come to the conclusion that for most, the S30 is not worth the price tag. For the value, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0163K1Z3G/?tag=ybdnutrivs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NutriBullet 900</a> is a comparable if not better product at a third the price.</p>
<p>Nothing about the Vitamix S30 made us think it wasn’t a great blender. Amazing power, nice features, portable, and relatively easy to clean. But there was also little that made us conclude that it was also worth $350+, especially when there were similar personal blenders on the market that compared nicely.</p>
<h2>The Vitamix reputation</h2>
<p>Vitamix is known for their world-class blenders. And world-class they are… especially at the family-sized Classic and Next Generation levels.</p>
<p>It’s my estimation that the personal blender line Vitamix has created, in the S30 and the S55, is an effort to appeal to the single-serve segment of the market, while also retaining the luxury brand identity they’ve established. They do, but when creating a product at $350, it only really “fits” in the bigger blender area in terms of features and need… and that’s where I think this segment of their product line breaks down.</p>
<p>When we tested the Vitamix S30 against six of the best personal blenders available, it not surprisingly <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-personal-blender/">lived up to reputation</a>. We created a static, consistent blending test across the seven blenders, inserted the ingredients in the same order, and tested time to even blend.</p>
<p>These were the ingredients we tested:</p>

<p>The Vitamix powered through the mix, generating the third best time in our sample. However, the NutriBullet Pro 900, priced at a third the cost, managed to blend the mix in a third the time:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1093" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-2.png" alt="blender-time" width="880" height="609" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-2.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-2-610x422.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-2-360x249.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-2-375x260.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-2-414x287.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-2-295x204.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-2-180x125.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-2-320x221.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>To be fair, in the instruction guide, the Vitamix recommends starting for a bit on the 1-2 blending speed level and then ramping up to 10. We did that, but it was still surprising to have it get blown away so significantly by the NutriBullet.</p>
<p>In other areas, the Vitamix either leads or close to leads the pack. It’s relatively quiet, has a good sized blending cup (with a bigger option the other blenders didn’t have), and has significantly more features in the speed modes and pulse option no other blender did.</p>

<p>The extra features Vitamix offers also come with a cost &#8212; size. Out of its personal blender counterparts, the Vitamix will take up the most room on your counter. It’s by no means gigantic, but it is one the largest blenders in the single-serve niche.</p>

<p>If you’re considering the S30, you probably want a power-packed personal blender. Our recommendation is actually to go with the NutriBullet, which offers a more enjoyable product at a third the cost.</p>

The Pro 900's 1.2-horsepower motor tears through the ice and frozen fruit to deliver a delicious smoothie in record time.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0163K1Z3G/?tag=ybdnutrivs-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The NutriBullet has more blending power and is slightly easier to clean than the Vitamix. On the negative side, the NutriBullet only has a one year warranty compared to the Vitamix’s impressive five year warranty. If we’re being fair and assume the NutriBullet might break once over the five years, you’re still paying half the cost of the Vitamix S30.</p>
<p>And if it breaks twice, the comparison is getting a lot closer, but with two one year warranties to back it up, you’re probably likely to get the similar long-term value at around half the price.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-S30-Personal-Blender-Black/dp/B00JS8S2IC/?tag=ybdnutrivs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Vitamix S30</a> is still an amazing product for the right person. To me, it fits perfectly into the need set of a young professional with a kid or two, who wants to be able to make on-the-go smoothies and also have the option to make bigger ones with the 40 ounce container if the need arises.</p>
<p>Similarly, said professional should probably have or be starting to develop some passion for cooking/precision, and want to utilize the speed and pulse functions to create thicker or smoother smoothies or other ingredients, such as pesto, that the NutriBullet can’t compete with.</p>
<p>In essence, we’d best describe the Vitamix S30 as an entry-level performance blender for the on-the-go smoothie lover.</p>
<p>If that’s not you, check out the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0163K1Z3G/?tag=ybdnutrivs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NutriBullet</a>.

				<description><![CDATA[The Vitamix S30 is a great personal blender -- its just not worth the $250+ you'll pay for it if you're using it for those reasons. If you want a real, more versatile blender, upgrade in size. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter spending 40 plus hours testing the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-S30-Personal-Blender-Black/dp/B00JS8S2IC/?tag=ybdvita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vitamix S30</a> and six of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-personal-blender/">the best personal blenders</a> on the market, we’ve come to the conclusion that for most, the S30 is not worth the price tag. For the value, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0163K1Z3G/?tag=ybdvita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NutriBullet 900</a> is a comparable if not better product at a third the price.</p>

<li><a href="#who-should-buy">Who should buy the Vitamix S30</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing about the Vitamix S30 made us think it wasn’t a great blender. Amazing power, nice features, portable, and relatively easy to clean. But there was also little that made us conclude that it was also worth $350+, especially when there were similar personal blenders on the market that compared nicely.</p>
<h2>The Vitamix reputation</h2>
<p>Vitamix is known for their world-class blenders. And world-class they are… especially at the family sized <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.vitamix.com/">Classic and Next Generation levels</a>.</p>
<p>It’s my estimation that the personal blender line Vitamix has created, in the S30 and the S55, is an effort to appeal to the single-serve segment of the market, while also retaining the luxury brand identity they’ve established. They do, but when creating a product at $350, it only really “fits” in the bigger blender area in terms of features and need… and that’s where I think this segment of their product line breaks down.</p>
<p>When we tested the Vitamix S30 against six of the best personal blenders available, it not surprisingly <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-personal-blender/">lived up to reputation</a>. We created a static, consistent blending test across the seven blenders, inserted the ingredients in the same order, and tested time to even blend.</p>
<p>These were the ingredients we tested:</p>

<p>The Vitamix powered through the mix, generating the third best time in our sample. However, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0163K1Z3G/?tag=ybdvita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NutriBullet Pro 900</a>, priced at a third the cost, managed to blend the mix in a third the time:</p>

<p>To be fair, in the instruction guide, the Vitamix recommends starting for a bit on the 1-2 blending speed level and then ramping up to 10. We did that, but it was still surprising to have it get blown away so significantly by the NutriBullet.</p>
<p>In other areas, the Vitamix either leads or close to leads the pack. It’s relatively quiet, has a good sized blending cup (with a bigger option the other blenders didn’t have), and has significantly more features in the speed modes and pulse option no other blender did.</p>

<p>The extra features <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-S30-Personal-Blender-Black/dp/B00JS8S2IC/?tag=ybdvita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vitamix offers</a> also come with a cost &#8212; size. Out of its personal blender counterparts, the Vitamix will take up the most room on your counter. It’s by no means gigantic, but it is one the largest blenders in the single-serve niche.</p>

<p>If you’re considering the S30, you probably want a power-packed personal blender. Our recommendation is actually to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0163K1Z3G/?tag=ybdvita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">go with the NutriBullet</a>, which offers a more enjoyable product at a third the cost.</p>
<p>The NutriBullet has more blending power and is slightly easier to clean than the Vitamix. On the negative side, the NutriBullet only has a one year warranty compared to the Vitamix’s impressive five year warranty. If we’re being fair and assume the NutriBullet might break once over the five years, you’re still paying half the cost of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-S30-Personal-Blender-Black/dp/B00JS8S2IC/?tag=ybdvita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Vitamix S30</a>.</p>
<p>And if it breaks twice, the comparison is getting a lot closer, but with two one year warranties to back it up, you’re probably likely to get the similar long-term value at around half the price.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-S30-Personal-Blender-Black/dp/B00JS8S2IC/?tag=ybdvita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Vitamix S30</a> is still an amazing product for the right person. To me, it fits perfectly into the need set of a young professional with a kid or two, who wants to be able to make on-the-go smoothies and also have the option to make bigger ones with the 40 ounce container if the need arises.</p>
<p>Similarly, said professional should probably have or be starting to develop some passion for cooking/precision, and want to utilize the speed and pulse functions to create thicker or smoother smoothies or other ingredients, such as pesto, that the NutriBullet can’t compete with.</p>
<p><strong>In essence, we’d best describe the Vitamix S30 as an entry-level performance blender for the on-the-go smoothie lover.</strong></p>
<p>If that’s not you, check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0163K1Z3G/?tag=ybdvita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the NutriBullet</a>. You can also consider the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Decker-PB1002R-Fusion-Personal-Blender/dp/B00LU2HXTI/?tag=ybdvita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black &amp; Decker Fusion Blade</a>, our best pick under $30, a solid choice for a fraction of the cost.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[The NutriBullet comes with a ton of hype, but for the most part, it delivers. It took first in our test of the best personal blenders.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e researched and tested six of the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-personal-blender/">best personal blenders</a>. After logging 40+ hours putting our contenders through the grinder, we’re confident the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0163K1Z3G/?tag=ybdnbpro-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NutriBullet Pro 900 Series</a> is the best personal blender on the market. It combines impressive blending power, affordable cost and perhaps most importantly, fun, in one exquisite and effective package.</p>
<p>The marketing campaign of the NutriBullet claims that it can revolutionize your health. We’re not quite as certain about that, but if you look at the NutriBullet only as a personal blender, it’s amazing. And due to that, said amazement may drive you to make smoothies more&#8230; which may directly impact your health. So, there may be something to it&#8230; but it’s on you to get there.</p>
<p>Unlike other reviews, we not only took a look at the NutriBullet Pro 900 Series in isolation, but also<br />
compared it to the other high-rated blenders in order to decide it’s the best choice for most smoothie aficionados.</p>

<h2 id="standalone">The NutriBullet as a standalone</h2>
<p>Before jumping into how the NutriBullet compares, let’s first just talk about the NutriBullet inside and out. Before coming across the product, I had been using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-51101BA-Personal-Blender/dp/B00KVZ27UA/?tag=ybdnbpro-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach’s cheaper personal blender</a> for 18 months plus. It did the job, but pretty much that only. Upon opening and using the NutriBullet for the first time, I realized what I had been missing.</p>
<p>First, the helpful recipes and how-to guide NutriBullet includes immediately sparked me to order healthy accompaniments to my previously boring fruit-and-protein only mixes of the past 18 months. Without doing anything, I was inspired by the NutriBullet to make nutrient balanced smoothies that not only tasted better, but were better for me, too.</p>
<p>Next, after using the NutriBullet for the first time, I realized the next step of enjoyment &#8212; blending. The NutriBullet’s 1.2 horsepower motor tore through the ice, frozen fruit, and protein powder I included, delivering a delicious smoothie in record time.</p>

    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/NutriBullet_animated.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Once you’re done blending, the 32 ounce top is easily removable, allowing you to enjoy the bullet on the go. And when you’re done, cleaning is a cinch, too, as the blender cup and motor are separate… unlike many other blenders.</p>
<p>At just under $100, it’s a high priced blender. But it delivers similar quality to blenders two and three times its cost, such as the Vitamix S30, which <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/nutribullet-vs-vitamix/">we tested it against</a>. And after pairing it against options in the $30 range, we realized it’s worth the price jump.</p>

<p>We tested the NutriBullet Pro 900 against six other products over 40+ hours in our test of the best single-serve blenders. In doing so, it won on almost every metric tested.</p>
<p>We blended an identical list of ingredients on each blender: four ice cubes, one cup mixed frozen fruit, ¼ cup oats, ⅓ cup protein powder, seven almonds, and 1 ½ cup almond milk, and then tested the time to even blend.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1091" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-1.png" alt="blender-time" width="880" height="609" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-1.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-1-610x422.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-1-360x249.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-1-375x260.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-1-414x287.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-1-295x204.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-1-180x125.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-1-320x221.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The NutriBullet beat the group average by almost 50 seconds and the next best competitor by 18. There’s no doubt, the 900-watt NutriBullet motor gives it a significant edge in terms of processing power.</p>
<p>After that, we compared blenders across several important attributes. Ease of cleaning, cup size (if you wa a lunch, not just a snack), opening circumference (to make it easy to make shakes and not spill over your counter), and noise.</p>
<p>The NutriBullet won or broke even on pretty much all of them, showing it as a leader amongst the group as a blending option. Click the image below to see it full size.</p>

<p>If there are any faults to the NutriBullet, the warranty is one that comes up. Ideally, it would have longer than a 12 month warranty, and its expensive counterpart, the Vitamix S30, features a five-year guarantee.</p>
<p>The NutriBullet has occasionally received some negative reviews about breaking down, but after testing similar models (that also broke down), it doesn’t seem out of line with the industry standard.</p>
<p>Also, as a blender, it has great efficiency as a personal or single-serve option. However, if you’re looking for a blender that blends smoothies for your entire family, you might find the 32 ounce max lacking.</p>
<p>It also comes with a 24 ounce top as a supplement, but it doesn’t come with a big mixer you can pour out to everyone in your family of five. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-S30-Personal-Blender-Black/dp/B00JS8S2IC/?tag=ybdnbpro-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Vitamix S30 is a better option</a> in that case, offering a 40-ounce blender for bigger meals.</p>

<p>There are several great models in the sub-$30 price point, such as the <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/BLACK-DECKER-Fusionblade-Personal-Blender-Red-PB1002R/39791213" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker</a>, our pick for the best model in that range. The Black+Decker has a 275 watt motor and is definitely effective for efficient blending… so if you’re on the fence or unable to spend almost $100 on a blender, that’s a great pick.</p>
<p>The main difference between the Black+Decker and the NutriBullet is the pure power of the bullet, and also subtle improvements in cleaning ability and cup size. The Black+Decker also has a two year warranty despite a much lower price point.</p>
<p>The Black+Decker will blend your smoothies. The NutriBullet Pro 900 will blend your smoothies in seconds and inspire you to make more while doing it.</p>
<p>And as mentioned previously, you might have a large family and want more blending room out of your blender. Or you might want more features &#8212; the S30, for example, offers blending speeds and a pulse option the NutriBullet does not. You’ll most certainly need to pay more to get there, though.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a personal blender and have a couple bucks to spend, the NutriBullet Pro is a worthy investment. You’ll make more smoothies in less time, get inspired to make better ones, and overall, probably come away as a slightly healthier person.</p>
<p>If the budget’s tight and you’re confident in your own self-motivation, the Black+Decker Fusion Blade is an awesome pick, too. And if your family demands non-stop smoothies, consider the Vitamix S30 for maximum versatility and reliability.</p>
