								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent over 50 hours measuring pounds of ice, including production and melting times, capacity and taste, and selected the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B074VFTRV3/?tag=ybdice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Della &#8211; 048-GM-48186</a> as the best portable ice maker. The Della was the most efficient and user-friendly and lived up to its manufacturer’s claim of making a batch of ice in seven minutes. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GE7V1H8/?tag=ybdice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Frigidaire &#8211; EFIC108</a> earned our runner-up title for its ice-production speed and clear LED display.</p>

<p><em>(Editor&#8217;s note: In October 2019, we learned that two of the ice makers we tested had been discontinued: Ivation and ThinkGizmos. We checked the manufacturers of the other portable ice makers we reviewed, and although the Frigidaire &#8211; EFIC108 is no longer available on the company&#8217;s website, many retailers are still selling it. For this update, we tested the Hamilton Beach &#8211; 86150, the company&#8217;s latest model. See our review below.)</em></p>
<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>We began our research by familiarizing ourselves with how a portable ice maker works. We watched videos online and then turned to the subreddit /r/Frugal, which provided insight into what consumers are actually looking for in a portable ice maker.</p>
<p>Most other review sites don&#8217;t actually conduct real testing of products, so we relied heavily on Amazon reviews to determine which portable ice makers consumers considered to be the best.</p>
<p>Finally, we chose highly rated products that were also different from one another. This actually proved to be quite difficult for such a niche product, the reasons for which we discuss in the section below: “Rebranding and knock-off machines.”</p>

<h2>Why a portable ice maker?</h2>
<p>As every host knows, ice &#8212; and plenty of it &#8212; is a must-have for any party. Even if you&#8217;ve got great beverage containers like those we chose in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-insulated-tumbler/">insulated tumbler review</a> or <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/#best-insulated-water-bottle">insulated water bottle review</a>, ice is essential for keeping any drink as cold as possible. If you&#8217;re grilling outside on a hot day, the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-lunch-box/">best lunch boxes</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">coolers with the best insulation</a> will still need ice to protect uncooked food from entering the bacteria-incubating danger zone.</p>
<p>A portable ice maker makes ice over 20 times faster than a freezer, so you&#8217;ll always have it on hand and won&#8217;t have to make an ice-run in the middle of a cocktail party. If you buy ice frequently in 10-pound bags at the 7-11, then you&#8217;ll be pleased to know that a portable ice maker can make you the same amount for a fraction of the price.</p>
<h2>Countertop vs. under counter models</h2>
<h3>Portable ice maker</h3>
<p>Portable (or countertop) ice makers are about the size of a bread maker.  They plug into a standard outlet and require no drainage system or connection to a water line like under-the-counter ice makers. You simply fill them with water, select the size of ice you want and press start. They can store roughly 1 to 2 pounds at a time, depending on the size of its ice tray and how well the ice maker is insulated.</p>
<p>Portable ice makers are  less expensive than under-the-counter ice makers. They&#8217;re also quicker at producing ice, and the bullet-shaped pieces of opaque ice they make are smaller and thus melt quicker in your drink.</p>
<h3>Under-the-counter ice maker</h3>
<p>Under-the-counter ice makers, as the name implies, are installed between kitchen cabinets and need to be hooked up to a water line and a drain. They&#8217;re more expensive than portable ice makers, but they have several benefits that portable units don&#8217;t have.</p>
<p>First, you won&#8217;t need to add water, since it&#8217;s added automatically. They also produce double the amount of ice &#8212; up to 60 pounds &#8212; and the ice stays frozen longer because the under-the-counter ice makers are well insulated. This type of ice maker is ideal for an outdoor bar, an RV or a boat.</p>

<p>There are basically just a couple of models of portable ice makers that are branded under many different names.  Keep this in mind when you&#8217;re browsing on Amazon or elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Aesthetic:</strong> Although many of the shapes and functions are similar, the overall look of an ice maker is important. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N1GEX2Y/?tag=ybdice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NewAir</a> has several brightly colored models, while <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B074VFTRV3/?tag=ybdice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Della</a> has a cleaner, sleeker look that might pair better with other kitchen appliances.</p>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> Check the dimensions and weight to make sure it will fit on your countertop or whether it can be easily transported from one location to another.</p>
<p><strong>Ice production:</strong> A crucial element in a portable ice maker is how quickly ice is produced. For a cocktail party, figure about one pound per person. Our chart below shows the differences in ice produced by the models we tested.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7932" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size.png" alt="ice production chart by ice size" width="1801" height="1111" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size.png 1801w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-610x376.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-1500x925.png 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-768x474.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-885x546.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-300x185.png 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-295x182.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-1000x617.png 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-360x222.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-375x231.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-414x255.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-320x197.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-768x474@2x.png 1536w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-300x185@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><strong>Storage capacity:</strong> Storage capacity is another key component. Generally, portable ice makers produce 1.5 to 2 pounds per hour at which point, the ice tray needs to be emptied for another batch of ice can be made.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Cost definitely plays a role. Check out the energy efficiency of each ice maker to see which produces ice at the smallest cost to you (most units make ice at less than two cents per pound).</p>
<p><strong>Noise:</strong> Another thing to keep in mind, as with all machines, is how much noise it makes while making ice. Naturally, the quieter the better, and most of the models we tested were at about the same noise level.</p>
<h3>How to make ice in a portable ice maker</h3>
<p>Making ice in a portable ice maker is a simple process. Once you&#8217;ve plugged it in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the lid, remove the ice tray and fill the tank with filtered water to the “Max” line, about 8-10 cups depending on the model.</li>
<li>Put the ice tray back in, and close the lid.</li>
<li>Push the “ON” button, and select the size of ice you’d like. The default is “large,” but we found that to be the slowest for ice production.</li>
</ul>
<p>Portable ice makers have very few options beyond &#8220;on&#8221; and off&#8221; and size selections. Other LED notifications are “Add water” and “Full ice,” which will light up when it&#8217;s time to add water or empty the ice tray.</p>

<p><strong>Ice making ability:</strong> The ice makers we tested were supposed to be able to produce 26 pounds of ice per day (28 pounds for the NewAir)  We compared the actual production by adding 8 cups of water to each ice maker and timed how long it took to make both large and small ice capsules.</p>
<p>We transferred the ice to a container and let it melt completely. We then measured out the water and used its volume to calculate its weight (1 milliliter of water is equal to 1 gram). This gave us the total mass of the ice produced. So depending on the time it took to make and how much was made, we were able to calculate the amount of ice that each machine could produce in 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Insulation and temperature:</strong> We indirectly measured the insulation of each machine by how well the ice stayed frozen until the tray was full. This was a major variable, as some ice makers, like the Ivation, had insufficient isolation, and the ice began to melt before the cycle was completed.</p>
<p><strong>Storage:</strong> We tested how much water each machine could hold and how much ice it would produce. Generally the total amount of water exceeded the ice storage capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Size and portability:</strong> We measured and weighed each unit to see if they matched the manufacturer&#8217;s specs.  We also noted how easy or not it was to transport the ice maker from place to place. There actually wasn&#8217;t much difference between the units, varying by approximately 5 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Energy and sound:</strong> We checked each manufacturer&#8217;s claim of the amount of energy each ice maker actually used and also measured its noise level in decibels.</p>

<p>We measured how quickly ice was made and how long it took to fill the ice tray. We then made rudimentary calculations to compare the ice to a 10-pound bag from the supermarket.</p>

<p><strong>Melting time:</strong> The first melting measurement also took into consideration the size and thickness of the ice and the thickness of the unit&#8217;s insulation. We also timed how long one and two batches of ice took to melt in a glass with 12 ounces of water.</p>
<p><strong>Ice size and cooling speed:</strong> This test worked in tandem with the melting time as we looked at how much the temperature of the 12-ounce glass of water changed once all of the ice melted.</p>
<p><strong>Taste:</strong> This depends largely on the water used (we recommend filtered water). In some reviews consumers complained that the ice had a &#8220;taste.&#8221; We found that any off-taste was gone after a first full run and a thorough cleaning of the machine.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B074VFTRV3/?tag=ybdice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Della &#8211; 048-GM-48186 </a>is the best overall portable ice maker simply because it made the most ice the quickest and with the most consistency. The Della outperformed its competitors on both the large (26 pounds/day) and small (19 pounds/day) settings. Though the Frigidaire was a close second, averaging about a third of a pound less per day on both settings, the Della flat out won.</p>

<p>On average, ice production on the small setting yielded almost 7 pounds more per day than the large setting.  In general, the ice sizes differed only a little, but it had more to do with the amount of time the machine had been running rather than the size selected.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Della &#8211; 048-GM-48186 was the most effective and affordable portable ice maker we tested and made 26 pounds a day.</li>
<li>After seven minutes the Della produces enough ice to cool a glass of water by almost 15 degrees. After 15 minutes it can cool a 12-ounce drink to 53 °F.</li>
<li>It has a clean and simple design, easy-to-read programming and a large, clear lid for viewing the ice as it&#8217;s being made.</li>

<p>(<em>Editors note: The unit we tested by Frigidaire seems to have been discontinued, but there are multiple identical rebrands available (just different color options). We&#8217;ve updated the article to reflect this with Frigidaire&#8217;s product.</em>)</p>
<p>Coming in a very close second is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GE7V1H8/?tag=ybdice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Frigidaire &#8211; EFIC108</a>, which yielded 25.6 pounds per day on its best setting (small ice cubes), and between it large and small settings, it averaged 22.5 pounds per day overall.</p>
<p>Similar to all the ice makers we tested, the Frigidaire uses about 100 watts, occasionally spiking at 140 watts, which calculates to a production cost of only two cents per pound. Compared to the cost of a store-bought 10-pound bag of ice, the Frigidaire is 20 times less expensive to use.</p>
<p>The Frigidaire&#8217;s display was clearer than that of the Della as it used words instead of symbols. Frigidaire is available in black, red, white or brushed silver. <em>As we noted above, it&#8217;s available on Amazon and other online retailers, but it&#8217;s no longer being sold by Frigidaire.</em></p>

<p>The lid is 1.5 inches thick, which helped keep the ice cold during production. Although the ice tray holds 1.5 pounds of ice, the Frigidaire automatically shuts off when 1 pound of ice is made.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Frigidaire &#8211; EFIC108 has excellent production capacity (25.6 lb per day) and works best on the small setting.</li>
<li>The average cost of ice with the Frigidaire is about 1.3 cents per pound.</li>
<li>After about seven minutes, the first batch of ice can cool a 12-ounce beverage by 13 degrees.</li>

<p><em>For this update, we tested a new model, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P769JJG/?tag=ybdice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 86150</a>, to see how it would compare with the other ice makers we previously reviewed.</em></p>
<p>Hamilton Beach claims that this ice maker can make 28 pounds of ice per day. However, during our testing, it averaged one pound per hour, totaling approximately 24 pounds of ice.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach has a sleek stainless-steel design with black trim, and its clear, flat lid lets you see how much ice has formed. It’s also quiet: You hear just a gentle whirring of its fan, until the next batch of ice is made. The Hamilton Beach makes two sizes of hollow, bullet-shaped ice. We programmed each size separately, but we saw no difference between them. The Hamilton Beach is well insulated, so the ice doesn’t melt, and automatically stops when the tray is full (at about 1 pound).</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach wasn’t the fastest ice maker we tested, depositing 10 ice capsules every 10 minutes, so if you need ice in a pinch, you’ll need to turn the machine on at least one hour in advance. At $169, it’s a bit expensive, and although it did a good job, we still prefer our top pick, the Della for its speed and the amount of ice it can produce.</p>
<h3>NewAir &#8211; AI-100BK</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N1GEX2Y/?tag=ybdice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NewAir &#8211; AI-100BK</a> is a slightly larger unit and 4 pounds heavier than the Della and Frigidaire. Its manufacturer claims that it can produce 18 pounds of ice and has a larger ice tray, storing 2.2 pounds of ice. To our surprise, the NewAir did all that its manufacturer claimed.</p>
<p>However, depending on the size selected, there was considerable variance in how much the ice tray held before the machine automatically shut off: 2.25 pounds for large ice, 2.05 for medium ice, and 1.19 pounds for small ice. That said, the medium size was the most effective setting and produced 26 pounds per day.</p>
<p>Another downside to the NewAir is that it&#8217;s difficult to drain. Most portable ice makers drain from the bottom, but the NewAir drains from the side, so we had to tilt the machine to drain out all of the water. The white model that we tested is nearly double the price of the Frigidaire; however, the other available colors are about $100 less.</p>

<p>(<em>Editor&#8217;s note: The Ivation model that we tested has been discontinued. An upgraded model is on the Ivation website, but at present it&#8217;s unknown when it will be released.</em>)</p>
<p>The Ivation went toe-to-toe with Della in ice production and produced 23.5 pounds per day on the small setting. Its thin lid, however, reduced insulation and resulted in one-tenth of a pound melting. That said, the melted ice was simply recycled into the container and made into ice again.</p>
<h3>ThinkGizmos &#8211; Discontinued</h3>

<p>(<em>Editor&#8217;s note: ThinkGizmos has discontinued this model and is no longer selling portable ice makers.</em>)</p>
<p>Despite its high rating on Amazon, ThinkGizmos &#8211; TG22 suffered from inconsistency between its settings, both in how much the ice tray could hold and how quickly the ice was produced. Like the units we tested, the ThinkGizmos worked best when making small ice cubes even though it produced the least amount of ice (22.4 pounds per day). At the large setting, the ThinkGizmos performed the worst, producing a meager 11.2 pounds per day.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you hate making an ice run in the middle of a party, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B074VFTRV3/?tag=ybdice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Della &#8211; 048-GM-48186</a> portable ice maker is a great option. Not only will it produce 26 pounds of ice in 24 hours, the size of the ice it makes will cool any beverage down in 7 minutes.</p>
<p>Our runner-up, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GE7V1H8/?tag=ybdice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Frigidaire &#8211; EFIC108</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N1GEX2Y/?tag=ybdice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NewAir &#8211; AI-100BK</a> were both within a couple of pounds of reaching their manufacturers&#8217; claimed production of 25.6 pounds and 26 pounds per day. NewAir&#8217;s white model is nearly twice the price of the Frigidaire, and although the ice it makes is cost-efficient, we recommend looking at other colors for this model, which are substantially less expensive.<br />

<p>As I checked out of Trader Joe&#8217;s with 30+ bottles of wine and told the checkout staff about the plan to test out automatic wine openers, he quickly questioned me back &#8212; “I don’t get why people use electric wine openers. The traditional corkscrew works just fine.”</p>
<p>He had a point&#8230; the traditional corkscrew <i>does</i> work just fine, but it specifically works fine for a certain set of people. Not everyone wants to use a corkscrew, or will be consistently successful at using one.</p>
<p>For example, I’m pretty goofy. Coordination has never been my strong suit. I had, with frequency, suffered from open-failure with a corkscrew. The cork broke, I got cork in the wine, or we couldn’t get the cork out, period.</p>
<p>It wasn’t every time out, but it was enough to be frustrated. After a bottle or two, the success rate would very frequently get worse.</p>
<p>Due to this frustration, I got to the point where I put my pride aside and asked my wife to open the wine for us most of the time. As you might imagine, it wasn’t a great feeling.</p>
<p>Enter electric wine openers. I basically lucked into buying my wife the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YFI0O6/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oster</a> for Christmas, and it turned into a gift for me. I was never going back.</p>
<p>The electric wine opener isn’t for everybody. It’s not as pinky-in-the-air elegant as a corkscrew. You won’t find one at a five star restaurant. You’re probably not going to impress your date with it. And <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/RRFPHKP0PP0JQ/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">according to some reports</a>, you might not want to trust them with fancier bottles of wine.</p>
<p>But if you’re simple, don’t raise your nose when drinking a bottle of wine, and prefer function over elegance, electric wine bottle openers are a great fit for you.</p>
<p>In addition, a great additional benefit of automatic wine openers is that they’re far superior to corkscrews if you have arthritis or another disability. You might have always loved the corkscrew, and that’s okay, but you’re starting to feel some discomfort in your hands and are looking for another option. Electric wine openers can offer some relief.</p>
<h2 id="trust">Why you should trust us</h2>
<p>As I mentioned above, I’ve been using an electric wine opener for a year and a half, and have opened an estimated 300+ bottles using them. I pretty much fit the stereotype of the ideal user &#8212; love wine (but not in a need to buy a $200 bottle kind of way), am a bit uncoordinated, and prefer function over elegance&#8230; but without sacrificing quality.</p>
<p>I spent 40+ total hours researching electric wine openers, asking other experts and crowd-sourcing amongst users of Reddit. Unfortunately, the /r/wine/ subreddit wasn’t very helpful, so I took to Google and Amazon to compare and contrast the reviews and feedback on many of these openers.</p>
<p>This led me to compare ~20 units until I narrowed down my options to a final five, including the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Oster-FPSTBW8207-S-Electric-Bottle-Opener/dp/B003YFI0O6/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oster</a>, which was the highest rated on Amazon and the product I already owned, and had been using with frequency.</p>
<h2 id="the-five-best">Compare the best electric wine openers</h2>
[table id=7 /]
<h2 id="test">How we tested</h2>
<p>First, we broke the wine openers into several judging categories and areas of value: battery life, foil/top cutter, product quality, and of course, ease of opening the wine.</p>
<p>Battery duration has a few positive benefits. First, having used one of these for a year &#8212; and drinking several dozen bottles of wine/being a disorganized person, there were several unfortunate scenarios where I forgot to place the opener on the charger, which led to a dead opener in times of need.</p>
<p>Second, electric wine openers have value for commercial applications, such as catering, so if that’s you, you probably don’t want an opener that dies after a few opens. So, battery life can be important.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, cold testing these on actual wine from start to end would have been pretty tough to do without spending thousands of dollars, so we did the best next thing and ran the battery from full to end, gave it a full 24 hours to charge, and then did so again three times in order to create an average.</p>

<p>Overall, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FPSTBW8207-S-Electric-Bottle-Opener-Silver/dp/B003YFI0O6/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oster</a> led the pack by a considerable margin, with an average battery life of 53:52. The Pyora, Wine Enthusiast and Secura models ran in a similar 40+ range, with Ozeri at the back of the pack with a 25:49 average. If you need the opener for commercial applications, the Oster is your best bet.</p>
<p>If you need an opener for everyday use, it&#8217;s possible battery life will never come into play if you&#8217;re consistent &#8212; and the top four models will make that especially certain. If you even forget once, it&#8217;s possible the Ozeri&#8217;s battery life may come back to bite you, but it has other positive features to make up for that as well.</p>
<p>After the battery test, we used each opener on six different bottles of wine, all of different varietals, simply to see if there was any variation based on the type of bottle we opened, and also to get a significant sample size with each bottle in order to get a true impression.</p>
<p>When cutting, we judged overall build quality and simplicity. When opening, we judged ease, consistency, and also the hold firmness required to open the bottle &#8212; a characteristic that could make a big difference for those with a disability or arthritis.</p>
<p>Across the six bottles, if the open went flawlessly and didn’t require a strong grip on the base or the top, it was judged as “good”.</p>
<p>If the open went flawlessly but required a strong grip, or if it didn’t require a strong grip but had something strange happen (such as a readjustment or strange sound, signifying bad build quality) it was judged as “fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the open went poorly/didn’t happen at all, or something else erroneous happened, it was judged as “bad.&#8221; Fortunately, this only happened once with the Secura, which shockingly had the bottom partially crack on the very first open!</p>

<p>Overall, the Pyora, Ozeri and Wine Enthusiast models performed best in our test opens. They each required little pressure to operate, had predictable results, and had no real problems from start to finish. The Oster and Secura, on the other hand, required additional strong pressure to operate with consistency.</p>
<p>One thing that also quickly became apparent in the testing was the superiority of the transparent bottom design. Transparency made it easy to predict where in the opening process you were, while the closed base of the Oster resulted in more unpredictable and occasionally failed opens. If coordination isn&#8217;t your thing, the transparent base automatically puts the other four models ahead of the Oster.</p>

<p>The foil/top cutter was a small detail that most of the wine openers did well, since the act of creating a circular blade that could cut out the top of the wine was pretty straightforward. However, there were subtle differences that made some cutters more preferable than others.</p>
<p>The Ozeri wine opener, the cheapest of the lot, reflected the price, as its foil cutter felt cheap and had a confusing design. To cut open a bottle of wine, you have to “clamp” the sides of the opener in order to express pressure on the bottle. However, this same clamp, attached to the top of the opener, feels as if it’s the function that actually allows you to remove the foil cutter from the base.</p>
<p>In actuality, all you have to do is turn the cutter right in order to remove the top. For experienced or frequent owners, this will frequently become obvious, but for first-time users or guests in your home it could become irritating.</p>
<p>Otherwise, upon evaluating other cutters it became obvious the transparent cutters were the most valuable. Non-transparent cutters make you guess/predict the exact moment you’ve made it to 360, often causing incorrect guesses or second tries. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01261VEOG/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secura</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wine-Enthusiast-Electric-Push-Button-Corkscrew/dp/B002EOHXFK/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wine Enthusiast</a> models offer transparent cutters, which made them the most attractive of the lot.</p>
<p>Overall, the marginal improvement of a slightly better cutter should not make or break your electric wine opener decision. However, it is a product difference that we noticed amongst the different versions, and can indicate a slightly better opener.</p>
<h2 id="overall">Best overall: Wine Enthusiast</h2>

<p>In terms of overall performance, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wine-Enthusiast-Electric-Push-Button-Corkscrew/dp/B002EOHXFK/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wine Enthusiast</a> led the pack. Wine Enthusiast’s model was one of the three that had the easiest-to-use transparent design&#8230; the see through end removed any guesswork when removing your cork.</p>
<p>The highest rated model on Amazon, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FPSTBW8207-S-Electric-Bottle-Opener-Silver/dp/B003YFI0O6/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oster</a>, had a covered end that resulted in guesswork, unnecessary pressure, and sometimes, failed attempts when removing the cork.</p>

<p>After purchasing, we also realized Wine Enthusiast offered a version of the same model with the best foil cutter style we tested, a transparent one. Transparency here, just like the base, removes the guesswork of non-transparent cutters and will guarantee you aren’t left fumbling with second and third attempts at removing the foil.</p>
<p>The blue light emanating from the base when plugged in also makes for a nice, subtle nightlight the next time you need to fumble through the kitchen for a late night snack.</p>
<p>And while the battery life didn’t outshine any competitors, it was right on par, making it, along with Wine Enthusiast’s strong reputation for quality product design, big influences in our decision to crown Wine Enthusiast&#8217;s model the best overall wine opener.</p>
<h2 id="easiest">Easiest to operate: Ozeri &#8211; Nouveaux</h2>

<p>By far, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ozeri-Nouveaux-Electric-Removable-Elegant/dp/B002YENQ4M/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ozeri &#8211; Nouveaux</a> was the easiest, loosest grip wine opener we tested, which came as a surprise for the lowest-price product of the bunch. However, its high rating shined through, making it a great pick for anyone with arthritis or any other issues preventing them from using a corkscrew or applying a lot of pressure to the bottle.</p>
<p>Other options, while feeling more elegant/high-end, required a lot of pressure, both from the top and the bottom, in order to remove the cork. The Ozeri required some pressure, but still very little, a pleasant surprise for a product on the lowest price end of the models we tested.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YENQ4M/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ozeri-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ozeri-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ozeri-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ozeri-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ozeri-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ozeri-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ozeri-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ozeri-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ozeri.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Easiest to Use: Ozeri - Nouveaux</h3><p>Despite the low cost, the Ozeri required very little pressure to open most wine bottles.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YENQ4M/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>On the negative side, it should still be understood that the Ozeri had the worst battery (so keep it plugged in), and also, the overall stability/product quality made it feel like it could have a short shelf life. It’s also not a product that will visually exude premium to house guests.</p>
<p>However, given the ease of cork removal and overall quality of what it’s tasked to do &#8212; open your wine, it’s a great option for those with arthritic issues or anything else that may require high pressure on their bottles.</p>
<h3 id="budget">Also our budget pick</h3>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t have arthritis, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YENQ4M/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ozeri</a> is a high-quality product that should find its way onto any budget-conscious shelf.</p>
<p>If you like to drink wine but don’t care about sticking your pinky in the air or the need to impress guests, the Ozeri is a great option for your repertoire. It’ll open wine with ease and offer exceeding value over its price point.</p>
<p>The only negative to the model is its battery life, so if you open two or more bottles, make sure you remember to plug it back in.</p>

<p>It’s not perfect or elegant due to the high pressure it requires on the top and bottom to remove many corks, but it gets the job done. Since neither the cutter nor the bottom of the opener is transparent, you’ll have to guess at timing as well.</p>
<p>Despite this, it’s a great fit for high-turnover environments, such as catering, where you may need to open dozens upon dozens of bottles in one evening &#8212; and also don’t want the wine opener to die out. And if you’re opening enough bottles, there’s no doubt the frequency of your opens will make the cutter and timing issues almost nill.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-760 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EWO_Secura01_web.jpg" alt="EWO_Secura01_web" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EWO_Secura01_web.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EWO_Secura01_web-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EWO_Secura01_web-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EWO_Secura01_web-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EWO_Secura01_web-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EWO_Secura01_web-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EWO_Secura01_web-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EWO_Secura01_web-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EWO_Secura01_web-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EWO_Secura01_web-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01261VEOG/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secura</a> felt like a poor man’s version of the Oster. On our first try, the base slightly frayed, which was shocking. From there, a few of the openings made slight “crack” sounds that made me wonder about the long-term viability of this product.</p>
<p>In addition, the Secura needed more hand-grip overall in order to keep it tightly in place and remove the cork from the base. Two of the tests resulted in the wine bottle moving despite a fairly strongly grip.</p>
<p>On the positive side, the Secura’s transparent cutter that made foil removal easy was the best option of the bunch, but as mentioned, it’s the least important feature of wine openers. It did, however, illuminate that our pick for best overall, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002EOHXFK/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wine Enthusiast</a>, also had a transparent cutter option of the same opener available.</p>
<h3 id="gifting">Pyora</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-761 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EWO_Pyora_GIFTSET_web.jpg" alt="EWO_Pyora_GIFTSET_web" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EWO_Pyora_GIFTSET_web.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EWO_Pyora_GIFTSET_web-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EWO_Pyora_GIFTSET_web-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EWO_Pyora_GIFTSET_web-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EWO_Pyora_GIFTSET_web-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EWO_Pyora_GIFTSET_web-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EWO_Pyora_GIFTSET_web-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EWO_Pyora_GIFTSET_web-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EWO_Pyora_GIFTSET_web-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EWO_Pyora_GIFTSET_web-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the Pyora electric opener was right on par with the Oster in terms of consistency, performance and battery life, but its main drawback was the need to buy it as part of a set. Pyora has since discontinued this set.</p>
<h2 id="future">What we’ll test in the future</h2>
<p>Although 18 months of testing has already been done on the Oster, it became clear that wasn’t the best long-term model to evaluate.</p>
<p>The cheaper <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YENQ4M/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ozeri</a> identified itself as a leader in the pack with some questions about durability&#8230; if it can keep up with other models, it’s possible it can pass Wine Enthusiast’s opener and take the number one slot.</p>

<h2 id="why-we-are-qualified">Why trust us?</h2>
<p>Everyone loves popcorn, and we wanted to figure out which popcorn maker would allow us to make the most delicious popcorn possible. We also wanted to know whether we needed a popcorn maker, or whether microwavable bags of popcorn would suffice.</p>
<p>We spent three weeks of research and testing in our office to determine which popcorn makers were the best on the market. We also found that making popcorn yourself is preferred compared to using microwavable bags of popcorn for a number of reasons, including several health-related concerns.</p>
<p>After speaking with <a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/tob/general/staff/morgan/index.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Morgan of the Respiratory Toxicology Group at the National Health Institute</a>, we determined that microwave popcorn bags pose too many questions regarding health risks for us to confidently recommend them to others.</p>
<p>That left us with popcorn makers.</p>
<p>When testing popcorn makers, we took several considerations into account. These included: build quality and materials used, cost, ease of setup and cleanup, taste and quality of popcorn, and how many kernels went unpopped or were burned during cooking.</p>
<p>We also conducted taste-testing in our office to make sure the popcorn would be enjoyed by the typical popcorn lover.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-found">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Before conducting the research for this article, our experience with popcorn was mostly limited to movie theaters and microwave bags. In order to become experts on the subject, we read through dozens of consumer reports, articles, forums, and Reddit threads on r/popcorn to determine what people are looking for in their popcorn makers:</p>
<p>We found that, overall, popcorn lovers want:</p>
<ul>
<li>Popcorn that is fluffy and crunchy</li>
<li>As few burned and unpopped kernels as possible</li>
<li>A popcorn maker that is easy to set up and easy to clean</li>
<li>Flexibility in the additional ingredients (salt, oil, other toppings) that can be used</li>
<li>Making quality popcorn as fast as possible</li>
<li>Flexibility on the minimum and maximum amount of popcorn that can be made at one time</li>
</ul>
<p>We used those metrics to narrow our list of prospects. From there, we dug deeper into each of the prospects until we had a list of six finalists, which we ordered on Amazon so we could test them in-house.</p>
<p>Each of our six finalists were put through extensive testing in order to determine which popcorn maker was built best, and provided the best popcorn quality.</p>

<h2 id="health-risks">Are microwavable popcorn bags health risks?</h2>
<p>Several years ago, there was a lot of controversy surrounding the fact that the chemical diacetyl was used in microwavable bags of popcorn. This chemical, which artificially creates a buttery flavor, was linked to health problems — including the sometimes-fatal disease <i>obstructive bronchiolitis</i>, also known as “popcorn lung”.</p>
<p>We were shocked to find out that something so seemingly innocuous and innocent — namely, enjoying a bag of microwaved popcorn — could have such a potentially devastating impact on our health. We wanted to get to the bottom of the situation, so we searched for the most trusted experts in the field.</p>
<p>We were fortunate to get the opportunity to conduct an interview with <a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/tob/general/staff/morgan/index.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Daniel Morgan</a>, who has been an Inhalation Toxicologist at the National Institute of Health for more than 30 years, and is now the head of the Respiratory Toxicology Group within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>Dr. Morgan has researched and written extensively about this subject, and is widely regarded to be one of the leading experts.</p>
<p>Dr. Morgan explained to us that the vast majority of diacetyl-related incidents occurred to workers in the factories where microwave popcorn is produced. There were also a few incidents for consumers as well, however those were largely limited to individuals with substantially greater exposure than the typical consumer.</p>
<p>One example was a man who ate <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/09/popcorn-lung-lawsuit-nets-7-2m-award/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two bags of microwave popcorn</a> <i>every day</i>, and who took deep inhalations of the steam (so he could enjoy the buttery artificial smell). He ultimately developed “popcorn lung”, and was awarded a multi-million dollar judgement following a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Ultimately, diacetyl was removed by <i>most</i> brands of microwavable popcorn bags by 2007. However, according to Dr. Morgan, there are still other concerns surrounding the chemicals and materials used within the bags.</p>
<p>One example is the fact that diacetyl “trimers” are still used by some brands. These trimers, which are chemical compounds that aren’t technically diacetyl, actually become diacetyl when the popcorn is heated and comes in contact with steam.</p>
<p>Another disconcerting element in microwave bags is the use of Perfloroocatanoic acid, otherwise known as “p-foa”, which is used to line the bag and prevent water and oil from seeping into it. Unfortunately, those chemicals can break down into the contents of the bag during microwaving.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Dr. Morgan says that consumers don’t really have much to worry about (unless they’re eating two bags of microwave popcorn a day and are deeply inhaling the steam). Nevertheless, you can avoid <i>all</i> of these unsettling chemicals simply by using a popcorn maker!</p>

<p>For a product like a popcorn maker, determining what to look for is fairly straightforward.</p>
<h3>Crisp popcorn that pops and doesn’t burn</h3>
<p>The most important consideration is whether or not the popcorn maker can consistently make high-quality popcorn that is crisp, does not burn, and leaves few to no kernels unpopped.</p>
<h3>Taste</h3>
<p>Taste is of course another consideration, however this metric is highly subjective. In addition, there are countless ways to prepare popcorn, from basic air popping (healthy but not the most flavorful), to oil and butter-drenched popcorn drizzled with chocolate and caramel.</p>
<h3>Type of popcorn</h3>
<p>When choosing a popcorn maker, first ask yourself what type of popcorn you want to make. By figuring this out first, you can narrow down the popcorn makers you’re considering to only the ones capable of making your preferred type(s) of popcorn.</p>
<h3>Build materials</h3>
<p>It’s also important to make sure that a popcorn maker is built from high-quality materials that will last for many years. Getting a “good deal” on a popcorn maker that breaks after 6 months isn’t a good deal at all — and you’ll end up spending far more than you would have had you purchased a high-quality popcorn maker instead.</p>
<h3>BPA free</h3>
<p>A high-quality popcorn maker should also be free of Bisphenol A, which is more commonly known as BPA. BPA is a synthetic compound that has been used in the creation of plastics since the 1960s. However, in recent years <a href="http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ucm064437.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BPA has been found to cause significant health problems</a>, and many (but not all) companies are quickly moving away from using it in their products.</p>
<p>Finding a popcorn maker without BPA is even more important when you consider the fact that your popcorn maker will be exposed to considerable heat every single time that it is used.</p>
<h3>Easy setup and cleanup</h3>
<p>A good popcorn maker should also be easy to set up and clean, and should include clear instructions that assist in that process. A nice (but certainly not essential) bonus is an instruction manual which includes recipe suggestions and/or tips for making the best popcorn possible.</p>
<h3>Maximum capacity</h3>
<p>Finally, make sure to look at the maximum capacity of each popcorn maker. If you only plan on making popcorn for you and one other person, this might not be much of a factor. However, if you are planning to use your popcorn maker with your friends and family, choosing a high-capacity popcorn maker could be worthwhile investment.</p>
<h3>What to consider after purchasing a popcorn maker</h3>
<p>After ordering a popcorn maker, you should verify that the build quality is high, and also make sure that all of the pieces are in good working order. This should be done right away, so that you are eligible for a return or replacement while under the manufacturer&#8217;s warranty or return period.</p>
<p>The first few times that you use your new popcorn maker, be sure to take a look at how many kernels are burned, and how many are left unpopped. Every popcorn maker will produce a few burned or unpopped kernels, however if there appears to be an excessive amount, it’s likely that you have a defective product and should return or replace it while still under warranty.</p>
<h2 id="why-popcorn-makers">Cost savings of popcorn makers</h2>
<p>While the potential health concerns are reason enough to avoid microwave bags of popcorn, there’s another reason to choose popcorn poppers instead of microwave bags: <i>saving money</i>.</p>
<p>We did the math, and it turns out that using a popcorn maker saves between 22.25 precent and 48.48 percent over microwave bags of popcorn — depending on how you prepare your popcorn (with or without oil).</p>
<h3>Popcorn math</h3>
<p>For those of you who don’t love math, you might want to just take our word for it that making your own popcorn is much cheaper than buying microwavable bags and skip to the next section. For those who want us to show our work, read on!</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007WI0O2M/?tag=ybdpopc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">28-pack of Pop-Secret popcorn</a> is typically $24.99 on Amazon. There are an estimated 79 servings of two tablespoons in the box, which comes out to 158 tablespoons for $24.99, or <b>$0.158 per tablespoon</b>.</p>
<p>A five pound, 12 oz jug of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0098IOL2S/?tag=ybdpopc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">popcorn kernels from Orville Redenbacher</a> costs $15.89 on Amazon, and contains 195 tablespoons of unpopped popcorn kernels. This comes out to <b>$0.0815 per tablespoon</b>.</p>
<p>This comes out to a savings of 7.67 cents per tablespoon, or 48.48%.</p>
<h3>What about oil?</h3>
<p>For those who want to add oil to their popcorn, don’t worry! You’ll still save money over a microwave bag of popcorn.</p>
<p>You can purchase about 252 tablespoons (about four quarts) of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007F1KVX8/?tag=ybdpopc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wesson oil</a> for $18.47 on Amazon. According to several recipes online, we determined that the ratio of unpopped popcorn kernels to oil should be 5.33 tablespoons to three tablespoons, or 0.56253 tablespoons of oil per tablespoon of kernels.</p>
<p>This adds a cost of $0.04151 to each tablespoon of popcorn kernels, bringing the total to $0.123 per tablespoon of popcorn with oil added. This also means there is a savings of 3.52 cents, or 22.25% over the cost of an equal amount of microwave bag popcorn.</p>
<p>One other way of looking at this is by comparing the cost of a bag of Pop Secret popcorn with the equivalent amount of popcorn from a popcorn maker:</p>
<p>A Pop Secret bag, with an average of 5.643 tablespoons of unpopped kernels, costs $0.90. The same amount of popcorn from a popcorn maker would cost $0.46 without oil, and $0.69 with oil.</p>
<h3>What about the cost of the popcorn maker?</h3>
<p>Of course, there is also the one-time cost associated with purchasing a popcorn maker. Our best pick, the Lékué Popcorn Popper, costs $18.90 at the time this post is published.</p>
<p>At six tablespoons of unpopped popcorn per bowl, we calculated that the Lékué would pay for itself after 44 bowls of oil-free popcorn, or after 103 bowls of popcorn with oil.</p>
<p>While this might seem like a lot, keep in mind that the Lékué has a 10 year manufacturer’s warranty, which means after those initial 44 or 103 bowls of popcorn, the Lékué will preserve both your money <i>and</i> your health for years to come.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-popcorn-makers">The different types of popcorn makers</h2>
<p>There are lots of different ways to make popcorn that don’t involve an unhealthy bag of microwave popcorn. In our testing, our finalists consisted of three types of popcorn makers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microwave popcorn poppers</li>
<li>Hot air popcorn poppers</li>
<li>Electric popcorn poppers</li>
</ul>
<p>All of them will do the job, and each have their own sets of strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<h3>Microwave popcorn popper</h3>
<p>Microwave popcorn poppers offer much of the convenience of microwave popcorn bags, but without the health risks. Since each unpopped kernel of popcorn has moisture locked inside, the microwave — which heats food by energizing water molecules — is well-suited to the task of making popcorn.</p>
<p>Microwave poppers like the Lékué are able to make popcorn either with or without oil, and salt or other flavorings can be added before or after popping the corn.</p>
<p>There aren’t many downsides to a microwave popper, as long as there is a microwave nearby. Microwave poppers also have a tendency to dry out popcorn — particularly if the microwave is set for too long — so microwave popcorn poppers require a little more attention and precision than a hot-air popcorn popper or an electric popcorn popper.</p>
<h3>Hot-air popcorn popper</h3>
<p>Hot-air popcorn poppers make popcorn without the use of any oil, and are great for producing fluffy, crisp popcorn kernels quickly and without any mess.</p>
<p>On the other hand, hot-air popcorn makers are limited in the types of popcorn they can produce. Oil is not an option, and it is difficult to get salt or other flavors to stick to the popcorn after it is popped.</p>
<h3>Electric/stovetop popcorn poppers</h3>
<p>Electric and stovetop popcorn poppers use oil and metal stirrers to heat popcorn kernels evenly, and they offer the greatest versatility in terms of adding butter and other flavorings.</p>
<p>However, electric popcorn poppers <i>require</i> the use of oil, so if you want to make popcorn that is oil-free (or even if you just want to go light on the oil) then an electric popcorn popper is not for you.</p>
<p>That said, if you are interested in making a flavor-packed snack and aren’t that concerned with counting calories, electric and stovetop popcorn poppers are an option worth looking into.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Popcorn makers are one of the more difficult product categories to test, because the most important metric — how the popcorn tastes — is largely subjective, and based on whether someone wants a healthy snack or a buttery, savory treat.</p>
<p>That being said, we were able to combine some quantifiable metrics, along with subjective taste testing to come up with what we believe is the best popcorn popper available.</p>
<p>The metrics we tested include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build quality</li>
<li>BPA free</li>
<li>Length of time until popping is finished</li>
<li>Percentage of kernels unpopped</li>
<li>Percentage of burned kernels</li>
</ul>

<p>We also used qualitative measurements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taste</li>
<li>Consistency</li>
<li>Ease of use</li>
</ul>
<p>We combined all of this information to come up with our best picks.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NF9CT0C/?tag=ybdpopc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lékué &#8211; Microwave Popcorn Popper</a> stood out to us because of its simple and innovative design, high build-quality, and versatility in the types of popcorn it can make — all of which comes at an affordable price point.</p>
<p>Made from high-quality silicone and completely BPA-free, the Lékué can make up to about a quart of popped corn at a time (about ⅓ of a cup unpopped), and can be cooked with or without oil.</p>
<p>The Lékué Popper is also dishwasher safe, making it far easier to clean, and the high-quality silicone should last for many years and thousands of bowls of popcorn.</p>
<p>One aspect of the the Lékué Popcorn Popper that really stood out to us during testing was the attention to detail the manufacturers used. The collapsible design of the Lékué is ideal for those with limited space, such as students or those living in an apartment.</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/lekue-collapse.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>However, even if you have a house with a large kitchen, the two inch collapsed height of this popcorn popper makes it easy to stick in a drawer when it’s not in use.</p>
<p>The Lékué also has measurements built into the popper itself, so you don’t even need a measuring cup when putting oil or unpopped kernels into the popper.</p>
<p>While the design of the Lékué is certainly important, what really matters is the quality of the popcorn it produces. Here again, the Lékué outshines the competition. In addition to completely popping the kernels in just over 2 and a half minutes, the Lékué consistently averaged only 10 unpopped kernels, while leaving little to no burnt kernels in the bowl.</p>

<p>Setup and cleanup is notably simple as well. Setup is as easy as putting the popcorn kernels (and optional oil) into the bowl, adding salt or spices if desired, and placing it in the microwave.</p>

<p>Cleanup can be done using hot water and soap, or the Lékué can simply be placed into the dishwasher. If you are only making one batch of popcorn, the Lékué also functions as a bowl — saving you from one extra dish to clean!</p>
<p>Finally, the manufacturers clearly stand by their product, which is why Lékué offers an industry-leading 10 year warranty on their popcorn popper.</p>
<p>The only real downside to the Lékué is the limited amount of popcorn that can be made at one time. The popcorn popper is among the smaller products we tested, and is limited to about one-third of a cup of unpopped kernels — which translates to about a quart of popped corn. Fortunately, the quick popping time means you can make multiple batches in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the fantastic build quality, innovative design, and quality of popcorn produced makes the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NF9CT0C/?tag=ybdpopc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lékué</a> our best pick for popcorn makers.</p>
<h2 id="most-fun-pick">Runner-up: West Bend &#8211; Stir Crazy</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/west-bend-popper.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004RC6R/?tag=ybdpopc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">West Bend &#8211; Stir Crazy Popcorn Maker</a> is the most fun of the popcorn makers we tested. It is lightweight (about four pounds), made from high-quality materials and is easy to use. The manual is very easy to follow, and even includes recipes, hints and tips for making the best bowl of popcorn possible.</p>
<p>The West Bend Popcorn Maker is made up of three primary components: The base, the cover and the cap.</p>
<p>The base is where the action happens. Popcorn is placed onto the surface in between the two metal stirrers which keep the kernels moving around and heating evenly.</p>
<p>The cover is made from transparent plastic, which allowed us to watch the popcorn as it was being popped. The top of the cover has an indented section with small holes in it, which can be used as a “butter well” for those who wish to melt butter onto their popcorn.</p>
<p>The cover can also be used as a popcorn bowl. Its large size makes it ideal for sharing popcorn with four to six people. However, if you’re planning on making more than one bowl, this isn’t an option. On the other hand, if you are just making one bowl, you won’t have an extra dish to clean when you’re finished.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a cap, which turns the top of the cover (which has butter well-holes in it) into an actual bowl that won’t leak all over your lap.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004RC6R/?tag=ybdpopc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-532" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/west-bend.jpg" alt="west-bend" width="800" height="530" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/west-bend.jpg 800w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/west-bend-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/west-bend-180x119@2x.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/west-bend-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/west-bend-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/west-bend-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/west-bend-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/west-bend-320x212.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/west-bend-295x195@2x.jpg 590w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></a></p>
<p>One of the most noteworthy features of the West Bend Stir Crazy popper is the fact that there is a considerable amount of time between the popcorn being mostly (or entirely) popped and the popcorn starting to burn.</p>
<p>This is beneficial for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don’t have to rush to turn the popper off.</li>
<li>You can get most if not all of the kernels to pop before turning the popper off.</li>
<li>It is much less likely that you’ll have burned popcorn in your bowl.</li>
</ul>
<p>The metal stirrers in the West Bend popper keep the kernels — both popped and unpopped — moving around, which helps evenly distribute the heat, and contributes significantly to the leeway between the popcorn popping and starting to burn.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004RC6R/?tag=ybdpopc-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/west-bend-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/west-bend-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/west-bend-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/west-bend-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/west-bend-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/west-bend-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/west-bend-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/west-bend-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/west-bend.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Great Fun: West Bend - Stir Crazy Popcorn Maker</h3><p>Although a little more expensive, it's ideal if you're looking to enjoy some popcorn and also entertain your guests.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004RC6R/?tag=ybdpopc-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>We also found that popcorn, oil, and anything else left on the base didn’t stick too badly. Even when we left the West Bend uncleaned overnight, a quick brush with a damp paper towel was all it took to clean the base off.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s worth noting that the West Bend &#8211; Stir Crazy can pop one cup of unpopped kernels at a time, or about six quarts popped — this is ideal anytime you are sharing your popcorn with three or four other people. On top of that, we averaged only four unpopped kernels!</p>
<h3>What we didn’t like about the West Bend &#8211; Stir Crazy</h3>
<p>Although there were a lot of things we liked about the West Bend Stir Crazy popcorn popper, there were some serious issues with it as well.</p>
<p>First off, flipping the popper upside-down (turning the cover into a bowl) is a dicey proposition. After popping, <i>everything</i> except the small handles are hot. We strongly recommend using oven mitts during this process so you don’t burn your hands like we did!</p>
<p>We also found that the West Bend would sometimes make sounds when popping corn. At first, we thought that these scratching/screeching sounds meant that the popper was breaking. However after using it several times, it seems that the metal stirrers just make that noise sometimes.</p>
<p>In addition, unlike our top pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NF9CT0C/?tag=ybdpopc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lékué</a>, you <i>must</i> use oil when popping corn in the West Bend popper. Without oil, the popcorn simply will not pop — but it will burn!</p>
<p>While this isn’t a problem for those who only plan to pop their corn with oil, it does take the West Bend out of contention for those who sometimes (or always) want to cook their popcorn without oil.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that the West Bend took longer than the Lékué to pop. On average, it took five minutes and 25 seconds for the West Bend to finish popping — nearly three minutes longer than the Lékué!</p>
<p>Finally, the bowl is somewhat challenging to clean up. While removing oil and leftovers from the base is fairly easy, the plastic bowl requires some hot water, soap, and a bit of effort.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004RC6R/?tag=ybdpopc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">West Bend &#8211; Stir Crazy</a> is an excellent option for those who are only looking to pop their corn with oil, and are willing to overlook the ergonomic challenges posed by this particular popcorn maker.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004SU35/?tag=ybdpopc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wabash Valley Farms &#8211; Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper</a> is a classic product, which is why we wanted to test it ourselves. While the this popper does make tasty popcorn, ultimately you are better off with one of our two top picks.</p>
<p>The biggest downside of the Whirley-Pop is also its charm. Namely, the fact that you have to manually stir the handle for several minutes while the popcorn pops. While this might be fun to do the first few times, ultimately it is simply a less effective and less flexible way to make your popcorn.</p>
<h3>Presto &#8211; PopLite Air Popper</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-534" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/presto-air-popper.jpg" alt="presto-air-popper" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/presto-air-popper.jpg 800w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/presto-air-popper-610x406.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/presto-air-popper-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/presto-air-popper-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/presto-air-popper-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/presto-air-popper-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/presto-air-popper-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/presto-air-popper-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/presto-air-popper-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IUWA/?tag=ybdpopc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Presto &#8211; PopLite</a> was the only finalist we tested that was an air popper. While there are benefits associated with using an air popper (not needing oil, ability to quickly make multiple batches of popcorn in succession), there were issues with the Presto PopLite Air Popper that we felt outweighed thought benefits.</p>
<p>The biggest issue we had with the Presto popper was the fact that it came with a California Proposition 65 warning, due to the BPA that that Presto popper is made with.</p>
<p>Less critical, but still noteworthy was the fact that the Presto PopLite shoots the popped kernels in a pretty wide spread, which meant that we needed a large bowl to capture the popped kernels — and even then a couple managed to escape the bowl.</p>
<p>In addition, this popper became <i>very</i> hot while in use. Not only did the components heat up, but the air about a foot in front of the popper was distinctly hot as well.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if you want popcorn without oil, the Lékué microwave popper works better, and is safer as well.</p>
<h3>Great Northern Popcorn &#8211; Table Top Retro-Style</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-536" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bambino2.jpg" alt="bambino2" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bambino2.jpg 800w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bambino2-610x406.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bambino2-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bambino2-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bambino2-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bambino2-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bambino2-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bambino2-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bambino2-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We had high hopes for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002Y4ZG7W/?tag=ybdpopc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Great Northern Popcorn &#8211; Table Top Retro-Style</a>. In addition to being the most expensive popcorn maker we tested, the Great Northern Popcorn Popper is designed like the classic kettle-style popcorn makers you’ve seen in movie theaters since you were a kid.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this product simply didn’t hold up to our expectations.</p>
<p>The first negative sign came when we opened the box and a strange, borderline foul odor came from the materials inside. Next, it took three of us nearly 20 minutes to figure out how to actually set up the popper. The instructions aren’t very informative, and putting the actual kettle into the popcorn maker was more complicated than we expected.</p>
<p>Cleanup was challenging as well, as there are many different components (a few of which are very hot for several minutes after making popcorn) that need to be removed and cleaned individually — and aren’t dishwasher safe.</p>
<p>The design itself is also lacking. The most notable example of this is in the design of the lid, which was knocked down by the rotor six times during our first three minutes of “preheat” time. You could just let it stay closed, but the user manual specifically instructs against that.</p>
<p>The popcorn from the Great Northern popper was tasty, but both of our best picks can do the same, with much less hassle and much less expense.</p>
<h3>Presto &#8211; PowerPop</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-537" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/presto-microwave-popper.jpg" alt="presto-microwave-popper" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/presto-microwave-popper.jpg 800w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/presto-microwave-popper-610x406.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/presto-microwave-popper-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/presto-microwave-popper-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/presto-microwave-popper-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/presto-microwave-popper-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/presto-microwave-popper-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/presto-microwave-popper-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/presto-microwave-popper-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005IBXK/?tag=ybdpopc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Presto &#8211; PowerPop</a> was an interesting product to test. The PowerPop uses special “power concentrator” disks which are placed on the bottom of the popper. Presumably, they help distribute the heat so that the there are fewer unpopped kernels.</p>
<p>The obvious downside to this is that these power concentrators need to be replaced after several uses, and while they are inexpensive, it is a hassle (and an additional expense) that other popcorn makers simply do not have.</p>
<p>The power concentrators would be an acceptable compromise, however, if the Presto PowerPop did in fact leave little to no kernels unpopped. Unfortunately, the PowerPop did worse than all of our other finalists.</p>
<p>To ensure that this was accurate, we conducted 10 different tests with the PowerPop, using three different power concentrators, and the results stayed the same.</p>
<p>Ultimately our best pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NF9CT0C/?tag=ybdpopc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lékué</a>, is simply a better microwave popper.</p>
<h2 id="long-term-testing">Long-term testing notes</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve continued to use both the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NF9CT0C/?tag=ybdpopc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lékué</a> to pop our popcorn, and the material still looks as good as new. In fact, unlike some other silicone products we&#8217;ve tested, the Lékué has managed to avoid becoming sticky and grimy. Part of that certainly has to do with the fact that we always make sure to clean it after use.</p>
<p>However, even after a couple of weekends where we forgot to clean it before going out of town, a run through the dishwasher left the Lékué looking as good as new again.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also continued to use the West Bend popcorn popper, albeit much less frequently. While it is fun to bring out the West Bend for guests, the large size of the popper, along with noisy operation and challenging cleanup make it a noticeably less-convenient popcorn popper for everyday use.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve continued to avoid microwavable bags of popcorn as well, especially since both the Lékué and the West Bend produce better tasting, and likely healthier, popcorn.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Popcorn doesn’t need to be a complicated affair. Fortunately, our top pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NF9CT0C/?tag=ybdpopc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lékué &#8211; Microwave Popcorn Popper</a>, keeps the process simple.</p>

<p>While microwaving a bag of popcorn for your next movie night might seem like the simplest way to enjoy this classic snack, the fact of the matter is that the health risks associated with microwavable bags of popcorn simply aren’t worth the risk.</p>
<p>On top of that, you can in fact save money (that you can spend on important things like <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-electric-wine-opener/">wine</a> for your movie night) by using a popcorn popper instead of microwave popcorn bags.</p>
<p>If you want a popcorn popper with more capacity (and more fun to watch), the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004RC6R/?tag=ybdpopc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">West Bend &#8211; Stir Crazy</a> is a strong option as well. However our best pick — due to its simplicity, versatility, and overall value — is the Lékué.</p>
