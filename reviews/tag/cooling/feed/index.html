								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hether you’re using them during a sweat session at the gym or to get through a hot summer day, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3017491/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies</a> show that cooling towels can significantly boost endurance levels. We put five top-rated cooling towels to the test to determine which ones perform best, wearing them while doing housework on a hot day, outside in the heat of the sun and during a workout at the gym.</p>
<p>The best cooling towel was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XKLYWFU/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chill Pal &#8211; PVA Cooling Towel</a>, a highly absorbent towel that kept us cool and comfortable for a span of two consecutive hours. We also chose the best cooling towel for sports — the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010T9RL2G/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alfamo &#8211; Cooling Towel</a>, a mesh poly blend towel that felt especially lightweight and breathable as it cooled us off during our gym time.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected cooling towels to test</h2>
<p>To put together our lineup of test-worthy cooling towels, we first looked over the top-rated best-sellers on Amazon and searched for user recommendations on Reddit and YouTube. We also read through buyer reviews on Amazon to determine what cooling towel features were most important to users, which we then used to filter and narrow down the top towel choices on our list.</p>
<p>Out of those top picks, we chose towels that were highly rated on Amazon and under $30 each. We also made sure to test a variety of fabrics and materials — polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), 100% polyester and polyester-nylon blends — to determine which were most effective at cooling us down.</p>
<p>The final filtered list included two cooling towel giants: the ShamWow-like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IAUZ3LS/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Frogg Toggs &#8211; Chilly Pad</a> and two cooling towels by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q7T3C3T/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mission</a>, an “instant cooling gear” brand touted by big-name athlete ambassadors like Serena Williams and Dwayne Wade. The other two brands, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010T9RL2G/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alfamo</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XKLYWFU/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chill Pal</a>, were dark horses by comparison, but were highly rated on Amazon and had received raves in YouTube and Reddit reviews.</p>

<h2 id="how-they-work">How do cooling towels work?</h2>
<p>When a moistened cooling towel is placed around the neck or on any skin surface, evaporative cooling comes into play — the skin’s temperature causes the towel’s moisture particles to heat up and evaporate, further cooling down the temperature of the towel. The result is a refreshingly cooling feeling against the skin.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3017491/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> published in the <i>Journal of Athletic Training</i> found that those who wore a cooling towel during exercise could endure the workout longer because it changed the participants’ perception of how much thermal strain they were experiencing. In our own research, we found that cooling towels seem to be used by everyone from gym enthusiasts and festival-goers to menopausal women battling hot flashes and mothers giving birth.</p>
<p>Ideal for vacationers, golfers and those who work outside or in perpetually hot environments (such as chefs), cooling towels seem to take the edge off of a variety of overheated situations and help keep wearers cool during the summer months.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Fabric</h3>
<p>The fabric of the cooling towel you choose will depend largely on how you intend to use your towel. If you want to cool off without soaking your clothes, polyvinyl acetate (PVA) towels like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XKLYWFU/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chill Pal &#8211; PVA Cooling Towel</a> are great because they will retain moisture and cool you off without sacrificing your outfit. Mesh polyester blend or 100-percent polyester towels such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F6R5J9S/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mission &#8211; Enduracool Techknit Cooling Towel</a> have a wetter feel and tend to be drippier, so they’re better for use at the gym, during a sports activity or in any situation where you don’t mind your clothes getting a little wet.</p>
<h3>Size</h3>
<p>Cooling towels come in a variety of sizes, with some brands (such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010T9RL2G/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alfamo &#8211; Cooling Towel</a>) offering a broader range than others. A small-to-medium size (about 10–13 inches by 32–40 inches) is perfect for wearing around the neck during a workout. Larger-sized towels (14–30 inches by 41–60 inches) are great for keeping the entire body cool — after sports events, during heat waves, etc. Many cooling towels offer UPF sun protection, making them perfect for draping over the shoulders while outside in the sun.</p>
<h3>Washability and storage</h3>
<p>Since you will most likely want to wash your cooling towel often, it’s a good idea to pick one that can be conveniently thrown into the washing machine.</p>
<p>PVA fans, take heed: Since PVA dries to a hard, cardboard-like finish, you’ll want to wash your towel and then fold or roll it up while still wet. Attempting to fold or roll your towel after it dries may result in tearing. If you don’t need to fold or roll your towel for storage, feel free to lay it out flat to dry.</p>
<p>Some cooling towels come with storage pouches and even hooks to attach to your gym bag or backpack for easy transportation while wet or dry.</p>
<h2 id="how-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>To determine the best cooling towels out of our top five picks, our testers wore each towel around their neck and shoulders for a span of two consecutive hours while doing housework and yard work. We also wore them during gym sessions to find out how well they cooled us down while we were hot and sweaty. Our testers then rated the towels using the following criteria.</p>
<ul>
<li>After wetting/activating the cooling towel with room-temperature water, how long does it actually stay cool?</li>
<li>How cool does it feel against the skin (without re-wetting) within the first 10 minutes of use? Within the first 30 minutes? Within the first hour?</li>
<li>How pleasant does the towel’s fabric feel against the skin?</li>
<li>Does it get clothes wet, or do they remain dry during use?</li>
<li>How well do the size and shape of the towel work for its intended purpose?</li>
<li>Is it machine washable?</li>
<li>How easy is it to store?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Chill Pal</h2>

<p>Our pick for best cooling towel overall is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XKLYWFU/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chill Pal &#8211; PVA Cooling Towel</a>, which remained moist and cool throughout our testing periods, didn’t get our clothes wet and was soft and comfortable to wear. Made of cushy polyvinyl acetate (PVA), the Chill Pal feels buttery against the skin, with one side textured and the other smooth. Its 12 inch by 32 inch size was ideal for draping easily around our neck or over our shoulders.</p>
<p>After soaking it in water and wringing it out according to the directions, the towel immediately felt cool against our neck and retained that coolness for the next hour of use. In the hour following that, the towel did begin to warm slightly, but we were impressed by how long it remained moist — well beyond our two-hour consecutive testing period — and even more impressed that it only lightly dampened our shirt during that time.</p>

<p>As a PVA cooling towel, the Chill Pal dries stiff. Though it can be washed cold in the washing machine, it shouldn’t be dried in the dryer. We recommend folding or rolling the towel while it’s still moist and pliable, and then air-drying it to prevent molding before storing it in its pouch.</p>
<p>Priced at about $13, the Chill Pal comes with a storage pouch and carabiner, so it can be clipped onto your bag or backpack before and after use. Because it does an excellent job of cooling the body down without soaking your outfit, we recommend it for those who need to cool down at work, while out and about on a hot day (Disneyland, anyone?) or during house and yard work.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Chill Pal &#8211; PVA Cooling Towel impressed us with its marathon moisture retention.</li>
<li>The towel remained cool longer than any of the others in our testing lineup.</li>
<li>Because it leaches little to no water onto clothing, the Chill Pal is ideal for use at work or in situations where you need to preserve your outfit.</li>
<li>Since it dries stiff, you need to air dry and roll it up while it is still pliable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lightweight, soft and breathable, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010T9RL2G/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alfamo &#8211; Cooling Towel</a> is our top choice for a cooling towel to use while at the gym or during sports. After we “activated” (wet) the towel with water, it remained cool against our skin throughout our hour-long workout.</p>
<p>Made of 45% polyester and 55% polyamide mesh, the Alfamo is not as absorbent as the Chill Pal PVA towel and therefore doesn’t distribute moisture evenly throughout the towel for long, making it a bit drippy. However, we found the wetter quality of the towel to be especially refreshing while working out and a non-issue for gym clothes, since we were already sweaty. We also like that the Alfamo offers UPF 50 sun protection, which will come in handy for those who exercise outdoors.</p>

<p>The Alfamo gets extra points for its sizing variety; while the other towels in our lineup only come in one or two sizes, Alfamo offers four different sizes: 11 by 33 inches, 13 by 40 inches, 14 by 47 inches and 29 by 60 inches, priced from around $8 for the smallest size to about $27 for the largest.</p>
<p>Like the Chill Pal towel, the Alfamo comes with a waterproof storage pouch and carabiner for easy transportability. The towel is machine washable, and can be dried in the dryer on low heat. Bonus: Alfamo also offers a lifetime guarantee on their towels.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Light and breathable, the Alfamo &#8211; Cooling Towel was the perfect weight to wear while exercising.</li>
<li>The towel’s polyester blend delivered slightly more moisture when wet, which provided extra cooling power during sweaty workouts.</li>
<li>The Alfamo offers four different sizes to wear around the neck, shoulders, torso or entire body.</li>
<li>It’s not as absorbent as PVA towels, meaning it’s a bit drippy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After testing five highly rated cooling towels indoors, outdoors and at the gym, we narrowed our picks down to two favorites. Our favorite cooling towel overall, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XKLYWFU/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chill Pal &#8211; PVA Cooling Towel</a>, holds moisture for an impressive amount of time without leaking onto clothes, cooling us off for two hours straight and keeping our outfit intact. For sports and working out, we recommend the airy, mesh <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010T9RL2G/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alfamo &#8211; Cooling Towel</a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>riginally used by therapists as a tool to soothe patients, weighted blankets have gone mainstream, used at home by the masses to calm anxiety and help insomnia. We bought four highly acclaimed weighted blankets to test, sleeping under each of them for multiple nights to judge their levels of comfort, breathability and soothing effect.</p>
<p>The best weighted blanket overall is the chemical-free <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N442PLC/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baloo &#8211; Weighted Blanket</a>, a luxurious, durable weighted duvet that felt cocoon-like yet breathable. With its cucumber-cool bamboo viscose outer shell, we felt cozy and comfortably cool all night under the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C193MKM/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YnM &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket</a>, making it our choice for the best cooling weighted blanket.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs a weighted blanket?</h2>
<p>One <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7b52/514a1b040f0b631168d98cfa9730cfc5a9dd.pdf" target="_blank" rel="&quot;noopener">study</a> that tracked the effects of weighted blankets on 30 participants aged 20 to 66 with chronic insomnia reported that the additional pressure from weighted blankets had a calming effect on the subjects. This, along with the secure “cocooned” feeling of being wrapped in a weighted blanket, decreased their muscle movement during sleep, resulting in better overall sleep quality.</p>
<p>Other <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20662681" target="_blank" rel="&quot;noopener">research</a> shows that weighted blankets shortens the time it takes for kids with ADHD to fall asleep, and also reduce middle-of-the-night wakeful periods. Weighted blankets have also been recommended for those on the autism spectrum and to help cope with anxiety, depression, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, sleepwalking and restless sleep in general.</p>
<p>The elderly and those with claustrophobia, breathing or circulation problems should consult with a health professional before using a weighted blanket. They are also not recommended for children under eight years old.</p>
<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>We first conducted an extensive online search to find which blankets had received high praise from trusted review sites, bloggers, YouTube reviewers and Reddit commenters. Since a weighted blanket can be a hefty investment, we wanted those in our testing lineup to be priced under $175 with good return policies, and also highly rated on Amazon.</p>
<p>Even though our review includes a separate category for the best cooling weighted blanket, we encountered so much online discussion about breathability that we decided to make it a key metric for all the blankets we tested. We also took note of other features that seemed to be especially important to buyers: whether the blanket is machine washable, comes with a duvet cover, etc.</p>
<p>Although the most well-known weighted blanket is arguably the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BNBFY52/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gravity Blanket</a> — the first weighted blanket brought to the mass market, via a 2017 Kickstarter campaign — we chose not to include it in our trials due to its weighty $249 price tag. (Affordability was a recurring theme in discussions online; we even came across Reddit threads discussing DIY weighted blanket projects.)</p>
<p>Instead, we selected the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N442PLC/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baloo &#8211; Weighted Blanket</a> — more reasonably priced (relatively) at about $149 — as a contender for the best weighted blanket overall. Known for its luxurious, long-lasting quality, breathability and excellent customer service, the Baloo brand promised to be worth the investment. For this category we also picked the Quility &#8211; Premium Adult Weighted Blanket, an Amazon customer favorite with a 4.8-star rating and nearly 9,000 reviews that comes with a fleece duvet.</p>
<p>For the best cooling weighted blanket category, the Zonli &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C193MKM/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YnM &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket</a> stood out as worthy contestants. Both made of breathable bamboo viscose, the blankets  received rave reviews from hot sleepers who were initially wary of feeling stifled under weighted blankets.</p>

<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Weight</h3>
<p>For adults, manufacturers generally recommend choosing a weighted blanket that’s about 10 percent of your body weight, give or take a few pounds. For children and those with mobility issues, the 10 percent rule still applies, but err on the side of a lighter blanket rather than a heavier one.</p>
<h3>Size</h3>
<p>Normally, the size of a blanket should match the size of your bed (i.e. a twin blanket for a twin bed, king for king, etc.). But because weighted blankets are heavy, if any excess material falls over the end or sides of the bed, it will either weigh too heavy on the sleeper, or drag the rest of the blanket onto the floor.</p>
<p>Weighted blankets are usually sized to keep this from happening; for example, if you buy a queen-size blanket, it should only reach the edges of a queen bed’s surface without any overhang. However, it’s a good idea to check the actual measurements of the blanket before ordering one.</p>
<h3>Glass beads vs. plastic pellets</h3>
<p>The weights inside a weighted blanket will come in one of two forms: glass microbeads or small plastic pellets. The only real difference between the two is that the glass beads are tiny and sand-like, whereas plastic pellets are a bit larger and less weighty. This means a glass-bead blanket will be thinner than a plastic-pellet one.</p>
<h3>Washability</h3>
<p>There will come a point when your weighted blanket will need a wash. Although many weighted blankets are advertised as machine washable,  the manufacturer will often recommend spot cleaning instead. In light of this (and because weighted blankets are so cumbersome), we urge you to buy a duvet cover for your blanket, which will allow you to wash the blanket itself as little as possible.</p>
<h2 id="how-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Our testers slept under each of the weighted blankets in our lineup for three nights, then rated them using the following metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>How well did you sleep under this blanket?</li>
<li>How comfortable and soothed did you feel?</li>
<li>Did you feel uncomfortably warm during the night?</li>
<li>How would you rate the feeling of the blanket’s exterior shell?</li>
<li>How well is the weight distributed throughout the blanket?</li>
<li>How would you rate the quality of the blanket’s construction?</li>
<li>How would you rate the aesthetic look of the blanket?</li>
<li>How easy is this blanket to wash/dry/care for?</li>
<li>Does the blanket come with a duvet cover?</li>
<li>Is this blanket worth the price?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Baloo</h2>

<p>Our top pick for best weighted blanket overall is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N442PLC/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baloo &#8211; Weighted Blanket</a>. Made with premium, chemical-free cotton and lead-free glass microbeads dispersed amongst polyester fill, the Baloo was luxurious and cozy to sleep under. It was also quite breathable; we didn’t feel too warm once throughout the testing period.</p>
<p>Right down to the ribbon-tied welcome note inside its blanket box, Baloo is all about the details, even offering three free downloadable tracks of soothing meditative music to fall asleep to. While the fill weights in many weighted blankets are contained by a grid of squares alone, the Baloo blanket features unique double-quilted stitching, creating channels of piping that run between the squares as well. This means more support for the heavy glass beads inside, as well as more evenly distributed weight throughout the blanket.</p>
<p>Baloo is a green company, meaning their blankets contain zero harmful chemicals and are certified vegan. The blankets also machine washable in cold water on the gentle cycle, and can be dried in the dryer on low heat. As far as return policies go, Baloo’s is one of the more lenient that we came across, encouraging customers to take some time to get used to the weight of the blanket. You have 30 days to initiate a return, as long as the blanket is sent back in its original condition.</p>

<p>Out of the four blankets we tested, the Baloo offers the least sizing and weight options; only two sizes (twin and queen) and three weights (12, 15 and 20 pounds) are available. The blanket also only comes in one color — Pebble White — and doesn’t include a duvet cover, though the company does sell them separately. Although the blanket itself is well-designed and has the look of a high-end duvet, we recommend protecting it with a cover so you won’t have to go to the trouble of washing it often.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Baloo &#8211; Weighted Blanket feels luxe and cocoon-like, without sacrificing breathability.</li>
<li>The blanket is certified vegan and contains no harmful chemicals.</li>
<li>With double-quilted stitching, the Baloo is well-constructed to distribute weight evenly and prevent seam breaks.</li>
<li>This blanket only comes in twin and queen sizes, offers 12, 15 and 20-pound options and doesn’t include a duvet cover.</li>

<p>With a 300-thread-count bamboo viscose shell that’s cool to the touch, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C193MKM/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YnM &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket</a> gets our vote for the best cooling weighted blanket. Though certainly not light and airy, the blanket didn’t feel too dense, and we remained well-ventilated throughout the night. However, if you’re a hot sleeper, keep in mind that this is the only blanket you’ll need on your bed.</p>
<p>We were impressed with the YnM blanket’s construction, which is designed to prevent seam breaks and tearing. Underneath the bamboo outer layer, there’s an extra layer of cotton fabric to better contain the thin, breathable layer of polyfill and lead-free glass beads inside. The stitching is also clearly strong and high quality. Although the blanket is technically machine washable (on the delicate cycle), YnM recommends spot cleaning the blanket instead.</p>
<p>What really sold us on the YnM blanket was its three-year free mending guarantee. If any unexpected damage should come to your blanket within three years of purchase, YnM will repair it for you (though you will need to pay for shipping). They also offer a 30-day return policy on their blankets, as long as they are sent back with the original packaging.</p>

<p>The blanket itself does not come with a duvet cover, but YnM sells a variety of reasonably priced covers in three fabrics — cotton, bamboo and “minky” fleece — which come in tasteful solid colors and surprisingly chic patterns. If you need more warmth when the seasons change, the fleece duvet would be a great addition to take the cooling blanket from summer to winter use.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The YnM &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket’s high-thread-count bamboo viscose outer layer is silky soft and cool to the touch.</li>
<li>The blanket features high-quality stitching and construction that will stand the test of time.</li>
<li>YnM offers an unbeatable three-year mending guarantee on their weighted blanket (though customers must pay shipping).</li>
<li>No duvet cover is included.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="others">Other weighted blankets we tested</h2>
<p>Although the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DLHD2RX/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Quility &#8211; Premium Adult Weighted Blanket</a> was cozy to sleep under with well-distributed weight, we grew uncomfortably warm during the night under its minky duvet cover, which seems to only be usable in cold climates during the winter. Without the cover, the blanket’s cotton outer layer felt a bit rough against our skin, and was quite plain compared to its <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N442PLC/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baloo</a> competitor.</p>
<p>Like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C193MKM/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YnM</a> blanket, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075W9VSW7/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zonli &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket</a> remained comfortably cool during the night, but the company’s return policy concerned us — Zonli offers no refunds on used blankets, only those that are returned unopened in their original packaging. Since high prices showed up as a top concern for weighted blanket buyers online, this bumped the Zonli down to second place in our cooling weighted blanket category.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>With weighted blankets now being marketed to the masses to help improve sleep and soothe anxiety and depression, they’re worth a try — as long as they include a good return policy.</p>
<p>Made of breathable, chemical-free cotton and featuring strong double-quilted stitching and a generous 30-day return policy, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N442PLC/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baloo &#8211; Weighted Blanket</a> is a great choice for anyone in the market for a high-quality, luxurious weighted blanket.</p>
<p>For those who sleep hot, we recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C193MKM/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YnM &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket</a>, made with silky, cooling 300-thread-count bamboo viscose and featuring durable construction and a three-year mending guarantee.</p>

Its unique crescent shape fits snugly around your neck and bolsters your head on either side while preventing a side sleeper from shifting positions.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We began our research by reading articles written by sleep experts at the National Sleep Foundation, Spine-Health.com and John Hopkins Medicine. Of the three general sleeping positions — supine (or back), stomach and side — sleeping on the right or left side is the most common.</p>
<p>Experts agree that although each position has both positives and negatives, it’s crucial to find the pillow that will provide the necessary support to your spine, neck, shoulders and head. Not all pillows are right for every sleeping position. Side sleepers need a pillow that elevates their head and cushions their neck and shoulders so their spine stays in alignment.</p>
<p>Finding the perfect pillow can be challenging since there are so many available. They come in different sizes and shapes and with a variety of fillings. There are thousands upon thousands of strongly held opinions about pillows, and from this commentary, we learned that pillow shopping is very personal; one pillow might be fluffy and comfortable for one side sleeper, and the same pillow might be hard as a rock for another side sleeper.</p>
<p>We selected a broad array of pillows that are recommended for and by side sleepers. Many pillows are marketed for people who sleep in any position, so we chose to test a few of those as well to determine whether they are actually suited for side sleepers.</p>

<h2 id="sleep-health">Sleep and health</h2>
<p>In 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published their findings from a year-long study that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data_statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">35 percent of American adults</a> over the age of 18 suffer from sleep deprivation. The CDC has not done another study since then, but other research indicates that that number has increased to 40 percent. If you’re one of the many millions of people who have lain awake at night, this probably comes as no surprise.</p>
<p>Sleep deprivation alters the normal functioning of the brain and weakens the immune system. The CDC and John Hopkins Medicine link insufficient sleep to chronic pain, type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer, chronic heart disease, obesity and dementia.</p>
<h2 id="sleep-tips">Tips for better sleep</h2>
<p>Some of the causes of sleep deprivation are health related and require medical attention. John Hopkins Medicine and the <a href="http://sleepeducation.org/healthysleep/healthy-sleep-basics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Academy of Sleep Medicine</a> state that adults require at least seven hours of sleep each night and make the following recommendations for sleeping better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove all technical devices, such as a television or computer.</li>
<li>Turn off your cell phone or tablet. Research shows that late-night use of a mobile device stimulates the brain.</li>
<li>If you use a night light, get one with a warmer or yellower color. The research we did on our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-night-light/">night light review</a> revealed blue lights make it harder to sleep.</li>
<li>Dim your digital alarm clock, or turn it away from your face.</li>
<li>Turn down the thermostat, and keep your bedroom cool.</li>
<li>Make sure your mattress is comfortable and supportive. The National Sleep Foundation recommends that a mattress should be changed every seven to 10 years.</li>
<li>Switch your sleeping position.</li>

<p>Supine sleepers and stomach sleepers have different needs, because of the way their sleeping position aligns their necks and spines. A supine sleeper needs a pillow about 3- or 4-inches high with a firm center to support the head and neck, A stomach sleeper (only 8 percent of the population) needs a pillow with almost no height to keep the spine neutral and aligned. (Some stomach sleepers don’t use a pillow at all.)</p>
<p>Side sleeping is the most prevalent sleeping position and considered the healthiest way to sleep. Side sleeping aligns the curvature of the spine and is often prescribed for alleviating neck and back pain. It also diminishes snoring and sleep apnea by keeping nasal and throat passages open.</p>
<p>If you’re a side sleeper, you need a pillow that will make up the distance between your head and the mattress to keep your spine in a neutral position. This type of pillow can be an elongated capsule shape or curved to fit around your neck.</p>
<p>The side sleeper pillow is filled with a soft material that holds its shape and creates a thick “loft,” which is the pillow’s height when it lays flat on the mattress.</p>
<p>Pillows for side sleepers come in the usual standard, queen and king sizes. The size you choose will depend on your height, weight and width of shoulders. Most side sleepers prefer a larger pillow for maintaining head and neck support if they switch sides during the night.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Shredded memory foam filling</h3>
<p>Memory foam is composed primarily of polyurethane that’s blended with chemicals to create a dense, heavy substance that softens under body heat. It’s durable and provides excellent support when it’s used in a bed mattress. A downside to memory foam is that it retains body heat, which makes it uncomfortably hot in higher temperatures.</p>
<p>The filling of the majority of the pillows we tested were shredded memory foam. As we discussed in our reviews about <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-cooling-pillow/">cooling pillows</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-mattress-topper/">mattress toppers</a>, any foam used in the manufacture of the pillow should be certified by <a href="https://certipur.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CertiPUR-US</a>, a non-profit organization that rigorously tests polyurethane foams for ozone depleters, fire retardants, mercury, lead and other hazardous contaminants. If the filling is not CertiPUR-certified, you can’t be sure where and what the foam came from or if you will be breathing in toxic gas emitted from the foam.</p>
<p>Shredded memory foam has the same moldable characteristic, but the smaller pieces move independently and can be easily shaped. Shredded foam is ideal for a pillow because it will fit the contours of your neck and, unlike a down pillow, will keep your head aloft.</p>
<p>Not all shredded memory foam is alike. The manufacturers of all of the pillows we tested made claims of a “proprietary blend” of memory foam. Basically this means that they didn’t cut the foam from somebody’s tossed-out recliner. In fact, some consumers do complain that shredded memory foam feels chopped up inside the pillow case.</p>
<p>Only one pillow in our testing had memory foam that felt rough cut, the Snuggle-Pedic. Snuggle-Pedic’s website seems a bit defensive about it. They come clean that the memory foam for their pillows is leftover trimmings from their mattresses. But they also have a lengthy statement about the purity of the particular — and proprietary — foam they use.</p>
<h3>Gel fiber</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21935" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pillow-filling.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1335" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pillow-filling-1000x668@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pillow-filling-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pillow-filling-768x513.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pillow-filling-885x591.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pillow-filling-810x541.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pillow-filling-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pillow-filling-1000x668.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pillow-filling-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pillow-filling-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pillow-filling-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pillow-filling-320x214.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pillow-filling-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pillow-filling-885x591@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pillow-filling-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pillow-filling-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pillow-filling-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pillow-filling-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pillow-filling-320x214@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>To add extra softness and flexibility to the memory foam, several manufacturers add gel fiber. Gel fiber is a synthetic fiber that has a silken feel to it and when blended with shredded memory foam, it softens the rough cut texture. Other benefits of gel-fiber-infused memory foam are that it’s hypoallergenic and adds a cooling element to the heat-trapping memory foam.</p>
<h3>Bamboo pillows</h3>
<p>A current trend for manufacturers is marketing their pillows as “bamboo,” which supposedly makes their pillows better than others. <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0122-bamboo-fabrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This is a case of false advertising.</a> The pillow padding itself is not made of bamboo, only the pillowcase is made of a bamboo-derived viscose rayon.</p>
<p>The viscose rayon is a breathable fabric with a velvety softness that’s similar to silk. Most of the pillows we tested were designed to be slept on without a traditional pillow case (one that matches your bed linens), so we preferred the bamboo pillows over those that had other polyester-blend or cotton pillowcases.</p>
<h3>Loft</h3>
<p>The amount of gel fiber blended with the memory foam will determine a pillow’s loft. For a side sleeper pillow, loft should be approximately 5 or 6-inches high. Less than that, and your head will sink into the pillow and put pressure on the curvature of your spine.</p>
<p>Factors that contribute to how well the pillow’s loft is maintained are the size of your head, your body’s weight and the breadth of your shoulders. Ideally you should be able to test a pillow for several nights to determine the efficacy of its loft.</p>
<p>Several pillows we tested had a blend of memory foam and gel fiber. But not all of them retained their loft after repeated nights. The best was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LYU7V4S/?tag=ybdsspillw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coop Home Goods &#8211; Eden</a>. The loft of other test pillows had sagged somewhat (or entirely) by morning, but the Eden kept our testers’ heads supported and elevated.</p>
<h3>Adjustable filling included</h3>
<p>All of the pillows we tested were advertised as being adjustable, and that’s certainly true. Filling can be added or removed to raise or lower the pillow’s loft. However, only two of the pillows we tested — the Eden and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EINBSEW/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coop Home Goods &#8211; Dawn</a> — actually included extra filling in a separate bag. The other pillows had stuffing that could be removed to lower the loft but none that could be added to increase the loft.</p>
<p>One pillow, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078SW9YZD/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sweetnight &#8211; SN-P001-K</a>, included a nice cloth bag to store removed filling, but no additional filling for increasing loft was included. We checked the manufacturer and, similar to most of the other pillows, you can request extra filling, which they send free of charge.</p>
<h3>Separate pillowcase</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pillowcase.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>One of the most important features is a separate removable pillow case that could be washed. You might think that this would be a standard feature, but it’s not. Almost all of the pillows advertised that their pillow cases had breathable, cooling fabric, and by and large, they did.</p>
<p>Naturally, over time, you will want to wash the pillowcase, and to do so, you&#8217;ll need to remove every last bit of stuffing, unless the manufacturer states that the entire pillow is washable.</p>
<p>If a storage bag wasn’t included with the pillow, then you’ll need a bag or receptacle nearby to catch the flyaway fluff. Once the pillow case is cleaned, you have to re-stuff and re-fluff the pillow in the dryer. In our minds, this is just too much work for any pillow.</p>
<p>Only three of the shredded foam pillows we tested had a separate pillowcase: the Eden, the Dawn and the Sweetnight. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073H7MNNB/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tuft &amp; Needle</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076MG5KTD/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coisum</a> also had separate pillowcases, but both are whole pieces of foam, which are easy to remove.</p>
<h3>Trial period</h3>
<p>During our research we discovered that pillows for side sleepers are a hot item. Naturally, every company that makes a shredded foam or gel fiber pillow wants to advertise that their product is the best one for side sleepers. So if you research buying pillows, you’ll see manufacturers making claims that their one pillow will magically put you to sleep no matter what your preferred sleeping position is.</p>
<p>The only true way of finding out whether or not a pillow is right for you is to try it out. Almost all pillow manufacturers allow you at least 30 nights; others increase the trial period to 60 nights. The best will offer 100 nights or even longer, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Snuggle-Pedic-Ultra-Luxury-Combination-Adjustable-Hypoallergenic/dp/B072HFY7WZ/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Snuggle-Pedic</a>.</p>
<p>A few of the pillows held their loft for the first two or three nights. But after that, their loft began to decrease and no longer provided the support they had on the first night. Several of the heavily hyped pillows went flat the instant we laid our heads down. If you spend $80 for a pillow, you want it to last for years. So take advantage of the longer trial period.</p>
<h2>How we tested</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pillow-fluffing.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<h3>First steps</h3>
<p>All of the pillows are compacted to fit into shipping boxes, so we had to first allow the pillows to expand naturally, anywhere between one and five minutes. Next, shredded foam is notorious for its rank chemical odor, so before sleeping on them, we allowed the pillows to air outdoors for at least two days.</p>
<p>Finally, as recommended by the pillow manufacturers, we tossed each pillow into a dryer and spun it for 10 minutes at low heat. This last process fluffs the pillow to its highest loft. This step is also recommended for refreshing and re-fluffing your pillow after several nights’ use.</p>
<h3>Adjusting the loft</h3>
<p>Side sleepers need a loft that lifts the neck to align with the spine while cushioning the head at the same time. Except for the Coisum and Tuft &amp; Needle, all of the pillows were advertised as adjustable, meaning filling could be added or removed to adjust the loft. (Tuft &amp; Needle will make an adjustment if you return the pillow to them.)</p>
<p>Many pillows also made claims that their pillows were stuffed with filling that most people find sufficient. This claim proved woefully inadequate in most cases, as the included filling was not enough to maintain a high loft.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, only the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B01LYU7V4S/?tag=ybdsspillw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eden</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EINBSEW/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dawn</a> provided a bag of extra filling in the box. Since all of the pillows stated that out of the box they were stuffed to full capacity, we stuffed both Coop pillows with the included extra stuffing. If the loft was too high, we could gradually remove stuffing until, like Goldilocks, we achieved just the right height.</p>
<p>It took us a lot of trial and error to finally get the right amount of stuffing for each tester. We were glad that there was enough filling included with the two Coop pillows so we could experiment at our leisure. Except for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XVMJMSH/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scrumptious</a>, none of the other pillows had sufficient filling. We appreciate that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Snuggle-Pedic-Ultra-Luxury-Combination-Adjustable-Hypoallergenic/dp/B072HFY7WZ/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Snuggle-Pedic</a> and <a href="https://www.nestbedding.com/products/the-easy-breather-pillow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nest Bedding</a> will send additional filling upon request, but we question why not just include it when the pillow is shipped?</p>
<h3>Sleeping</h3>
<p>Inevitably, it came down to sleeping on the pillows. Both of our testers change positions during the night; one is a back/side sleeper, the other a stomach/side sleeper. Each tester slept on a different pillow for a minimum of three nights and in the morning recorded responses to whether the pillow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Held its loft</li>
<li>Supported neck and head</li>
<li>Diminished neck, shoulder and back pain</li>
<li>Improved sleep</li>
</ul>

<p>After testing and retesting all of the pillows for three weeks, our testers agreed that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B01LYU7V4S/?tag=ybdsspillw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coop Home Goods &#8211; Eden</a> was the superior pillow for side sleepers. It has just the right amount of filling to bolster the neck and cushion the head and shoulders.</p>
<p>The Eden is Coop Home Good’s most recent addition to their product line, which includes their top-selling Dawn pillow, body pillow, traveler’s pillow and toddler’s pillow. The outer case is made of bamboo-viscose rayon and polyester with geometric stitching. It’s not cool-to-the-touch like a gel pillow, but the material never heats up because it’s so breathable. You can squeeze the pillow and almost feel it exhale.</p>
<p>The pillow case has a strong, stretchable gusseted edge that prevents the pillow from pinching together and promotes even distribution of the filling. The gel-infused shredded memory foam has its own zippered inner casing, so the pillow case can be slipped off without foam flying everywhere. The gel infusion gives the shredded foam an ultra-soft, feathery texture, yet it’s substantial enough to maintain a high loft all night long.</p>

<p>Our testers described the Eden as “comforting” and “cocoon-like.” There’s plenty of filling to stuff the queen-size pillow from corner to corner. The Eden is adjustable, but neither tester felt it was necessary to remove any filling. Other than Coop Home Good’s original Dawn pillow, this was the only pillow we tested that had the right amount of filling straight out of the box. Coop Home Goods will also send more filling upon request, but we honestly don’t think you’ll need extra.</p>
<p>Another plus for the Eden is that it did not have the characteristic memory foam odor and did not need as much time to air outdoors as the other pillows (excluding the Dawn). We fluffed it up in the dryer for 15 minutes and slept on it that night. The pillowcase had a pleasant, light vanilla scent, which eventually wore off, and the foam had no scent other than just smelling clean.</p>
<p>The Eden has both Certi-PUR certification and Greenguard Gold certification, which ensures that the pillow is safe for use in schools and healthcare facilities.</p>
<p>At $80, the Eden is comparable in price to other memory-foam pillows. Choosing a pillow is completely subjective, but Coop Home Goods offers a 100-night trial period and full refund, so it’s worth a try.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Eden is filled with the right amount of shredded memory foam to keep your head cushioned and neck and shoulders supported.</li>
<li>The unique gel-infused memory foam keeps the pillow cool and doesn’t have the usual chemical odor of memory foam.</li>
<li>The foam is stuffed into its own casing, so the pillow case can be easily removed and separately washed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our testers enjoyed the contouring shape of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XVMJMSH/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Honeydew Sleep Company’s Scrumptious</a>. This pillow, specifically designed for side sleepers, fits snugly around the neck and shoulders and bolsters the head on either side of its unusual arc.</p>
<p>Honeydew is a small, California-based company, and they have sourced two types of Certi-PUR certified memory foam that are unique to their product. This means that they’re not cutting off scraps from memory foam mattresses, as many pillow manufacturers do, but are actually making the shredded foam solely for their pillows.</p>
<p>Although the company claims that the Scrumptious is suitable for all sleepers, they really had the side sleeper in mind when designing it. There’s plenty of foam inside, so you don’t need to purchase additional foam from Honeydew. That said, they will provide it upon request. If you cut a doughnut in half, you’ll get an approximate idea of how the Scrumptious is shaped.</p>
<p>The curve fits snugly around your neck and shoulder and the “wings” on either end support your head and face. One of our testers said that it prevented him from shifting out of the side-sleeping position by squaring up his shoulders and keeping his spine in alignment. Another tester, however, claimed that the shape forced him to sleep on his back.</p>
<p>Out of the box, the Scrumptious’s velvety-soft viscose pillowcase had a pleasant aroma, but its memory foam interior had a slight chemical odor. We aired it outside overnight, and by morning the smell was mostly gone. Over the three-week testing period, Scrumptious still smelled fresh.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XVMJMSH/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/scrumptious-cta-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/scrumptious-cta-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/scrumptious-cta-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/scrumptious-cta-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/scrumptious-cta-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/scrumptious-cta-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/scrumptious-cta-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/scrumptious-cta-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/scrumptious-cta.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best for Spine Alignment: Honeydew Sleep Company - Scrumptious</h3><p>The pillow’s crescent-moon shape squares up your shoulders and keeps your spine aligned through the night.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XVMJMSH/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Our biggest complaint with the Scrumptious is that the filling is stuffed directly into the pillow case and does not have its own separate, washable casing. To clean the pillow case, all of the stuffing must be removed and then the pillowcase re-stuffed once it’s been washed and dried. The company sells pillow cases for the entire pillow, but we wonder why they simply don’t redesign the pillow so the stuffing has its own casing.</p>
<p>One of our testers said he could sleep on the Scrumptious for the rest of his life. But at $100, it’s the most expensive of the pillows we tested. Honeydew Sleep has a 60-day trial period, which will give you the chance to decide if the Scrumptious is worth the price.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Scrumptious’s contoured shape curves around your neck and shoulders while supporting your head and face.</li>
<li>The pillow prevents a side sleeper from shifting position by keeping your spine aligned.</li>
<li>It doesn’t have a separate pillowcase, so the stuffing must be removed before washing the pillow case.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="recommend">We also recommend</h2>
<h3>Coop Home Goods &#8211; Dawn</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EINBSEW/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Dawn</a> is Coop Home Good’s original memory foam pillow, and it has some of the features of the upgraded Eden pillow. There’s plenty of filling provided, so the Dawn has the same plush and supportive loft. The Dawn’s filling is enclosed in its own casing, so the velvety pillowcase can be easily removed and separately washed. The Dawn does not have the gusseted edging, so unlike the Eden, the filling doesn’t reach the corners of the pillow.</p>
<p>The filling is a mix of shredded memory foam and microfiber and doesn’t have the feathery texture of the Eden’s filling. It also has the slight chemical odor of memory foam that didn’t quite dissipate after outdoor airing for several days. Nevertheless, the Dawn was still one of our favorites.</p>
<h2 id="not-right">Not right for side sleepers</h2>
<h3>Nest Bedding &#8211; Easy Breather</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K8WVD7M/ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Easy Breather</a> scored high in <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-cooling-pillow/">our testing of cooling pillows</a>, but our two side-sleepers agreed that although it’s nicely made, it was somewhat too soft and pliable to hold a supportive loft. The Easy Breather had a gusseted edge that evenly distributes the memory foam, which had a slight chemical odor. The lyocell pillowcase mostly covered the foam’s scent, but it wasn’t as soft to the touch as the Eden’s or Dawn’s pillowcases.</p>
<p>Like other adjustable pillows, filling can be removed, but a storage bag isn’t included. The Easy Breather does not have a separate casing for the filling, so it must be completely removed before you can wash the pillow. We found this to be too inconvenient for such a pricey pillow.</p>
<h3>Tuft &amp; Needle &#8211; PI003-S</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073H7MNNB/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tuft &amp; Needle’s premium pillow</a> is made of a single piece of their trademarked Adaptive Foam, which the company also uses for their mattresses. The Adaptive Foam is infused with gel and graphite that Tuft &amp; Needle claims keep the foam cool. The foam is punctured with tiny holes and sewn into its own casing and has a pleasant scent. Although this pillow is advertised as a pillow for side sleepers, it has little loft and did not elevate our testers’ necks. It’s another well-made pillow, but it’s better suited for back or stomach sleepers.</p>
<h3>Snuggle-Pedic</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072HFY7WZ/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Snuggle-Pedic</a> is one of the companies that inaccurately markets their pillow as a bamboo pillow. In reality, it’s a shredded gel-infused memory foam pillow with a 40-percent bamboo viscose pillowcase. The foam is trimmed from the company’s mattresses, and although the gel adds a noticeable cooling and softening factor to the foam, the shredded bits feel coarse and chunky. The company takes great pains on its website to defend the purity of their foam, but unfortunately, even after three weeks, its odor hung on.</p>
<p>The pillow had a good loft, but the odor and rough-cut texture to the shredded foam disrupted our testers’ sleep.</p>
<h3>Sweetnight &#8211; SN-P001-K</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078SW9YZD/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sweetnight &#8211; SN-P001-K</a> had a couple of the features our testers preferred: a separate casing for the filling and a soft-to-the-touch pillowcase. The filling’s casing, however, could not mask the foam’s overwhelmingly acrid odor. Sweetnight’s shredded high-density memory foam had an odd texture. When squeezed, it squished into a clump, and so the pillow could not sustain a loft and went flat under the weight of each tester’s head.</p>
<h3>Infinitemoon &#8211; Everpillow</h3>
<p>Marketed as the “world’s most comfortable pillow,” <a href="https://infinitemoon.com/everpillow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infinitemoon</a> offers the option of selecting the filling for the Everpillow: latex noodle, kapok silk or a blend of both. We ordered the blend, which is 90 percent latex and 10 percent kapok silk. The pillow arrived in a vacuum-sealed bag, and when opened, the pillow expanded to its full length and resembled a giant dog biscuit.</p>
<p>The latex-kapok filling had a pleasant, lemony scent and was soft to the touch. We can’t criticize the pillow’s cuddly texture, but it had no loft. The pillow seemed too long and narrow for the amount of filling included. Infinitemoon will send a pound of extra filling upon request (within 18 months of purchase), which might plump the pillow to the height a side sleeper needs.</p>
<h3>Coisum &#8211; 4332456308</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076MG5KTD/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coisum &#8211; 4332456308</a> is an orthopedic memory foam pillow designed for alleviating neck and back pain. Its unique butterfly shape is curved for placement of the neck and arms. The pillow is a single piece of memory foam, similar to a Tempur-Pedic, and does not have the cooling properties of the other pillows we tested. Although it’s marketed as a pillow for side sleepers, the Coisum had no loft, and the memory foam was too hard and uncomfortable for both testers.</p>
<h3>Sable &#8211; SA-BD013</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074Q8C7BY/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sable &#8211; SA-BD013</a> is a goose-down-alternative pillow that’s stuffed with hypoallergenic polyester fiber fill. It has a 100-percent cotton pillowcase, which is soft and cool to the touch. Sable markets the pillows as adjustable, which is accurate, since the puffy stuffing can be removed. The stuffing was this pillow’s downfall. Both testers complained that the pillow had no shape or substance, and even folded over two or three times, the pillow gave no support.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Many pillows are marketed as the best for side sleepers, and we discovered from our testing that those claims just aren’t accurate. What works for a stomach sleeper or back sleeper simply doesn’t work for a side sleeper. If you’re a side sleeper you need a pillow that fills in the gap between the mattress and your head and keeps your spine aligned.</p>
<p>Over a three-week period, our testers slept on 10 different pillows, and agreed that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B01LYU7V4S/?tag=ybdsspillw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coop Home Goods &#8211; Eden</a> pillow met their needs for support and comfort. The Eden’s cooling gel-infused shredded memory foam bolsters the neck and cushions the head and shoulders. The Eden is filled with more than enough stuffing to keep the pillow’s loft high or low depending on your preference. It’s priced at $80, which might seem steep, but Coop Home Goods offers a 100-night trial period and full refund if you’re not satisfied.</p>
<p>Our runner up is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XVMJMSH/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Honeydew Sleep Company’s &#8211; Scrumptious</a>, a pillow that was specifically designed for side sleepers. Its unusual crescent shape fits snugly around the curvature of the neck and prevents a side sleeper from shifting positions during the night.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent a month using the best insulated tumblers side by side with water bottles and travel mugs. We found that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RTIC &#8211; 30 Ounce Tumbler</a> gives you all the same insulation performance and better leak-proofing at less than half the price of the best-known <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YETI &#8211; Rambler</a>. If you&#8217;re willing to pay, YETI does give you a slide-open spout that&#8217;s less annoying, though you run the risk of dribbles and drips.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>There are over 20,000 listings on Amazon for &#8220;insulated tumbler.&#8221; YETI is the undisputed brand king, with a tumbler that&#8217;s now even more popular than their ultra-rugged (and expensive) coolers. As with all things that are mass-produced and insanely popular, the number of competitors (and imitations) has expanded just as quickly as YETI&#8217;s profit numbers.</p>
<p>We read and watched dozens of YETI tumbler reviews and comparisons to narrow the mile-long list down to four of the best insulated tumbler cups. <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-tumbler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wirecutter</a>, as always, provides some in-depth testing, and <a href="https://www.savingfreak.com/best-tumbler-yeti-vs-rtic-vs-orca-vs-ozark-trail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saving Freak</a> compares the costs and benefits of the various copycat brands. GearJunkie, like most sites, only <a href="https://gearjunkie.com/yeti-rambler-tumbler-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passes a verdict on the YETI</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY5Kryq62SQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What&#8217;s Inside</a> tried to do a controlled test, but wound up destroying one of their samples.</p>
<p>In our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/" rel="noopener">water bottle review</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/" rel="noopener">travel mug review</a>, we&#8217;ve seen Klean Kanteen and Hydro Flask go head-to-head competing for a position in our tests. <b>For the first time, Hydro Flask offers something substantially different from Klean Kanteen: a bigger cup that actually matches what everyone else is offering.</b></p>
<p>Between the various well-known brands that are just barely different from YETI, RTIC is budget-friendly and offers a flip-cap lid that at least compares in functionality to the Mag-Slide on the new YETI lids.</p>
<p>CamelBak has an interesting contender in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LA4PUMc/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KickBak</a>, and it fared well in Wirecutter&#8217;s insulation test, but customer reviews of the lid are scathing so we skipped it.</p>
<p><b>We decided to test only the 30-ounce tumblers in this review, since they&#8217;re the most popular and represent a type of drink carrier that&#8217;s really different from a </b><a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/" rel="noopener"><b>16-ounce travel mug</b></a><b>.</b> It also allowed us to compare them directly to our favorite 30-ounce insulated <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/" rel="noopener">water bottle</a> to see what difference that narrower opening makes. We selected representatives from a range of prices to see if insulation quality really changes when you buy a $40 tumbler instead of a $16 tumbler.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-get">Should you get a tumbler, water bottle or travel mug?</h2>
<p>Like <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/#best-insulated-water-bottle" rel="noopener">insulated water bottles</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/" rel="noopener">travel mugs</a>, an insulated tumbler will keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold. The vacuum insulation also stops that slippery condensation from forming on the sides and leaving a puddle on your furniture.</p>
<p>The choice between a travel mug and an insulated tumbler is a tricky one. In most ways, these products serve an identical purpose for most people: They maintain temperature, and they&#8217;re convenient to sip from (no screw-top like an insulated water bottle).</p>
<p>The big difference with a tumbler is the lid. <b>While a travel mug is still designed for easy-access sipping, many tumblers don&#8217;t have any kind of stopper at all to slow down your sipping pleasure.</b> The lids are simple and easy to clean, but they offer far less insulation than good travel mugs. The best travel mugs keep your coffee hotter and your laptop (not to mention pants) safer from spills.</p>
<p>A tumbler is also available in much larger sizes than popular travel mugs. You can buy a thermos or a giant insulated water bottle, of course, but those aren&#8217;t easy to sip from.</p>
<p>So, the ideal setting for an insulated tumbler is on a hot afternoon where you want to keep your drink insulated, but you&#8217;re more worried about convenience more than spills. Drinking something cold poolside on a scorching-hot day is a perfect example. Reading on the patio in the early morning with a cup of coffee is also a case where the tumbler works better than an ordinary cup.</p>

<b>Size:</b> The most popular tumblers hold around 30 ounces, and among the friends and coworkers who use them daily, that was unanimously the preferred size for sipping cold beverages or ice water.</p>
<p><b>Spout stoppers:</b> Flip-up stoppers and slide-over stoppers are the two common approaches to keeping a tumbler closed. Look closely at what you&#8217;re buying, though: Many tumblers are made with a few different lid styles if you look for them.</p>
<p><b>Base diameter:</b> Do you need to keep your tumbler in a car cup holder? Check the size just to be sure, but most cup holders are designed to hold extra-large restaurant-size paper cups, which these tumblers mimic.</p>
<p><b>Painted, coated or brushed finish:</b> Color coordination is a nice benefit of painted or powder-coated tumblers, but they&#8217;ll show signs of wear eventually. Brushed stainless steel looks great even if it gets scratched, and there&#8217;s nothing that will peel off after a few years.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Everyday use tests</h3>
<p>Our tester used these tumblers in place of his usual water bottle and coffee mug for two weeks. At work, around the house, in the car and at the park, they all kept beverages handy. The 30-ounce size was bigger than our testers preferred for a morning cup of coffee, but for keeping hydrated (or keeping a rum and coke chilled) it&#8217;s just about perfect.</p>
<p>The differences between the mugs seemed smaller and smaller as we got used to them. The flip-lid from RTIC doesn&#8217;t flop around as much as most travel mug lids in this style, which was our biggest concern. The slide closures on the YETI and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0769CQYVS/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican &#8211; Traveler</a> were easy to use, though not any more so than the flip lid.</p>
<h3>Cleaning test</h3>
<p>Cleaning these tumblers and lids was easy, even by hand. Compared to popular travel mugs like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZI5XNO/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo &#8211; West Loop</a> with its springs and levers on the inside of the lid, a tumbler lid is dead simple to clean.</p>
<p>What about the dishwasher, though? <a href="https://www.rticcoolers.com/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTIC</a> and <a href="https://www.hydroflask.com/caring-for-your-hydro-flask/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hydro Flask</a> say that you should hand-wash only, while <a href="https://www.yeti.com/en_US/are-yeti-tumblers-dishwasher-safe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YETI</a> specifically claims their tumblers will survive dishwashing. (Pelican doesn&#8217;t comment either way.) Given the number of outright contradictions we&#8217;ve seen over our years researching vacuum-insulated products, we&#8217;re not surprised by either answer. Extra-hot drying cycles will make the metal expand and contract, so there&#8217;s some risk to every mug, but the biggest problems are usually with color coatings and glued-on plastic pieces.</p>
<p>If you want to keep your insulated tumbler looking and working its best, hand-washing is the safe way to go. But it seems clear that one trip through the washer won&#8217;t destroy the insulation if you find a week-old smoothie in the back of your truck.</p>
<h3>Insulation test</h3>
<p>We took our four tumblers and our <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07996C56J/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">top-performing insulated water bottle</a> and filled them all with 28 ounces of hot water. Temperature ranged from 190 to 194 degrees Fahrenheit, which is on the upper end of coffee temperature after brewing.</p>
<p>We then checked on the heat loss for the next six hours, and again at 12 hours. The chart below models the results for easy comparison. (The raw data had a difference of four degrees Fahrenheit in starting temperature. The chart shows an adjusted starting temperature, but the temperature change from one sample to the next is as recorded.)</p>
<div id="visualizer-18187-1533691480" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-18187"></div>
<p>The differences between these tumblers is so small that it would be impossible to tell them apart. The real difference is between the tumblers and the water bottle: because the vacuum-sandwich stainless steel walls provide the most effective insulation, the wide lid of a tumbler is a real liability. Even the fact that the Hydro Flask tumbler has no seal to keep steam in made only a tiny difference in the test.</p>
<p>We also added the results from an old test of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp 16-ounce travel mug</a> to this chart for comparison. <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/#how-we-tested" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The testing conditions were different</a> (starting temperature was lower, and we didn&#8217;t test for as long), but we&#8217;ve normalized the starting point on this graph so the sample intervals line up. It&#8217;s clear that even a small narrow-neck bottle keeps heat better than the tumblers.</p>
<h3>Ice test</h3>
<p>In our research, we saw so many variations of the ice test, we were a little surprised that there wasn&#8217;t some kind of consensus. Instead, it seemed that every test had a slightly different result. The real problem with an ice test is getting around the margin of error: It&#8217;s hard to know if you&#8217;re measuring the temperature of the water or the ice cubes. (Infrared thermometers are also often used, and those <a href="https://blog.thermoworks.com/thermometer/how-to-use-an-infrared-thermometer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only read the surface temperature</a> of the water, not the temperature of the whole bath.) It&#8217;s also tricky to ensure that all your ice is the same temperature going in.</p>
<p>We ultimately decided not to repeat an ice test because the insulation performance is so clearly demonstrated by a hot-water test. If heat coming into the cup is any different than heat escaping, the amount of time it takes for that difference to show is measured in hours. If you really want the best insulation possible to keep ice frozen all day long (or if you want to keep small amounts of liquid nitrogen, or something similar), a sealed narrow-neck bottle is still your best bet.</p>
<h3>Leak test</h3>
<p>In our travel mug tests, we went as far as putting the mugs into a spin dryer to see if they would leak in the most extreme circumstances. By comparison, most tumblers will spill some of your drink when you tip them sideways. We filled each tumbler with water and turned them upside down to see if any of the stoppers actually prevent leaks.</p>

Don't put this in a bag with a laptop, but if you knock it over it's not going to dump your drink.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The RTIC&#8217;s lid is surprisingly secure, given the competition. You can usually hold this cup upside down, or even leave it sitting on a table upside down, and not see more than a few drops. As soon as you shake it or drop it on the floor, though, all bets are off. (The more fluid you have inside, the more explosive the spill will be when the flip-cap pops open.)</p>
<p>Of the two brands that are trying sliders, YETI is fairly successful, while Pelican&#8217;s lid is a hot mess. It&#8217;s not clear exactly what the issue is, since the basics of the mechanism seem the same, but the Pelican lid always dribbled a stream of water when we turned it upside down. The YETI &#8220;Mag Slider&#8221; lid isn&#8217;t as magical as it sounds, but it works fairly well to stop anything more than occasional drips.</p>
<p>Hydro Flask gives you nothing to work with for spill prevention. If you really want the color options and tapered form factor they&#8217;re offering, they do have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07943NMYX/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a straw lid option</a> that might be better at stemming the flow of sticky drinks in case of an accident.</p>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RTIC &#8211; 30-Ounce Insulated Tumbler</a> is the best bargain in this lineup, and it&#8217;s our top pick overall. The stopper actually prevents some spills, and compatible accessories are easy to find. This is an updated version of the RTIC, but the old <a href="https://www.amazon.com/RTIC-30-oz-Tumbler-Pink/dp/B019D9HESO/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">all-metal-no-stopper version</a> is still available.</p>
<p>Without buying and trying out these tumblers, it&#8217;s easy to make assumptions about performance. &#8220;Maybe the steel is thinner,&#8221; you think. &#8220;Maybe the vacuum is actually less of a vacuum.&#8221; Our testing shows, though, that If there&#8217;s anything fancy that other brands are doing to improve theoretical insulation performance, the giant plastic lid is an equalizer that levels the playing field.</p>
<p>In every case we&#8217;ve seen (even among top-class insulating mugs and bottles from Zojirushi, Thermos and Hydro Flask) a big lid means mediocre insulation. Improving the insulation of a tumbler without making the lid area smaller is like adding better insulation to your house while the doorways and windows are sealed with plastic sheets.</p>

<p>So, what is the difference that brings the price down? The plastic &#8220;foot&#8221; on this new RTIC is less tough than the YETI if you drop it on a hard surface, but the difference in price more than makes up for that.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important consideration when it comes to recommending a bargain-priced tumbler is availability: <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-30-Ounce-Double-Wall-Vacuum-Sealed-Tumbler/171452737" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ozark Trail</a>, <a href="https://www.target.com/p/zak-designs-174-30oz-stainless-steel-tumbler/-/A-52542332" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zak! Designs</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Steel-Tumbler-Insulated-Greens/dp/B01AZB6TQW/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BEAST</a> and a dozen other companies are also producing similar tumblers at low price points, but inventory (and new brands) come and go seasonally. RTIC has been around since the beginning of the fake-YETI game, and availability online is always good. That popularity also means that accessories (like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0779M1CBK/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this handle</a>) will actually be designed to fit this cup.</p>
<p>The main feature that bumped this tumbler to the top of our lineup is the spill-proof lid. If you don&#8217;t want the flip-cap to stick up into your face when you&#8217;re drinking, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019D9HESO/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">older version of the RTIC</a> with no stopper is going to be just as good at insulating your drink. Note that the outer dimensions are slightly different; old-style handles don&#8217;t fit new-style mugs with the plastic foot.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The RTIC &#8211; 30-Ounce Insulated Tumbler is a bargain-priced drink vessel that will keep your beverage just as cold (or hot) as other brands.</li>
<li>This flip-up lid stopper is the only option we found that really prevents leaks, though it&#8217;s still not safe to put in a bag.</li>
<li>RTIC compromises on quality very slightly, with some plastic parts, but the vacuum insulation is all that it needs to be.</li>

If you want something better than a budget-priced tumbler, there&#8217;s no way to beat the original <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YETI &#8211; Rambler</a>. YETI didn&#8217;t technically invent this category of drinkware (similar insulated travel mugs have been around for a very long time), but they created a new market with big 30-ounce tumblers targeted at outdoor enthusiasts who loved their coolers for camping and tailgating.</p>
<p>This is not a Yeti thermos: You can easily beat this kind of insulation with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07996C56J/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">narrow-neck bottle from Klean Kanteen</a>, for about the same price. If you want the easy-filling and easy-sipping convenience of a tumbler, YETI has the same performance drawbacks as the other brands.</p>

The magnetic slider is more convenient than a flip-up stopper, but it doesn't make this cup leakproof. The main reason to pick this tumbler is if you've gotta have that logo.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The one category YETI manages to squeak ahead of some competition is in spill prevention. The Rambler&#8217;s slide cover actually stops most (but not all) leakage and only lets drops escape. In comparison, the Pelican will dribble out a stream. The RTIC is more leak-proof, but the YETI really is ready for those times when your friend fires up the motor on the jet boat and you haven&#8217;t finished your drink.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a YETI for coffee that&#8217;s a little different than the classic 30-Ounce Rambler, there&#8217;s also the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BM72ZXT/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YETI &#8211; 14-Ounce Rambler Mug</a> for about $10 less. The small amount of coffee it holds compared to the large lid surface means it&#8217;s only going to keep your coffee hot for about 45 minutes, but compared to six minutes for an open-top ceramic mug for some people this is exactly what they&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>The other case where this is an obvious pick is if you&#8217;re buying a gift. Nothing says &#8220;I only sorta love you&#8221; like a knock-off version of a trendy product. If you know someone who actually wants a YETI, the price difference is worth it.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The YETI &#8211; Rambler is the product that got everyone buzzing about giant insulated cups, and they&#8217;re still the most recognizable.</li>
<li>The price of this tumbler is high, and it doesn&#8217;t keep your drink any hotter or colder than others.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll get drips if you hold the YETI upside down or drop it on the floor, but this lid is good at keeping your drink inside.</li>
</ul>

In many ways, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0769CQYVS/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican &#8211; Traveler</a> hits the optimal price to performance ratio in this lineup, but that doesn&#8217;t make it the best buy.</p>
<p>Pelican is a company that makes quality flight cases for sensitive equipment, and in many ways they&#8217;re like YETI: a small company who established a niche with a specific product, then started building a brand around it. This tumbler is a bit different than the rest, and if you love the screw-on lid with the bigger spout area it&#8217;s a good buy.</p>
<p>The slide-cover lid isn&#8217;t as good at sealing against leaks as YETI&#8217;s lid, though. It dribbles a small stream if you hold the cup upside down. If you really want to keep your drink in, the flip-up lid on the RTIC (or the old-style <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071KW6MRN/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican Snap Lid</a>, which you can still buy in 2018) is a better choice.</p>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079445ZGP/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hydro Flask &#8211; 32 Ounce Insulated Tumbler</a> is a notable contender from one of the big names in the world of insulated drinkware. Many publications give it a win for the sleek profile and brand reputation.</p>
<p>About the only feature that really stands out, though, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07943NMYX/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the straw lid</a>. If you want your insulated tumbler to look like a Big Gulp, this is the way to go. It&#8217;s a hefty price tag, though: The straw lid was a $13 accessory for a $40 tumbler when we checked. The basic lid that comes with the tumbler is claimed to be designed for good insulation, but without even a stopper to keep heat from circulating in and out it doesn&#8217;t make any difference.</p>
<p>If you or the person you&#8217;re buying for already have a Hydro Flask water bottle, buying a matching tumbler for use around the house is a nice touch. They&#8217;re good looking tumblers, but they don&#8217;t perform any better than the other brands to justify the huge price difference.</p>

If you primarily want an insulated cup to drink coffee from, we think a sealed and better-insulated travel mug is a smarter pick than a tumbler. If you want to carry water around with you, likewise, water bottles are better at making water portable while keeping it colder (or hotter.)</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re just looking for the functionality of the classic SOLO party cup with the benefit of better insulation, the double-wall stainless steel vacuum-insulated tumbler checks all the right boxes.</p>
<p>The brand everyone knows is YETI, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">our best buy pick from RTIC</a> beats that cup in two ways: first, RTIC is selling their cup at less than half the price with no loss in performance. Second, the RTIC has a flip-up spout stopper that actually keeps your drink inside, even if you turn it upside down and shake it.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t like the flip-up lid or if you don&#8217;t like supporting imitation products, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the YETI &#8211; Rambler</a> has an updated lid that&#8217;s pretty good at keeping drinks inside without sticking a flap in your nose.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We spent weeks testing ten of the top fans on the market, and found that the Vornado - Vfan blew away the competition. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter weeks of testing, we&#8217;ve determined that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TX79C1O/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage</a> is our current top choice for best fan. Inspired by the company’s original model from 1945, the VFAN Vintage has an authentic vintage look. It operates both powerfully and quietly, which is the combo you want in a bedroom or living room fan. You pay more for the vintage aesthetic and more durable coated metal construction, but if style as well as efficacy is important to you, the Vornado is worth the price. At less than a third the price of our top pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012BL7Z5S/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesis &#8211; Avalon</a> was the second-most powerful fan we tested, yet remains lightweight, relatively quiet and keeps a low profile.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-found">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>There is a wide variety of fans on the market, so we started by researching which fans were best for the home and bedroom. Once we had a list of the top rated fans, we vetted them through reviews on Reddit, Amazon and real testing sites such as The Wirecutter.</p>
<p>With a list of nine finalists, we read through articles on how to measure airflow and designed our testing process with a senior manufacturing engineer with over 15 years of combined experience in the automotive, medical and defense industries.</p>
<p>Once we developed two methods to test wind velocity and circulation and came up with our numbers, we used these fans as any consumer would: to cool down on a hot summer day. In the end, the real world testing influenced our top picks as much as our calculations.</p>
<p>The cooling effect that you feel is not something that can be directly measured since a fan will not cool a room, but it will help lower your body temperature due to evaporative cooling on your skin. If you are looking for a unit that will lower the temperature in the room, you should consider installing an air conditioner. We recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BN38X4D/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Frigidaire &#8211; 8000 BTU</a> as the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-window-air-conditioner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best window air conditioner</a>.</p>

<h2 id="features-to-consider">Features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> You want the style and design of a fan to fit in line with your room and personal needs without spoiling the interior design.</p>
<p><strong>Noise:</strong> Since a fan is often placed in a living room or bedroom, you want it to be quiet enough that you can hold a conversation without shouting. Our 10 fans averaged a reading of 63.86 decibels. (This is about the noise level of the inside of an average restaurant.) Bonus points if the fan has a quiet setting so you can use it to fall asleep at night.</p>
<p><strong>Oscillation:</strong> The ability to push out large volumes of air makes a fan better able to circulate a room. However, even a fan with low CFM (cubic feet per minute) measurements can provide a wide area of coverage if it oscillates.</p>
<p><strong>Removable grill:</strong> A fan can gather dust quickly and push it out into the room. A fan that’s easy to clean, such as one with a removable grill, makes it more likely that you will clean it on a regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>Remote control:</strong> For the sake of convenience, a remote control is handy to have, especially if the fan has remote control housing for storage when not in use. You may never have to leave your couch again.</p>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> The lighter the fan, the easier it is to move around the room or even switch rooms.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-fans">Types of fans we tested</h2>
<p>We reviewed the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-tower-fan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best tower fan</a> in another article, so for this article we focused on the following three types of household fans.</p>
<p><strong>Floor:</strong> A floor fan sits on the floor and tends to be larger than other fans. Since heat rises and the coolest air is at floor level, this will push the cooler air upwards. This makes a floor fan a good choice for home, even though many floor fans are used in industrial applications.</p>
<p><strong>Pedestal:</strong> An oscillating pedestal fan generally has large blades that are capable of cooling larger rooms. All the pedestal fans we tested have an adjustable stand. You can use the adjustable stand to change the height of a pedestal fan, and it usually includes both a remote control and digital display so you can adjust the settings from your couch or bed.</p>
<p><strong>Personal:</strong> Also referred to as a table fan, a personal fan has a small, compact size. This makes it ideal for placing on desks, tables or countertops so you can stay cool in your personal space. It is typically used if you are working at home or situated at an office desk.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >

<h3>Circulation</h3>
<p>Fans can improve air circulation, which means they can move a large volume of air throughout a room. We conducted the circulation test two different ways. First, we used an anemometer and a makeshift wind funnel to measure the rate of air flow. Second, we gauged circulation in a real world setting using testers on hot, humid days with temperatures in the high 80’s.<br />
We used the anemometer to measure the volume of air each fan could move.</p>
<p>Then we averaged the velocities and calculated the air flow rate in cubic feet per minute (CFM), a standard of measurement used in the HVAC industry. To give you an example of airflow measured in CFM, 300 to 400 CFM per ton of cooling is needed for an air conditioning unit to run properly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Capture all the air coming off the fan</strong><br />
We used a trash bag to &#8220;funnel&#8221; all of the air coming off the fan down to an opening of 6&#215;6 inches, then measured the air speed that comes out through the opening of the trash bag in linear feet per minute.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Measure the air speed</strong><br />
To measure the air speed, we turned on the fan to its highest setting, and let it speed up. Then we checked to make sure there wasn’t air blowing out somewhere other than the measured opening. We used our anemometer to measure an average speed for the air coming through the opening in linear feet per minute.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Calculate CFM</strong><br />
To determine the number of cubic feet per minute the fan moves, we multiplied the rate in linear feet by .25 square feet (since a 6&#215;6 inche square is a .5x.5’ square). For example, the GreenTech had a speed of 748.1 feet per minute. Multiplying this number by .25 square feet gave us a CFM of 187. We compared our results to data published by the fan manufacturers, when available.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Conduct real world testing</strong><br />
The above calculations may have little bearing on a decision to purchase a fan. With that fact in mind, we also set up a real world test that is perhaps more useful for the average person.</p>
<p>Our testers sat across the room from a fan to consider its capacity to cool them down and to circulate air. We asked our testers whether they felt cooler, and if it felt like the air was moving around the room in a way that made them feel more comfortable. Then, we recorded their responses.</p>
<p>Once we were armed with data, we compared our numbers to tester responses and looked for correlations. We found that the bigger fans were able to push a higher volume of air, even if the blades are moving more slowly.</p>
<p>The Air King, at 20 inches, outperformed the other finalists both in numbers and real life circulation. The Genesis &#8211; Avalon, at more than half the price of the Air King, pushed out a comparable volume of air. Our other floor fan, the Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage was another top performer. Of the pedestal fans, the Klarstein rated nearly as well as the floor fans.</p>
<p>We were unable to get accurate numbers for the Vornado &#8211; Zippi, which has exposed fabric blades that touched the plastic bag and impeded the air flow.</p>
<h3>Wind velocity</h3>
<p>We tested the peak air speed with an anemometer at a typical distance we&#8217;d use a fan. To capture the speed of an air stream coming off the fan, we used a cardboard “sampling” tube. Our tube measured 3 feet long and 6 inches in diameter. This gave us a straight path for the air that was the same for each test.</p>
<p>We placed each fan so its louvre blades weren&#8217;t blowing air up or down but were parallel to the ground. Then we held the tube parallel to the ground and directly touching the face of the fan to help isolate it from any vortexes. We turn the fan on to its highest setting and measured the wind speed at the end of the tube. We moved both the tube and meter around different parts of the fan and logged the fastest speeds we could capture.</p>
<p>Since this test only measured the speed of a tiny air stream, a high number here from a small fan isn&#8217;t unexpected. However, we found that the wind velocity was higher in our largest fan and our floor fans had the highest speeds.</p>
<p>The Air King reached top speeds of 13.4 miles per hour (MPH), once again outperforming our other finalists. The Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage was a close second at 11.4 MPH, and the Genesis reached top speeds of 10.5 MPH. Among the pedestal fans, the Klarstein performed the best (and was nearly comparable to the floor fans) at 10.3 MPH.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, the personal fans had the lowest speeds. The best performer here was the Holmes at 7.8 MPH.</p>
<h3>Sound test</h3>
<p>The noise of fans are usually calculated as sones, a subjective measurement of how sound is sensed. <strong>The lower the sone rating, the quieter the fan will be.</strong> You may see this number advertised by manufacturers, although more typically this is used with exhaust fans or fans that serve as a backup when an HVAC system doesn’t work properly.</p>
<p>Typically, the sone level is measured at the maximum cubic feet per minute (speed), which we previously tested. You can also convert sone ratings to decibels to give you an example of how loud a fan sounds. For example, a sone rating of 2.0 would have the approximate noise level of a residential area at night.</p>
<p>For a practical sound level measurement, we used a sound decibel meter to measure decibels at an arm’s length away from the grill and set the fan to its highest setting. Unsurprisingly, our personal fans such as the Vornado &#8211; Zippi and Honeywell were the quietest at 48 and 59.8 decibels, respectively. The Holmes was in the mid-range at 64.5 decibels, despite being a personal fan.</p>
<p>The quietest floor fan was the Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage, which was even quieter than the Holmes at 62.4 decibels. The quietest pedestal fan was the Best Choice at 64.6 decibels.</p>
<p>The Air King was exceptionally loud, rating at 79.2 decibels (or approximately the sound of a vacuum from 3 feet away). It also had the most unpleasing acoustics, as it starts out with a rattling sound, and on full speed it buzzes like a swarm of bees.</p>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<p>No matter how quiet or powerful a fan can be, usability is a key factor when choosing a fan that works best for you. For this portion of the testing, we considered how easy it was to interface with the fan, how safe it seemed and how easy it was to keep clean.</p>
<p><strong>Assembly</strong><br />
As we unpacked the boxes, we considered ease of assembly. The floor and personal fans arrived in one piece, while the pedestal fans needed to be assembled. The Klarstein was the easiest of the pedestal fans to assemble, with a two piece grill that snapped together. Both the Rowenta and Best Choice required some complicated maneuvering to fit together. This also became an issue when we cleaned the fans later.</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetics</strong><br />
Once assembled, we considered design and aesthetics. We took note of the unique, modern look of the bladeless GreenTech and the sleek design of the Klarstein (especially compared to the other pedestal fans). In terms of sheer style, the Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage would hold its own with any interior decorating scheme. It is simply a fan meant to be displayed. The Vornado &#8211; Zippi is another fan from the same maker that stands out on a desk.</p>
<p>The Air King, with its rough metal edges and exposed screws, has an unrefined, industrial look that may not vibe in a home setting. The Genesis is comparable to the Air King in terms of size and style, but tends to blend into the background much better.</p>
<p><strong>Stability</strong><br />
The first thing we looked for when we turned the fans on was whether or not each fan kept steady. We placed the pedestal fans on carpet and hard flooring, the personal fans on a desktop and the floor fans on carpet, hard flooring and a kitchen chair (since floor fans should by nature be more versatile in their placement). Nearly all of the fans were stable on their highest setting, the one exception being the Air King, which wobbles on “take off” and then seems to get its bearings.</p>
<p><strong>Cleanability</strong><br />
You don’t have to worry about dust collecting on the blades with the bladeless GreenTech: All you need to do is wipe down the face and base with a soft cloth. If there is any dust accumulation on the back grill, you can clean it with a vacuum. It was the only fan we tested that didn’t require the removal of any parts to clean, making it the most simple.</p>
<p>Two of our personal fans, the Holmes and Honeywell advertise a removable grill that you can easily pop off to dust the blades. However, both models require you to remove the Phillips head screws at the back or base of the grill, so it isn’t as easy as we would have liked.</p>
<p>The grill wire of the Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage can be released from the support tabs using a flat screwdriver, and snapped back into place, making it easier to reach the blades than our other floor models. It is difficult to reach the blades of the Genesis and Air King, since you unscrew the grill to clean and then reassemble it.</p>
<p>For the models that require you to take it apart to clean the blades, we came across several tips from users that may help you reduce the number of times you have to perform a deep clean. Among the tools recommended were canned air, Swiffer dusters and cotton swabs. We also used microfiber cleaning cloths to dust the grill, preemptively removing dust before we needed to clean the blades.</p>
<p><strong>Safety</strong><br />
We initially conceived that we would use a pencil to test safety, by seeing if it would fit through the grate and whether or not it left a mark on the the side of the pencil when stopped by blades. However, after concern that this would damage the fans, we went with a much simpler test: seeing if our pinky finger (roughly the size of a child’s index finger) would fit through the grate with the fan turned off.</p>
<p>Styled after its 1945 predecessor (the fans of those days had more exposed blades), the Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage was the only fan that caused us to raise our eyebrows. Our pinky finger fit a little deeper than we felt safe, were the fan to be on and a child involved. Needless to say, you would want to keep children and pets away from any fan with a moving blade. If you are concerned about safety, the bladeless GreenTech would be your best bet. The Vornado &#8211; Zippi is another safe alternative, with fabric blades that won’t harm little fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Usability</strong><br />
The floor fans and personal fans are fairly straightforward in terms of operation: you use a knob to turn them on. Therefore we didn’t concern ourselves with usability as much as the pedestal fans.</p>
<p>For all the fans, we measured cord length with a ruler, since nobody wants a fan that doesn’t reach their outlets. The cords typically ran to 5 or 6 feet, with several fans on the shorter side of the spectrum at 5 feet. We favored the 6 feet, although the 8-foot cord of the GreenTech was handy. The Air King had 20 feet of cord, which was more than necessary for our home needs.</p>
<p>For the pedestal fans, we interacted with them without reading the user manuals first, to determine whether or not the display symbols were intuitive. Since the pedestal fans came with a remote, we checked the product manuals for specifications and tested whether the remotes worked at the ranges claimed.</p>
<p>The Klarstein was intuitive to interface with, both on the LCD digital display and remote control, despite having multiple settings, speeds and a timer. We especially liked the fact that the remote control had the same dial system to adjust speed as on the fan. Another feature we liked is the auto-dimming display, which turns off automatically after a few moments so you don’t have a distracting glow in your bedroom at night.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, some users have reported that their television remote changes the fan settings. We didn’t experience this with any of the remotes we used around it: television, DVD and Wii.</p>
<p>In comparison, the Best Choice  has an easy to read digital display, but the bright blue light never shuts off, which can make it hard to sleep when placed in a bedroom. The remote control is clearly labeled with words (rather than icons like the Klarstein) and easy to use.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-fan">The best overall: Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage</h2>

<p>If you are looking for a fan with a lot of bells and whistles, you may want to look elsewhere. However, if you want a sturdy and powerful fan that has a neat vintage aesthetic, doesn’t wobble and is quiet and powerful, we highly recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TX79C1O/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage</a>. We tested the VFAN Sr, although the line comes in several sizes and even has a pedestal option.</p>

Most importantly though, it has high power but operates quietly.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TX79C1O/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>For a fan that looks old-fashioned, the VFAN has one of the widest vertical tilt ranges of the fans we tested. It can tilt 180 degrees in either direction; the only thing that stops it from tilting 360 degrees is the cord. It doesn’t oscillate, but it doesn’t need to. The twin air cones, deep-pitched propeller blades and vortex action mean that air moves outward in a spiral, so it travels further. Even before we verified this with our circulation test, we could feel the breeze rippling in all corners of the room.</p>
<p>It is the most expensive fan we tested, but it’s also made with a quality built to last. It has a durable construction and is made with high-quality materials.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Vornado brand has been around since 1945, giving them plenty of time to hone their craft. One thing that hasn’t changed? The retro style of the Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage that recreates the classic look.</li>
<li>You don’t need a degree in aerodynamics to appreciate the effects of the company’s signature vortex action, which pushes out a large volume of air and allows it to travel further.</li>
<li>While it doesn’t oscillate, it has a vertical tilt that beats out nearly all of the other finalists.</li>
<li>Despite a high wind velocity, it is one of the most quiet floor fans we tested.</li>
</ul>

<p>We found that overall, floor fans are more powerful than pedestal fans. But that doesn’t mean you’re out of luck with a pedestal fan. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZYTD184/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klarstein &#8211; Silent Storm</a> delivers consistent high wind speed and circulates air better than the other pedestal fans we tested; in fact, its performance rivaled that of a floor fan. You end up getting the power of a floor fan with the versatility of a pedestal fan. In our opinion, this makes it worth the high price tag (when compared with similar models).</p>
<p>If you like fancy features, you may be especially enticed to buy the Klarstein. One of its coolest features is the comfort mode, which automatically adjusts the speed based on the current room temperature. We also liked the night mode, which turns down the decibels and automatically switches off.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZYTD184/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/klarstein-silent-storm-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/klarstein-silent-storm-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/klarstein-silent-storm-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/klarstein-silent-storm-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/klarstein-silent-storm-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/klarstein-silent-storm-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/klarstein-silent-storm-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/klarstein-silent-storm-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/klarstein-silent-storm.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Runner-up: Klarstein</h3><p>With a setting or speed to fit the bill in any kind of environment, from a natural breeze to full force, the Klarstein is the most versatile fan we tested.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZYTD184/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>In the same vein, the auto-dimming display means there is nothing blinking at you when you try to go to sleep at night, and it makes the design look more sleek during the day. The natural mode, which simulates the wind, was less jarring than in other models with a similar feature.</p>
<p>On the silent mode, it measures only 40.4 decibels, perfect if you want a gentle breeze at night without the noise. It is one of the louder models on full speed, slightly above our average decibel rating, but it didn’t impact our opinion about the Klarstein. We can honestly say that we didn’t find any drawbacks with this fan, although you may want to keep in mind that the price tag is on the high side compared to other fans we tested.</p>
<p>The Klarstein comes with 26 different speed settings, and w<span style="font-weight: 400;">hile 26 settings may be more than any user actually needs, we loved being able to give the dial a quick spin to easily land within the range we wanted (high, medium, low). The multiple settings are thanks to the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">brushless DC motor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (BLDC), which gives you a wide speed range due to a linear torque curve. BLDC motors have higher efficiency, run quietly and have a long service life &#8212; all features you look for in a quality fan. </span></p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A powerful 16-inch fan on a tilt-resistant base, the Klarstein &#8211; Silent Storm is a strong performer with a sleek look.</li>
<li>The height can be adjusted by up to 6 inches, and the vertical tilt adjusted by 30 degrees. It also has 90-degree oscillation. With all these options, you can direct the wind stream where ever you need it to go.</li>
<li>Change speed settings (up to 26) with an easy to use control wheel on either the unit or the remote control.</li>
<li>It has a brushless DC motor and operates on 35W, so it is economical even at its highest speeds.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012BL7Z5S/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesis &#8211; Avalon</a> is a fitting choice for households that move their fan from room to room. It has a lightweight construction, weighing only 8 pounds, and features an easy-carry handle. For something so lightweight, we were pleasantly surprised at how stable it is on the floor or a table (especially given its high wind speeds). When bumped into, it doesn’t knock over easily, either.</p>

<p>It has a 360-degree vertical tilt, so you can push a large amount of air (it tested as our second highest rated fan in terms of volume) into the room at whatever angle you wish. It has a durable copper motor, so not only does it reach high wind speeds, it has a reputation for lasting a long time. This makes the low price even more exceptional.</p>
<p>The design is fairly minimalist, encased in a hard black plastic, but it certainly won’t clash with your decor. It blends in to any area it is placed. We also appreciated the tightly spaced grill, which keeps small prying hands away from the blades.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will say that this fan&#8217;s low price is somewhat evident in its design. It’s harder to clean the blades of the Genesis, and the all-plastic construction makes it feel and look more flimsy than our other top picks.</span></p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In terms of volume and wind speed, the Genesis &#8211; Avalon was the second most powerful fan we tested.</li>
<li>At just 8 pounds, it is exceptionally lightweight for such a powerful fan.</li>
<li>Able to pivot a full 360 degrees, you can direct the air stream anywhere you choose, even directly up or down.</li>
<li>With well covered blades and a <a href="https://www.ul.com/aboutul/what-we-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UL approved</a> safety fused plug, you can feel comfortable with its safety features.</li>

<h3>Holmes &#8211; Lil Blizzard</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000J07RMU/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Holmes &#8211; Lil Blizzard</a> is perfectly sized to fit on your desk, helping you circulate air so you can feel comfortable and work more efficiently. After all, you can’t type with two hands if you’re fanning yourself with one. It isn’t the quietest personal fan, but it isn’t so loud that your office mates would complain. It oscillates smoothly, can be tilted up or down (30 degrees in either direction) and can be locked in place.</p>

<p>It can also be easily used on a bedside table to cool yourself at night or on a kitchen counter to offset the heat from cooking. It’s priced low enough you could buy more than one, and it’s lightweight enough to easily move around if you want to save space.</p>
<h3>Air King &#8211; 9212</h3>
<p>You could say the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007Q3RHK/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Air King &#8211; 9212</a> blows away the competition in terms of wind speed and air flow you could say it will blow you across the room. The Air King has tremendous power, but it feels like overkill as a fan for home. It also has a three-pronged outlet, unlike our other fans. If you have an open space office or a garage that would benefit from powerful air circulation, this is a good option.</p>

<p>When you first start up the Air King, it makes a rattling sound and wobbles, but then it settles into a normal albeit loud whirring sound. For this reason, we did not choose the Air King for our top pick, despite its winning performance.</p>
<h3>GreenTech &#8211; PureFlow</h3>
<p>The aesthetic of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072PS3FR1/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GreenTech</a> is ultra modern — in fact, with its sphere shape and shiny white casing, it looks more like a futuristic cartoon character (specifically, EVE from Disney’s WALL-E) than a traditional fan.</p>
<p>We can’t say enough about our comfort level with the bladeless design, and we felt it was safe enough to be in an area where young children are playing, without worrying they would attempt to stick their fingers through a grate and touch the blade.</p>
<p>The digital controls are easy to use, so you can figure them out without the use of the manual. The remote control is simple to use as well, and has a long range so it can be used from the other side of a large room.</p>
<p>The speeds range from 1 to 12. It’s not that powerful on its highest speed (at 10” across, it has a smaller face than the average 16 inches), but it circulates well, and you can feel the breeze from across the room. Despite the safety and usability of this fan, we didn’t feel it had enough wind speed to recommend it as our top pick.</p>
<p>What we loved about the digital controls on this fan is that it remembers the last setting you used, so if it was on speed 10 when you turned it off, it will be on speed 10 when you turn it on again.</p>
<h3>Rowenta &#8211; VU5551</h3>
<p>In its turbo-boost mode, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C4QP8N2/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rowenta<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></a>had strong wind speeds and was able to push a decent amount of air (just above average when compared with our other finalists). Unfortunately, with only mid-range power, it was the second loudest of the fans we tested. It advertises a top decibel rating of 57, although we recorded it at 68.1. The remote control and unit are easy to interface with, and the fan is easy to adjust.</p>
<p>The downsides to the Rowenta are that there is no on-board storage for the remote control and the front grill is extremely difficult to remove and reposition (making cleaning a chore). It also has a blue light that stays on all night. For these reasons, and the fact that it is slightly less powerful than our top picks, we didn’t name this our best pick.</p>
<h3>Vornado &#8211; Zippi</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000E19MQ8/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vornado &#8211; Zippi</a> is definitely a conversation starter. Available in black, white or a variety of bright colors, the Zippi has a unique look. It is reminiscent of an airplane propeller, with three blades made of soft nylon fabric. The blades are safe to touch even when the fan is in motion. It weighs only 1.7 pounds (our lightest fan) and folds compact, making it an ideal travel companion.</p>
<p>It’s the quietest fan we tested, but it also had the lowest wind speed. We weren’t able to test the CFM due to the way the fan is constructed, although we did notice it is light on power. This took it out of the running for first place. Still, we think it’s pretty cute.</p>
<p>Some users have reported if you tilt it all the way back on the highest setting, it will flip over. We didn’t experience this issue, however.</p>
<h3>Honeywell &#8211; HT900 Turbo</h3>
<p>We can see why the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001R1RXUG/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Honeywell</a> is a best seller on Amazon. It’s very basic, but it can pivot to a 90-degree angle and pushes out a large volume of air for its small stature. The Honeywell uses its proprietary Turbo Force Air Circular technology to achieve this effect. It’s one of the quietest fans we tested, so it’s great for a small bedroom.</p>
<p>It’s slightly big for a desktop fan but not enough air flow to place more than a few feet away from where you need it. This makes it a good fan, especially for the price, but prevented it from being labelled our number one.</p>
<p>Despite measuring at a loudness of only 64.6 decibels (close to our average decibel rating), the Best Choice makes clicking, popping and occasional grinding noises when in use. We also found the so-called “wind mode” to be a little disconcerting; it felt as if power were fading in and out, as if it were coming loose from the plug. Finally, the construction left something to be desired, and the LCD digital display never shuts off. For these reasons, we didn’t name the Best Choice as a top pick.</p>
<p>However, given its low price in comparison with the other pedestal fans, it may still be worth considering. If you just need a fan to get you through a brief period, the Best Choice is a decent fan in terms of circulation, breeze and ease of use.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>With any of our top choices, you can feel confident you’ll be purchasing a high-caliber product. They all have high wind speeds, push out a large volume of air and are constructed from durable, quality materials. The best choice for you when it comes to a fan depends on your personal preferences and budget.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TX79C1O/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage</a> is a great choice for those who have a strong sense of style and want a fan that circulates air in a tornado air stream that reaches all corners of the room.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a pedestal fan that can be adjusted to direct a strong air stream to where you need, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZYTD184/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klarstein &#8211; Silent Storm</a> is an excellent choice. It’s the most versatile fan we tested, with multiple modes and speeds. It can be set to a night-time mode that is ultra quiet and shuts off after a set amount of time, making it an ideal fan for the bedroom.</p>
<p>If budget is highest on your list of considerations, you’ll appreciate the relative low price of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012BL7Z5S/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesis &#8211; Avalon</a>. The Genesis is a steal, and you won’t have to sacrifice power.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-pick">How to pick a window air conditioner</h2>
<p>Window air conditioners are the most economical way to cool a room. <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-portable-air-conditioner/" rel="noopener">Portable air conditioners</a> are popular because they&#8217;re versatile and can vent out of almost any window, but window-specific units are typically 30 percent more efficient, since all the heat-generating parts of the air conditioner sit outside your house. They&#8217;re also much easier to install than a wall-mounted &#8220;mini-split&#8221; system.</p>
<p>Choosing a cooling capacity that’s right for your room is crucial for long-term comfort and reliability. Your Best Digs works and tests in the mildly dry climate of Southern California, so we sought out an expert from more humid regions to get the scoop on humidity and AC performance.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Ciresi, owner of <a href="http://www.aireserv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aire Serv Heating &amp; Air Conditioning</a> in Louisville, says that oversized AC units are a big problem.</strong> “First,” Richard says, “heating and air conditioning units are sized for the hottest and coldest days of the year. On a moderate day they often don’t run long enough to remove the excess moisture from the air.</p>
<p>“Second, some homeowners and even some contractors still believe in the &#8216;bigger is better&#8217; concept, which further exacerbates the problem.&#8221; We asked Richard if the opposite is true with AC units that are too small, and it is!</p>
<p>“An undersized unit,” he says, “may not be able to lower the ambient temperature to the desired set point on extremely hot days, but moisture removal will be improved. You’re better off both health- and utility-wise with a slightly warmer, dry home than the damp &#8216;cave-like&#8217; conditions that occur when the equipment is oversized.“</p>
<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>This is a tricky category to research. Retailers often keep dozens of listings for each manufacturer, and they don’t make it immediately clear which models are current-year updates or what the other differences might be.</p>
<p>We combed through retailer listings and called a few sales representatives to decode the model numbers for top air conditioner brands to find the most recent models. We considered testing some old models that had been well-reviewed by other publications, especially the Haier &#8211; Serenity model <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-air-conditioner/#upgrade-quieter-but-pricier" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that’s won awards for quiet performance</a>, but even that model is now discontinued and out of stock.</p>
<p><strong>We only tested models current for the 2018 season, no old stock or discontinued models.</strong> If you see more customer reviews of other models from the same manufacturers that have different model numbers, that&#8217;s the reason. Hopefully these models will remain easy to find for a while. Pricing will change throughout the year, but typically the up-to-date design is actually cheaper to buy.</p>
<p>Our testing picks centered on brands with a proven track record of making reliable and high-performance air conditioners. Older versions of the machines we tested have all won awards from sites like <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-air-conditioner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wirecutter</a> or <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/window-air-conditioners/best-window-air-conditioners-for-hot-days-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Reports</a>.</p>
<p>We only tested models that meet the <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/sites/default/files/ENERGY%20STAR%20Final%20Version%204.0%20Room%20Air%20Conditioners%20Specification.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Energy Star efficiency rating</a>. This label means the product is at least 10 percent better than the mandated minimum efficiency and can move at least 12 BTUs of heat out of your house for every watt-hour of electricity. These models also have an “energy-saver” mode that turns the fan off when it’s not actually working to maintain the set temperature.</p>
<p>Our typical strategy for choosing products includes sifting customer reviews and owner discussion groups to see if people have had problems with a particular model. That strategy wasn&#8217;t as easy to implement here, since we’re picking a model that’s brand-new and two others that don’t have nearly as many reviews as older models from the same companies. Appliance reviews are also especially tricky with air conditioners, since so much about the unit’s performance can change depending on what room you put it in.

<h2 id="how-to-install">How to install a window air conditioner</h2>
<p>The biggest variable in window unit installation is going to be your window. <strong>Almost all of the window air conditioners available are designed for “double-hung” windows with vertical window sliders.</strong> The slider pane rests behind a bracket and provides a stable and secure brace to keep the air conditioner from falling out of your window, and in most windows it’s easy to fill the gap on either side of your AC unit with the included expanding baffle “wing” curtains. Minimum size requirements are important to note but are not hard to match with most windows.</p>
<p>The install is pretty simple. Most window sills should be able to support the air conditioner without extra steps, though the kits include brackets or suggest ways to add bracing if you’ve got a storm window that prevents the AC unit from sitting right. One important step to note is making sure that your air conditioner tilts down slightly at the back, since that’s how it drains excess water outside instead of onto your floor.</p>

<p>Once you get the included foam sealing tape in place and attach the wings that will fill gaps on the sides, hoisting the unit into place is the hardest part. (We like that the Frigidaire is only 53 pounds, it’s definitely the easiest to lift out of the box.) Resting a bit precariously in the frame as you steady it with one hand (or a helper), the air conditioner is secure as soon as you slide the inside window sash into place to brace it.</p>
<p>After that, it’s just a matter of adding stop-braces to make sure nobody accidentally opens the window. It&#8217;s also recommended that you finish up with insulating panels and tape to close any gaps and make sure your cold air doesn’t get out.</p>
<h3>Installing a sliding or casement window air conditioner</h3>
<p>In comparison, to stay secure in a horizontal sliding window, the unit has to use some sort of brace or shelf against your exterior wall. There’s also going to be a big gap above the air conditioner that you’ll have to fill. Install kits included with slider-window AC units vary in how complete they are, but even the best kits require a lot of measuring, drilling holes and sawing a plastic window insert to size.</p>
<p>Casement windows that pivot open on a hinge with a crank are even more complicated to fit, though air conditioners designed for horizontal slides are often also designed for casement windows.</p>
<p>If you’re set on a window air conditioner for your slider window, a purpose-built model is going to be easier to work with than adapting a regular window air conditioner. We wouldn’t blame you for trying to come up with a DIY solution, though; models for horizontal sliders come at double the price, and they aren’t updated as frequently. (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B4XUU2O/?tag=ybdwac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The top casement-window model from Frigidaire has a model number from four years ago.</a>)</p>
<p>Through-the-wall installation is even less common, but Friedrich designed their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GM328Z4/?tag=ybdwac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">high-end Chill series</a> (our pick for best quiet air conditioner) to work equally well in vertical sliding windows and through-the-wall installation by making it easy to slide the outer housing on and off and keeping the vents at the back of the unit.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>We tried to follow the installation instructions as best we could and managed to do a one-man install of each unit without losing any parts or dropping any of the units out the window. Installation wasn’t identical, as each model uses a slightly different method for centering, sealing and securing the windows, but you could probably swap the parts from one install kit to another without problems.</p>
<p>Curiously, the LG and Friedrich units come with very similar installation booklets. There’s almost certainly some relationship between these Texan and Korean companies, despite all the differences in the actual performance and features of their air conditioners.</p>
<p><strong>Frigidaire easily wins our pick for easiest install just on account of how much more compact it is.</strong> Friedrich’s install kit is the most complete and versatile if you’ve got a tricky situation like a through-the-wall install, and it was nice that the outer “sleeve” housing could be completely secured before we slid the heavy internals into place. For most people, though, the easy-to-lift Frigidaire is the way to go (53 pounds compared to Friedrich’s 64).</p>
<h3>Performance test</h3>

<p>After installing each air conditioner in a 115-square-foot bedroom, we ran it in the hottest and most controlled environment we could create. We started each test by running two space heaters and the apartment’s central heating to get the room up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit, then letting it stabilize at 85 each time before powering on the AC. Outside temperatures during testing were between 65 and 70 degrees.</p>
<p>We tested these air conditioners in March rather than July or August, but we were happy to see that our controls gave a stable and consistent performance comparison with similar conditions across the three tests.</p>
<p>We logged the temperature and humidity in the room with an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H3669T4/?tag=ybdwac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Elitech &#8211; GSP-6</a> for an hour after turning on each air conditioner to see how it would respond to the initial heat and how it would cycle after that initial drop to maintain a steady temperature.</p>
<p>Performance, as expected, was quite similar, but not identical between the three models. These are all capable of cooling the rated 350-square-foot room, but in repeated testing we could see that the Frigidaire is able to respond more quickly and bring down the room temperature right away when you turn it on.</p>
<h3>Humidity performance</h3>
<p>As previously mentioned, if you’re running any of these air conditioners in a room that’s smaller than what they’re designed for, you’ll get a damp, humid environment if the air cools off too quickly. Fortunately, each one also has a “dry” operating mode that runs the AC for longer and at a slower fan speed to pull out more moisture.</p>
<p>If you’re running an AC in an extra-humid climate and your room is on the smaller edge of the room-size categories, the fact that the LG and Friedrich air conditioners are a little bit slower to cool means that your humidity and comfort level will be a little bit more stable on the full-blast AC mode. They’re rated for an extra 0.3 pints per day of water removed from your air, though the specifics of how well each model will do can change depending on what settings you choose.</p>
<h3>Noise testing</h3>

<p>We ran each air conditioner in the same room using the same sound pressure measurement equipment: a PC running <a href="https://www.roomeqwizard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REW v1.58</a> with a calibrated measurement mic mounted to a stand six feet away from the window. We measured using the standard “A” weighting scale, which means the system factors an annoying high-pitch whine more heavily than a low-pitch rumble.</p>
<p>The sound of the compressors turning on in all of these units was less dramatic than we expected, and the fan noise made up the biggest difference between them. We’d say that these are all good performers with only 60 dBA at the maximum.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, Frigidaire is the worst performer by the numbers, but the quality that doesn&#8217;t come across on this chart is a slightly-annoying ticking or buzzing that comes from the fan on the LG. If you need a quiet fan setting but don&#8217;t want to shell out for the Friedrich, the LG is an alternative; we think the smoother-though-louder sound of the Frigidaire&#8217;s fan is better for most people.</p>
<p>We were expecting to see better noise performance with the more expensive Friedrich &#8211; Chill air conditioner, but the actual difference in testing was shockingly good. If you’re installing a window unit in a bedroom and you can afford to spend a little bit more, the 7 dBA difference will seem about half as loud. (On the logarithmic decibel scale, sound doubles in perceived loudness every 10 dB.)</p>
<h3>Comfort and accuracy</h3>
<p>Tracking the performance of each air conditioner over our tests also means that we can compare the consistency and accuracy of the thermostats they use to turn the compressor on and off.</p>
<p>The Friedrich thermostat was the least accurate, with an average temperature of two degrees hotter than the set 70 degrees, but it also had the least “swing” from hotter to colder than the set temperature, running whenever the room hit 73 and cooling until it got just above the set temperature.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Frigidaire &#8211; FFRE0833U1</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11579" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/frigidaire-window-ac-grey.jpg" alt="Frigidaire AC" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>The 8,000 BTU Frigidaire &#8211; FFRE0833U1 is our favorite air conditioner for beating the summer heat. In our testing it ranked top for performance and it was the easiest to install, and it has some cool features that you can’t get anywhere else.</p>
<p>Frigidaire has a long pedigree going back to <a href="http://www.findingdulcinea.com/features/science/innovations/great-inventions/the-refrigerator.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the very first self-contained refrigeration systems</a> in 1915. They’ve been doing room air conditioning for a long time, and their products continue to shine. This is a 2018 update that was just released as we started our research for this review, and it’s encouraging to know that this is an updated design, though it doesn’t seem like any significant features have changed over the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B4XUQI2/?tag=ybdwac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">833S1</a> from 2016.</p>

Frigidaire knows how to build an AC, but they’re also competitive on price. Pick a model that’s the right size for your room and you’ll have the best performance you can get.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BN38X4D/?tag=ybdwac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The real distinction between these models is performance. We used a Kill-A-Watt electricity meter to monitor performance, and the Frigidaire draws about 34 watts more electricity than the LG on high, but cooled our room at an average of -2.7 degrees per minute instead of just a -1.4 degree change for the LG.</p>
<p>That change in cooling performance should more than offset any difference in power draw, and the efficiency rating for both machines is the same, which indicates that official lab testing shows that they move the same amount of heat per watt of power used. In our small testing room, we just got our cool air much more quickly with the Frigidaire.</p>
<p>This also means a bit wider of a thermostat overshoot than LG: The lowest temperature we saw with the thermostat set to 70° was 67.6°, compared to 68.5° for the LG. Most of us aren’t trying to maintain a specific accurate temperature so much as to cool a room quickly and efficiently, so we won’t count this as a major fault, but it’s something to note.</p>
<p>Frigidaire’s most interesting feature is a “remote sensing” thermostat that uses the temperature of the remote to trigger the air conditioner, rather than the air in front of the window.</p>
<p>This means that if you have a big picture window or other hot-spot you’re trying to cool, you can help keep the Frigidaire from shutting off before you’re ready to give up the cool blast. We found this far more useful than the Wi-Fi features offered by LG. The only letdown is that the sensor on the remote reads about 4 degrees too hot, which means it would probably run for longer than it needs to if you’re trying to reach a specific temperature like 72 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>The Frigidaire window air conditioner is solid but also subtle. The fan makes noise when it blows, but it’s a consistent enough sound that we had to recheck a bunch of times to be sure the compressor was running. This AC is 1 dBA louder than the LG at max output, but the fan noise is smoother.</p>
<p>The airflow from the fan is strong, and the air it blows is cold, so at a price that’s the same or better than the competition, it’s hard to imagine a compelling reason to pick a different model.</p>
<p>The 8,000 BTU capacity we tested is the most popular size since it covers the widest range of common room sizes. If you’re cooling a space smaller than 250 square feet, check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076QM34LC/?tag=ybdwac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">5,000 BTU model.</a> If you&#8217;ve got a suitable window in a big room that&#8217;s 300-450 square feet, look for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BN3MB6Z/?tag=ybdwac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">10,000 BTU model</a>.

<p>The Friedrich &#8211; Chill CP08G10B is the 8,000 BTU model of the company’s most popular line, and it’s a step up from our top pick in luxury and quality, though not in absolute performance.</p>
<p>When we talk about luxury in an air conditioner, we’re talking about more than just good-looking industrial design (though Friedrich has that, too). The big factors for comfort are noise and temperature stability, and this AC has both.</p>
<p>Even at full blast, Friedrich’s noise level on this 8,000 BTU model is well below the 55 dBA level where an appliance starts to compete with you when you’re having a conversation in the room.</p>

The slower-moving air won’t cool down your room as quickly, but it will keep the temperature steady without distracting you.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GM328Z4/?tag=ybdwac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>With the compressor off and the fan on low, the measured average was 47 dBA, and that’s quieter than most oscillating room fans. It’s a smooth, consistent background noise even when the compressor kicks on, which makes this design perfect for a large bedroom. (<strong>Go for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GM3259S/?tag=ybdwac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">6,000 BTU model</a> if you’ve got a 150- to 300-square-foot room, or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SMMZHRE/?tag=ybdwac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">5,000 BTU model</a> to suit smaller rooms.</strong>)</p>
<p>The Friedrich thermostat was technically the least accurate we tested, with an average temperature of two degrees hotter than the set 70 Fahrenheit compared to half a degree either side for the other models. It had far less “swing” from hot to cold when run over a long period of time, though. The Friedrich would run whenever the room hit 73 and cool until it got just above the set 70, compared to a 6-degree swing with the Frigidaire. So long as you’re buying a unit that’s the right size for your room, that’s just about as perfect as it gets.</p>
<p>Friedrich was also the only manufacturer to make provisions for installing their units through-the-wall rather than in a window. The outer shroud comes right off when you remove four screws, so you can pre-install all of the screws and braces before you add the weight of the actual machine.</p>
<p>This is a good thing, because it’s 11 pounds heavier that the Frigidaire, and quite a bit longer so that the exhaust fan can clear the sides of a through-the-wall install. The install hardware also includes adjustable leveling feet so that you can be sure the condensation will drain properly.</p>
<p>Friedrich also includes an auto-swing fan option for those who don’t like having all their cold air focused on one spot. How useful this is will depend on your room, but it’s good to have the option.</p>
<p>The Friedrich remote doesn’t have the fancy remote-sensor thermostat that makes Frigidaire’s AC more flexible, but they did include a wall mounting bracket so your remote won’t get buried in a drawer.</p>
<p>Friedrich’s air conditioners don’t have built-in Wi-Fi, and they’re definitely more expensive. The Texas-based company is competing to offer you exactly what you need with design that does its job quietly and efficiently. They’ve accomplished that and still managed to come in well under the list price of Frigidaire’s <a href="https://www.frigidaire.com/Home-Comfort/Air-Conditioning/Window-Mounted-AC/FGRQ0833U1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Gallery” air conditioner</a> (which should also be quiet).</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GM328Z4/?tag=ybdwac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Friedrich &#8211; Chill CP08G10B</a> is the quietest model we’ve tested, about half as loud as the competition.</li>
<li>Cooling performance isn’t as quick as our top pick, but it will keep your room’s temperature steady.</li>
<li>This is a more expensive AC unit, but not as expensive as Frigidaire’s premium-label Gallery model.</li>
<li>The through-the-wall installation option is unique in residential window units.</li>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XH1T138?tag=ybdwac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LG &#8211; LW8017ERSM</a> is not a bad air conditioner by any means. If you can’t find the Frigidaire and can’t afford the Friedrich, this is a solid replacement pick. The two things that kept this air conditioner from a recommendation are noise and performance.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, this makes less sound energy than our top-pick Frigidaire. The difference is most pronounced on the lowest fan setting, where the sound level drops to 50 dBA when the compressor turns off. When the compressor turns back on, though, that goes up to basically the same level as the Frigidaire. That means the sound of the compressor turning on and off will be more noticeable, which is more jarring even if the average sound level is lower.</p>
<p>The fan noise from the LG is also slightly more irritating than the Frigidaire’s, with a very slight-but-consistent buzzing or ticking quality to the drone of the fan. It’s not bad enough that we think it’s a broken part or obstruction, but it’s noticeable.</p>
<p>For performance, the LG is steady and stable enough to compete with the Friedrich, but it can’t keep up with Frigidaire. LG only managed an average temperature change of -1.49 degrees per minute in our small-ish test room, meaning if you come home and it’s 90 degrees in your house, it’ll take even longer to cool the 300-square-foot room this unit was designed for.</p>
<p>Slower performance can be an advantage if you’re more concerned with pulling moisture out of the air than with cooling off, but all of these models have a “dry” mode, which will accomplish that very nicely by slowing down the fan. The fact that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BN38X4D/?tag=ybdwac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Frigidaire’s</a> air conditioner is lighter and easier to install basically seals LG’s fate for this round.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you don’t have central air conditioning, installing a window unit can be a cheap way to get some relief in one room. A window unit is always going to be more efficient than a portable, and if you’ve got a vertically sliding window, then a window air conditioner is easy to install.</p>
<p>Air conditioners are tested for efficiency and the performance labelling is pretty tightly regulated, so the biggest differences you’ll find are in noise level. The very quietest model we found is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GM328Z4/?tag=ybdwac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Friedrich &#8211; Chill</a>, if you can afford to spend about 60 percent more than you would for most models in this size.</p>
<p>Frigidaire has this recommendation locked up, though. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BN38X4D/?tag=ybdwac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FFRE0833U1 8,000 BTU window air conditioner</a> is easier to install and delivers the best cooling performance when you need it. The smooth-sounding fan isn’t technically as quiet as LG’s, but we prefer it, and the second thermostat on the remote is just plain brilliant.</p>

<p><em>(Editor&#8217;s note: In October 2019, we learned that two of the ice makers we tested had been discontinued: Ivation and ThinkGizmos. We checked the manufacturers of the other portable ice makers we reviewed, and although the Frigidaire &#8211; EFIC108 is no longer available on the company&#8217;s website, many retailers are still selling it. For this update, we tested the Hamilton Beach &#8211; 86150, the company&#8217;s latest model. See our review below.)</em></p>
<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>We began our research by familiarizing ourselves with how a portable ice maker works. We watched videos online and then turned to the subreddit /r/Frugal, which provided insight into what consumers are actually looking for in a portable ice maker.</p>
<p>Most other review sites don&#8217;t actually conduct real testing of products, so we relied heavily on Amazon reviews to determine which portable ice makers consumers considered to be the best.</p>
<p>Finally, we chose highly rated products that were also different from one another. This actually proved to be quite difficult for such a niche product, the reasons for which we discuss in the section below: “Rebranding and knock-off machines.”</p>

<h2>Why a portable ice maker?</h2>
<p>As every host knows, ice &#8212; and plenty of it &#8212; is a must-have for any party. Even if you&#8217;ve got great beverage containers like those we chose in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-insulated-tumbler/">insulated tumbler review</a> or <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/#best-insulated-water-bottle">insulated water bottle review</a>, ice is essential for keeping any drink as cold as possible. If you&#8217;re grilling outside on a hot day, the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-lunch-box/">best lunch boxes</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">coolers with the best insulation</a> will still need ice to protect uncooked food from entering the bacteria-incubating danger zone.</p>
<p>A portable ice maker makes ice over 20 times faster than a freezer, so you&#8217;ll always have it on hand and won&#8217;t have to make an ice-run in the middle of a cocktail party. If you buy ice frequently in 10-pound bags at the 7-11, then you&#8217;ll be pleased to know that a portable ice maker can make you the same amount for a fraction of the price.</p>
<h2>Countertop vs. under counter models</h2>
<h3>Portable ice maker</h3>
<p>Portable (or countertop) ice makers are about the size of a bread maker.  They plug into a standard outlet and require no drainage system or connection to a water line like under-the-counter ice makers. You simply fill them with water, select the size of ice you want and press start. They can store roughly 1 to 2 pounds at a time, depending on the size of its ice tray and how well the ice maker is insulated.</p>
<p>Portable ice makers are  less expensive than under-the-counter ice makers. They&#8217;re also quicker at producing ice, and the bullet-shaped pieces of opaque ice they make are smaller and thus melt quicker in your drink.</p>
<h3>Under-the-counter ice maker</h3>
<p>Under-the-counter ice makers, as the name implies, are installed between kitchen cabinets and need to be hooked up to a water line and a drain. They&#8217;re more expensive than portable ice makers, but they have several benefits that portable units don&#8217;t have.</p>
<p>First, you won&#8217;t need to add water, since it&#8217;s added automatically. They also produce double the amount of ice &#8212; up to 60 pounds &#8212; and the ice stays frozen longer because the under-the-counter ice makers are well insulated.

<p>There are basically just a couple of models of portable ice makers that are branded under many different names.  Keep this in mind when you&#8217;re browsing on Amazon or elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Aesthetic:</strong> Although many of the shapes and functions are similar, the overall look of an ice maker is important. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N1GEX2Y/?tag=ybdice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NewAir</a> has several brightly colored models, while <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B074VFTRV3/?tag=ybdice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Della</a> has a cleaner, sleeker look that might pair better with other kitchen appliances.</p>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> Check the dimensions and weight to make sure it will fit on your countertop or whether it can be easily transported from one location to another.</p>
<p><strong>Ice production:</strong> A crucial element in a portable ice maker is how quickly ice is produced. For a cocktail party, figure about one pound per person. Our chart below shows the differences in ice produced by the models we tested.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7932" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size.png" alt="ice production chart by ice size" width="1801" height="1111" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size.png 1801w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-610x376.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-1500x925.png 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-768x474.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-885x546.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-300x185.png 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-295x182.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-1000x617.png 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-360x222.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-375x231.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-414x255.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-320x197.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-768x474@2x.png 1536w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ice-production-size-300x185@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><strong>Storage capacity:</strong> Storage capacity is another key component. Generally, portable ice makers produce 1.5 to 2 pounds per hour at which point, the ice tray needs to be emptied for another batch of ice can be made.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Cost definitely plays a role. Check out the energy efficiency of each ice maker to see which produces ice at the smallest cost to you (most units make ice at less than two cents per pound).</p>
<p><strong>Noise:</strong> Another thing to keep in mind, as with all machines, is how much noise it makes while making ice. Naturally, the quieter the better, and most of the models we tested were at about the same noise level.</p>
<h3>How to make ice in a portable ice maker</h3>
<p>Making ice in a portable ice maker is a simple process. Once you&#8217;ve plugged it in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the lid, remove the ice tray and fill the tank with filtered water to the “Max” line, about 8-10 cups depending on the model.</li>
<li>Put the ice tray back in, and close the lid.</li>
<li>Push the “ON” button, and select the size of ice you’d like. The default is “large,” but we found that to be the slowest for ice production.</li>
</ul>
<p>Portable ice makers have very few options beyond &#8220;on&#8221; and off&#8221; and size selections. Other LED notifications are “Add water” and “Full ice,” which will light up when it&#8217;s time to add water or empty the ice tray.</p>

<p><strong>Ice making ability:</strong> The ice makers we tested were supposed to be able to produce 26 pounds of ice per day (28 pounds for the NewAir)  We compared the actual production by adding 8 cups of water to each ice maker and timed how long it took to make both large and small ice capsules.</p>
<p>We transferred the ice to a container and let it melt completely. We then measured out the water and used its volume to calculate its weight (1 milliliter of water is equal to 1 gram). This gave us the total mass of the ice produced. So depending on the time it took to make and how much was made, we were able to calculate the amount of ice that each machine could produce in 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Insulation and temperature:</strong> We indirectly measured the insulation of each machine by how well the ice stayed frozen until the tray was full. This was a major variable, as some ice makers, like the Ivation, had insufficient isolation, and the ice began to melt before the cycle was completed.</p>
<p><strong>Storage:</strong> We tested how much water each machine could hold and how much ice it would produce. Generally the total amount of water exceeded the ice storage capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Size and portability:</strong> We measured and weighed each unit to see if they matched the manufacturer&#8217;s specs.  We also noted how easy or not it was to transport the ice maker from place to place. There actually wasn&#8217;t much difference between the units, varying by approximately 5 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Energy and sound:</strong> We checked each manufacturer&#8217;s claim of the amount of energy each ice maker actually used and also measured its noise level in decibels.</p>

<p>We measured how quickly ice was made and how long it took to fill the ice tray. We then made rudimentary calculations to compare the ice to a 10-pound bag from the supermarket.</p>

<p><strong>Melting time:</strong> The first melting measurement also took into consideration the size and thickness of the ice and the thickness of the unit&#8217;s insulation. We also timed how long one and two batches of ice took to melt in a glass with 12 ounces of water.</p>
<p><strong>Ice size and cooling speed:</strong> This test worked in tandem with the melting time as we looked at how much the temperature of the 12-ounce glass of water changed once all of the ice melted.</p>
<p><strong>Taste:</strong> This depends largely on the water used (we recommend filtered water). In some reviews consumers complained that the ice had a &#8220;taste.&#8221; We found that any off-taste was gone after a first full run and a thorough cleaning of the machine.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B074VFTRV3/?tag=ybdice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Della &#8211; 048-GM-48186 </a>is the best overall portable ice maker simply because it made the most ice the quickest and with the most consistency. The Della outperformed its competitors on both the large (26 pounds/day) and small (19 pounds/day) settings. Though the Frigidaire was a close second, averaging about a third of a pound less per day on both settings, the Della flat out won.</p>

The Della made ice the fastest and with the most consistency, and it's markedly less expensive than other ice makers.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074VFTRV3/?tag=ybdice-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>On average, ice production on the small setting yielded almost 7 pounds more per day than the large setting.  In general, the ice sizes differed only a little, but it had more to do with the amount of time the machine had been running rather than the size selected.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Della &#8211; 048-GM-48186 was the most effective and affordable portable ice maker we tested and made 26 pounds a day.</li>
<li>After seven minutes the Della produces enough ice to cool a glass of water by almost 15 degrees. After 15 minutes it can cool a 12-ounce drink to 53 °F.</li>
<li>It has a clean and simple design, easy-to-read programming and a large, clear lid for viewing the ice as it&#8217;s being made.</li>
</ul>

<p>(<em>Editors note: The unit we tested by Frigidaire seems to have been discontinued, but there are multiple identical rebrands available (just different color options). We&#8217;ve updated the article to reflect this with Frigidaire&#8217;s product.</em>)</p>
<p>Coming in a very close second is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GE7V1H8/?tag=ybdice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Frigidaire &#8211; EFIC108</a>, which yielded 25.6 pounds per day on its best setting (small ice cubes), and between it large and small settings, it averaged 22.5 pounds per day overall.</p>
<p>Similar to all the ice makers we tested, the Frigidaire uses about 100 watts, occasionally spiking at 140 watts, which calculates to a production cost of only two cents per pound. Compared to the cost of a store-bought 10-pound bag of ice, the Frigidaire is 20 times less expensive to use.</p>
<p>The Frigidaire&#8217;s display was clearer than that of the Della as it used words instead of symbols. Frigidaire is available in black, red, white or brushed silver. <em>As we noted above, it&#8217;s available on Amazon and other online retailers, but it&#8217;s no longer being sold by Frigidaire.</em></p>

<p>The lid is 1.5 inches thick, which helped keep the ice cold during production. Although the ice tray holds 1.5 pounds of ice, the Frigidaire automatically shuts off when 1 pound of ice is made.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Frigidaire &#8211; EFIC108 has excellent production capacity (25.6 lb per day) and works best on the small setting.</li>
<li>The average cost of ice with the Frigidaire is about 1.3 cents per pound.</li>
<li>After about seven minutes, the first batch of ice can cool a 12-ounce beverage by 13 degrees.</li>

<p><em>For this update, we tested a new model, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P769JJG/?tag=ybdice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 86150</a>, to see how it would compare with the other ice makers we previously reviewed.</em></p>
<p>Hamilton Beach claims that this ice maker can make 28 pounds of ice per day. However, during our testing, it averaged one pound per hour, totaling approximately 24 pounds of ice.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach has a sleek stainless-steel design with black trim, and its clear, flat lid lets you see how much ice has formed. It’s also quiet: You hear just a gentle whirring of its fan, until the next batch of ice is made. The Hamilton Beach makes two sizes of hollow, bullet-shaped ice. We programmed each size separately, but we saw no difference between them. The Hamilton Beach is well insulated, so the ice doesn’t melt, and automatically stops when the tray is full (at about 1 pound).</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach wasn’t the fastest ice maker we tested, depositing 10 ice capsules every 10 minutes, so if you need ice in a pinch, you’ll need to turn the machine on at least one hour in advance. At $169, it’s a bit expensive, and although it did a good job, we still prefer our top pick, the Della for its speed and the amount of ice it can produce.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N1GEX2Y/?tag=ybdice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NewAir &#8211; AI-100BK</a> is a slightly larger unit and 4 pounds heavier than the Della and Frigidaire. Its manufacturer claims that it can produce 18 pounds of ice and has a larger ice tray, storing 2.2 pounds of ice. To our surprise, the NewAir did all that its manufacturer claimed.</p>
<p>However, depending on the size selected, there was considerable variance in how much the ice tray held before the machine automatically shut off: 2.25 pounds for large ice, 2.05 for medium ice, and 1.19 pounds for small ice. That said, the medium size was the most effective setting and produced 26 pounds per day.</p>
<p>Another downside to the NewAir is that it&#8217;s difficult to drain. Most portable ice makers drain from the bottom, but the NewAir drains from the side, so we had to tilt the machine to drain out all of the water. The white model that we tested is nearly double the price of the Frigidaire; however, the other available colors are about $100 less.</p>

<p>(<em>Editor&#8217;s note: The Ivation model that we tested has been discontinued. An upgraded model is on the Ivation website, but at present it&#8217;s unknown when it will be released.</em>)</p>
<p>The Ivation went toe-to-toe with Della in ice production and produced 23.5 pounds per day on the small setting. Its thin lid, however, reduced insulation and resulted in one-tenth of a pound melting. That said, the melted ice was simply recycled into the container and made into ice again.</p>

<p>(<em>Editor&#8217;s note: ThinkGizmos has discontinued this model and is no longer selling portable ice makers.</em>)</p>
<p>Despite its high rating on Amazon, ThinkGizmos &#8211; TG22 suffered from inconsistency between its settings, both in how much the ice tray could hold and how quickly the ice was produced. Like the units we tested, the ThinkGizmos worked best when making small ice cubes even though it produced the least amount of ice (22.4 pounds per day). At the large setting, the ThinkGizmos performed the worst, producing a meager 11.2 pounds per day.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you hate making an ice run in the middle of a party, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B074VFTRV3/?tag=ybdice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Della &#8211; 048-GM-48186</a> portable ice maker is a great option. Not only will it produce 26 pounds of ice in 24 hours, the size of the ice it makes will cool any beverage down in 7 minutes.</p>
<p>Our runner-up, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GE7V1H8/?tag=ybdice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Frigidaire &#8211; EFIC108</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N1GEX2Y/?tag=ybdice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NewAir &#8211; AI-100BK</a> were both within a couple of pounds of reaching their manufacturers&#8217; claimed production of 25.6 pounds and 26 pounds per day. NewAir&#8217;s white model is nearly twice the price of the Frigidaire, and although the ice it makes is cost-efficient, we recommend looking at other colors for this model, which are substantially less expensive.<br />

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected machines to test</h2>
<p>It’s said that Thomas Jefferson introduced ice cream to the young United States and since then it’s certainly become an American obsession. With hundreds of flavors sold in supermarkets and ice cream parlors, ice cream machines have come a long way since the good ol’ days of churning it by hand with pounds of ice and rock salt.</p>
<p>We began our research by going through articles about the art and science of ice-cream making, including IceCreamScience.com, the American Chemical Society, Cook’s Science and Serious Eats. We then consulted chefs from three upscale restaurants in Los Angeles (The World Famous Magic Castle, Mare and Farmshop). In Vancouver, we sought out our colleague James Coleridge of <a href="http://bellagelateria.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bella Gelateria</a>. Maestro James — as he’s called — is the first non-Italian to earn a degree from the Carpigiani Gelato University near Bologna, Italy.</p>
<p>Once we learned the basics of how ice cream is made, we moved on to researching what home ice cream makers are available. A number of websites that specialize in ice-cream making also recommend the machines they prefer to use.</p>
<p>We also read through numerous customer reviews posted on Amazon. Many customers got great results from compressor models, but they were also pleased with freezer-bowl models and the automatic ice-and-salt machines. We decided to include each of these in our testing.</p>
<p>The leader in the industry is Cuisinart. The company has several ice cream machines on the market that they upgrade every couple of years. However, there are several other American and European manufacturers who are giving Cuisinart a run for their money, so we included a few of these in our list of candidates to test.</p>

<h2>The science of ice cream ingredients</h2>
<p>Amazon reviewers state that an important reason for their buying an ice-cream machine is so they know what ingredients are going into the ice cream that they make. Other than flavoring, ice cream has only five ingredients: cream, milk, eggs (for custard-style ice cream), sugar and air.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, ice cream’s total volume is composed of 30 to 50-percent air. A rule of thumb is that the cheaper brands of ice cream are pumped up with more air than the expensive brands. You can test this for yourself by holding a pint of Haagen Dazs in one hand with a pint of a generic supermarket brand in your other hand. The Haagen Dazs will be somewhat heavier than the cheaper ice cream since it is denser and has less air.</p>
<p>The chemical formation of ice cream is similar to that of a salad dressing: They’re both an emulsion, which is a combination of two liquids that aren’t normally cohesive with each other; for example, oil and vinegar. Like with salad dressing, air is necessary to bring the two “unfriendly” elements together. In the case of ice cream it’s fat (from cream and milk) and water (ice crystals), which serve to bind the ice cream together when it’s frozen.</p>
<p>Air, however, is only one component. Ice cream also needs an emulsifier, which stabilizes the fat and ice crystals to give the ice cream a smooth and creamy texture. The most common emulsifier in ice cream is egg yolks. This type of ice cream is called custard or French style; without eggs, the ice cream is called Philadelphia style. The difference of adding egg yolks is most dramatic between French Vanilla (yellow and rich-tasting) and regular Vanilla (white with vanilla flavor more prominent).</p>
<p>Almost all store-bought ice creams that aren’t custards use stabilizers such as guar gum, locust (or carob) bean gum, xanthan gum or carrageenan (derived from seaweed). Each of these is a thickening agent and serves the same purpose as egg yolks in chemically binding the other ingredients.</p>

<p>Our chef-consultants revealed that most ice-cream parlors — even ice-cream artisans — and restaurants use a pre-mixed ice cream base manufactured by a dairy distributor, such as Nestle or Hood, which the ice-cream shop flavors and customizes.</p>
<p>These commercial bases combine, water, fat, sugar, milk solids and emulsifiers. They are then homogenized and pasteurized to prevent food-borne illness, as required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the legal sale of commercially produced ice cream. Although a few countries in the EU continually fight restrictions on raw-milk cheeses, which can be substantially more flavorful that pasteurized cheese, we could not determine whether there is an EU manufacturer that makes ice cream with raw milk or cream.</p>
<p>We questioned several ice-cream companies (The Penny Ice Creamery, Salt &amp; Straw, and a la Minute Ice Cream) about whether organic and locally sourced ingredients really affect the taste of the ice cream they make. Each company acknowledges their symbiotic business relationship with local dairy farmers and they all fervently believe their natural ingredients make better-tasting ice cream.</p>
<p>The experts agree that home ice-cream machines aren’t powerful enough to give professional results. They do offer tips, however, for making ice cream that closely approximates what you might purchase.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sugar doesn’t freeze, so it keeps ice cream soft. There is some leeway in the amounts of sugar you can use (for example, diminishing the recipe by ¼ cup), but unless you add some other ingredient that doesn’t freeze (like alcohol), it’s best to stick with the amount of sugar recommended in the recipe.</li>
<li>Corn syrup adds body and suppleness to the ice cream so it won’t melt as fast. It also gives sorbets a smooth consistency.</li>
<li>Fat also doesn’t freeze, but it’s not necessary to use all cream for creamy ice cream. Whole milk or half-and-half can replace cream with very good results (gelato is made almost entirely with milk).</li>
<li>Corn starch will make a smooth and creamy ice cream without eggs. A small amount thickens the ice cream base into a custard-like consistency.</li>
<li>Churning time affects the airiness of ice cream. A commercial machine is powerful enough to churn ice cream in 10 to 15 minutes. A home machine doesn’t have that kind of power, so it needs to churn longer, 35 to 50 minutes, to achieve a light consistency.</li>
<li>Generally, all ice cream made in a home machine needs to be frozen for at least two hours after it’s been churned. This “resting period” gives the water molecules time to freeze and firm up the ice cream so it’s easier to scoop.</li>
<li>Ice crystals destroy the consistency and flavor of ice cream, so freshly churned ice cream should be covered with plastic wrap and stored in a plastic rectangular container. (Deli-style containers promote the growth of ice crystals.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-buy">Why buy an ice cream maker</h2>
<p>At face value, an ice cream machine is a luxury item, but if you enjoy ice cream on a regular basis, it can actually be quite cost-efficient. An ice cream parlor charges around three dollars (or in the case of gelato, four dollars) for a single scoop and that’s without any add-ins. A pint of Ben and Jerry’s can set you back six or seven dollars. When you make your own ice cream, the cost for two quarts is about five dollars.</p>
<p>It may also be important for you to know exactly what’s going into your ice cream, especially if you prefer to eat organic or have a food allergy. With a few of the machines we tested, we were able to reproduce ice creams and sorbets that tasted like those you buy at an ice cream parlor but with less processed ingredients.</p>
<p>Today’s compressor ice-cream makers take ice and rock salt out of the picture altogether (except for the nostalgic, vintage-style machines), so homemade ice cream couldn’t be easier. And let’s face it, making ice cream is fun. Although we used the same recipes for all the machines during our testing, we couldn’t wait to get creative and try out flavors and add-ins after the testing was completed.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Compressor style:</strong> Although compressor models are more expensive, in the long run, we found they were the best for rapidly churning quarts of excellent ice cream in a short period of time. Compressor models are self-cooling, like mini refrigerator-freezers, so you don’t need to pre-freeze the canister. Also, because the machine stays cold, you can churn out continuous quarts without waiting.</p>
<p><strong>Freezer-bowl style:</strong> A less-expensive alternative is a machine with a removable freezer bowl. The bowl is filled with a liquid gel that must be frozen in your freezer for at least 12 hours before you plan on churning ice cream. Although we could only churn two quarts of ice cream per day in the freezer-bowl model, we did find that the freezer bowl did an efficient job.</p>
<p><strong>Capacity:</strong> Three of the machines we tested had a 1.5-quart capacity, while two machines had a 2-quart capacity. The ice-and-salt model, Hamilton Beach &#8211; 68330N had double the capacity at four quarts. For the compressor models, we found a 1.5-quart capacity sufficient, since we could make several quarts one after another. If you want to make more than two quarts in the Cuisinart &#8211; ICE-60W, you’ll need to buy an additional freezer bowl.</p>
<p><strong>Add-in spout:</strong> If you want to add in your favorite nuts and candy to your ice cream, then look for a machine with a spout. It’s a convenient and practical feature, since removing the lid entirely during the churning process will lower the temperature of the ice cream and lengthen the time it takes to freeze.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Ice cream recipes</h3>
<p>Before we put the machines through their paces, we researched a number of tried-and-true ice cream recipes. Each of the instruction manuals for the machines included suggested recipes in chocolate and vanilla.</p>
<p>The basic recipes for vanilla custard ice cream were all pretty much the same. The manuals instruct that you can add any flavorings and add-ins like nuts, chocolate chips, caramel and pureed fruit into the base recipe.</p>
<p>Because these ice cream makers can also make sorbet, we tested that too. Sorbet is much easier to make and generally, the manuals offered simple sorbet recipes with pureed fruit, sugar and water. However, without a stabilizer, such as eggs, sorbet is grainy with ice crystals and melts too quickly. We researched recipes for sorbet and learned that light corn syrup works in a similar way to eggs and also makes sorbet smooth.</p>
<p>We settled on four recipes to test all of the machines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Egg-based <a href="http://www.davidlebovitz.com/vanilla-ice-cream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vanilla custard ice cream</a> or French-style</li>
<li><a href="http://www.davidlebovitz.com/chocolate-ice-cream-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eggless chocolate ice cream</a> or Philadelphia-style</li>
<li><a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/02/vegan-chocolate-ice-cream.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dairy-less coconut ice cream</a></li>
<li>Fruit sorbet &#8211; We used the same sorbet recipe for all of the machines, but changed the fruit, using blueberry, raspberry, mango, peach, lemon and cherry.</li>
</ul>
<p>The three ice creams all needed to be cooked to some degree. It’s a crucial process for the vanilla custard ice cream, since the egg yolks need to heat to 170°F to kill the salmonella bacteria sometimes found in raw eggs. We also added cornstarch to the eggless chocolate ice cream to act as an emulsifier, so the mixture needed to be heated so the cornstarch could bind the cream and milk.</p>

<p>The best recipes we found for the vanilla custard ice cream and the eggless chocolate ice cream are by ice-cream guru David Lebovitz. However, we did switch out the condensed milk in the chocolate recipe for half-and-half. In some of the machines, the ice cream still churned out smooth, creamy and intensely chocolate.</p>

<p>For the dairy-less coconut ice cream, we used equal parts coconut milk to coconut cream, which needed to be heated to completely dissolve the coconut fat globules. We began with <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/02/vegan-chocolate-ice-cream.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this recipe</a> and made a couple of alterations, decreasing the sugar from ¾ cup to ⅔ cup. With the addition of corn syrup, we found ¾ cup of sugar made the ice cream too sweet. We also eliminated the chocolate, since we wanted to better judge how the coconut milk and cream tasted as stand-alone ice cream.</p>

<p>The sorbets did not require cooking. However, we simmered the simple syrup we used in the sorbet to completely dissolve the sugar.</p>
<p>Here’s the simple recipe we used for the sorbet: Heat ½ cup sugar with one cup water until the sugar is dissolved. Add the simple syrup and ¼ cup light corn syrup to 12 ounces frozen fruit in a blender and puree. We experimented with frozen blueberries, raspberries, peaches, cherries, mango and lemon juice.</p>
<p>We prepared the same amount of ice cream base for each of the machines to produce one quart of ice cream. Since ice cream expands when the air is whipped in, the mixture needs to be less than the machine’s capacity.</p>
<p>The mixtures were all chilled for at least 12 hours to allow the flavors to fully mature. The chilled base was then poured into each machine. The sorbet was already chilled from the frozen fruit, so we simply poured the mixture into the machine without refrigerating it overnight.</p>
<h3>Ease of use</h3>
<p>Four of the machines we tested were compressor models, meaning that they have an internal cooling unit, which eliminates pre-freezing the machine’s inner canister. The compressor models also allow you to churn several quarts of ice cream in a couple of hours.</p>
<p>The compressor models were designed for ease of use and although they are all quite heavy and bulky, once we wiped the bowls, paddles (also known as “dashers”) and bowl covers clean, we simply had to pour the mixture in and push a button.</p>
<p>We also tested a freezer bowl model, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006UKLUFS/?tag=ybdcrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; ICE-60W Cool Creations</a> and although it wasn’t as convenient for making more than 1.5 quarts of ice cream per day, the machine was very easy to use once the bowl had been frozen the night before.</p>
<p>Vintage ice-cream makers required manually churning the internal canister that’s been packed in ice and rock salt (which lowers the temperature of the ice). There are a couple of automatic models on the market that have a nostalgic appeal. We tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009A0N4E/?tag=ybdcrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 68330N</a>, a popular, inexpensive ice-and-salt model, that we found to be charming but messy and inconvenient.</p>
<h3>Churning time</h3>

<p>The compressor models had higher wattage (100 &#8211; 180 watts), which gave them the edge over the freezer-bowl model and the ice-and-salt model in churning the ice cream faster. Generally, the compressor models took about 30 minutes to make soft-serve ice cream you could serve immediately or freeze to firm up.</p>
<p>The compressor models were less consistent, however, when it came to churning sorbets and the non-dairy coconut ice cream that were firm enough to hold a scoop. For example, the high-end <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004RDF0/?tag=ybdcrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Musso &#8211; Mini 4080 Lussino</a> churned out soft-serve ice cream in 30 minutes, but the sorbet and non-dairy coconut didn’t firm up for 50 minutes.</p>

<p>The ICE-60W surprised us. The same amount of mixture (to produce 1.5 quarts) we used for the compressor models began freezing almost immediately before even turning the machine on. The ICE-60 differs from the compressor models in that the freezer bowl revolves while the dasher remains stationary. The vanilla and chocolate ice creams and the sorbet were at a scoopable consistency in 20 minutes, while the non-dairy coconut was firm in 15 minutes.</p>
<h3>Texture and consistency</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6898" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ice-cream-texture.png" alt="ice cream texture comparison chart" width="1801" height="1230" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ice-cream-texture.png 1801w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ice-cream-texture-610x417.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ice-cream-texture-1500x1024.png 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ice-cream-texture-768x525.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ice-cream-texture-885x604.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ice-cream-texture-300x205.png 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ice-cream-texture-295x201.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ice-cream-texture-1000x683.png 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ice-cream-texture-360x246.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ice-cream-texture-375x256.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ice-cream-texture-414x283.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ice-cream-texture-320x219.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The biggest challenge for an ice cream maker is to recreate the smooth texture and the buttery stick-to-the-roof-of-your-mouth consistency of the ice cream you get at a professional ice cream parlor. Except for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N63J432/?tag=ybdcrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Whynter</a>, all of the machines we tested produced a soft-serve ice cream that needed to be frozen for at least two hours before serving.</p>
<p>You might actually prefer soft-serve to a more firm ice cream, but most of the manufacturers and professionals recommend that the churned ice cream should be frozen to give the ice cream a chance to “ripen,” which is really just giving the ice crystals time to bind with the butterfat and give the ice cream density.</p>
<p>Freezing also changes the consistency and flavor of the ice cream. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009OZ62IG/?tag=ybdcrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BCI600XL Smart Scoop</a> has automatic, pre-programmed settings and a manual option, which allows you to set a specific time for churning. The only choice you can make with the automatic, pre-programmed settings is how hard you want your ice cream to be. We experimented with different hardness levels and found little noticeable difference between them.</p>
<p>The Breville’s automatic setting bulked up the frozen desserts to an almost fluffy consistency, which, when frozen, left the ice cream — particularly the vanilla — practically flavorless. The Breville’s sorbet, however, was delicious and could be served immediately. Plus, it retained its bright fresh-fruit flavor.</p>
<p>We had less successful results with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009A0N4E/?tag=ybdcrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach</a>. The unit’s motor simply didn’t have the power to whip enough air into the ice creams and sorbet. The taste of butterfat overwhelmed the vanilla and the chocolate and coconut ice creams and lemon sorbet were grainy and unappetizing.</p>
<p>We conducted our testing over a two-week period and discovered that without the commercially added stabilizers, none of the ice creams held up longer than five days. We carefully wrapped the desserts in plastic wrap and stored them in airtight containers.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, the ice creams and sorbets we made at the beginning of the test period had radically deteriorated in texture and flavor. Thus, we recommend consuming homemade ice cream within two or three days.</p>
<h3>Noise level</h3>

<p>A common criticism by Amazon reviewers of ice cream machines is that they’re exceedingly noisy. Overall we did not find that to be the case. Of all the machines, the Breville was considerably less noisy. It simply emitted a low hum as it churned and was barely noticeable in the background.</p>

<p>The Musso, Whynter and Cuisinart &#8211; ICE-100 made some noise as the dasher scraped the internal canisters, but they weren’t annoying. The Cuisinart &#8211; ICE-60W clunked a bit as the freezer bowl spun and the Hamilton Beach made a loud grinding sound as if its motor would overheat and shut down.</p>
<h3>Clean-up</h3>
<p>One of the factors that you should consider when purchasing an ice cream maker is the convenience of using and cleaning it on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The compressor models we tested were stainless steel and the only parts that can be washed (not in the dishwasher) are their removable metal canisters and plastic dashers. The Whynter, ICE-100 and the Breville were especially easy to clean and ready to use again in minutes. The Breville even comes with its own small brush to clean the hard-to-reach canister cylinder. The ICE-60’s freezer bowl, once defrosted, was also easy to clean.</p>
<p>The Musso gave us a couple of problems. The only removable part is the metal dasher and it freezes tight during the churning, which made it difficult to remove until we defrosted it with hot water. The Musso&#8217;s instruction manual advises pouring hot water into the bowl, waiting 10 minutes and wiping it out with a sponge, then repeating until clean. We followed the instructions and needed to do the process several times before all soapy residue was removed.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach’s canister and dasher were easy to detach and wash, but it was tricky to empty out the ice and salty water from the unit’s bucket without spilling it everywhere.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-overall">Best overall: Whynter &#8211; ICM-200LS</h2>

<p>The compressor models were certainly more convenient and easy to operate than the freezer bowl and automatic ice-and-salt models. Overall the compressor models performed reasonably as well as advertised.</p>
<p>However, we found that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N63J432/?tag=ybdcrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Whynter &#8211; ICM-200LS</a> stood out as the best compressor model that churned out extremely smooth, creamy and dense ice cream you’d expect from a high-end, artisan ice-cream parlor. Whynter is known for refrigeration and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-portable-air-conditioner/" rel="noopener">air conditioning</a> and their expertise was clearly applied when they designed an ice cream machine.</p>

Its powerful motor churns out desserts in less than 30 minutes.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N63J432/?tag=ybdcrm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Whynter is incredibly user friendly: You simply pour the ice cream mixture into the canister, snap on the lid and push the “power” button. An LCD screen lights up with the options for Ice Cream, Cooling and Mixing Only (for add-ins once the ice cream has partially solidified). The digital countdown begins at 60 minutes, and you can add or subtract from that default time.</p>
<p>The Whynter’s powerful internal motor (180 watts) churned 1.5 quarts (its total capacity is 2.1 quarts) of vanilla-custard ice cream to completion in only 25 minutes. It was the only ice cream from all of our test subjects that didn’t need to be frozen before serving. It scooped up hard and dense and was perfectly smooth and creamy. An efficient plastic ice-cream scoop is included.</p>
<p>The egg-less chocolate ice cream wasn’t as dense, but it was just as rich-tasting as the vanilla and intensely chocolate-y. The sorbet and non-dairy coconut took slightly longer to churn (28 minutes) and they were also flavorful and smooth.</p>
<p>The Whynter’s extended cooling function kicks in automatically when the timer hits zero and the unit keeps the ice cream chilled for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>The removable canister and dasher were easy to wash and the machine’s stainless steel wipes down beautifully. At over 25 pounds, the Whynter is one of the heaviest of our test subjects, so it’s definitely a countertop appliance.</p>
<p>The Whynter costs about the same as the other compressor models we tested, so it’s not inexpensive. However, because of the excellent quality of the ice cream it makes, we believe it’s a worthwhile investment.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Whynter churns out ice cream and other frozen desserts that taste exactly like what you would get from a professional ice cream parlor.</li>
<li>It’s the only machine we tested that makes hard and soft-serve ice cream.</li>
<li>The Whynter has an add-in spout and programmed menu choice for pausing the churning for add-ins.</li>
<li>Its 2.1-quart capacity allows you to make a lot of ice cream in a short period of time.</li>
<li>The machine’s automatic functions are very user-friendly and make ice-cream-making easy and fun.</li>
</ul>

<p>For our runner-up, we chose another compressor model, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006UKLUFS/?tag=ybdcrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; ICE-100</a>, which consistently churned out very good ice cream and sorbet in about 30 minutes. It runs about $50 less than the Wynter, and although it’s more expensive than the freezer-bowl and ice-and-salt models, we feel the price is worth it for the ICE-100’s quality and convenience.</p>

<p>We opted for the Whynter as our first choice and the Cuisinart &#8211; ICE-100 as our runner-up, because all of the ice cream the machine made was soft-serve and needed to be frozen before serving. After four hours of freezing time, the ICE-100’s ice cream and sorbet had the taste and texture of high-end store-bought frozen desserts.</p>
<p>The ICE-100 is easy to use and after a quick wipe-down of the removable bucket and dasher, you can start making ice cream (as long as you have the mixture ready) with the unit straight out of the box. The ICE-100 has only three functions on its touchpad control: on/off, start/stop and a programmable LCD timer. A second dasher for making gelato is included, but we really didn’t notice much difference in the churning.</p>
<p>Once the ice cream is done, the machine goes into an automatic cooling mode for 10 minutes. Unless you enjoy a soft-serve consistency, we recommend freezing the ICE-100’s ice cream for two hours to let it firm up before serving.</p>
<p>The ICE-100 is about the same size as the Whynter, yet it makes somewhat less ice cream (1.5 quarts) and it doesn’t have a spout for add-ins. The machine’s stainless steel is easy to clean and the unit would make an attractive addition to your kitchen countertop.</p>
<p>While we disagree with Cuisinart’s claim that the ICE-100 is a commercial-quality ice cream maker, it’s certainly a reliable option for the ice-cream aficionado.</p>

<p>With a price tag of $700, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004RDF0/?tag=ybdcrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Musso &#8211; 4080</a> is certainly the Tesla of the ice cream machines we tested. It’s a solidly constructed unit that could easily be used in a restaurant. The Musso&#8217;s motor doesn’t have the wattage of the other compressor models we tested, but it’s so efficiently built that it has enough power to whip ice cream into a frothy and airy confection.</p>

<p>The Musso is manufactured in Italy and entirely made of stainless steel, so weighing in at 38 pounds, it’s approximately the size of a small microwave and is clearly intended to have a permanent place in your kitchen. Design-wise, it’s gorgeous, all ovals and sleek curves and when cleaned-up, it gleams. If you ever needed an ice-breaker at a party of strangers, the Musso would be it.</p>
<p>The stainless dasher screws into place and you pour in the ice cream mixture, then set the built-in manual timer (it resembles a vintage kitchen timer) to 40 minutes. The manual suggests 30 minutes, but we found that to be insufficient time. The Musso has two switches: Churn and Chill, and the unit won’t start until the timer is set.</p>
<p>The vanilla-custard ice cream was done in 25 minutes and, of all the ice cream we tasted during our testing, it was the best: super smooth, velvety and flavorful. The eggless chocolate ice cream took five minutes less, and it had the same rich consistency as the vanilla. The sorbet and non-dairy coconut seemed less smooth and flavorful, but once frozen, the magic chemistry happened, and both were luscious.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that the ice cream the Musso produced was all soft-serve, which should either be eaten immediately or frozen to firm up.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6936 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/musso-bowl.jpg" alt="Musso's built in bowl closeup" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/musso-bowl.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/musso-bowl-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/musso-bowl-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/musso-bowl-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/musso-bowl-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/musso-bowl-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/musso-bowl-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/musso-bowl-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/musso-bowl-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/musso-bowl-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>For all of the beauty of the Musso, we did have a couple of quibbles. The dasher isn’t able to reach the base of the bowl, so we needed to scrape up the quarter-inch thick frozen layer so it could be churned and incorporated into the ice cream.</p>
<p>Second, as noted above, washing the inner bowl and rinsing the soapy water is cumbersome because of the weight of the machine. Consequently, we had to wipe out the bowl several times before we felt confident that all residue was removed.</p>
<p>If you want to make ice cream of professional quality at home and you can afford it, then the Musso is the machine to buy.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Beautifully designed, solidly built and easy to use, the Musso makes professional-quality ice cream at home.</li>
<li>Its efficient motor and dasher churn out exceedingly smooth, creamy and airy soft-serve ice cream and gelato.</li>
<li>The Musso is an investment, but if you’re serious about ice cream, it’s worth it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Breville &#8211; BCI600XL Smart Scoop</h3>

<p>The highly rated <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009OZ62IG/?tag=ybdcrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; Smart Scoop</a> comes with lots of bells and whistles and although the ice cream we made in it was acceptable, we didn’t feel the machine merited its considerable price tag.</p>
<p>The Breville is also a compressor unit that chills the machine to -22°F in approximately 10 minutes. It has an impressive LCD panel and various buttons for programming automatic settings for ice cream, gelato, sorbet and frozen yogurt, as well as a knob for adjusting the dessert’s hardness. We found the machine chiming when it’s time for add-ins and when the ice cream is ready to be a useful and accurate feature.</p>
<p>As with most of the other machines, the ice cream had soft-serve consistency and needed to be frozen before serving. We found the texture of the desserts made in the Breville disappointing. The vanilla-custard ice cream was more like frozen whipped cream with a heavy aftertaste of butterfat. The chocolate, sorbet and non-dairy coconut were grainy with ice crystals.</p>
<p>The Breville has a removable bucket and dasher and includes an efficient ice-cream scraper and a small brush for cleaning. The machine has a powerful motor of 200 watts, but it emitted a harsh metallic odor throughout our testing period that never dissipated.</p>
<h3>Cuisinart &#8211; ICE-60W Cool Creations</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006UKLUFS/?tag=ybdcrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; ICE-60W</a> is a freezer-bowl model, so it does require some planning ahead of time because you’ll need to freeze the bowl for at least 12 hours before using it. Since we needed to chill the ice cream mixture for the same amount of time, it really wasn’t an issue for us. Many Amazon reviewers simply store the bowl in their freezers.</p>
<p>The ICE-60W differs most noticeably from the compressor models in that the bucket — not the dasher — revolves. Since the dasher doesn’t move, the ice cream gets stuck in the upper third of the bowl, forming around one of the blades. During the churning, we had to continually scrape the ice cream off the dasher so it could be incorporated into the mixture.</p>
<p>However, despite this bit of maintenance, as we noted earlier, the freezer bowl is very efficient in quickly freezing the ice cream mixture, which began to freeze upon contact with the bowl. All of the ice cream and sorbet made in the ICE-60W were smooth with a soft-serve consistency.</p>
<p>A freezer-bowl model isn’t as convenient as a compressor model, but it’s certainly more affordable. The ICE-60W runs about $100, so it’s a viable option for a less expensive ice cream maker.</p>
<h3>Hamilton Beach &#8211; 68330N 4-Quart</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6940 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hamilton-beach.jpg" alt="the Hamilton Beach – 68330N 4-Quart" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hamilton-beach.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hamilton-beach-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hamilton-beach-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hamilton-beach-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hamilton-beach-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hamilton-beach-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hamilton-beach-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hamilton-beach-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hamilton-beach-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hamilton-beach-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>At around $30, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009A0N4E/?tag=ybdcrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 68330N</a> 4-quart ice cream maker is an Amazon top seller. Reviewers love the nostalgic fun of making ice cream with ice and rock salt and it can make twice as much for larger groups.</p>
<p>However, despite Hamilton Beach’s claim that the model is not labor-intensive, we found it to be just the opposite. It’s a cheaply made product consisting of a plastic bucket, a 4-quart metal cylinder that easily dents, a plastic dasher and a small motor in a plastic casing that snaps on top.</p>
<p>Although it’s motorized, the Hamilton Beach requires 10 pounds of ice and a couple of cups of rock salt, which are layered inside the bucket around the sides of the cylinder. The noisy motor churns the dasher slowly and simply doesn’t have the power to whip enough air into the ice cream.</p>
<p>During the machine’s 50 minutes of churning, we needed to keep an eye on the ice and salt level, adding both half-way through the process. But before doing so, we had to remove the motor and canister, drain out the melted water, re-insert the canister and lock the motor back into place (no small feat).</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach was definitely not a “set-it-and-forget-it” type of appliance. Whereas the other machines we tested were fun to use, the Hamilton Beach turned ice-cream making into a chore.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you love ice cream like we do, then an ice cream machine isn’t a luxury item but a “must-have” appliance that you’ll want to use every day. The compressor-model ice cream maker takes all the fuss and mess out of ice-cream making of yore. The less-expensive machines might save you money at first, but we believe they won’t hold up as long as the compressor models, nor will they make ice cream you’ll really enjoy.</p>
<p>For under $300, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N63J432/?tag=ybdcrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Whynter &#8211; ICM-200LS</a> is our top pick. It’s easy to use, easy to clean and makes the same dense, rich and creamy ice cream and sorbet that you’d find at an ice cream parlor.</p>
<p>For a slightly less expensive option, we also recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006UKLUFS/?tag=ybdcrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; ICE-100</a>, another compressor model, that’s very user-friendly and makes a satisfying high-end supermarket ice cream.</p>
<p>And if money is no object, go for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004RDF0/?tag=ybdcrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Musso &#8211; 4080 Musso Lussino</a>, an impeccably and beautifully designed machine that churns out restaurant-quality frozen desserts in 30 minutes.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter comparing 30 fans, we narrowed it down to five top contenders that we tested for 60+ hours during the California summer heat. Our pick for overall best tower fan is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seville-Classics-UltraSlimline-Tower-40-inch/dp/B00LA1FIHS/?tag=ybdtwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Seville Classics &#8211; UltraSlimline</a>.

<h2 id="chose">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>When researching top oscillating fans and choosing the final five, as well as our winner overall, we considered several attributes that people look for most in a tower fan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall cooling power</li>
<li>Overall cooling distribution (oscillation/coverage)</li>
<li>Noise level</li>
<li>Energy efficiency</li>
<li>Cost and/or value for the price</li>
<li>Features (timer, eco mode, remote control)</li>
<li>Aesthetics</li>
</ul>
<p>We determined this final set by reading dozens upon dozens of Amazon reviews (both good and bad), polling our team, and of course, testing ourselves.</p>
<p>Have no doubt, though — you buy a fan to cool yourself, not to look cool (although Dyson might try and convince you otherwise). We determined our final five based on the consistently positive reviews they warranted across Amazon and in <a href="http://www.consumersearch.com/fans/best-tower-fan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other</a> <a href="http://www.geek.com/review/best-desk-fan-dyson-vs-vornado-vs-honeywell-1589462/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-regarded</a> <a href="http://www.toptenreviews.com/home/hvac/best-tower-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publications</a>.</p>

[table id=266 /]
<h2 id="important">The most important attribute after cooling power</h2>
<p>Although it’s easy to consider looking at the cooling power of these fans in isolation, it’s not the only cooling-focused attribute that matters when choosing a tower fan — especially if you’re not the only one being cooled.</p>
<p>The other attribute that matters is total wind distribution — that is, not just how much powerful air is blown in one area, but how much air circulation is being distributed in total across the height and width of the fan.</p>

<p>As you can see from the photos, each of these models besides the Dyson have grates the air is pushed through. Not all of them push air through the same number of grates, or in the same way — causing a distributed mix in how effective they are in pushing the air.</p>
<p>Some of them can cool your chest, or your face, and others can cover all of it. Similarly, the oscillation limitations of some of the units mean already ineffective units perform even worse when we consider the airspace covered in total.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you plan on keeping more than one person cool (or want to not have to continually adjust your fan in order to have it cool you in different areas of the room), you want to look for not just cooling power, but also cooling distribution when choosing a tower fan.</p>
<p>If you only care about cooling one small area in isolation, you probably need a table fan.</p>

<p>To start, we measured the traditional unit of success: cooling power. Using an anemometer, we measured the wind speed of each fan’s highest level in miles per hour when sitting around two feet from the unit, with it pointing straight at us.</p>
<p>However, we looked at not just speed in one isolated spot — we measured two, one at around two feet off the floor, and another at about four. We chose these positions because based on Google searches, we found that the average chair height when is 18 inches, average torso height when sitting is 39 inches, and average total height when sitting averages around 48.4 inches when including the size of an average human head.</p>
<p>This gave us a sense of how much air circulation was being distributed in multiple areas, not just one — a major reason you would buy a tower fan over a table fan. If a fan can&#8217;t generate wind power at three to four feet, it has design problems.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2504" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fans-air-speed.png" alt="tower-fans-air-speed" width="880" height="588" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fans-air-speed.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fans-air-speed-610x408.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fans-air-speed-360x241.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fans-air-speed-375x251.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fans-air-speed-414x277.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fans-air-speed-295x197.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fans-air-speed-180x120.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fans-air-speed-320x214.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Overall, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seville-Classics-UltraSlimline-Tower-40-inch/dp/B00LA1FIHS/?tag=ybdtwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Seville</a> crushed the competition in waist-height cooling power, generating wind speeds of 8.2 MPH — which even beat out the Dyson, a unit that&#8217;s five times as expensive.</p>
<p>Four feet from the floor, the units started to separate themselves. Dyson and Seville showed their positions as best in class, while the Brookstone, which tries to position itself as a luxury fan, showed that it’s incapable of cooling you from the chest up due to its bottom-positioned grates.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lasko-2551-Platinum-Control-Ionizer/dp/B000RL3UJA/?tag=ybdtwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lasko</a>, while in the same boat, at least has the function to tilt the grates in case you want to cool up rather than down.</p>
<p>Next, we measured noise levels on their highest speed settings. After testing <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-portable-air-conditioner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the best portable air conditioners</a>, we were cautious of the impact noise can have on comfort.</p>

<p>Seville showed that with power came noise. However, the noise levels weren’t anything unusual or excessive, and each unit stayed comfortably within similar audible, but not disruptive sound ranges.</p>
<p>However, the expensive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dyson-Multiplier-AM07-Tower-White/dp/B00I8R4VZC/?tag=ybdtwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson AM07</a> did show some price value in its ability to generate the most cooling power at the lowest noise levels. The unit somehow generates impressive power without screaming at you. If you&#8217;re planning to use your tower fan as a bedroom cooling unit, it&#8217;s definitely the best option.</p>

<p>If your primary function for the fan is as a bedroom cooling option, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Honeywell-HY-280-QuietSet-Whole-Tower/dp/B00B4BJU1E/?tag=ybdtwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Honeywell HY-280</a> is a great budget choice due to its quiet noise levels and all-around performance in the other areas we tested.</p>
<p>Finally, we looked at oscillation. In addition to power to distribute air in a set position, if you’re trying to cool a group (or a whole room), ability to rotate significantly makes an impact.</p>

<p>Using a protractor and two pens to best line up the two points on each end of the rotation, we measured degrees of oscillation. After marking the two points such as in the above photo, we lifted the fan and then used the protractor to measure the degree distance between the two pens.</p>
<p>Although hard to measure to an exact degree, we did our best and rounded up or down to the nearest five-degree mark.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2506" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-oscillation.png" alt="Photo Credit Kimberly Lostroscio" width="879" height="387" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-oscillation.png 879w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-oscillation-610x269.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-oscillation-360x158.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-oscillation-375x165.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-oscillation-414x182.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-oscillation-295x130.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-oscillation-180x79.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-oscillation-320x141.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Again, the Seville impressed, showing the strongest total coverage by a slight margin. The Honeywell equaled the movement as well, followed closely by Brookstone and Dyson.</p>
<p>The only poor performer was really the Lasko: it had significantly less movement and didn’t have the range capable of covering a portion of a large room, at an underwhelming 70 degrees of oscillation.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Finally, since these fans might run all night, it’s worth considering their energy impact, both on the environment and your utility bill. Using a Kill a Watt Energy Usage monitor, we measured the energy impact of each.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The units were pretty close in kilowatt-hour (KWH) usage, with the Brookstone and Honeywell performing best at 0.03 KWH used. To give you some context, you can use a number like KWH to determine how much these units might cost you per much.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Power rates vary by location, but if you lived somewhere where your cost per hour was eight cents, your KWH was 0.03 and you were planning to use the unit for 720 hours a month, the unit would cost you .03 * 8¢ = $0.0024/hr, and if used for 720 hours, $1.72 a month. Comparatively, that would be $2.88/month for the 0.05 KWH units.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2628" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-power-usage-2.png" alt="tower-fan-power-usage (2)" width="880" height="481" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-power-usage-2.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-power-usage-2-610x333.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-power-usage-2-360x197.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-power-usage-2-375x205.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-power-usage-2-414x226.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-power-usage-2-295x161.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-power-usage-2-180x98.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-power-usage-2-320x175.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>All things considered, these units aren&#8217;t big energy users. The Honeywell, though already a great budget pick, slightly stands out further with cheaper long term cost when using it.</p>
<h2 id="softer">The softer fan attributes we considered</h2>
<p>We think the above metrics are by far the most important things when considering a tower fan, but they aren’t the only ones. Many of the tower fans have other characteristics that might be attractive to you.</p>
<p>For one, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dyson-Multiplier-AM07-Tower-White/dp/B00I8R4VZC/?tag=ybdtwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson AM07</a> amazingly functions secondarily as a talking point for house parties. There’s no doubt, the technology of the wind generation is pretty incredible, and it — as well as the design of the model, will almost certainly stop guests in their tracks.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2484" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fans_Dyson-Hand.jpg" alt="Photo Credit Kimberly Lostroscio" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fans_Dyson-Hand.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fans_Dyson-Hand-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fans_Dyson-Hand-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fans_Dyson-Hand-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fans_Dyson-Hand-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fans_Dyson-Hand-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fans_Dyson-Hand-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fans_Dyson-Hand-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fans_Dyson-Hand-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fans_Dyson-Hand-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>If looking cool and feeling cool is important to you, that attribute may get you to consider the $400 price tag. In addition, the bladeless design of the fan makes the model safe for all ages and simple to clean, although there’s little about the other encased fans that make us feel like our health is at risk.</p>
<p>Some of the fans feature unique modes that they use for differentiation, such as Seville’s “Eco” mode, Honeywell’s eight fan speed settings, and Brookstone’s “Breeze” mode which attempts to imitate a relaxing wind pattern.</p>
<p>Each of these features is nice, but for the most part, not things we recommend making a purchase decision on. For 99% of the world, three to five fan speed settings on a control panel are enough and Brookstone’s “Breeze” mode feels like a sales gimmick.</p>
<p>In addition, tower fans have a reputation for instability. A wide base means smaller odds of barely touching the fan will knock it over.</p>
<p>The Honeywell HY-280, which performed solidly and had impressive oscillation, counters those strengths with an unbalanced design an active dog wouldn’t have any trouble knocking over.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the other four models were mostly bottom-balanced, making them harder than the Honeywell to knock over. They won’t anchor themselves against an oncoming linebacker, but they also won’t get knocked over by a gust of air.</p>

<p>In our opinion, the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seville-Classics-UltraSlimline-Tower-40-inch/dp/B00LA1FIHS/?tag=ybdtwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Seville Classics &#8211; UltraSlimline</a> is by far the best tower fan for the money. It&#8217;s tall, thin design is an excellent space-saving option. Plus, it’s the most powerful, at the same price level of the other mid-level fans, and is capable of cooling several people in a large room due to better-than-average total coverage.</p>

This oscillating fan cools as capably as the Dyson - AM07, a unit five times its cost.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seville-Classics-UltraSlimline-Tower-40-inch/dp/B00LA1FIHS/?tag=ybdtwr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Its only weakness is that it’s on the loud side, but that’s what comes with reasonably-priced cooling power. On lower speed settings, it’s noticeably quiet operation, meaning you can get similar power at the same noise levels of the other units while still retaining the cooling upside.</p>
<p>Although it’s not quite as aesthetically impressive as the Dyson AM07, it isn’t an eyesore and definitely won’t repel your next date. It also features four speed settings on its control panel, a timer, and a user-friendly remote control that rounds out the Seville’s performance package.</p>
<h2 id="luxury">Luxe pick: Dyson &#8211; AM07</h2>

<p>If you gave us the choice of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dyson-Multiplier-AM07-Tower-White/dp/B00I8R4VZC/?tag=ybdtwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson &#8211; AM07</a> or the Seville, we’d take the Dyson. It’s close in power, looks considerably better, has the quietest speeds, and can cover a significant portion of your room.</p>
<p>But that’s only if you gave us a coin flip choice. The reality is hard to get past — the Dyson costs around five to six times the cost of the Seville. In our minds, the Dyson warrants around a $200-$250 price tag. At $400, it’s hard to recommend to anyone who cares about using their money wisely.</p>
<p>If you happen to be rich or a real cooling connoisseur, by all means, consider it. Dyson revolutionizes the industry, cooling you and your whole room in a way no other fan ever has.

Its wooden face would blend in nicely with the right home, but overall, it’s not a unit we’d recommend.</p>

<p>Overall, we ended quite impressed with the Seville Classics UltraSlimLine. It’s high powered, can cover a lot of ground, and is in the bottom cost bracket of every single top tower fan we tested. Plus, its included remote control means you can control temperature without getting up.</p>
<p>It might not have the wow factor of the Dyson AM07, but it does have the effectiveness. At around $60, it’ll keep you, your family and your friends as cool as can be — all at the same time.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter five summers of testing in the California heat, we’ve determined the best portable air conditioner overall is the dual-hose <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AA8WOAK/?tag=ybdpac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Whynter &#8211; ARC-122DS Elite</a>. The ARC-122DS is more expensive than our single-hose pick, but it will minimize the amount of cold air that&#8217;s wasted. Thankfully, this 12,000 BTU Whynter is fairly quiet compared to the company&#8217;s big <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002W87P9C/?tag=ybdpac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">14,000 BTU model</a> we&#8217;ve tested in the past. From the newest single-hose releases, the <a href="http://homedepot.sjv.io/neXNV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LG &#8211; LP1218GXR 12,000 BTU</a> portable air conditioner also impressed us.</p>

<p>When we first set out to test portable air conditioners, two of our team members had already owned the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008UHWUY4/?tag=ybdpac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Honeywell 10,000 BTU</a> portable AC unit, and we were quite familiar with the limitations of these machines.</p>
<p>We spent almost 40 hours researching the best models on the market and reading tests results from other publications like <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/06/are-portableair-conditioner-claims-a-lot-of-hot-air/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Reports</a> and consumer reviews on the web to find out what other people are looking for.</p>
<p>We decided to focus on models made in-house by big manufacturers, trying to eliminate designs that would be identical inside their shells. This is pretty common among brands like Sunpentown, Keystone and Danby.</p>
<p>We bought the highest-rated models from four manufacturers across three sizes, including the Honeywell we had already been using. We then spent 100+ hours testing this first group in the heat of a San Diego summer.</p>
<p>It quickly became clear that 12,000 BTUs is the sweet spot. Our market research shows that&#8217;s the size most people are purchasing, too.</p>
<p>After it won our first roundup, we used the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0115XWCHO/?tag=ybdpac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LG &#8211; LP1215GXR</a> in homes and offices for two years. We tried LG&#8217;s 2017 replacement since the specs were a little bit better, but we were disappointed with the actual performance compared to our 2016 winner.</p>
<p>In 2018, we added the top-ranked 12,000 BTU dual-hose model from Whynter and the competitive Frigidaire single-hose, along with a surprise update from LG. We&#8217;ve seen <a href="https://homedepot.sjv.io/OLenZ">one new 14,000 BTU-class machine</a> hit the shelves since then, but nothing that competes for value or efficiency with our existing picks.</p>
<p>We haven&#8217;t tested more 10,000 or 14,000 BTU models; new designs we&#8217;ve looked at don&#8217;t have better performance specs, so as long as our current picks are in stock we&#8217;ll keep listing them.</p>
<p>We briefly looked at the monstrous Wi-Fi-controlled <a href="https://homedepot.sjv.io/2Baj0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frigidaire Gallery</a> model, but our experiences testing &#8220;smart&#8221; appliances for our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-garage-door-opener/#wi-fi-garage" rel="noopener">garage door opener review</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-baby-monitor/#is-wi-fi-safe" rel="noopener">baby monitor review</a> have made us skeptical. We don&#8217;t recommend paying extra to accidentally become a quality-control tester.</p>

<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re sure you want to use this type of machine, here are some features you may want to consider.</p>
<p><strong>Portability:</strong> Weight is the major concern when you&#8217;re lifting these up and down stairs, but also consider how tall the unit is if you&#8217;ll ever need to squeeze it into the front seat of a car. (We&#8217;ve made all the 12,000 BTU models fit, but just barely.)</p>
<p><strong>BTU capacity:</strong> This is a measurement of how much heat the air conditioner can remove in an hour. Large rooms and hotter climates will need more BTUs, but see our <a href="#btucalculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investigation into BTU ratings</a> below for information on the sticky details.</p>
<p><strong>Double hose vs. single hose:</strong> This choice comes down to how hot your region gets. At temperatures rise above 90°F, the single-hose models stop being effective. Check out the <a href="#dual" target="_blank" rel="noopener">details of our testing below</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Energy efficiency:</strong> The Department of Energy gives &#8220;Energy Star&#8221; awards to other air conditioner types if they can reach 12 BTUs per watt, but the new BTU tests have dramatically lowered the ratings of all portable units. You&#8217;ll probably see an &#8220;energy efficiency rating&#8221; on models tested before 2017, but newer advertising skips this listing.</p>
<p><strong>A drain pump:</strong> If humidity is above 90 percent, you might fill up the water reservoir when running the AC and need to drain it frequently. If you don&#8217;t have a floor drain handy, some brands sell an alternate version with a pump so you don&#8217;t need to lift the unit to drain it. Even if you don&#8217;t spring for that feature, you can still use an external pump.</p>
<p><strong>Window kit:</strong> all of these air conditioner units come with a three-piece expanding baffle that holds the hose in your window. You&#8217;ll need an extension for the window kit if your window opening is more than 36 inches.</p>
<p><strong>Availability:</strong> Sadly, if you wait until the week before a heat wave you might not be able to get the air conditioner you want in time. We hope you can at least find one of our back-up picks if you&#8217;re trying to get two-day shipping and the top models are sold out.</p>
<h2>How do portable air conditioners work?</h2>
<p>Portable air conditioners use refrigerants to absorb heat and move it around, just like your freezer does. As room air passes over a metal tube, the refrigerant inside this &#8220;evaporator coil&#8221; changes from liquid to gas and soaks up as much heat as it can.</p>
<p>Up to this point, all air conditioners are basically the same. The difference between a portable air conditioner and the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-window-air-conditioner/">window air conditioners we&#8217;ve reviewed</a> is the location of the other half of an air conditioner system, the compressor and &#8220;condenser coil.&#8221;</p>
<p>A portable has the condenser coil with all that heated refrigerant sitting in your room with you. The machine can only get rid of heat by blowing a powerful fan over the condenser coil to carry heat out your window. Hence, the giant vent tubes and high noise level. <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-window-air-conditioner/">Window air conditioners</a> and central air systems are more efficient because they condense all the captured heat <em>outside</em> your house.</p>
<p>You’re still able to enjoy cool air from a portable air conditioner, but the efficiency is poor. And when you start to look at the overall temperature of a house on a hot day when you&#8217;re running a portable AC, the story only gets worse.</p>

<p>There are two ways to get enough air blowing over the condenser coil to remove all that heat: You can use the air from your room, or you can bring in air from outside. This is the purpose of the second hose in a &#8220;dual hose&#8221; air conditioner.</p>
<p>We asked Richard Ciresi, the owner of Aire Serv Heating &amp; Air Conditioning in Louisville, to explain which cases make sense for a dual-hose system compared to the more popular single-hose designs.</p>
<p>“Generally speaking,” Richard says, “it depends on the temperature outside. A single hose unit uses air that you have paid to condition and sends it outside. Warm air from the outdoors is then drawn into the space to replace the exhausted air.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it’s really warm outside, this gets expensive. If someone is using this device as a permanent solution, the [dual-hose air conditioner] will be an energy saver over the life of the unit.”</p>
<p>In our tests, we found that on a moderately hot day (up to about 87°F) the LG single-hose champion could beat the dual-hose Whynter at cooling a small room. On hot summer evenings, when temperatures outside drop to the 80s but it&#8217;s still 85 inside after a scorching afternoon, the single-hose system helps move all that hot air out of your bedroom and spot-cools your bedroom very well.</p>
<div id="visualizer-13409-497805072" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-13409"></div>
<p><strong>On a day when it climbed above 90°F outside, though, things changed. The dual-hose would still cool the room, while a single hose couldn&#8217;t keep up.</strong> The single-hose model starts off with a fast-cooling drop since it&#8217;s drawing moderately cool air into the room from the rest of the house. That&#8217;s not ideal for efficiency, but if you only need one room to stay cool for half an hour it&#8217;s worth noting. After all the air in your house is replaced with outside air, a single-hose system can only add heat on a hot day.</p>
<p>Note that in either case, you&#8217;re still getting cold air out of the front of your air conditioner; the problem is with the average air temperature in your whole house.</p>
<p>If heat is coming from <em>inside</em> the room (in kitchens, laundry rooms, or if you&#8217;ve got a room full of sweaty people) dumping the hot room air out a window can actually make the single-hose system more efficient. That&#8217;s not a typical situation for most people, though.</p>
<p>If you think you might benefit from a single-hose system, you can always leave the intake hose disconnected on a dual-hose machine to create a single-hose system; adding an outside-intake hose for a single-hose system should be possible with a lot of duct tape or 3D printing, but that&#8217;s not realistic for most of us.</p>
<p>Many insist that it only makes sense to buy an AC that will work as well as possible in the hottest conditions, and the dual-hose Whynter systems definitely fit that bill. Sadly, there aren&#8217;t many other manufacturers selling this type.</p>
<p>On the west coast where we&#8217;re located, the difference between the dual-hose and single-hose systems is notable a few weeks out of the year. The rest of the summer a cheaper and more refined single-hose system still gives much-needed relief.</p>
<h2 id="btucalculator">How many BTUs do you need?</h2>
<p>Since their main job is pumping heat energy out of your room, air conditioners are rated by their capacity for British thermal units (BTUs) of heat moved in an hour. (One BTU is the heat it takes to increase the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.)</p>
<p>The air conditioner capacity rating is based on a standardized test designed for the appliance manufacturers by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). The test allows manufacturers to compare the size of air conditioner hardware in an ideal environment.</p>
<p>For a window unit or a central air system, you can use a calculator to see how many BTUs you need to cool the volume of air your room holds, assuming normal conditions. These calculators are essential tools when buying most AC systems, so you can avoid spending money on a machine that&#8217;s bigger and draws more energy than is necessary for your home.</p>
<p>Calculating the heat load of your room also helps you avoid an over-sized system that makes your room damp instead of comfortable.</p>
<p>If you have the right windows for it, check out the calculator in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-window-air-conditioner/">window air conditioner review</a> to see how much capacity you need.</p>
<p>For a portable, though, that&#8217;s not the whole story.</p>
<h3>DOE BTU ratings</h3>
<p>In 2015 the Department of Energy proposed a new way to calculate BTU capacity of portable air conditioners that accounts for poor performance on very hot days, called an “adjusted cooling capacity.” Both single and dual-hose models were affected, but the single hose models got hit much harder.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2016-12446/p-172" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manufacturers pushed back and amendments were made to the testing procedure</a>, so the adjustment is now &#8220;seasonal.&#8221; Eighty percent of the performance rating is determined by tests with outdoor air at 83°F, and 20 percent of the rating accounts for the worst days of the season at 95°F.</p>
<p>All of the 12,000 BTU portables (like the models we tested) are down-rated to around 7,000 under the new tests. Some consumer advocates would have liked to see the testing demonstrate exactly how much worse a single-hose unit is on the very hottest days of the year, but the DOE was satisfied by data that shows <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2016-12446/p-172" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80 percent of the time most people run an AC, it&#8217;s about 83°F outside</a>.</p>
<p>Products made since 2018 show the new DOE rating side-by-side with the old number, but remember that the rating number doesn&#8217;t tell the entire story. Portables aren&#8217;t as efficient as window units, but how much less depends on complex factors.</p>
<p>Manufacturers insist on keeping exaggerated room-size recommendations, though, which is downright disingenuous. In portables, calculating a BTU rating fit for your room size isn&#8217;t as simple as it is for window air conditioners. On the hottest days of the year, even a giant 14,000 BTU dual-hose portable will struggle to keep up compared to a standard 8,000 BTU window unit.</p>
<h3>Is bigger always better?</h3>
<p>With a window air conditioner, buying a unit that&#8217;s too big will mean that it cools off the air before it can suck out the humidity, leaving your room dank. Portables tend not to cool quickly enough to have that problem, though. Models we tested also feature a &#8220;dry&#8221; mode that will redirect dry exhaust air into the room.</p>
<p>There are reasons to avoid extra-large portable air conditioners, though. In our testing, it became obvious that noise from bigger units in the 14,000 BTU range can be detrimental to sleep. The extra coolant and bigger coils make portability suffer, too: The Whynter 14,000 BTU model came in at a whopping 100 pounds compared to a typical 65.</p>
<p>Our recommended size bracket for most rooms is 12,000 BTUs (under the old ASHRAE raw-performance rating), but manage your expectations on hot days. If you don&#8217;t care about noise and portability, a bigger model will cool more effectively in large rooms. Just remember that you&#8217;re going to need to be working (or sleeping) close to these beasts to really stay cool.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve run tests over four summers, and conditions have varied from moderate 80-degree California spring days to 105-degree heat waves. We&#8217;ve moved our portables between homes and offices, slept beside them, and run three different kinds of tests.</p>
<p>A portable AC unit needs to blow out your window, and the included window kits are all equivalent in terms of features. The LG has gray plastic, while the other kits came in white.</p>
<p>We needed an extension for one room we tested in, so we cannibalized parts from the three LG window kits we had on hand.  Extensions are only readily available for the Honeywell, so buying a second window kit is probably your best bet if you don&#8217;t want to cut a custom-sized baffle out of plexiglas.</p>
<h3>Size testing</h3>
<p>For our first round of testing in 2016, we used a lineup of four portables in a San Diego home and measured the temperature change as they did their work over moderately hot days in two different room sizes.</p>
<p>In a 125-square-foot office, LG’s 12,000 BTU model was neck and neck with the powerhouse 14,000 Whynter dual-hose unit, and those two models actually left the room cold — definitely better performance than we expected.</p>
<p>Once we moved the portables into a 450-square-foot great room, the 14,000 BTU size started to show its strength — but it was still disappointing for an air conditioner in a room that it&#8217;s nominally &#8220;rated for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having used the 10,000 BTU Honeywell in the heat of summer, we can say that a smaller portable unit needs to be blowing directly on you. Even then, it’s not comfortable, it’s just barely getting you by.</p>
<p>Let’s not kid ourselves — portable air conditioners aren’t going to cool an entire house. In many ways, they’re best described as personal air conditioning units. If you think of them and use them that way, you’ll probably be happy.</p>
<h3>Updated tests</h3>
<p>For further tests of updated models, we decided to focus on the Goldilocks size of 12,000 BTU models.</p>
<p>Our winner from 2016 is still going strong, but we tested a replacement model that was released in the summer of 2017. LG&#8217;s sales representatives confirmed to us that they update air conditioners on a two-year cycle, so we were surprised when we bumped into a redesigned 2018 model, the LP1218GRX, in a Home Depot.</p>
<p>We also bought the Whynter and Frigidaire 12,000 BTU models, since their specs looked competitive and nobody else has tested these models against each other.</p>
<div id="visualizer-12964-586442157" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-12964"></div>
<p>For our updated tests we tried three different methods for comparing these designs. First, in early summer when outside temperatures were only hitting 82°F, we heated our upstairs testing room from the inside to see what the actual peak performance of our machines was. Starting from a controlled 85°F and with 2,000 watts of ongoing heat (about 6,800 BTU) from a pair of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-space-heater/" rel="noopener">space heaters</a>, we ran the 12,000-BTU-rated portables for an hour.</p>
<p>Next, we shut off one heater to bring the load down to 800 watts for another hour, then turned off the last heater to see how the AC could cool in &#8220;easy&#8221; conditions.</p>
<p>We were satisfied that the old 2015 LG is still going strong, and a bit surprised at how poorly the Whynter dual-hose model was cooling the room.</p>
<p>When we considered the reason that a dual-hose model is supposed to be more efficient, the test results made sense: a single-hose model draws air from outside or from the rest of your house (depending on how well your windows and doors are sealed).</p>
<p>If your room is being heated from inside rather than by hot weather, a single-hose portable works very well. In our case, the single-hose models dumped heated room air out of the window exhaust and drew air from a lower floor that stays cooler, even on a moderately hot day. There was still a difference in the amount of cooling these units were doing relative to each other; in the last phase of the test LG&#8217;s models continued to lead the pack even after the heat was turned off.</p>
<h3>Dual hose vs. single hose testing</h3>
<div id="visualizer-12959-123408318" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-12959"></div>
<p>When a summer heat wave finally arrived and we saw a forecast for back-to-back days at 100+ degrees, we set up the Whynter dual hose and the winning LG single-hose to compare performance in worst-case scenarios.</p>
<p>With outside temperatures climbing from 92°F to 102°F in the afternoon, the dual-hose Whynter was finally playing its strong suit. The LG held on early in the testing day, but when peak temperatures hit the single-hose design drew in hot air more quickly than it could cool the room. (It was actually a few degrees cooler on the day we tested the LG, but it didn&#8217;t help.)</p>
<p>When we opened our sealed room at the end of the testing period we were impressed at how cool the airstream coming off of the LG was compared to the average temperature logged on our thermometer — it&#8217;s not an efficient way to cool your room, but a good single-hose design is still making a cool breeze that you could use strategically on a hot day.</p>

<p>After all our cooling tests, we know these units can be loud. While you&#8217;re not going to get complaints from the neighbors, the worst offenders might disrupt your sleep. If you buy an AC unit to keep you from sweating all night, it shouldn’t make you pay by waking you up.</p>
<p>There are two stages of sound levels for these units: the ongoing noise and the sound of the compressor turning on or off. These units are all designed so that when the room hits a temperature higher than you set, it rumbles to life, reaching its all-time loudest point.</p>
<p>This means that you’ll most likely find yourself shaken awake when the unit activates or deactivates throughout the night. Not an ideal situation. Most of them won’t be so loud they immediately jar you, but if they find you in the wrong sleep stage, there’s a good chance you’ll be woken up.</p>
<p>For this reason, we measured not only the ongoing decibel levels of each unit — we also measured the activation/deactivation decibel level, to see which models were most likely to jar us awake.</p>

<p><strong>The 14,000 BTU Whynter, while the most powerful unit, was also the most brutally loud.</strong> That&#8217;s an instant nix if you’re considering it as a bedroom option.</p>
<p>On the other side of the sound spectrum, LG&#8217;s 2015 and 2018 designs have proven the quietest overall. You&#8217;re not going to mistake these for room fans, but they stayed low enough not to be a nuisance in our night-time testing.</p>
<p>The smaller 12,000 BTU Whynter is a bit louder than the LG in normal operation, but the starting/stopping sound was less of an overall change in sound level. It&#8217;s a 1dB difference either way, which is so small that you might not notice it without measuring equipment.</p>
<h3>Sleep modes and remotes</h3>
<p>Another irritating feature of many units is that you can’t turn off their LED lights. You’d think the product designers would have thought through the option to shut off the lights for people who prefer blacked out rooms (<a href="http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/discomfort-15/better-sleep/slideshow-sleep-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies show it helps your sleep</a>), but most didn’t.</p>

<p><strong>LG is the standout here, with a button on the remote control that will actually turn off the light.</strong> On the 2017 model, they also designed it to drop the fan speeds down for quieter operation at night, but the 2018 model just sticks with whatever mode you&#8217;ve been using. Frigidaire made an effort, with a sleep mode that makes the thermostat less picky so the machine starts up the loud compressor less often, but the main light only dims very slightly and the mode LEDs are still bright.</p>
<h3>Dehumidifier modes</h3>
<p>If you suffer through long, muggy summers, you may find the humidity-removal of these units valuable. Because we don’t live in an overly humid area, we weren’t able to test the maximum capacity of each, but the reported pints-per-hour ratings are on par with the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-dehumidifier/" rel="noopener">best dehumidifiers</a> we&#8217;ve tested.</p>
<p>Despite winning on every other test, LG came in last with a manufacturer&#8217;s rating of 35.04 pints per day — that&#8217;s less than half of Frigidaire&#8217;s class-leading 79 pints per day. We haven&#8217;t heard anything from LG&#8217;s engineers about why there&#8217;s such a difference.</p>
<p>Note that all of these units are designed to operate in &#8220;dry&#8221; or &#8220;dehumidify&#8221; modes with the exhaust hose disconnected and dry, hot air circulating inside your room. They won&#8217;t be cooling the room much in dry mode, and water will collect much more quickly in the reservoir.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AA8WOAK/?tag=ybdpac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ARC-122 DS Elite</a> from Whynter is a quiet dual-hose air conditioner, and that makes it a rare beast. Dual-hose models are rare enough as it is!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re buying a portable because you expect temperatures to climb above 95°F, a dual-hose system will do its job while a single-hose model will struggle. Now that we&#8217;ve had a chance to verify this with our own test in a real heat wave, we have to agree with our competitor on the other coast that the inconvenience of the second hose is a worthwhile tradeoff.</p>
<p>We looked at other tests of competing dual-hose models and didn&#8217;t see anything that convinced us to buy other models. The Whynter&#8217;s performance in more moderate conditions was actually pretty disappointing, and usability is lackluster</p>

This is a quiet air conditioner that will be able to handle heat waves better than any single-hose design. If you're not expecting to see temperatures above 95°F, though, there are better options</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AA8WOAK/?tag=ybdpac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>While Whynter is neck and neck for noise output with the LG in this size class, the screen is hard to see without crouching down, and if you&#8217;re using the remote control you still have to walk over and open or close the vent manually. There&#8217;s a slip cover included for storage, which is nice, but the paint scratches easily. Finally, when we averaged the power draw we measured with the Whynter it was about 70 watts higher than the competition. Not a huge gap, but notable.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Whynter &#8211; ARC-122DS Elite will beat any single-hose design during a heat wave, and that&#8217;s probably the time when performance is most important.</li>
<li>Whynter is one of the few manufacturers focusing on dual-hose designs, so there&#8217;s not a lot of competition.</li>
<li>Noise output from this model is competitive with winning single-hose models.</li>
<li>The design is a bit old and clunky-looking, but low weight makes it relatively portable.</li>

<p>We&#8217;ve tested three versions of this design: the LP1215GXR was current in 2015-16, then came the LP1217GXR, which is supposed to be sold through 2019 according to LG&#8217;s sales director. The 1218GXR is a limited release we&#8217;ve seen at Home Depot and on Amazon, though, and it&#8217;s been quieter and more efficient in our tests than the 17.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, the new LG design is around $20 less expensive than the Frigidaire and $45 less than the Whynter. You could save money by buying a smaller AC (the new Honeywell 10,000 BTU model is typically sold for about $100 less), but portables are enough of a performance compromise already that downsizing is risky.</p>

This is great for bedroom use.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CQ97KFP/?tag=ybdpac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The LP1218GXR is the newest model LG makes in the 12,000 BTU size. If you&#8217;re dead-set on a single-hose design and you want something bigger, check out the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NC2QM6V/?tag=ybdpac-20">LG &#8211; LP1419IVSM</a>. The best new features include a dedicated sleep button on the control panel and a hose outlet on the base that allows you to store the hose while it&#8217;s connected to the machine. A 14,000 BTU model will provide more cooling power, but they&#8217;re a lot bigger and louder: the fan speeds need to be higher to cool at that capacity, so for bedroom use, it&#8217;s not really worthwhile.</p>
<p>For our money, the 12,000 BTU LG is also the best-looking model, with a sleek design that tapers elegantly. It also has features sorely missed on the Whynter, like a magnetized holder for the remote and a spindle to keep the cord wrapped when it&#8217;s in your closet. There&#8217;s even a nighttime mode that works!</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The LG &#8211; LP1218GXR will give you top performance if it doesn&#8217;t get above 90°F outside.</li>
<li>During a heat wave, a single-hose design like this can actually make your room hotter.</li>
<li>Of the single-hose models, this was the quietest and nicest to use.</li>
<li>If it&#8217;s hot inside but cooling off outside, this single-hose design will cool your bedroom quickly.</li>
</ul>

<p>If, for whatever reason, you&#8217;re looking for a portable air conditioner that doesn’t need to move or sit in your bedroom, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002W87P9C/?tag=ybdpac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Whynter &#8211; ARC-14SH</a> may be a better choice, especially if your climate skews on the much hotter side.</p>

<p>A dual-hose design like the ARC-122 Elite already has a leg up on our single-hose picks, but the enforcer on Whynter&#8217;s team brings raw power to match. The DOE still down-rates capacity to 8,500 BTUs, but the difference between this and a single-hose unit will get bigger as the outside temperatures get hotter.</p>
<p>One feature this particular Whynter model brought to the table is a heating mode. If you’d like your portable A/C to double as a heating unit, the versatility of the Whynter may be a good fit for your home or office. You can also check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-space-heater/" rel="noopener">space heater review here</a>.</p>
<p>We could see the Whynter being a good fit in older office buildings with open floor plans that both get too hot and too cold, but anticipate drawing straws to determine who has to sit next to &#8220;the beast.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077VH1GC2/?tag=ybdpac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Frigidaire &#8211; FFPA1222U1</a> was new to our testing lineup in 2018, and this model has a few strengths.</p>
<p>Frigidaire&#8217;s machine is highest-rated for moisture removal in dehumidifier mode, which might be an important stat if you&#8217;re in an especially humid area.</p>
<p>The design has a nice feature that&#8217;s been deleted from LG&#8217;s newest models: a space on the back you can plug the cord into to keep it tidy in storage. There&#8217;s no remote control holder, though, and the sleep mode doesn&#8217;t dim the lights as much as we&#8217;d like.</p>
<p>The handles are set high on this model, which makes it a bit easier to pick up and move over a short distance (like when you&#8217;re clearing a threshold between rooms). It&#8217;s more top-heavy, though, so we prefer LG&#8217;s design for lifting and rolling around.</p>
<p>The price for any of these models will bounce up and down as inventory shifts during summer heat waves. On the whole, though, the performance edge and lower noise of LG&#8217;s 2018 model makes it a better choice even if it happens to be $20-30 more.</p>

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008UHWUY4/?tag=ybdpac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Honeywell &#8211; MN10CESWW</a> unit is getting old, but it&#8217;s still a popular choice for many people — it has solid Amazon reviews and is on the low end of average prices in the market.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re obviously in the target buyer group: Two different households in our office owned the Honeywell for a total of four summers of use. While we were generally satisfied, “ecstatic” would be pushing it.</p>

<p>Even compared to the bigger LG, this thing is hard to move, and we would often decide not to move it from room to room with us simply because of the inconvenience. Even in moderately-hot environments, it really only functions as a cold fan.</p>
<p>This model is on the louder side, too, and frequently woke us up in the middle of the night. Overall, it’s a solid product and one that got us by for a few summers, but after testing the LG we understand what you give up with a cheap portable air conditioner.</p>
<h2 id="long-term">Updates and long-term notes</h2>
<p>This post was originally published in May of 2016. Over two summers we extensively compared the LG 12,000 and a now-discontinued Haier 12,000 in two different rooms, and our opinion of the LG was solidified.</p>
<p>The Honeywell 10,000 BTU unit is as loud and proud as ever, though we find ourselves begrudging any need to move it or turn it on.</p>
<h3>Updated models</h3>
<p>In 2018, we checked on manufacturers to see what’s new on the market and bought an updated LP1217 model from LG.</p>
<p>The new LG is heavier and louder, but average performance over three tests was actually slightly lower than the model we bought in 2016. In one test it did cool more quickly by running its cooling cycles more frequently, but the energy efficiency rating has dropped from 11.2 for the old model to 9.4 on the new model.</p>
<p>While we were researching for a dual hose vs. single hose shootout, we bumped into a brand-new LG 12,000 BTU model that&#8217;s not even on LG&#8217;s website yet. We decided to test it, the Whynter 12,000 BTU and a new Frigidaire 12,000 BTU model in a new round of testing, since they all had comparable specs.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://homedepot.sjv.io/neXNV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LG &#8211; LP1218GXR</a> has finally bumped the 1215 off the throne for noise and cooling capacity, but now that we&#8217;ve tried them more thoroughly in heat-wave conditions, we can confirm that a dual-hose design does perform better.</p>
<p>The Haier we tested in 2016 was discontinued, but the Honeywell is still widely available for a good price.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Since there are a bunch of factors to weigh, we don&#8217;t want to make your decision for you, but we hope this information will be a helpful guide for your purchase.</p>
<p>If you live in a region that sees scorching heat waves on a regular basis, the dual-hose Whynter &#8211; ARC-122DS is definitely going to be the best choice. We&#8217;ll say it again, though: even great portable air conditioners aren&#8217;t very good at keeping up with extreme heat. The <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-window-air-conditioner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best window air conditioners</a> keep the heat outside far better, and they&#8217;re also much quieter.</p>

<p>For as long as it’s still readily available, we’re happy with the performance of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0115XWCHO/?tag=ybdpac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LG &#8211; LP1215GXR</a>, but the new LP1218GXR is sleeker and works a little better. This isn&#8217;t going to do as well as a dual-hose design like the Whynter during an extremely hot day, but the rest of the year or in the evening it can&#8217;t be beat.</p>

<p>If you’re between a rock and a hard place with a big sun-facing room and can’t install a window unit, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002W87P9C/?tag=ybdpac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Whynter’s dual-hose 14,000 BTU portable</a> has more capacity and cools more efficiently than other portables. It’s gigantic and significantly louder than our top pick, but this is your best bet for rooms bigger than 400 square feet. It’s also a great choice if you need heat in the winter.</p>
