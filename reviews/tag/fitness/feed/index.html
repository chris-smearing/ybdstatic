								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ur team of testers took 12,000 steps and 12 trips to the gym in pursuit of the best gym bag with a shoe compartment. After a week of side-by-side testing, we determined that the best overall is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DLQP1T1/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Boost &#8211; Sports Gym Bag</a>. It’s inexpensive yet sturdy, water-resistant and provides the most enjoyable day-long carrying experience. Close behind was the roomy, durable <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011R5MHKC/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adidas &#8211; Team Issue</a>, best for athletes and outdoor exercisers.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>The market for gym bags is filled with great products in wildly varied size and price ranges. To narrow our testing field, we set our budget at 50 dollars and only looked for bags with excellent average review ratings at the usual online retailers.</p>
<p>From there, we checked lists from Men’s Health, Wirecutter and NY Magazine. When we found a bag that was on multiple lists and met both our buyer-rating and budget criteria, we added it to a shortlist for testing.</p>
<p>Finally, we talked to our gym-going colleagues and friends to find out which bags they use and love. Our final list is made up of high-quality, inexpensive, well-loved bags that have the features to make your trips to the gym more productive and maybe even less smelly.</p>
<h2 id="lineup">Compare the best gym bags</h2>
[table id=328 /]
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Size</h3>
<p>We chose gym bags specifically with shoe compartments to test, and that distinction naturally lent itself to at least medium-sized bags. Our goal was to find a bag comfortable enough to carry, but big enough to fit not only our shoes and gym outfits, but also toiletries and cosmetics, a change of clothes, a full water bottle and one specialty equipment item (we chose boxing gloves). If walking to the gym, you may want a smaller bag like the gym-friendly pick in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-laptop-backpack/#17-inch-pick">Laptop Backpack review</a>. If transporting large equipment, you&#8217;ll want to check out larger bags.</p>
<h3>Weight</h3>
<p>Depending on the weight of the equipment you’re carrying and the distance you have to travel with your gym bag, you’ll likely want as lightweight a bag as possible. If you’re opting for a heavier bag for either style or sturdiness, you’ll want to make sure the bag’s straps are adequately padded. All the gym bags we tested are two pounds or fewer, with the exception of the Everest.</p>
<h3>Material</h3>
<p>We looked for a bag that we were confident could last and remain fresh for a long time. We considered material type (body of the bag and zippers included), which influences how much weight a bag can bear, how susceptible it is to tearing and its breathability.</p>
<p>Generally, gym bags with shoe compartments are made of nylon (often laminated and less breathable), polyester (more breathable), or some combination of the two. The strongest bags in our bunch were blends. In the case of our top pick, different weaves are added to the mix, but a backing is still present to keep out water.</p>
<p>You should also note that breathable fabric also allows water in. Nylon technically gets soggy more than polyester if you let it sit in the rain, but it&#8217;s the rubbery backing that keeps your clothes dry inside.</p>
<p>To mitigate the effect a waterproof bag might have on the smells trapped inside, find a bag that includes a vented shoe compartment.</p>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>Most gym bags with a shoe compartment will do a fairly decent job of holding everything you need. What sets the great apart from the good is a bag’s ability to organize. The amount, size and arrangement of pockets can make a huge difference in how functional a gym bag is. When working out under a time constraint, digging for the items you need can be incredibly frustrating. Check for pocket numbers and layouts that will make your life easier, not harder.</p>
[table id=330 /]
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Over the course of a week, we tested six different bags  on our commutes and in our gyms. We standardized our packing lists to include sneakers, clothes for working out, a change of street clothes, cosmetics, a water bottle, electronics, keys and a pair of boxing gloves.</p>
<h3>Packing and functionality</h3>
<p>Our picks ranged from four pockets to nine (with the shoe compartment included), with the Mier &#8211; 20 inches Sports Gym bag at the lowest end and the Everest &#8211; Gym Bag with Wet Pocket at the highest. The latter became our organizational favorite, but still wasn’t our top pick overall.</p>
<p>As we packed for each of our trips to the gym, we used our standardized packing list to establish a preference for one gym bag over another. We wanted to know which bag was the best organizational help and which felt like a bottomless pit. Packing and using the same gear for our trips gave us a clear indicator which bags we liked to use best.</p>
[table id=329 /]
<h3>Comfort</h3>
<p>Each gym bag accompanied our team members on their individual commutes, but each bag was also taken for a roughly 2,000 step journey to compare comfort levels. We rated the comfort level of each bag on a star system, where one is “ too uncomfortable to use again,” two is “became very uncomfortable quickly”, three is “pretty comfortable”  and four is “no discomfort at all.”</p>
<p>Because different testers can comfortably carry different weights, potentially influencing this test, we also made a more direct assessment of strap padding.</p>
<h3>Durability</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25398" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key.jpg" alt="Testing abrasion resistance with a key" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We left each bag hanging with 30 pounds inside for one hour to test the strength of straps, buckles and zippers. Next, we applied a scratch test. For the scratch test, we took a key and scraped the outside and the lining of each bag with varying degrees of pressure (first soft, then firm, then as hard as possible) and recorded any tears or permanent scratches.</p>
<h3>Breathability and smell</h3>
<p>To test how well our bags dealt with moisture and smell, we performed two tests. For the first test, we kept our dirty gym clothes in the bag for a full eight hours, and after taking the clothes out, noted how long the bag retained its dirty smell. We unzipped each bag but did not fully open them, and checked in at the half hour, hour and two hour mark.</p>
<p>For the second, we muddied an old pair of sneakers and put them into the designated shoe compartment. Then, we checked back in an hour to see if the mud was dry. We also checked to see if we could smell the shoes from the outside of the bag from both a foot away and right next to the bag.</p>
<p>Our goal was to find a gym bag that resisted odors entirely, but it became clear that this was unrealistic, so we placed greater emphasis on the second test and the breathability of a bag’s shoe compartment.</p>
<h3>Water resistance</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25397" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water.jpg" alt="Testing waterproofing" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We also poured a cup of water directly onto our bags to test claims of water resistance or waterproof-ness. For bags claiming to be only water resistant, we accepted damp clothes as a result, but not wet ones. Waterproof bags needed to keep clothes inside completely dry.</p>
<h3>Cleaning test</h3>
<p>If you’re carrying specialized equipment that sees a lot of outdoor use, you’ll want a gym bag with a shoe compartment that cleans easily. As a final test, we gave each of our gym bags a thorough cleaning with wipes to compare maintenance effort.</p>
<p>We counted how many wipes it took to clean each bag, checked to see if mud remained in nooks and crannies after a single cleaning pass and gave extra kudos for machine washable bags.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Boost</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25402" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Boost.jpg" alt="Boost" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>Our tests to find the best gym bag with shoe compartment confirmed our initial intuition; many of these bags are excellent, and this was a tough race. Ultimately, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DLQP1T1/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Boost</a> proved itself as our favorite with its attention to detail, overall functionality and affordable price.</p>
<p>The Boost gym bag was near the top of our list for functionality thanks to its structure and layout; it has five total pockets (including the shoe compartment), and one is meant specifically for holding wet clothes or swimsuits. It has no designated place for toiletries, but our team was satisfied storing those in the front pocket. On the side is a mesh bottle pocket we found perfect for holding the full range of sizes we&#8217;ve tested in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-water-bottle/">water bottle review</a>, and the shoe compartment was vented, which helped it perform well in our breathability and smell test.</p>
<p>In terms of comfort, we loved the Boost gym bag for its comfortable straps, and for the way its shape helps it stay easy to carry on long trips. The unique (among this group of bags) textured material – a nylon-blend oxford weave – made the bag feel more luxurious.</p>

Its thoughtful design makes the Boost a great, functional companion for the gym</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DLQP1T1/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Performing well on our durability test was an absolute must, and the Boost gym bag did not disappoint. We thought its unique fabric texture might rip easily, but no amount of pressure in our scratch test damaged the bag. In the weighted hanging test, we found that the reinforced seams and metal clasps held the load without trouble. The added reinforcement on the bottom of the bag and its water-resistant (though not waterproof) outside ensure this bag will last a long time.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Boost &#8211; Sports Gym Bag excels in combining versatile functionality with subtle style.</li>
<li>If you need a fully waterproof gym bag, you’ll need to look elsewhere (like the runner-up from Adidas), but this bag can handle a bit of water, and can keep wet clothes separate.</li>
<li>The relatively low price and high durability of this gym bag make it ideal for long term use without making a big investment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="runner-up">Runner up: Adidas</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25401" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Adidas.jpg" alt="Adidas" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011R5MHKC/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adidas &#8211; Team Issue</a> came highly recommended not only by a number of review websites, but also by some trusted friends and colleagues who swore by its longevity and spaciousness. Our team found that it lived up to its reputation, but fell slightly short in terms of functionality.</p>
<p>The main pro of the Adidas bag is that it combines lightweight comfort with durability. We knew from other tests that this bag would be durable, but from the way the fabric blend (nylon, polyester and elastane) felt in our hands, and considering the bag weighs less than two pounds, we were surprised by how well it stood up to abuse.</p>
<p>In our durability tests, this bag performed extremely well. The straps barely strained holding 30 pounds for an hour, and no amount of scratching (on any of the distinct fabric types) left a lasting mark. It comes with a lifetime guarantee, but we don’t think you’ll need to use it.</p>
<p>It’s the elastane in the fabric mix that gives this bag its stretch and lightweight feel, and the nylon provides a fair degree of water resistance, especially on the reinforced bottom. We found too that the lining of this bag was great at repelling moisture — lugging around wet clothes or swimsuits won’t be an issue, nor would setting this bag down in a puddle on the locker room floor.</p>

<p>Our Adidas gym bag was slightly quicker to clean than our top pick and also included a vented shoe compartment, which we liked for our muddy shoes and sweaty clothes. Even with five total pockets, though, its spartan functionality (or lack thereof) knocked it to number two on our list.</p>
<p>Despite a small toiletries section, the main pocket felt way too disorganized. With almost no structure (and no water bottle pocket), we found that our items continued to slide around in transit, knocking our attempts at organization further out of alignment.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Adidas &#8211; Team Issue is a great bag for athletes because of its easy cleanability and cavernous design.</li>
<li>For a busy, everyday gym-goer, this bag’s lack of structured organization made finding things too difficult.</li>
<li>The mix of durability and light weight this bag provides makes it a comfortable way to lug your gym gear that will last a long time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-other-finalists">The other finalists we tested</h2>
<h3>Coreal</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25403" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Coreal.jpg" alt="Coreal" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CTPM7MC/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coreal &#8211; Sport Gym Bag</a> is another gym bag that makes great use of its pockets. High functionality combined with a fully waterproof shell almost earned it a top spot.</p>
<p>We found this bag to be spacious yet organized and especially liked the side pockets. A dedicated water bottle pocket seems like it should be a prerequisite for a good gym bag, but not all of our picks had one, so we appreciated Coreal for including theirs. This bag passed our packing functionality test easily.</p>
<p>The most fully waterproof of all our finalists, we felt so confident in this bag’s impenetrability that one of our testers took it into a torrential downpour. It protected the contents inside and proved its worth even further.</p>
<p>A completely waterproof shell does come with one main drawback, however, and that is the Coreal gym bag’s complete lack of breathability. The bag is mainly waterproofed ripstop nylon, and the shoe compartment has no vent. During our testing, we noticed that our muddy shoes were not dry after an hour and that the Coreal bag retained the smell of our sweaty gym clothes overnight.</p>
<p>If you live in an especially wet climate, or favor swimming as your exercise of choice, this orderly, highly waterproof bag is perfect. If, on the other hand, you aren’t keen on at least wiping down your gym bag after every use, more breathable designs on this list may serve you better.</p>
<h3>Everest</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25394" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Everest.jpg" alt="Everest" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000F3FVTC/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Everest</a> was the top of Wirecutter’s list of best gym bags for a while before they reconsidered due to durability issues. Likewise, a number of other sites and friends suggested giving this bag a try, and it performed well until our durability test, where it ultimately failed.</p>
<p>Nine pockets (including shoe compartment) make it very easy to put everything in exactly the right place when using this bag; there is even an extra water bottle pocket, which would be great for bringing coffee or tea during a commute to an early morning workout. The inside compartment of the Everest gym bag is smartly divided and we especially liked that it included both a wet-item pocket and a pocket for toiletries and cosmetics. We felt that this bag could have easily held double our packing list and remained high in our functionality ranks; there really is a place for everything.</p>
<p>This bag may not be waterproof and is barely water resistant – our clothes were definitely damp after we did our water test – but it did a great job at not holding onto odors. While the lining of the main compartment was a little more difficult to clean than others, we had no trouble wiping the shoe compartment of its mud thanks to its more water-resistant material.</p>
<p>Where the Everest gym bag lost our testers was in its durability testing; even before applying full pressure, we were able to tear the polyester canvas on the outside of the bag. During the hanging test, we also saw that the seams were straining and were worried they might pop; our top three gym bags with shoe compartments performed much better.</p>
<p>Our testers also found that the sub-par straps on the Everest bag less comfortable to travel on their shoulder than most other bags on this list. Though Everest provides padding for the long strap, we found it to be insufficient. This gym bag will serve you really well for a while, but if you have to walk far with the bag or expect to have it for a long time, you may want to reconsider.</p>
<h3>G4free</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25395" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/G4free.jpg" alt="G4free" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>A few of our testers prefer backpacks over duffels, so were excited to give the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KV96XFU/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">G4Free &#8211; 3-Way 40L</a> convertible backpack a try, thinking it would be more comfortable.</p>
<p>While we found this bag to be high on our functionality list – it’s convertible and has lots of organization features – we were disappointed to find that the padding for the duffel strap was much more substantial than the padding for the backpack straps. This makes carrying the G4free less comfortable as a backpack than it should be.</p>
<p>When performing the weighted hanging test with this bag, we did separate tests for the duffel straps and the backpack straps. The duffel straps performed well, but the backpack straps did not. Though it’s likely the backpack straps were made thinner to make sure they tuck into their pocket during conversion, we thought a bit more reinforcement wouldn’t hurt. Our key also made some faint marks during the scratch test portion of our durability investigation.</p>
<p>Pluses of this bag include its lightweight design and its waterproof shell; like the Coreal gym bag, though, the shoe compartment was not vented and made for wet, muddy and smelly sneakers. We appreciated the addition of a toiletries pocket, but missed the water bottle pocket.</p>
<h3>Mier</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25399" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mier.jpg" alt="Mier" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>Our testers might have marked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01A4Z4VC8/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mier &#8211; SPO002</a> higher if other products on this list hadn’t been so excellent. As a gym bag with shoe compartment, it’s perfectly adequate, but has nothing to set it apart from the rest.</p>
<p>We were excited by the structure in this bag, a factor which usually makes packing easier, but with only four total pockets, we felt like some of our smaller items had nowhere to go where they wouldn’t get lost. This alone doesn’t make this bag our least favorite, but combined with its poor performance during other tests, it didn’t quite live up to expectations. There is almost no padding on the straps (which struggled as a whole throughout testing) to provide comfort and we quite easily put marks in the nylon material of this bag during our scratch test. Other gym bags jumped ahead quickly in the rankings.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>During our testing, we looked for a gym bag with excellent features that could be had for under 50 dollars, and the competition was quite close.</p>
<p>Our top pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DLQP1T1/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Boost &#8211; Sports Gym Bag</a>, earned its number one spot by passing all of our durability tests and particularly wowing our testers in packing functionality and comfort.</p>
<p>We placed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011R5MHKC/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adidas &#8211; Team Issue</a> in a very close second place, and it’s a great choice for sports equipment. The high quality of this bag means you may never have to replace it.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>We consulted with registered yoga instructor, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hollenbeckyoga" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Hollenbeck</a>, about her recommendations for choosing a yoga mat. She also helped test mats and was indispensable in guiding us with this review.</p>
<div class="ybd-expert"><div class="ybd-expert-outer"><img class="  ybd-expert-headshot" data-src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sarah-hollenbeck-expert.png" /><div class="ybd-expert-inner"><h4 class="ybd-expert-title">Expert Consulted:</h4><h5 class="ybd-expert-person">Sarah Hollenbeck</h5><p class="ybd-expert-person-title">Certified Yoga Instructor</p></div></div></div>
<p>We also scoured yoga subreddits and surveyed various yoga devotees to find out what features they look for and value in a yoga mat. We then consulted trusted review sites to pinpoint the current top-rated mats. We narrowed our list down even further by reading through customer reviews on Amazon to weed out the mats that didn’t live up to the hype and further define the features everyday yogis value in a yoga mat. With all of this information under our belts, we could define the key metrics to use for our mat selection and comparison.</p>
<p>We then chose mats to test from our list that best matched the most vital, sought-after features we’d discovered in our research, had a high number of customer reviews and were rated above four stars on Amazon. For the best affordable yoga mat category, we chose mats under $40; for the best travel yoga mat, we selected thin, lightweight, highly portable models to test.</p>

<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>“In general, it&#8217;s best to look for mats that compliment your practice and lifestyle, as that&#8217;s what will keep you coming back to yoga again and again,” Sarah notes. “For instance, if you are new to yoga and have sensitive joints, it’s best to go with a mat with greater cushion, as it will provide relief for your joints. If you have been practicing for some time, you may want to consider something with a bit more longevity. Body types should be taken into account as well, as someone taller will need a bigger mat to keep proper alignment in poses without trailing off the edge.”</p>
<h3>Thickness</h3>

<p>In general, there are three yoga mat thickness levels to consider:</p>
<h4>Thin (2 millimeters and below)</h4>
<p>For classes that are more difficult or specifically focused on balance, like Bikram or Iyengar, thinner mats are the way to go. If you plan to use your mat while traveling, a thin, lightweight and/or foldable mat is a sensible option to fit in your suitcase or carry-on. Advanced yogis or those who practice on a soft surface (like carpet) may also prefer a thinner mat.</p>
<h4>Medium (generally in the 3 millimeter range)</h4>
<p>Medium thickness mats are often good for hatha and vinyasa yoga, which require a balance of cushion and grip.</p>
<h4>Thick (about 5 millimeters and up)</h4>
<p>If you have sensitive joints or plan to practice a type of yoga that requires you to hold poses for an extended period of time — yin or restorative, for example — a thicker mat will provide the padding you need to cushion your joints and the balls of your hands and feet, so you can hold those long poses with less pain. This is also a great option if you plan to practice on a solid surface, such as hardwood, tile or cement floors.</p>
<p>Props and other tools are also available as an alternative to buying a thicker mat, including yoga blankets, blocks, bolsters and straps to alleviate pressure on joints. Special yoga knee pads, gloves and socks can also be used for additional cushioning on a thinner mat.</p>
<p>“Props can be used on an as-needed basis if you are still experiencing pain in your joints,” advises our mat expert, Sarah. “Over time, as your body gets used to practicing on a regular basis, you can upgrade to thinner mats, which provide more balance.”</p>
<p>While thicker mats provide maximum comfort and cushioning, keep in mind that too much cushion tends to be tougher to balance on. A thick mat that isn’t high quality can also be lacking in the “bounce-back” factor, leaving you with permanent dents and impressions on your mat after a session.</p>
<p>Of course, your selection will ultimately come down to personal preference. Do you like a harder or softer surface? Do you prefer the cushioned feeling of a thick mat, or do you want a solid surface that will deliver optimum balance and stability? If you’re just starting out, we recommend beginning with a low-priced mat on the thicker side (such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B078XJ1D5W/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HeathYoga &#8211; Eco Friendly Non Slip</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IAAIEIG/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Clever Yoga &#8211; Better Grip</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GQLH61H/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gaiam &#8211; Print Premium</a>) until you get a better idea of your thickness preference.</p>
<h3>Traction</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-23925 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yoga-mat-padding-types.jpg" alt="types of mat padding" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yoga-mat-padding-types-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yoga-mat-padding-types-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yoga-mat-padding-types-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yoga-mat-padding-types-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yoga-mat-padding-types-810x540.jpg 810w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yoga-mat-padding-types-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yoga-mat-padding-types-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yoga-mat-padding-types-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yoga-mat-padding-types-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yoga-mat-padding-types-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yoga-mat-padding-types-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yoga-mat-padding-types-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yoga-mat-padding-types-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yoga-mat-padding-types-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yoga-mat-padding-types-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yoga-mat-padding-types-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yoga-mat-padding-types-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yoga-mat-padding-types-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Another important factor to consider when buying a yoga mat is how much traction you need on the top of your mat. There are two types of traction you’ll find on a mat’s surface: “grippiness” and “stickiness.” A grippy mat surface is textured to provide extra grip for your hands and feet, while a sticky mat surface is actually tacky to the touch and provides even more protection against slippage.</p>
<p>A non-skid bottom is an especially important feature to have in a yoga mat, especially if your practice involves a lot of movement, like vinyasa or ashtanga. If you practice any type of hot yoga, or if you tend to perspire a lot, you’ll want a mat with plenty of traction all around — grippiness, stickiness <i>and</i> a non-skid bottom. Yogis who fall into this category may also want to consider anti-bacterial mats for their practice. Some mats are actually designed to become even grippier with moisture; these are ideal for hot yoga.</p>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>There are many different materials to choose from, and they all have their pros and cons, depending on the type of yoga you plan to practice.</p>
<p>“For those who don&#8217;t like to upgrade their mats every few years, a plain yoga mat made out of rubber is the best bet,” says Sarah. “Many brands are also coming up with manufacturing processes that reduce carbon emissions during creation, which can help make your practice more eco-friendly.”</p>
<p>Here are the most common materials you’ll find.</p>
<h4>PVC</h4>
<p>Pros: PVC is one of the most common materials used in yoga mats. (Those yoga mats for rent in your gym? Those are probably PVC mats.) Generally very durable, PVC usually features optimum cushioning for restorative poses and a nicely sticky surface. With lots of budget-friendly options to choose from, PVC mats can be a great choice for beginner yogis.</p>
<p>Cons: PVC can become slippery when wet, so we don’t recommend it for Bikram and hot yoga enthusiasts. Also known as polyvinyl chloride (basically, vinyl), PVC is man-made and not eco-friendly.</p>
<p>(A note about PVC: There is speculation that too much exposure to PVC can actually be bad for your health. Not only is it non-biodegradable, it actually releases dioxin — a chemical that causes cancer — into the air when incinerated. To make PVC pliable for use in products, it must be treated with phthalates, which have had <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/phthalates_factsheet.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative effects on reproduction</a> when tested on lab animals.)</p>
<h4>NBR</h4>
<p>Pros: Nitrile butadiene rubber (aka NBR) is a non-toxic, budget-friendly option that tends to be very padded and comfortable. Because it’s oil-resistant, it’s also easy to clean.</p>
<p>Cons: While the cushiness of NBR certainly feels nice, it does mean less stability for standing poses. NBR also tends to stretch during poses like warrior or down dog, affecting stability even more.</p>
<h4>TPE</h4>
<p>Pros: Though thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) is a manmade rubber, it’s actually biodegradable. Inherently antimicrobial, it’s easy to clean and also UV-resistant, making it great for outdoor use. It also offers good traction.</p>
<p>Cons: TPE is not as durable as PVC and does not feel as cushioned as PVC either.</p>
<h4>Natural rubber</h4>
<p>Pros: Like TPE, natural rubber is biodegradable, anti-microbial and very grippy.</p>
<p>Cons: If you’re allergic to latex, you’ll want to avoid natural-rubber yoga mats like the plague. Natural-rubber mats can also be heavy to carry, have a noticeable odor and tend to run in a higher price range.</p>
<h4>Polyurethane</h4>
<p>Pros: Very grippy and durable, polyurethane (PU) mats are a good option for yogis on a budget.</p>
<p>Cons: Unfortunately, PU yoga mats aren’t eco-friendly.</p>
<h4>Cork</h4>
<p>Pros: Cork is a great environmentally friendly “alternative” material that offers long-lasting durability and terrific grip that actually <i>increases</i> when wet, making it a good option for Bikram and hot-yoga practitioners.</p>
<p>Cons: If you’re looking for an eco-friendly mat made purely out of cork, watch out for those that have a rubber backing (many of them do). Cork itself can feel very dense and hard on the joints, and cork mats tend to run in a higher price range.</p>
<h4>Jute</h4>
<p>Pros: Jute is another natural, environmentally friendly “alternative” option. It has a rough texture that provides great traction either on its own or when placed over a regular yoga mat. Lightweight and anti-microbial, jute mats tend to be cheaper than other eco-friendly mat materials.</p>
<p>Cons: Jute can be a bit rough on the skin and takes some getting used to. It’s also quite thin and doesn’t provide much padding for the joints.</p>
<h4>Organic Cotton</h4>
<p>Pros: Last but not least, organic cotton mats are another eco-friendly alternative that can be used alone or on top of your regular yoga mat. Because they absorb sweat well and grow more “grippy” with moisture, cotton mats are great for hot yoga and Bikram. They’re also lightweight and easy to clean — simply throw yours in the washer after class.</p>
<p>Cons: Organic cotton mats provide barely any padding and can be slippery when dry.</p>
<h3>Size</h3>
<p>Yoga mats range in length from the standard 68 inches to the extra long 85 inches. As far as width goes, mats vary from a narrow 23 inches to a broad 36 inches. Body type and height are obviously factors when choosing the size of your mat; when lying flat on the mat, your entire body should fit on its surface. If you’re an advanced yogi or especially flexible, you may prefer to have extra room to move around on your mat as well. It’s also a good idea to consider how much space you have available to practice in, and then choose your mat accordingly.</p>
<h3>Convenience</h3>
<p>Convenience should also be a factor when choosing your yoga mat. Consider whether you need a mat that’s lightweight (for example, if you commute to your class via public transportation or are going to travel frequently with your mat in tow). Does the mat fit easily in your bag? Is it compact enough to store easily? Is it easy to keep clean or a hassle to disinfect after each session? “Those who practice mainly at home can invest in something thicker and larger,” says our yoga expert, Sarah, “but yogis on the go should look for a mat that&#8217;s lightweight and easy to travel with.”</p>
<h2 id="types-of-yoga">Types of yoga (and matching mats)</h2>
<h3>Hatha</h3>
<p>In the West, hatha yoga has generally come to mean a slow-paced, gentle form of yoga that’s perfect for beginners. Because it’s unlikely that you’ll work up a sweat, we recommend starting with a basic low-priced, non-slip mat, and then upgrading to a more specific type of mat once you get a feel for your needs or branch out into a particularly yoga specialty.</p>
<h3>Vinyasa</h3>
<p>Vinyasa is a form of yoga characterized by its flow of continuous, dance-like movement and focus on the breath as the yogi transitions smoothly from asana to asana. Vinyasa’s quick movements and continuous sequences require a dense, sticky mat on the thicker side with a non-skid bottom.</p>
<h3>Bikram and hot yoga</h3>

<p>Although both are practiced in 95°F to 105°F heat, Bikram and hot yoga are actually not the same type of yoga — while hot yoga is a broader term that refers to any form of yoga practiced in a heated room, Bikram is a set of 26 postures followed in an exact sequence with two specific types of breathing exercises. For both types, you’ll want to invest in a mat with lots of grip and stickiness in the midst of sweat and moisture, such as jute or cork (which actually increase their grip when wet), or use in a non-skid yoga towel placed over your regular mat. We recommend an <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-water-bottle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insulated water bottle</a> for icy rehydration during a hot set.</p>
<h3>Ashtanga</h3>
<p>Linked to vinyasa yoga, ashtanga is a disciplined and rigorous practice that follows a series of challenging poses with no breaks in between. Since ashtanga will have you dripping sweat right off the bat, we recommend either a cork mat or a dense, sticky mat with grippy undersides, along with a yoga towel for extra slip support.</p>
<h3>Iyengar</h3>
<p>Iyengar yoga is all about achieving improving posture and achieving perfect alignment, usually involving blocks, straps and other props to help facilitate the poses, which can be held for a full minute or even longer. Alignment mats with good grip and stickiness in the midst of sweat are ideal for this type of yoga.</p>
<h3>Yin and restorative</h3>
<p>Restorative yoga is focused on deep relaxation of the body and mind, while yin stimulates specific meridians in the body and improves circulation around the joints with poses that are held for up to 10 minutes at a time. Because both yin and restorative yoga are slow-moving, meditative practices that involve holding poses for long periods of time, yogis will need mats with plenty of cushioning for maximum comfort and relaxation.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>The mats in our lineup were put to the test over several weeks by seven yogis of varying body types and heights, ranging in skill from beginner to advanced and in age from early 20s to 40-plus. Our testers used the mats during regular one-hour hatha, vinyasa, restorative, Bikram and hot-yoga sessions. Following testing, we asked our yogis to rate the mats on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 being the best) using the following metrics.</p>
<h3>Traction</h3>
<ul>
<li>How “sticky” is the mat’s surface? How “grippy” is the mat’s surface?</li>
<li>How well does the mat maintain its stickiness and grippiness in the midst of sweat and moisture?</li>
<li>How effective is the mat’s non-skid bottom?</li>
<li>How well does the mat maintain its integrity during use (as opposed to stretching during poses)?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Thickness</h3>
<ul>
<li>How comfortable is it to perform seated poses on the mat?</li>
<li>How stable/balanced do we feel on the mat?</li>
<li>Does the material bounce back after use, or are you left with dents and divots?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li>How does the mat’s material feel against our skin?</li>
<li>Does the mat have an odor once out of the packaging? If so, does it fade at all with cleaning?</li>
<li>How easy is the mat to clean after use?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Size</h3>
<ul>
<li>How cramped or spacious does the mat feel?</li>
<li>How portable is the mat? Is it easy/hard to carry, roll up, store, etc.?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Design and color</h3>
<ul>
<li>How pleasing to the eye is the mat?</li>
<li>How well does the mat’s color match what was advertised?</li>
<li>How would we rate the variety of designs and/or prints available for this mat?</li>
<li>If the mat has alignment markings printed on it, how helpful did we find those markings to be?</li>
<li>Does the mat have lasting marks or sweat stains on it after each session?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Price</h3>
<ul>
<li>After using the mat, would we say the mat is well worth its price?</li>
</ul>

<p>The most budget-friendly yoga mat options are the rentable community mats at your gym or yoga studio. However, assuming you would prefer to forego an encounter with the bacteria and fungus left behind by other yogis and buy your own brand-new mat, we highly recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B078XJ1D5W/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HeathYoga &#8211; Eco Friendly Non Slip Yoga Mat</a> as our top pick for the best affordable yoga mat.</p>
<p>The HeathYoga mat is dual-layered, with a textured, non-slip top surface and a “tire tread” bottom for traction. Although we were skeptical at first that the “tire tread” was just for show, we were soon converted; the mat didn’t budge throughout our yoga sessions. As for the textured top, while it doesn’t offer much stickiness, it does provide excellent grip for the hands and feet (though the grip does decrease slightly when you start to sweat).</p>
<p>Our testers also reported that the mat’s diamond-pattern texture is an unexpectedly pleasurable tactile bonus — a “mini massage for your hands and feet,” according to one yogi. Made of environmentally friendly, anti-microbial TPE in a simple, tasteful design, the mat feels luxurious and expensive for its sub-$30 price tag.</p>

<p>The mat’s 6-millimeter thickness is springy enough to provide nice cushioning for the joints and balls of the hands and feet, without compromising balance and stability. Our hatha and restorative yoga testers reported excellent comfort levels for seated and resting positions. Because the mat’s bottom traction is so strong, it maintains its integrity during use and doesn’t stretch out, and any dents that appear on the top of the mat quickly disappear again minutes later.</p>
<p>At 72 inches by 26 inches — four inches longer and two inches wider than the average yoga mat — our taller yogis appreciated the HeathYoga mat’s larger surface area. Weighing in at 2.2 pounds, the mat is lightweight to carry, though slightly on the bulky side. It does come with a velcro strap and carrying strap, which helps with the load. The mat comes in five no-fuss color variations: turquoise, pink, purple, green and gray.</p>
<p>This mat receives bonus points for its alignment markings, which are meant to help yogis maintain proper alignment during their practice. Although our testers admitted that they didn’t always pay attention to these marks during their sessions, the lines did serve as helpful reminders of where to place their hands and feet, especially during vinyasa flows. Because the markings are stamped into the mat’s surface for a recessed effect, it is easy to achieve correct alignment without looking down too much; for example, if you’re in child’s pose or downward dog, you can feel around with your fingers to find the recessed line marking where your hands should be placed.</p>
<p>With its great traction, forgiving cushioning and low price point, the HeathYoga &#8211; Eco Friendly Non Slip Yoga Mat is the perfect eco-friendly starter mat for beginners. Its superior grippy, yet not <i>too</i> sticky surface also makes it an excellent option for vinyasa-flow practitioners, and hatha, yin and restorative yogis will appreciate its cushy thickness. We also recommend it for those who practice Iyengar yoga and put particular focus on alignment.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>With its winning combination of excellent bottom traction, surface grip and cushioning, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B078XJ1D5W/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HeathYoga &#8211; Eco Friendly Non Slip Yoga Mat</a> is our choice for best affordable mat for a variety of yoga practices, skill levels and body types, including yogis on the taller side.</li>
<li>The mat’s alignment system is a helpful guide for beginners and a reminder for  advanced yogis to maintain alignment.</li>
<li>The mat’s eco-friendly, anti-microbial TPE material with a closed-cell surface is a hygienic win, making for an easy-to-clean and fresher-smelling mat.</li>

<p>Travel yoga mats are usually designed to be extremely thin for maximum portability; however, this often comes at the cost of comfort and joint support. Unless you’re an advanced yogi, travel mats tend to be quite taxing on the joints and balls of the feet and hands, especially in supine, seated and kneeling positions. At 3 millimeters thick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001AOHUHQ/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jade &#8211; Travel Yoga Mat</a> offers about 1 millimeter more cushioning than most travel mats. Our testers gave it high marks for both balance and cushioning, noting that it is surprisingly comfortable for a travel mat.</p>
<p>Weighing in at just over 3 pounds, the Jade mat is admittedly on the heavier side for a travel mat. However, its outstanding performance with regard to our other criteria — comfort, traction, material, etc. — clearly outweighs the competition. This mat is streamlined enough for travel, but it’s not so thin that you’ll be suffering and wincing your way through downward dog and cat-cow. “It’s the perfect amount of barrier between the floor and my body,” says one of our testers. “It’s a great buy.”</p>
<p>Made of biodegradable natural rubber, the eco-friendly Jade Travel Yoga Mat features a subtle surface texture and open-cell construction, which gives it a nice grip and excellent stickiness, even in the presence of sweat. Although one tester noted that the mat could use a bit more traction on its bottom surface, the mat maintained its integrity throughout the yoga sessions with zero stretching.</p>

<p>The antimicrobial Jade mat had a slight rubbery odor at first, but the smell faded after the first cleaning. Because of its relatively smooth surface, the mat is easy to clean, with any smudging disappearing after a wipe-down. The mat’s simple, rather plain design comes in four colors: purple, green, blue and black.</p>
<p>This mat’s cushy comfort does have one negative trade-off: it is not as easily foldable as other travel mats often are. The mat may be rolled tightly or folded lengthwise, but due to its thickness, folding it into a square may lead to creasing. If you plan to pack this mat in a suitcase, we recommend checking to make sure your travel case is the same width or wider than the mat’s breadth.</p>
<p>Surprisingly comfortable for a travel mat, the Jade &#8211; Travel Yoga Mat will make you actually <i>want</i> to practice yoga while you’re on the road. With great surface and bottom traction, it’s an excellent choice for yogis on the go, or advanced practitioners who desire a thin, easily portable mat. (Note: Advanced yogis who don’t require cushioning and are looking for a super lightweight, extra-thin travel mat may want to check out the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KP49Z8S/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jade &#8211; Voyager Mat</a>, which is about 1.6 millimeters thick and weighs a measly 1.5 pounds.)</p>

<p>Seasoned hot yogis know that toting your equipment to a Bikram or hot yoga class can feel like a workout in itself; along with your water bottle and regular yoga mat, there’s the full-size towel to place over your mat to reduce slippage once you start sweating, as well as a smaller towel to wipe yourself down after class. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006ZBGY1C/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aurorae &#8211; Synergy 2 in 1 Yoga Mat</a> helps lighten the load with a unique double-sided design that features a full-length microfiber towel already built into its surface. Bonded to a PER (polymer environmental resin) base, the built-in towel eliminates the hassle of a separate towel bunching up on top of your mat. “I like both the convenience and aesthetics of having the microfiber attached,” says one tester. “It makes the mat super sleek.”</p>
<p>Although our natural rubber and PVC contenders provided good surface grip at the beginning of our hot yoga and Bikram classes, the Aurorae mat climbed quickly to the head of the pack once our testers started sweating. “The more you sweat, the better its stability and balance,” one tester says. “I tend to slip on rubber material. For someone who sweats a lot, this mat was perfect.” The Aurorae mat also provides excellent bottom traction, staying intact and refusing to budge or stretch even when things start to get sweaty.</p>
<p>The Aurorae &#8211; Synergy 2 in 1 mat is so responsive to moisture that its manufacturers recommend misting the top of the mat with water before you even begin to sweat for increased grip. Our testers agree, noting that the microfiber material provides less traction when dry, and is even a little slippery before you start to sweat. So while this mat is the perfect companion for a hot yoga or Bikram experience, it may not be the ideal choice for less sweaty types of yoga.</p>

<p>The 5-millimeter Aurorae mat gets high marks for comfort; it feels great against the skin and leaves zero dents or impressions on the microfiber side after classes. And with a 72-inch by 24-inch surface area, it feels nice and spacious during your practice as well.</p>
<p>Because hot yoga and Bikram environments are breeding grounds for bacteria, it’s vital to clean your mat after every session to keep things hygienic. Conveniently, the Aurorae &#8211; Synergy 2 in 1 mat can be thrown right into the washer after every class (it’s compatible with front-loading machines or top-loading washers without agitators) and then simply air-dried before your next sweat session. If you have a top-loading washer with an agitator, the manufacturer recommends washing the mat with a coarse sponge instead.</p>
<p>The Aurorae &#8211; Synergy 2 in 1 Yoga Mat is a dream for hot yoga and Bikram practitioners, eliminating the need for a separate yoga towel and delivering excellent surface traction when wet. It’s also a great option for arduous ashtanga classes and for yogis who tend to sweat easily. We highly recommend misting the top of the mat at the start of your class for optimum surface grip.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>With a built-in, full-length microfiber towel, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006ZBGY1C/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aurorae &#8211; Synergy 2 in 1 Yoga Mat</a> is unparalleled when it comes to traction under sweaty conditions.</li>
<li>Because the towel is bonded to the mat, you get excellent grip without having to worry about your towel bunching up during poses.</li>
<li>The mat can be put directly into the wash and air-dried after every class — essential for good hygiene in the face of sweaty, bacteria-heavy hot yoga sessions.</li>

<p>Our runner-up in the best affordable yoga mat category is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IAAIEIG/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Clever Yoga &#8211; Better Grip Yoga Mat</a> which, with its 6-millimeter thickness, gets high marks for both comfort and balance.</p>
<p>“The mat was cushioned, but still firm enough to feel stable in standing balance poses,” says our tester, who notes that it is especially good for yin, Iyengar or restorative yoga.</p>
<p>The Clever Yoga mat maintains its shape well and doesn’t stretch out during standing poses — qualities that can be hard to find in a thicker mat. Its bottom traction is also excellent with surface grippiness and stickiness ratings slightly higher than average.</p>
<p>Thought it was a close race between the Clever Yoga mat and our top pick for best affordable yoga mat, the HeathYoga mat ultimately won out for its handy alignment system and for having slightly better surface traction.</p>

<p>Also in the best affordable yoga mat category is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GQLH61H/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gaiam &#8211; Print Premium Yoga Mat</a>, which has a good overall design and fares well in our bottom and top surface traction ratings. “This is a solid mat,” says one tester.</p>
<p>The mat loses points for being a bit stiff and difficult to roll up. At 5 millimeters thick and 68 inches long, the mat is also thinner and shorter than its competitors in the category, though it does come in a variety of lively patterns.</p>
<h3>Manduka &#8211; Prolite Yoga and Pilates Mat</h3>

<p>Our runner-up in the best yoga mat for hot yoga category, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073ZJ3LR3/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Manduka &#8211; Prolite Yoga and Pilates Mat</a>, gets high marks from our testers for its overall comfort and the stability they felt while using the mat (though one yogi notes that it felt a little thin to her). The 4.7-millimeter mat provides good cushioning, with a pleasant surface texture that helps prevent slippage. It’s easy to clean and leaves no permanent smudges, and its 71-inch and 79-inch length options are great for tall yogis.</p>
<p>During hot yoga, however, the mat loses much of its surface grip once you begin to sweat; our hands began to slide forward during down dog. A towel would be required to use this mat for Bikram or hot yoga.</p>
<p>The Manduka Prolite is an excellent all-around yoga mat — but we don’t recommend it for Bikram or hot yoga.</p>
<h3>Jade &#8211; Harmony Mat</h3>

<p>Another contender in the best yoga mat for hot yoga category, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EC7KW0/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jade &#8211; Harmony Mat</a> is very similar in quality to the Manduka Prolite, providing excellent stability, balance and bottom traction. Made from eco-friendly natural rubber, the mat is easy to clean, leaving no stains or smudges behind. One tester notes how sturdy and high-quality the mat felt during her session.</p>
<p>Like the Manduka Prolite, the 4.7-millimeter Jade Harmony had great initial surface traction — until we began to sweat in our hot yoga sesh. In the face of moisture, the Jade mat loses much of its surface grippiness and stickiness, causing our hands to slip forward during down dog.</p>
<p>Just like the Manduka Prolite, we recommend the Jade Harmony for regular, non-sweaty yoga practices.</p>

<p>As much as we wanted to like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NR62BI/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Manduka &#8211; eKo Superlight Travel Yoga Mat</a>, it had several downsides that left us disappointed and a little sore. The 1.5-millimeter mat barely provided enough cushion to differentiate it from the floor underneath; we were counting down the seconds until we could shift our weight off of our knees, hands and sit bones and into the next pose. Even for a travel mat, it was quite uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The mat’s surface grippiness was okay, with its stickiness faring a bit better. However, once our hands became slightly sweaty, we started slipping forward like crazy in downward dog. The combination of discomfort and a slippery surface made for an overall unpleasant yoga experience.</p>
<p>The mat does offer excellent bottom traction and doesn’t stretch at all during poses. It also folds up easily for portability, and its minimal surface texture makes it easy to clean.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Your choice of yoga mat is determined by a range of factors — the type of yoga you do, the environment you practice in, your skill level, body type, past injuries, etc. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B078XJ1D5W/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HeathYoga &#8211; Eco Friendly Non Slip Yoga Mat</a> is an excellent affordable option for any yogi to start with, featuring a handy alignment system, excellent traction, 6 millimeters of cushy thickness and a luxurious feel that defies its price point.</p>
<p>For those looking to take their yoga mat on the road, we recommend the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001AOHUHQ/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Jade &#8211; Travel Yoga Mat</a> for its combination of portability and comfort. Made of eco-friendly natural rubber, the mat offers impressive stickiness and grip that endure through sweat and moisture.</p>
<p>The unique, double-sided <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006ZBGY1C/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aurorae &#8211; Synergy 2 in 1 Yoga Mat</a> is our pick for hot yogis. The mat’s built-in microfiber towel provides unbeatable surface traction when wet with its truly non-skid base. Bikram and hot yogis will love that it’s machine-washable — a major plus for keeping sweaty mats bacteria and fungus-free.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We spent 27+ hours researching and testing standard &#038; smart bathroom scales to name the Weight Gurus scale as the best smart bathroom scale and one by Etekcity for standard scales.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent over 27 hours researching both standard and smart scales. After conducting over 250 weighs-ins, we determined that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N9ENKDI/?tag=ybdscl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Weight Gurus &#8211; 0375</a> is the best bathroom scale due to its wide-ranging abilities, accuracy and reliability. The Weight Gurus smart scale also provides you with a consistent body fat percentage that is tracked automatically with their phone app and is compatible with other apps like FitBit, Apple Health and Google Fit. For a standard scale, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Etekcity-Digital-Weight-Measure-Tempered/dp/B01HI1W1V4/?tag=ybdscl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Etekcity &#8211; EB4074C</a> delivers accuracy and consistency, a great option if you don’t need app connectivity.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>We scoured through review sites like ConsumerReports.org and The Wirecutter to get an idea of some of the best digital scales out there. We then dove into forums on Reddit and read through customer reviews of bathroom scales on Amazon. With about ten hours under our belt, we felt confident that we’d developed a solid base of what to look for and how to narrow down our search.</p>
<p>We looked at both the singular function digital scales (non-smart scales) and the multi-functional digital smart scales, which provide information on body fat, muscle mass and more. In our search of the most precise and consistent product, we compared the best ones on the market to one another, using others’ reviews and our knowledge base, ultimately ending up with nine finalists, three of which are smart.</p>

<p><strong>Large backlight display:</strong> Regardless of how precise a bathroom scale is, it’s useless if you can’t read the numbers on the display. Thankfully, all of the scales we tested had great backlit displays with easy to see numbers.<br />

<p><strong>Design:</strong> While design shouldn’t be the primary determinant you use when shopping, you’re more likely to use it if it looks and feels good. You should consider attributes like the feet of the scale, dimensions and weight.</p>
<p><strong>Weight tracking (smart scales only):</strong> This feature is incredible to have as it takes away all the tedious work that would otherwise be required to see the changes in your weight over time. This way you can easily see trends with the graphs and all the other visuals the phone apps provide for you. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N9ENKDI/?tag=ybdscl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Weight Gurus &#8211; 0375</a> can even integrate with programs like FitBit and Google Fit.</p>
<p><strong>Batteries:</strong> Most of us are familiar with alkaline AAAs, but some scales use the lithium CR2032, which are flat and disc-like. <a href="http://data.energizer.com/pdfs/energizer-licoincr2032vsaaaasellsheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a> are some graphs from Energizer that display the performance difference. AAAs seem to work better and more safely in the long run.</p>

<strong>Standard scale:</strong> Your everyday (old-school) non-smart digital bathroom scale can measure only one thing a: weight. Usually you can switch between pounds, kilograms or stones.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why we didn’t choose to include any spring-loaded mechanical scales. The answer is simple: mechanical ones that perform well cost about as much as a smart alternative but only give you the function of a standard scale.</p>
<p><strong>Smart scale:</strong> These measure weight, but come loaded with an abundance of other features too. These can include body fat, BMI, muscle percentage, water %, bone mass, BMR and protein %.</p>

<p>We did a lot of weighing (over 250 times in total). We weighed humans and weights. Before we get started, however, let’s briefly differentiate between ‘consistency’ and ‘accuracy’. A scale will be dubbed as consistent if it produces the same result again and again. An accurate scale is one whose readings are very close to the actual weight.</p>
<p>To get a feel for the bathroom scales, we weighed a subject who wasn’t holding anything. Then we weighed them holding dumbbell A (25.8 pounds), holding dumbbell B (24.2 lb) and both dumbbells A and B together (49.6 lb). And yes, the dumbbells are from the same manufacturer and are both supposed to be 25 lb. Evidently they weren’t, so we used professionally weighted dumbbells.</p>

<p>We went to our (newly-made) friends over at <a href="http://www.iccinstrument.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICC Instrument Company</a> to use the weights they use to calibrate industrial scales. These weights were 50.0 lb each, which made it at least a bit easier to spread out the weigh-ins into groups of 100.0 lb, 150.0 pounds and 200.0 pounds. We made sure the ground was perfectly level all around and then placed each of the weights on three times. When we did this, we found one scale to be perfectly accurate: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Etekcity-Digital-Weight-Measure-Tempered/dp/B01HI1W1V4/?tag=ybdscl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Etekcity &#8211; EB4074C</a>.</p>
<p>Then, to compare consistency even further we weighed one subject ten times on each of the scales. We used the Etekcity as our baseline for comparing the reading accuracy of the other bathroom scales as it was deemed perfectly accurate and consistent from the previous test. After gathering the data we gave the appropriate rankings to each scale for the below categories, then we averaged the scores and combined them to get overall rankings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Accuracy of body weight readings</li>
<li>Consistency of body weight readings</li>
<li>Accuracy of standard weight (100.0 to 200.0 lb)</li>
<li>Consistency of standard weight (100.0 to 200.0 lb)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Consistency &amp; accuracy of body fat readings</h3>
<p>A quick note on body fat before we look at how we tested it: body fat percentage (BFP) is the total mass divided by the total body mass. The way the smart scales measure this is with Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA). The smart scale shoots an electric current through your body and uses the resistance between the conductors to create a measurement.</p>
<p>In order to measure the BIA we first needed a standard measurement of BFP. There are a couple of accurate ways to measure body fat like skinfold caliper reading (instrumental body fat pinching) or hydrostatic weighing (underwater). We chose to go with the skinfold caliper testing because it has the best ratio of accuracy to repeatability, so this was our standard to which we compared the results of the BIA.</p>
<p>We took two subjects of similar weight, but with noticeably different fat content and had them undergo three trials of skinfold caliper testing and three BIA evaluations with each smart scale. We conducted these tests within seconds of one another to avoid discrepancies in the amount of body fat throughout the day.</p>

<h3>Ease of use</h3>
<p><strong>Standard and smart scales</strong></p>
<p>Because there is not too much to non-smart bathroom scales, their ratings were based on only a few things. Nowadays none of the top scales require you to tap before they turn on. All of the products we tested had the “step-on” technology, which means you can just step on without having to turn it on beforehand.</p>
<p>Another area we evaluated was the clarity of the display. There was not too much difference between the products here because they all have backlights and have reasonably similar display sizes. Nonetheless, we measured out the dimensions of the display and scale and compared the total surface areas — the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/iDOO-Precision-Bathroom-Oversize-Platform/dp/B01ASLPVY0/?tag=ybdscl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iDOO Jumbo &#8211; ES09-3089M</a> was the only real big difference with about a 30% bigger surface area.</p>
<p>The other areas we looked at here were batteries, grip-to-floor bottom (or non-slip) and transportation. We ranked them each on how easy it was to change the batteries and what type they used. We also thought about anyone who likes to keep their bathrooms scales hidden away when not in use and rated the process of moving each bathroom scale from one area to another.</p>
<p><strong>Smart scales only</strong></p>
<p>We broke these down into two categories for ease of use. First, we considered how easy it was to track your weigh-ins, the two smart scales that had a phone app were easier (Weight Gurus &#8211; 0375 and Yunmai Premium). Secondly, if applicable, we compared the overall user-friendliness of the phone app by adding new users to the account, tracking body weight, accessing and reading graphs, and connecting to existing apps like Apple Health and FitBit.</p>
<p>And we evaluated the reliability of the body fat measurement on these scales (because after reading all the other reviews and comments this was the most desired datum from smart scale users). This was determined by the accuracy and precision of the measurements.</p>
<h2 id="best-smart">The best smart scale: Weight Gurus &#8211; 0375</h2>

<p>The best product will provide multiple pieces of data, the ability to connect with other apps, and is precise in its readings. It really came down to the Yunmai Premium and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N9ENKDI/?tag=ybdscl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Weight Gurus &#8211; 0375</a>. They both had exceptional apps that made it easy to track your progress and body composition and were both incredibly consistent in their weight measurements. However after looking at the accuracy of the weight and fat-percentage readings, the this one stole the show.<br />

<p>Although reading fat using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis is not as accurate as some of the more professional methods, this bathroom scale was amazingly consistent in its fat percentage measurements. Not only did it give the same reading for the same subjects time and time again, but it also detected an average of 3.3% to 4.2% lower percentages when using different subjects with different fat contents. This means it is a consistent tracker of body fat percentage. You want to lose weight, yes, but more importantly, you want to lose fat. The Weight Gurus &#8211; 0375 lets you know when that is happening.</p>
<p>The Weight Gurus digital bathroom scale performed beautifully. When we used the standard 50.0 pound weights to test, and it was only off by one pound after nine weigh-ins. So in weighing 2,988 pounds it was only off by 0.17%. That’s pretty much perfect, and far exceeds the needs of most people using it to track weight.</p>

<p>Now let’s step off the scale and move onto the app. The integration couldn’t have been easier, plus you can connect your data with FitBit, Google Fit, Apple’s Health app, Under Armour and more. If you’re sharing the scale with friends or family, they don’t get access to your results so privacy is yours to keep.</p>
<p>One of our favorite features (of both smart scales that had apps): you don’t need your phone nearby! You can see your weight, BMI, body fat, water and muscle percentages on the display and it will store the data until your Bluetooth is connected, then sync automatically.</p>
<p>Cool side note: If you skip a day (or only do so once a week), the app will automatically input phantom weight figures to show your estimated weights from the last time you weighed yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Weight Gurus &#8211; 0375 allows you to use its app alongside others like FitBit and Google Fit.</li>
<li>It performed near-perfectly on both the accuracy testing and consistency testing only missing by 0.17% out of 2,988 lb.</li>
<li>Even though BIA is not the most accurate way to measure body fat content, the Weight Guru Scale was lower by 3.3-4.2% than actual, but very reliable with its readings.</li>

It’s a bit unfortunate for the smart <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C6E2YSI/?tag=ybdscl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Yunmai &#8211; Premium Smart Scale</a> that it had to be compared to the Weight Gurus, because if this was the only scale you looked at, it would seem perfect. It syncs with other apps, you don’t need your phone present (it will sync once connected) and it’s accurate and consistent. However, it cannot sync with as many apps (only Apple Health, FitBit and Google Fit), and it is not as accurate in body weight or as consistent in body fat as the Weight Gurus (it measured both higher and lower than the actual).</p>

<p>However, this one was the only bathroom scale in our lineup that was precise to the tenth of a degree (0.1 lb). All of the others were precise to 0.2 lb increments. And it was perfectly consistent!</p>
<p>This is impressive, considering only half of the bathroom scales scored perfectly on this test. Furthermore, its 4.5 star rating for accuracy of weight was because it was off by only 6.4 lbout of 2,988 (0.21%). That is nearly imperceptible when using it to track your body weight. So for practical purposes, this one will fit almost all of your needs.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This Yunmai Premium Smart Scale was perfectly consistent and has a great phone app, allowing you to easily connect with FitBit or Apple Health.</li>
<li>Offers 10 body composition measurements</li>
<li>It is the only precision digital bathroom scale that measured to 0.1 lb as opposed to the common 0.2.</li>
<li>Although its body fat readings were above and below the actual, they were quite precise: 2.6% below and 1.7% above.</li>

<p>This one has one of the smaller backlit LCD displays out there at only 3.1 inches, but the bright blue background stays lit for eight seconds, allowing you to take a closer look if needed.</p>
<p>Like all of the scales we tested, you can just step right on to measure your weigh. It has an auto-zero function and has an automatic overload indication (and if that goes off you may want to look at the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/iDOO-Precision-Bathroom-Oversize-Platform/dp/B01ASLPVY0/?tag=ybdscl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iDOO Jumbo &#8211; ES09-3089M</a> that handles up to 440 lb).</p>
<p>As one of the only clear scales we looked at, you won’t have to worry about putting this one away between uses because it goes with almost any design. And there are two metal bars on the bottom which allow you to hold onto it and dry it off easily if need be. Also, the unit-button on the bottom is clear and easy to push, making it easy to switch from lb to kg.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For a non-smart bathroom scale, the glass Etekcity &#8211; EB4074C performs very well under pressure.</li>
<li>This precision digital scale uses four sensors and quad stability pad suspension that allows for accurate and safe weigh-ins.</li>
<li>It has a smaller backlit lcd display, but the number will flash three times and stay put for eight seconds with a bright blue background.</li>

For a standard, non-smart scale, It consistently delivers accurate results, plus its ultra-thin design allow you to easily store it out of the way.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vive-Precision-Digital-Bathroom-Scale/dp/B00SNLZ2PQ/?tag=ybdscl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>As one of the most slim models analyzed, this six millimeter-thick glass comes in a light silvery gray and a fresh black, both of which have a modern textured look. It is a great little scale and was one of the easiest to move back under the sink in between weigh-ins. It was sturdy and light with a firm capacity to stay put on slippery tile.</p>
<p>This digital scale only uses two CR2032 batteries (most others require four), but it seems to be at an expense: it can only support up to 330 lb. Another possible downside to this scale was a display under three inches, though its backlight is easy to see for most of us.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Vive &#8211; DMD1002SLV receives an A+ for being accurate and consistent (99.96% correct).</li>
<li>It is one of the slimmest bathroom scales we tested but can only support up to 330 lb.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s easy to move to and from a cupboard, though it has a very modern design in two colors.</li>

<h3>INEVIFIT &#8211; Smart Scale</h3>
<p>We’re not quite sure what caused it, but the digital <a href="https://www.amazon.com/INEVIFIT-BODY-ANALYZER-Accurate-Bathroom-Composition/dp/B01N0MI131/?tag=ybdscl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">INEVIFIT Smart Scale</a> had a bit of a hiccup during the standardized weight testing. If you check out the graphs you can see it was off by quite a bit for the 100 and 150 pound tests. Other than, that this glass bathroom scale was a top performer. This was the only smart scale that didn’t have a phone app to go along with it so tracking won’t necessarily be as easy as the others but it did have body composition features. Then again, if you use these often and have a decent memory this should do just fine.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/INEVIFIT-BODY-ANALYZER-Accurate-Bathroom-Composition/dp/B01N0MI131/?tag=ybdscl-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/inevifitI-smart-scale-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/inevifitI-smart-scale-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/inevifitI-smart-scale-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/inevifitI-smart-scale-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/inevifitI-smart-scale-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/inevifitI-smart-scale-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/inevifitI-smart-scale-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/inevifitI-smart-scale-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/inevifitI-smart-scale.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Also Great: INEVIFIT Smart Scale</h3><p>As a newer company and less expensive option, the INEVIFIT can carry up to ten users in the scale’s memory and uses its built-in detection technology so you don’t have to choose which user you are before stepping on.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/INEVIFIT-BODY-ANALYZER-Accurate-Bathroom-Composition/dp/B01N0MI131/?tag=ybdscl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Something to keep in mind, however, is that even though the fat readings were significantly low this was actually the most consistent smart scale for that test. So if an app and the exact numbers don’t matter too much to you then this is a good choice. You can store ten users and it is able to detect the different user so you don’t have to choose yourself each time.</p>
<h3>Kinzi &#8211; DBS-1000</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kinzi-Precision-Bathroom-Capacity-Technology/dp/B010FG0KD0/?tag=ybdscl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Kinzi &#8211; DBS-1000</a> has a sleek glass design, is affordable and is one of the most accurate and consistent scales. When we tested, it was only off by 3.8 total lb of the near 3,000. The Kinzi runs on only two CR2032 batteries and weighs up to the standard 400 lb. Another thing to note is its display: 3.3 inches (one of the biggest of the scales we found).</p>
<p>Unfortunately the black backlight makes it a bit more difficult to read than the normal blue. Thankfully, however, the reading stays on the backlit display for about 11 seconds, giving you more time than you’d need to read it from a closer position. Another not-so-hot aspect is the “non-slip” bottom legs. They were average at best and it was only one of a few that didn’t have great non-slip technology.</p>
<h3>EatSmart &#8211; ESBS-01</h3>
<p>Another standard digital bathroom scale coming in with the precision and consistency we like to see is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/EatSmart-Precision-Digital-Bathroom-Lighted/dp/B001KXZ808/?tag=ybdscl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EatSmart &#8211; ESBS-01</a>. It was only off by 0.2 lb on the 100 pounds weight test and 0.6 on the body weight test.</p>
<p>The EatSmart Scale was one of the most inexpensive bathroom scales (under $20) and had one of the biggest lcd screens that held the number for over nine seconds on a blue backlit screen. It measured weight quickly too. Also, as a pleasant surprise, it came with a free body tape measure, which was made it easy to self-measure due to its construction.</p>

It has about a 30% larger surface area than a standard scale, weighs up to 440 pounds and has the ‘stickiest’ non-slip pads for stability.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/iDOO-Precision-Bathroom-Oversize-Platform/dp/B01ASLPVY0/?tag=ybdscl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The last and biggest is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/iDOO-Precision-Bathroom-Oversize-Platform/dp/B01ASLPVY0/?tag=ybdscl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iDOO Jumbo &#8211; ES09-3089M</a>. It measures up to 440 pounds. This scale also has the biggest base, with about 35% more surface area when compared to other scales. The bottom also has very sticky non-slip pads.</p>
<p>The iDOO has a marble-like surface that, at least artistically, puts the others to shame. If you have bigger feet or just like feeling extra safe, we’d suggest this product. There was a certain comfort experienced when stepping on this extra-sized machine.</p>
<h3>Greater Goods &#8211; 0390</h3>
<p>This was a very cleanly designed standard bathroom scale. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Balance-Accuracy-Bathroom-Backlit-Warranty/dp/B01929N69G/?tag=ybdscl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greater Goods &#8211; 0390</a> was consistent and accurate (off by seven pounds of 3,000). It has a 3.3-inch “big lcd screen” display with a nice blue backlight. But your weight will only stay for five seconds after you get off (if you remain standing on the scale it will keep your weight lit up).</p>
<p>It’s another not-too-expensive option for your bathroom under $20. But that may come at an expense: the non-slip pads at the bottom don’t live up to their name. Also, it uses CR2032 batteries, which is not the biggest deal but it is little things like that that could leave you to want other scales.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>For all of you exercisers, weight-losers and health-trackers, the bathroom scale is an integral part of your life. The most informative and functional smart scale on the market is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N9ENKDI/?tag=ybdscl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Weight Gurus &#8211; 0375</a> as it integrates with almost any other health app or Smartwatch program and was 99.83% accurate on just under 3,000 pounds. Also, the body fat readings were consistently low which means it can definitely be used to track your body fat.</p>
<p>There were, of course, others that performed well like the smart <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C6E2YSI/?tag=ybdscl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Yunmai Premium Smart Scale</a> and standard <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Etekcity-Digital-Weight-Measure-Tempered/dp/B01HI1W1V4/?tag=ybdscl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Etekcity Glass &#8211; EB4074C</a>. The former is a phenomenal smart scale that is precise to the tenth of a pound, and the latter was what you’d expect when buying a scale: perfectly accurate and consistent.<br />
