				<description><![CDATA[We tested eight of the best lightweight vacuums and chose the Shark - Rocket HV302 as the best corded vacuum for everyday and heavy-duty cleaning. We also picked the Eureka - NEC22 as the best cordless lightweight vacuum.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent 20 hours on research and six weeks testing each of the vacuums in a home environment. We chose the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EUKHACW/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Rocket HV302</a> as our pick for the best lightweight vacuum. Weighing just 8 pounds (the average vacuum weighs 14 to 17 pounds), it is one of the more powerful vacuums we tested. The Shark possesses agility and suction strong enough to make it feel as though it were self-propelled. If you want a cordless model, we found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MNJ7ZR1/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; NEC222</a> to be the best option. It pulls up an impressive amount of debris and has swivel steering that makes it easy to navigate around furniture.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Since a vacuum weighing more than 15 pounds can cause arm fatigue when pushed around large spaces or carried up stairs, we limited our scope to vacuums weighing 15 pounds and under. Corded vacuums tends to be more powerful, while cordless ones are more convenient. Keeping this in mind, we searched for the best options in each category.</p>
<p>We’ve tested multiple types of vacuums here at Your Best Digs, as we searched for everything from the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">best upright vacuum</a> to the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum/">best handheld vacuum</a>. These previous experiences have given us a good sense of overall features to consider when also factoring in a lightweight aspect.</p>
<p>For instance, we considered the fact that swivel steering can greatly impact the amount of work it takes to move a vacuum around. If you’re choosing a lightweight vacuum because you want to ease the strain of pushing a heavy vacuum around, this is an important feature to note.</p>
<p>We looked at reputable sources such as Consumer Reports and Wirecutter to gather information about the top lightweight vacuums on the market. Once we narrowed down a list of finalists that had the features we deemed most important, we culled the list further based on Amazon reviews and reports from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/LaundryLoveandScience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laundry Love &amp; Cleaning Science</a> Facebook group.</p>

<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lightweight:</strong> Vacuums over 15 pounds become tough to move around, an important consideration if you need to cover more square footage or carry it upstairs. The vacuums we tested weighed 3 to 8 pounds.</li>
<li><strong>Swivel steering:</strong> Maneuverability is key if you’re choosing a vacuum based on its ease of use. Even a lightweight vacuum can cause arm fatigue without swivel steering, since you need to make double the effort to guide it around the room.</li>
<li><strong>Corded vs. cordless:</strong> Corded vacuums are typically more powerful than cordless vacuums, although some newer cordless models are nearly as powerful as a corded vacuum.</li>
<li><strong>Battery life/run time:</strong> If you do choose a cordless model, consider how long the battery takes to charge and how long you can run the vacuum before the battery dies.</li>
<li><strong>Sealed HEPA filter:</strong> If you have allergies or asthma, you’ll want to make sure your vacuum traps dust mites, pet dander and pollen in a tightly sealed system. A vacuum with a sealed HEPA filter must meet the rigorous <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/ttncatc1/dir1/ff-hepa.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. HEPA</a> (High Efficiency Particulate Air) standards of removing 99.97 percent of all particles 0.3 microns or larger.</li>
<li><strong>Low profile:</strong> A vacuum that lies flat is able to fit under furniture, which means you can clean without moving heavy objects around the room.</li>
<li><strong>Easy emptying:</strong> Whether using a bagged or bagless model, you should be able to empty the vacuum without dirt escaping.</li>
<li><strong>Brush roll:</strong> A spinning beater brush agitates debris in the carpet for a deeper clean, but on hard floors, it can scratch the surface and fling debris away. A better option for hard flooring is a vacuum that allows you to turn off the beater brush or, better yet, has a soft roller head.</li>
<li><strong>Converts into handheld vacuum:</strong> A model that converts into a handheld vacuum gives you the most bang for your buck and allows you to use it on multiple cleaning tasks. It’s convenient to have a vacuum that can clean your floors as well as your car. If you’re primarily looking to use your vacuum as a handheld, our article on the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum">best handheld vacuum</a> can guide you in the right direction.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple attachments:</strong> Attachments such as a soft roller head for hard floors, a crevice tool and a dusting tool allow you to tackle multiple cleaning jobs with one vacuum.</li>
<li><strong>Adjustable-height cleaning head:</strong> Automatic height adjustment allows you to switch from carpet to hard flooring, although you may want to turn your brush roll off or switch to a soft roller head.</li>

[table id=296 /]
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>We tested in a household with three children and three fur babies — two dogs and a domestic shorthair cat — and the carpet was embedded with pet hair. We added sand, baking soda (to mimic fine dust) and cereal (large debris) to the mix. Starting with empty collection containers, we passed each vacuum over the area for 30 seconds. Then we weighed the output in grams to test how much each vacuum collected.</p>
<p>Pet hair is naturally lighter than sand or cereal, so while we measured the contents of each collection container, we visually inspected the carpet to see if there was any debris remaining. The type of debris collected gave us insight into which vacuums picked up more fine debris and which gathered the most pet hair.</p>
<p>Finally, we performed the same test again on hard flooring. We paid attention to whether or not the vacuums snowplowed (pushed forward rather than sucked up) the large debris.</p>
<p>The Oreck, Dyson and Eureka were able to capture the most pet hair, sand and baking soda at the same time without the brush roll or filter becoming clogged. The Shark picked up a large amount of pet hair from the carpet, but the hair wound itself around the filter and created a pressure that caused it to “backfire,” sending larger pieces of debris back onto the carpet.</p>
<p>The Hoover does a good job of picking up surface pet hair and cereal, but it doesn’t do much to pull up ground-in dirt and debris from the carpet. It pulls in cereal without snowplowing it across the floor, even better than some of our more expensive finalists. For example, the Tineco isn’t able to retain larger pieces of debris, leaving them on the floor after you move the vacuum.</p>
<h3>Emissions</h3>
<p>The best vacuums are able to keep the dirt contained in their collection bag or cylinder, so the dust and debris isn’t spewed back out into the air. This is especially important if you have allergies. To test filter performance, we measured dust kickback with a Dylos air quality monitor.</p>
<p>The laser counter measures air quality in terms of both large particles (PM10) and small particles (PM2.5). Particle pollution can be especially harmful to those with asthma, older adults and babies and children. Smaller particles are more troublesome because they can get into the deep parts of your lungs.</p>
<p>We took a reading before vacuuming, then measured the air quality again after vacuuming a single room for 10 minutes. Some vacuums, such as the Oreck and the Bissell, caused the numbers to jump dramatically. The Shark and the Dyson actually improved the quality of the air, reducing both large and small airborne particles. The Eureka and Deik were relatively neutral, neither spewing dust nor filtering it out of the air.</p>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<p>Over the course of six weeks, we used these vacuums to vacuum as any consumer would. We vacuumed in multiple rooms on both hard flooring and carpet for approximately 30 minutes at a time.</p>
<p>Since we wanted to find the best lightweight vacuum, key considerations here were arm fatigue and maneuverability. We rated each vacuum on a scale of one to five (five being best) for ease of use, giving the highest ratings to vacuums that didn’t cause arm fatigue.</p>
<p>We maneuvered each vacuum around the room and judged how easy it was to operate. Then we tested its profile by lying it flat and vacuuming under a couch and living-room chairs. We noted features such as button placement and ability to determine what the settings meant without consulting the manual. Finally, we considered how easy it was to change the filter or empty the waste container.</p>
<p>Our five-star finalists for maneuverability were the Shark, Eureka, Tineco and Deik. Despite being only 8.2 pounds, the Oreck was incredibly difficult to push around the room. The stronger the suction, the more difficult it was to push &#8212; with the exception of the Shark, which feels as if it is propelling forward without effort. Finalists like the Dyson and Tineco were easy to operate, but we encountered resistance on their Max settings and vacuuming became more labor-intensive.</p>
<h3>Noise output</h3>
<p>For this test, we measured the sound output in decibels of each vacuum using a sound pressure level meter. The ambient noise level of the room measured at 59.3 decibels, with a fan running and someone cooking in the other room. We held the meter at ear level while running each vacuum to gauge the noise exposure while actually using the vacuum.</p>
<p>The average noise level of our finalists was 79 dBA, when the vacuums were used at their highest setting. Comparatively, it’s the <a href="https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/noisehearingconservation/loud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sound of a freight train</a> from 100 feet away. Our loudest vacuum, the Oreck, was closer to the sound levels of a boiler room at 88.6 dBA. The Eureka was the quietest vacuum, measuring 71.3 dBA, or a little louder than classroom chatter. The Shark had a wide range of noise levels, from 83.5 dBA on its max setting to just below the average noise level at 77.2 dBA on its lowest setting.</p>

<p>In our tests, we found the vacuums with better suction tended to be harder to move around the floor. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EUKHACW/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Rocket HV302</a> is the exception; the power and the motorized brush roll work together to make it feel as though it is self-propelled. Swivel steering adds even greater agility, making the Shark easy to navigate around furniture. The combination of power and maneuverability made the Shark our top choice for a lightweight vacuum.</p>
<p>The Shark doesn’t snowplow large debris and is excellent at pulling up dirt and debris from along wall edges. The filter is simple to reach and remove using a flip-top lid and the waste canister is easy to empty. It has a 30-foot cord, so it’s easy to reach across the room and even down the hallway, depending on the size of your rooms.</p>
<p>Although it doesn’t have a HEPA filter, the Shark performed on par with the Dyson in terms of emissions (and the Dyson is priced three times higher). It lowered both the large particle count and small particle count in the room after vacuuming. It pulled up sand and fine debris in large amounts, impressing us with how clean the floor looked after vacuuming with the Shark.</p>

It glides smoothly across carpet and easily navigates around furniture and against wall edges.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EUKHACW/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The motorized brush roll helps to agitate dirt from carpets, while the included Hard Floor Hero head serves to pick up surface litter and stuck-on food or dirt. So you have the option to adjust the height with a switch and keep vacuuming across different floor types or change out the vacuum head.</p>
<p>This model converts into a hand vacuum with a dusting brush, upholstery brush and crevice tool. It also comes with a car-detail kit with micro tools for detailing your automobile.</p>
<h3>Things we didn’t like</h3>
<p>As powerful as the Shark is, it didn’t fare well in our pet hair test. For a better option, see our review on <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">vacuums for pet hair</a>. In fact, the power may have been part of the problem. It sucked up so much pet hair at one time that within 30 seconds the filter was too clogged to retain any more debris.</p>
<p>The other downside is that it is one of the heavier finalists we tested. Although it only weighs eight pounds, the majority of the weight is in the handheld portion of the vacuum. It may not be the best choice for you if your wrist is easily strained. Because it is so top heavy, it also doesn’t stand up on its own.</p>
<p>However, you can mount it on the included wall bracket for storage. You can also detach the hand vac from the floor mount and place it on the hook above the floor nozzle for easy storage.</p>
<p>These considerations aside, the Shark has enough pros that we feel comfortable recommending it as our top choice for a corded lightweight vacuum.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Shark &#8211; Rocket HV302 is easy to use and maneuver, as the combination of strong suction and a motorized brush head reduces the force needed to push the vacuum.</li>
<li>Swivel steering makes vacuuming around furniture effortless, and a low profile allows you to reach under couches easily.</li>
<li>Our air was cleaner after vacuuming with the Shark, as its tightly sealed system and effective filter trapped fine and larger dust particles while running.</li>
<li>This model may not be the best choice for <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">pet owners</a>, as pet hair tends to clog in the filter and reduce efficacy.</li>

<p>Priced lower than average, especially for a cordless model, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MNJ7ZR1/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; NEC222</a> is well worth the investment of a high-end vacuum. It is quiet but powerful and swivel steering makes it a breeze to move around the room. The low profile makes it a snap to clean underneath furniture, while its agility makes it easy to get around large pieces.</p>
<p>The Eureka aced our performance test, picking up as many grams of dirt as the Dyson and pulling up embedded pet hair without clogging. While it didn’t clean the air in our emissions test, it also retained any large or fine debris it pulled up from the carpet so you don’t have to worry about dust kickback.</p>
<p>It has the brightest front headlights, making it easy to see in low lighting. The waste canister empties at the touch of a button; there’s also a second option to twist off the collection cup.</p>

Paired with a quiet but powerful motor, this model handily won our pick for best lightweight cordless.</p><a href="" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The things we liked most about this vacuum were its performance on both pet hair and fine dust and its quiet motor. The Eureka is only 6.5 pounds, so despite the motor being located at the handle, it didn’t put any pressure on our wrist.</p>
<p>The vacuum converts into a hand vac and comes with a crevice tool and a two-in-one upholstery tool. It has a solid 30 minutes of run time and charges in four hours.</p>
<h3>Things we didn’t like</h3>
<p>Our main concern with the Eureka is that the controls aren’t easily decipherable, so it’s hard to determine which symbol means carpet and which means hard floors (without consulting the manual, and let’s face it, we all know those end up in a junk drawer and are rarely consulted).</p>
<p>A secondary issue is that the brush head tends to lift off the ground, so it doesn’t always make full contact with the floor. This could mean it doesn’t pick up as much as it should or that you have to make multiple passes over the same area, unless you are actively ensuring that it fully engages with the carpet or hard flooring.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Eureka &#8211; NEC222 is reasonably priced for a lightweight cordless vacuum and well worth the expense.</li>
<li>If you want a lightweight cordless vacuum that rivals the Dyson in terms of performance and doesn’t kick back any dust, the Eureka is an excellent choice.</li>
<li>At 6.5 pounds, it’s so lightweight that the brush head tends to lift off the carpet, but it doesn’t cause any arm fatigue after a long period of vacuuming.</li>
<li>Despite being a powerful vacuum, the Eureka is one of the quietest models we tested.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003ZYPZ0I/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hoover &#8211; SH20030</a> wasn’t the absolute lowest-priced model we tested. However, of our eight finalists, it’s the best performing vacuum on the lower end of the price spectrum. It easily picked up pet hair and cereal in our performance test, and we especially liked that it could pick up debris along the edges of walls (thanks to edge cleaning bristles on the brush roll). It doesn’t deep clean as well as our other top picks, but it would be an excellent second vacuum for a quick pick up.</p>
<p>It runs smoothly on hard floors and doesn’t snowplow large debris, and you can easily transition between flooring types with a flick of the switch. It has a low profile and reaches under furniture with no problem. The swivel steering is useful for navigating around furniture and getting close to the edges.</p>

You may want to opt for a more heavy-duty vacuum to deep clean your carpets occasionally, but the Hoover will keep your room tidy and free of pet hair.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003ZYPZ0I/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Weighing only eight pounds, the weight is evenly distributed, so it’s easier to handle than our top-heavy cordless vacuums. Its 20-foot cord is long enough to reach across most rooms.</p>
<p>We also like that the Hoover is on the quieter side at only 75.9 dBA, less than our average rating of 79.4 across all models we tested. It’s also slim and stores upright, which makes it convenient to keep close at hand for those quick pick-up jobs.</p>
<h3>Things we didn’t like</h3>
<p>The Hoover performs better picking up large debris than fine dust. It’s a good choice for a lightweight, everyday vacuum,, but if you’re looking for a vacuum that really deep cleans, you may want to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>It doesn’t spew out fine particles (perhaps because it doesn’t pull them out of the carpet in the first place), but it does have trouble retaining large particles. If you have allergies or breathing issues, you may want to upgrade to a model with a more tightly sealed system.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Hoover &#8211; SH20030 has a powered brush roll and edge-cleaning bristles, so it performs best on pet hair and along wall edges.</li>
<li>At less than half the price of our average for all the lightweight vacuums we tested, the Hoover is the best bang for your buck.</li>
<li>Swivel steering and a low profile makes this vacuum incredibly easy to operate, while its upright position makes it trouble-free to pause between tasks.</li>
<li>If you have allergies or asthma, you may want to opt for a more expensive model that has fewer emissions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="others">Other finalists we tested</h2>
<h3>Dyson &#8211; V10 Absolute</h3>
<p>If you want a luxury upgrade, we highly recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0798FVV6V/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson &#8211; V10 Absolute</a>. The price point is more than double the average cost of our vacuums, but every Dyson we have tested (including the V10 Absolute) outperforms the other finalists in terms of performance and air quality.</p>
<p>We didn’t name it our winner simply because it isn’t as easy to maneuver as our top picks, and we considered agility a top priority for a lightweight vacuum. The price point is higher than many consumers are able or willing to spend. Finally, we noted that the hygenic one-touch emptying bin tends to stick, making it more likely to spill the contents. (This wasn’t an issue with other Dyson models we previously tested.)</p>
<p>However, if you have pets or allergies, it may be worth it to invest in a Dyson for its ability to capture and retain both pet hair and dander. Dyson cord-free vacuums have whole machine filtration which captures 99 percent of particles as small as 0.3 microns.</p>
<h3>Oreck &#8211; XL2100RHS</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NDNV18/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oreck &#8211; XL2100RHS</a> is a bagged, corded and commercial model that performs extremely well in terms of pulling up embedded dirt and debris from carpet. It has plenty of power, but it’s also the noisiest vacuum of the models we tested. It also tends to drag along the floor and doesn’t have swivel steering, so alhough it weighs the same as the Shark, it causes arm fatigue, and the Shark doesn’t.</p>
<p>If you want a powerhouse vacuum and your main reason for choosing a lightweight vacuum is the ability to carry it upstairs easily, the Oreck is a good choice. However, if you have allergies or asthma, the trail of dust it leaves behind may make the Oreck a poor choice for you.</p>
<h3>Tineco &#8211; A11 Hero</h3>
<p>If maneuverability is what you prize most, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FFKYCRL/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tineco &#8211; A11 Hero</a> is hands down the most agile vacuum we tested. Unfortunately, it doesn’t possess the suction power to name it as our top cordless pick. It only picked up four grams of dirt in our performance test, and appeared to pick up large debris well (with no snow plowing), but would leave pieces behind after we turned off the suction.</p>
<p>It comes with two lithium-ion batteries and a dual charging dock, so you can run the vacuum for up to 60 minutes without interruption. The waste canister is easy to empty, and it is easy on the wrist at only 5.5 pounds, despite being top heavy.</p>
<h3>Deik &#8211; ZB1516</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FGRZJ29/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Deik &#8211; ZB1516</a> has swivel steering, but the brush head doesn’t move as easily as our other contenders with swivel steering. Although it’s a top-heavy model like most of our lightweight cordless vacuums, the Deik weighs only 4.7 pounds so you don’t feel strain on the wrist.</p>
<p>It has a HEPA filter, but it tested as one of the neutral models in our emissions test. It doesn’t leave the air cleaner like the Shark or Dyson, but it doesn’t kick back dust either. Our overall impression of the Deik is neutral. At just over half the price of the average cost of our finalists, there isn’t anything negative about this vacuum, but it doesn’t have many standout qualities either.</p>
<h3>Bissell &#8211; Featherweight 2033</h3>
<p>If you need the absolute lightest vacuum for quick pick ups, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZY7BTWM/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissell &#8211; Featherweight 2033</a> is a decent option. It lies flat so you can get underneath furniture easily, although the head doesn’t swivel so it doesn’t navigate as well as other finalists. However, at only 3 pounds, maneuverability isn’t as much of an issue as it would be for heavier vacuums.</p>
<p>The short cord could be problematic if you have a larger area room, and the filter clogs easily with pet hair. For the price and weight, these issues may not be deal breakers. The Bissell is the lowest-priced model we tested, and although it doesn’t come with any bells or whistles or have much power, it will make your floor appear cleaner with minimal effort.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>When looking for the best lightweight vacuum, we wanted to find a model that was agile as well as lightweight. Whether you’re purchasing a lightweight vacuum because you have a higher area of square footage, multiple floors or a limited range of motion, a vacuum that maneuvers easily will make the task less labor-intensive.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EUKHACW/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Rocket HV302</a> has tremendous capabilities to capture and retain dust and debris, while still being easy to navigate around the room. For those who prefer a cordless model, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MNJ7ZR1/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; NEC222</a> is another lightweight vacuum that combines power with ease of use.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter testing five vacuums in three different apartments and running controlled tests side by side, we&#8217;ve determined that the Shark &#8211; Apex is the best upright vacuum. This predator is at the top of the food chain with quiet power and effective cleaning on more surfaces than most other upright vacuum cleaners. The entry-level Shark &#8211; Navigator is also a good value at about half the price, and the Dirt Devil won a spot among our top picks with compact maneuverability.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>After spending the last year researching and testing selections for task-specific categories like <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">the best vacuums for pet owners</a>, <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum/">handheld vacuums</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuums</a>, we were ready to tackle a more general overview of the vacuum market.</p>
<p>We read comparison reviews by traditional publications like Wirecutter and Consumer Reports, but we also sunk hours into the endless testing footage available from vacuum enthusiasts on YouTube. We also investigated the latest buzz on the r/vacuums subreddit.</p>
<p>Vacuum cleaners, like many appliances, are often sold with different model numbers or packages at different retailers. Even finding the most recent models or determining differences between model numbers is sometimes nearly impossible. Our researcher compared specs on 18 different models for Shark alone, and that&#8217;s just the currently available models.</p>
<p>We included Shark&#8217;s perennial classic, the Navigator, since it&#8217;s their best value in terms of power for dollar and is still readily available. We also included the new Shark &#8211; Apex AZ1002, a model with all of Shark&#8217;s latest bells and whistles at a correspondingly higher price.</p>
<p>Selecting a worthy competitor for the Apex was tough. Every review of the Shark vacuums praises their relative maneuverability, while Dyson vacuums (though powerful) tend to be considered clunky by comparison. We selected the Dyson &#8211; Ball Multi Floor 2 rather than the larger, heavier, more expensive Animal or Cinetic models. (Some reviews actually show the Multi Floor to be more powerful than the Animal.)</p>
<p>Shark and Dyson have the high-end bagless vacuum market pretty much to themselves these days. We did find some well-regarded competitors in the budget bracket, though, with affordable and lightweight models from Dirt Devil and Eureka that had excellent customer reviews.</p>

<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Cleaning path:</strong> A wider cleaning path means fewer passes to clean an area, but it usually also makes a vacuum less maneuverable.</p>
<p><strong>Edge cleaning gap:</strong> This is a measurement of the distance of the pickup track from the edge, which determines how much dirt is missed when you&#8217;re vacuuming along baseboards or furniture.</p>
<p><strong>Steering design:</strong> Dyson really made a name for themselves with the &#8220;big ball&#8221; steering design, but we&#8217;ve come a long way since the days when every vacuum handled like a giant commercial model. Swivelling heads are now a common feature that actually made two other brands easier to turn than the Dyson.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories:</strong> Upright vacuums typically come with hose attachments that help you clean things like stairs, couches and drapes. Great attachments really make some jobs easier, but if you don&#8217;t have any upholstered furniture you might find yourself keeping them in the closet.</p>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> Lower weight is always better for carrying and using a vacuum, so long as you aren&#8217;t giving up features you need. This is also an important factor if you&#8217;re vacuuming on hardwood, since lighter vacuums are less likely to leave scuff marks.</p>
<p><strong>Noise:</strong> All vacuums are loud, but some are louder than others. Sleeping housemates will thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Filter performance and sealed systems:</strong> High efficiency particulate air (&#8220;HEPA&#8221;) filters are common, and the filter itself almost always does a great job filtering out even the smallest dust particles. The big difference between vacuums is whether they&#8217;re fully sealed or just let dust escape out of cracks and gaps.</p>

<p><strong>Height to fit under furniture:</strong> Coffee tables, beds and other low-clearance furniture can be tricky to vacuum under. Low-profile vacuum beater heads can slip into more places without stopping to use a specialty attachment.</p>
<p><strong>Cord Length:</strong> You want to be able to vacuum your entire floor without switching outlets, so cord length is a big priority for larger rooms or even just getting down the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>Length of hose:</strong> If you want to get the most out of your specialty attachments, it&#8217;s nice to be able to roam a bit. This is especially important for high ceilings.</p>

<p><strong>Total reach:</strong> This spec is usually a combination of cord length and hose length, plus the longest extension attachment. We think it makes more sense to think about your needs for cord length and hose length separately, though.</p>
<p><strong>Warranty and service network:</strong> In the past, vacuum repair worked like car repair: You buy an expensive machine from a dealer and take it back in for repairs. Dyson still has a repair network, while Shark works mostly by shipping things in the mail.</p>
<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs an upright vacuum?</h2>
<p>Upright vacuums are great on carpet. If you&#8217;ve got wall-to-wall medium-pile carpet, an upright vacuum is probably going to be your first choice. If you have more than 500 square feet of carpet to clean, an upright also makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>For bare floors, like hardwood or tile, an upright vacuum usually isn&#8217;t the best choice. Picks from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-steam-mop/">steam mop review</a> will be a much better choice on tile or vinyl, though a good upright vacuum will still pick up dirt.</p>
<p>Being able to turn off the brushroll is an important feature if you&#8217;re going to use an upright on bare floors, since the brush will usually scatter dirt too much and doesn’t really help on a bare floor. Brushroll control is a standard feature for all the vacuums we looked at.</p>
<p>Upright vacuums put the weight of the motor above the brushroll, which helps it work into carpet fibers. That extra weight pushing down helps with getting out tough dirt, and for &#8220;grooming&#8221; longer carpet into that gorgeous freshly vacuumed look.</p>
<p>A good upright vacuum also makes cleaning floors more convenient. An upright keeps all of your vacuum parts rolling on one set of wheels, which means you only have to stop vacuuming when you get to the end of your cord.</p>
<p>The cordless models from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuum review</a> are even more convenient to carry around. An upright is wider, though, so it can clean more quickly, and it can also go longer before the dust cup fills up. Most importantly, a plug-in upright won&#8217;t run out of battery power before you finish cleaning.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, an upright vacuum puts the suction motor, roller brush and dust receptacle in one piece riding on wheels with a long handle. A canister vacuum separates the motor and dust receptacle from the tools with a long hose, so you typically have most of the weight of the vacuum in a piece that follows you around on the floor while you hold the attachments and pickup tools.</p>
<p>Upright vacuums are similar to the oldest designs, basically adding suction and a bag to 19th-century carpet sweeper designs like the Bissel. Early upright designs were called &#8220;suction sweepers,&#8221; while early canister designs were called &#8220;suction dusters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those names highlight the strengths of each design: Upright vacuums are very efficient for &#8220;sweeping&#8221; over large surfaces, while the maneuverability and flexibility of a canister&#8217;s detached hose make it perfect for vacuuming things that aren&#8217;t your floor.</p>
<p>That said, most upright vacuums sold to consumers deliberately allow you to use a flexible hose and attachments, so you can still clean your drapes and upholstery.</p>
<p>Likewise, canister vacuums typically come with long-handled floor-sweeping attachments, and some even come with very nice electric-powered brushroll systems for plush carpet.</p>
<p>An upright vacuum really shines if you need to clean up and down a carpeted hall. The cord is long enough that you can finish the job without unplugging, and you won&#8217;t have to drag a canister along behind you. It&#8217;s also easier to store in a closet because of the small footprint.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re cleaning smaller rooms with lots of furniture, the lighter weight and low-profile head of a canister vacuum&#8217;s pickup tool make it much easier to work under and around obstacles. The drawbacks start when you have to move the canister body while you&#8217;re vacuuming.</p>
<p>Canister vacuums often come with air-powered tools, which means that only the flow of air is powering the brushroll that&#8217;s picking up hair and dirt from your carpet. Air-powered tools are better than nothing in a pinch, but they&#8217;re not nearly as effective as a motor-driven brush. We found out when testing the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">best pet hair vacuums</a> that just because a canister vacuum is expensive doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s always the right tool for the job.</p>
<p>Shark&#8217;s popular &#8220;lift-away&#8221; vacuum design tries to split the difference between a canister and an upright. If you want to separate the bulky motor housing from the floor tools you can just push a button and detach it. The hose is very short compared to a purpose-built canister system, but it has many of the same strengths when you need to vacuum under a bed or on carpeted stairs.</p>
<p>Note that among Shark models, only the powered lift-away models can run the brushroll motor when the base is detached. The un-powered Navigator, however, can still do bare-floor cleaning just as capably in this mode.</p>

<p>It might seem like distant history, but for most of the hundred or so years of vacuum cleaning we&#8217;ve relied on a bag to capture dirt that&#8217;s picked up. Once the bag was full, you had to throw it away and replace it with a new one. Bags could be made from paper for cheaper designs, but more expensive bags used other materials for better reliability and filtration.</p>
<p>Various bagless vacuum designs have been tried, but it was James Dyson who really popularized the bagless concept. Dyson pioneered the use of &#8220;cyclonic&#8221; airflow to separate dirt inside the dust receptacle through centrifugal force. Twenty years later, nearly all consumer-grade vacuums are bagless.</p>
<p>Without cyclonic dust removal, filters are the weak point of any vacuum system. If the filter is too fine, not enough air will get through and they will plug up quickly. If the filter lets a lot of air through, dust particles will also escape. Bag systems slowly lose suction efficiency as the filter pores fill with dust.</p>
<p>Modern bagless vacuums all use cyclonic action to separate dust, which means they can all use HEPA filters and filter-exhaust air down to sub-micron particles without instantly plugging up. Bagless systems generally use filters that are designed to be washed, so you should never have to buy replacement parts.</p>
<p>One more perk of bagless designs is that you can more easily find a piece of jewelry or a micro SD card that you accidentally pick up.</p>
<p>The savings are a relief, and not having to hunt for replacement bags when your vacuum is discontinued is nothing to sneeze at, either. But there is at least one downside to bagless designs.</p>
<p>When your vacuum collects dirt in a bag, you can simply throw it away and move on if you pick up something sticky, smelly or otherwise nasty. With a bagless vacuum, you&#8217;ve got to clean out the plastic receptacle and wash the filter.</p>
<p>In the marketplace, bagless has been a clear winner. You can still find a few of the old standby brands that maintain marketshare among commercial users, but even Panasonic has left the US vacuum cleaner market altogether after making Kenmore&#8217;s vacuums for decades.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We tested each of these vacuums in real-world conditions over the course of two months in three different apartments. We also spent a week testing for specific performance criteria in side-by-side dirt pickup tests on different types of carpet, and we measured noise and dust output.</p>
<p>After all that testing, we sat down and analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of each vacuum to decide which buyers they could be best for.<br />
[table id=241 /]
<h3>Maneuverability and weight</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/maneuverability.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We tested maneuverability around everyday living-room furniture. Weight played a big role in improving the scores of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet</a>, which also swivels well for quick turns. The Shark &#8211; Apex kept up, though, despite weighing about four pounds more than the budget-priced uprights.</p>
<p>The other surprising results for maneuverability were the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NAGRRRU/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson &#8211; Ball Multi Floor 2</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07J4R23VJ/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; PowerSpeed</a> models. The Dyson ball design just seems stiff and clunky compared to the new swivel-head designs from other makers. And remember, this is a lighter, smaller sibling in the Dyson family.</p>
<p>The Eureka was definitely the most frustrating, though. Without any consideration for swiveling, even the low weight made just turning it around at the end of a hallway far more difficult than it was with the other models.</p>
<p>The dust cups in this roundup were surprisingly similar. Dyson has a slight edge with a one-button release and dump system that makes emptying easier, though figuring out how hard to press the button takes some getting used to. Putting the Dyson&#8217;s pieces back in place is sometimes tricky, too. The other systems also have a drop-away bottom that makes emptying dirt easy, but fiddling with their latches isn&#8217;t quite as elegant.</p>
<p>Dyson&#8217;s outer canister separates completely from the cyclonic separator piece, so it&#8217;s easier to do a deep-clean if something gets lodged in there. None of the other dust receptacles were especially bad at trapping debris, but the Dyson system is (as one might expect) very elegant.</p>
<h3>Under-furniture height</h3>
<p>Measuring the height of each vacuum&#8217;s head gives an idea of how low the base of your furniture can be before the vacuum won&#8217;t fit at all. A model like the Dyson may fit under your couch part-way, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it will actually vacuum underneath. Most upright vacuums are too bulky, so you need to use an accessory tool on the hose to get all the dust bunnies.</p>
<p>Shark&#8217;s powered lift-away system on the Apex has a definite edge here. With the motor body removed, the brush head is free and clear to vacuum in tighter quarters.</p>
<h3>Edge cleaning</h3>
<p>We also tested the ability of these vacuums to pick up along the edge of a room or large furniture that goes to the floor. The Apex was a clear winner on this test, with good pickup right to a half-inch from a baseboard. The other finalists all left a track of dirt more than an inch wide.</p>
<h3>Attachments and Hose Length</h3>
<p>Our testers rated the usefulness of attachments for tricky situations like stairs, couches and drapes. Shark is almost cheating on this score, since the lift-away design means you can attach the handle directly to the motorized brush head to easily vacuum stairs, but the Shark vacuums include useful tools in other respects, too.</p>
<p>Of note is the motorized hand-sized upholstery brush included with the Apex. This kind of tool only works with vacuums that send power through the hose, so it&#8217;s pretty unique on a vacuum that doesn&#8217;t cost $600.</p>
<p>Hose length was a tricky feature to analyze: If you need to vacuum over and under a big sectional couch, for example, it might make all the difference. But the stand-out winner in this category, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NAGRRRU/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson &#8211; Ball Multi Floor 2</a>, had the hose storage system that was most annoying to work with. Dyson stores a rigid extension tube inside the hose, and it all nestles into the handle shaft, but getting the parts to click into place after use was difficult.</p>
<p>The Shark’s short hose length lost the most points with our testers. The hose on the Apex is only half the length of Dyson&#8217;s incredible ten-foot reach. It&#8217;s easy to lift the Apex&#8217;s body with one hand if you&#8217;re standing on a stepladder to reach a ceiling, but if you&#8217;re going to use the hose frequently you might start looking at the after-market hose extensions offered by other companies.</p>
<h3>Pick-up performance</h3>

[table id=243 /]
<p>We ran ten different tests to determine performance on various kinds of carpet and with different types of dirt. We weighed samples of icing sugar, sand and circle-shaped cereal and tested how much each vacuum left behind in a single pass on short-, medium- and long-pile carpet.</p>
<p>The stand-out performance in the pickup tests came from Dyson. If you&#8217;ve got medium- or low-pile carpet and want a deep clean, Dyson does a great job. In those cases it left behind mere grams of material. That said, in long carpet fibers, Dyson offers no height or power adjustment to keep it from simply getting stuck. If you&#8217;ve got luxurious carpet or area rugs, count Dyson out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark&#8217;s Navigator</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet</a> were nearly tied for how much they picked up on shorter carpet. We were especially impressed with the performance of the Dirt Devil, given how inexpensive and light it is.</p>
<h3>Long carpets and area rugs</h3>

<p>The real winner for overall usefulness was the Shark &#8211; Apex. While the Navigator and Dirt Devil performed acceptably well on long carpet in their bare-floor modes, the Apex is the only vacuum in this lineup to offer real suction or brush speed control.</p>

This is the only upright that didn't struggle on area rugs and high-pile carpet.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Dyson and Eureka designs (despite the &#8220;height control&#8221; setting on the Eureka) were impossible to use effectively on long carpet. These vacuums try to gobble up the long fibers with the brushrolls on, and all the suction power pulls the vacuum down into the carpet so you can&#8217;t move.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s even worse if your plush carpet is a small area rug: With a vacuum like the Dyson, you&#8217;ll just get totally stuck or even damage your rug when it gets pulled part-way inside the vacuum.</p>
<h3>Filtration and sealing against dust escape</h3>
[table id=245 /]
<p>For a real test of the filter performance, we used a Dylos air-quality meter to measure particle counts in particles per million by volume, measuring half-micron particles and ten micron particles separately but averaged together here. Readings were taken before and after a vacuuming session, as well as after an additional five minutes running the vacuum to allow its filter to capture particles that had been thrown around.</p>
<p>Sealed-system vacuums performed better than the budget-priced models, though we were impressed at how well the Shark &#8211; Navigator kept up with the more expensive competition, even spreading less dust than its bigger sibling.</p>
<p>The Eureka turned in an impressive result if you only look at the improvement from running the vacuum for five minutes after you finish using it; the amount of dust it spat into the air while it was vacuuming, though, was by far the highest.</p>
<p>These results show that even a well-sealed vacuum that has a good filter will still kick up a lot of dust. <strong>Dust will settle naturally, but it takes a while. You should always vacuum the day before you have asthmatic friends over, not immediately before they arrive.</strong></p>
<p>In our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">pet vacuum review</a> we saw comparable performance capturing smells. The sealed vacuums also performed well keeping pet dander and even odors inside the receptacle. The Eureka performed surprisingly well here capturing dust, much better than it did capturing smells, but there&#8217;s definitely enough variability in our testing environment and the way dust circulates in a room to account for that.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to keep your air as clean as possible, Shark and Dyson do a good job of keeping dust contained. Check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-air-purifier/">review of the best room air purifiers</a> if you want to get dust levels even lower than this after you&#8217;re done vacuuming.</p>
<h3>Noise</h3>
[table id=244 /]
<p>After we collected all of the test data on effective cleaning, we booted up our audio-analysis rig to get some noise readings. We used a calibrated mic and the Room Eq Wizard software, set to measure decibels with A-scale weighting.</p>
<p>We took noise measurements from six feet away in a single-car garage bay with a concrete floor. That&#8217;s about double the distance you&#8217;d be at when using the vacuum. We also included two other test vacuums: The tester&#8217;s old Dyson &#8211; DC25 (purchased in 2013) along with the Shark &#8211; Rocket stick vacuum, which won top place in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuum review</a>.</p>
<p>The average noise level is quite loud, 85 dBA for just a vacuum motor or 89 with the brushroll engaged and picking up dirt on a hard surface. These vacuums move a lot of air very quickly, so noise is inevitable. For the louder machines, these levels are actually close to what we got in tests from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-leaf-blower/">review of electric leaf blowers</a>.</p>
<p>The difference between the quietest and loudest vacuum was a full 10 dBA. Because of how sound works, people will perceive that as only double the loudness, but it&#8217;s the same power increase as running nine more of the quietest vacuums in a room together.</p>
<p>The quietest vacuum was the Shark &#8211; Apex, also the most expensive vacuum we tested. <strong>The cheaper Shark &#8211; Navigator was only 1dBA louder, with both vacuums peaking under 87 dBA with the brushroll turned on.</strong> That&#8217;s still loud enough that <a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2016/02/08/noise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to guidelines set by the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety</a>, you shouldn&#8217;t be up-close with these vacuum cleaners for more than an hour every day without hearing protection.</p>
<p>All of the other vacuums we tested (including the stick vacuum) were louder than 85 dBA from six feet away. From close-up, as you&#8217;d be using them, the loudest vacuums measured at 97 dBA. You shouldn&#8217;t use a loud vacuum cleaner for longer than half an hour every day without some ear plugs.</p>
<p>This is still much quieter than the noise exposure from power tools at a jobsite, but it&#8217;s something to keep in mind. If you clean for a living and need some hearing protection, check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-ear-plugs/">review of the best ear plugs.</a> Obviously, any of these vacuums are loud enough to wake most roommates (not to mention a baby).</p>
<p>One notable quirk is that while the Dyson is loud overall, its brushroll motor hardly adds any extra noise. Shark&#8217;s powerful brushrolls are quiet, but you can definitely tell when they&#8217;re turned on and off.</p>

<p>At just over $300 from most retailers, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex AZ1002</a> is a premium product that really works to justify the extra cost. This is Shark&#8217;s largest vacuum, and it includes all of the best toys: powered accessory tools, a wood-floor-friendly brushroll, a hair-proof brush cleaning system, an extra-long cord and some working carpet-height settings.</p>
<p>This is the biggest vacuum we tested, though it actually has a fairly narrow cleaning track at 11.5 inches. Compare that to 12 inches on the budget-friendly Dirt Devil or 13.4 inches on the smaller-sized Dyson we tested. Shark tends to focus on maneuverability and flexibility instead of a wide pickup path, and we&#8217;re pretty happy with that tradeoff.</p>
<p>At 16 pounds and drawing 1350 watts of power, the Apex definitely feels like a full-size vacuum when you first assemble it. Most impressive are the power and floor-surface control switches that are mounted on the handle for easy access. No more bending down just to pause to answer the door or move from carpet to hard flooring.</p>
<p>We also noticed the DuoClean brush rollers pulling the Apex across floors more briskly than other uprights. Thankfully, the quick-swiveling head is easy to steer, so we never felt like this was a runaway vacuum. It&#8217;s power you can feel, but you&#8217;re in control.</p>
<h3>Best for thick carpet</h3>
<p>Thick carpet is where this vacuum really shone. Some of the other machines could get you by if you turn off the brushroll to keep it from jamming up, but the Apex gives you just the right amount of suction and brush speed to move swiftly across the floor and effectively clean your carpet.</p>
<p>In our test picking up icing sugar, the Apex was only 20 percent better than the Dyson on long carpet. With sand, though, that difference jumped to an astounding 43 percent. The Apex was also the only upright to earn a perfect score picking up large objects, though the Dirt Devil was not far behind.</p>
<h3>Powered lift-away design</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21917" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away.jpg" alt="Shark lift-away design" width="1987" height="1325" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away.jpg 1987w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Shark&#8217;s trademark design innovation is that they don&#8217;t let upright vacuums just be uprights: most of their line also converts to something more like a canister system, with the motor and dust cup in a &#8220;Lift-Away&#8221; pod that detaches from the handle tube.</p>
<p>The Lift-Away design makes the vacuum more flexible than a simple hand tool plugged into a hose could ever be. As mentioned above, since this is a powered Lift-Away model you can use the full-size brush head under furniture, and if you&#8217;re vacuuming a small area with lots of obstacles you can shed all the motor weight for more agility.</p>
<p>The downside of Shark&#8217;s Lift-Away designs has always been short hoses. You run out of hose very quickly if you try to use the Apex like a canister vacuum with the motor unit on the floor, so if you&#8217;re vacuuming a whole room with lots of furniture to clean under you&#8217;ll probably wind up carrying it in one hand while you vacuum with the other.</p>
<p>You can buy a wheeled cart for the canister, and there are non-powered hose extensions you can try, but most of the time it just makes far more sense to use the Apex in its upright mode.</p>
<p>Having too much extra hose can be annoying, and even Dyson&#8217;s remarkable collapsing hose is a bit unwieldy. Maybe there&#8217;s no perfect two-in-one canister and upright vacuum, but we really would like to see at least another three feet on the Apex to say it&#8217;s worth considering as a canister-mode design. For stairs and upholstery, though, it&#8217;s fantastic.</p>
<h3>Also the best upright vacuum for hardwood floors</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/brushspin.mov" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The Apex isn&#8217;t a one-trick fish, though. As well as tackling plush carpet, this is the best upright vacuum for bare floors. The Apex brings a few features to bear that you should consider if you&#8217;re vacuuming a hardwood floor rather than wall-to-wall carpet.</p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s Shark&#8217;s DuoClean brushroll. Many hardwood experts don&#8217;t like using a brushroll anywhere near hardwood, and you could use a vacuum that just has a simple easy-gliding suction head. (You could also use a dust mop.) <strong>But the DuoClean system is an exceptionally soft brush, and it works well to dust and even slightly polish your hardwood or manufactured flooring.</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got sand on your floor, it&#8217;s better to pick it up without grinding it in at all, but most of the time you encounter grains of sand on your floor you won&#8217;t know until you see a scratch. The Apex is, at least, designed to minimize the damage.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Top of the Food Chain: Shark - Apex</h3><p>Shark's vacuums are incredibly popular, and this model includes basically every feature they've come up with. Great control means this is actually a good vacuum on all surfaces, and the powered lift-away system makes it very flexible. To top it all off, this is quiet and captures dust effectively.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Another reason this is the best upright vacuum for hardwood floors is that it won&#8217;t choke on your area rugs. None of the other vacuums we looked at in this price range have controls for switching surfaces, so this is the vacuum that does the whole room at once.</p>
<p>We need to stop for a moment here and emphasize that if you&#8217;ve got a new engineered hardwood floor, you should double-check with the manufacturer that use of a soft brushroll won&#8217;t void your warranty. Flooring finishes should all be fine, but care instructions sometimes specifically say not to use a buffing machine or a &#8220;beater bar&#8221; head.</p>
<p>Again, we haven&#8217;t seen any evidence that this vacuum could damage a floor unless you&#8217;re running it through piles of sand and deliberately grinding it into your hardwood.</p>

<p>Shark sells the Apex in a few different versions, but we tested the version that had the best set of accessories, the AZ1002. This model ships with three compact attachments you can plug into the end of the hose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compact, motorized brush head</li>
<li>12-inch crevice tool</li>
<li>Combination upholstery brush &amp; mattress tool</li>
</ul>
<p>Also remember that the extension tube and the full-size head will plug into the handle, so you can get about 30 inches of extra reach with any of these tools for dusting high-up corners and drapes.</p>
<p>Shark sometimes runs promotions that will include extra accessories, like a flat-surface or under-furniture dusting tool, if you purchase directly from their site.</p>
<p>The motorized pet tool is a good pick if you&#8217;ve got corduroy upholstery or other surfaces that collect hair and need more than just suction to clean. It probably wouldn&#8217;t be worth picking this tool up all by itself if you buy the Apex without it, but it&#8217;s a nice perk and stores neatly on the base of the vacuum.</p>
<p>For stairs and other tricky carpeted surfaces, we think that plugging the handle directly into the regular carpet head and using the Apex like a super-powered handheld vacuum is a fantastic trick. If you&#8217;ve ever skipped cleaning carpeted stairs because you hate how clunky your vacuum is, you&#8217;ll love the Apex.</p>
<h3>Sealed system and HEPA Filter</h3>
<p>The Apex performed very well in our dust collection test. Any powered-brush vacuum will kick dust into the air, so don&#8217;t count on the Apex to make your air dust-free immediately after vacuuming, but the sealed system and HEPA filter will make sure that it&#8217;s not just blowing all the dust you pick up back out into your room.</p>
<h3>A bigger, better vacuum</h3>
<p>To sum up all our time with the Apex: this is a big vacuum that&#8217;s not clunky. Shark has some great tricks that make this a more versatile system than any other vacuum we found. If you have long carpet, area rugs, or any other tasks that utilize Shark&#8217;s special features it&#8217;s an easy vacuum to recommend.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re only vacuuming medium-length carpet, though, both the Shark &#8211; Navigator and the Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet will also do a good job. Those vacuums are lighter, so they&#8217;re easier to use, and they&#8217;re much less expensive, too.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex</a> is a big vacuum, but it’s still easy to handle.</li>
<li>On long carpet, the Apex easily beat all competitors.</li>
<li>This doesn’t quite have as much cleaning power as a Dyson on medium carpets.</li>
<li>Shark&#8217;s powered lift-away design gives flexibility.</li>
<li>Good sealing and filtration keeps dust to a minimum.</li>
<li>The DuoClean brushroll design is also good for hardwood floors.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-value">Best Value: Shark &#8211; Navigator</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Navigator NV352</a> earned a second-place ranking based on performance in our tests, but when you consider that it&#8217;s only half the price of the more expensive vacuums we bought, there&#8217;s plenty of reason to consider it best value overall.</p>
<p>The Navigator is a consistent winner in vacuum tests all over the internet. This is a step up from the cheapest vacuums that Shark makes, and a clear step down from their full-featured models. The NV352 doesn&#8217;t have the new hardwood-polishing soft brush, and the version with Shark&#8217;s new maintenance-free &#8220;ZeroM&#8221; brushroll is about $50 more. The lift-away mode won&#8217;t run the brushroll, and there&#8217;s no suction or speed control to make long carpets bearable.</p>
<p>That said, on mid- or short-length carpet this vacuum almost keeps up with a $300 Dyson in our pickup tests for sand and powder.</p>
<p>This is our pick for those whose biggest concern is pet hair pickup, so long as you don&#8217;t have longer carpet. If you do have high-pile carpet, this isn&#8217;t the worst-performing vacuum if you turn the brushroll off, but it&#8217;s not nearly as good as a machine with real multi-surface controls.</p>
<p>Just like the Apex, the Navigator beat the Dyson in both air quality and noise-output tests. It&#8217;s nice to know that for a value-priced vacuum, you don&#8217;t have to make compromises when it comes to your health.</p>

This isn't the very best in any one category, but it's got a strong motor and it's still easy to handle. The Navigator's filter performance and low noise are also competitive with the bigger machines.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If you&#8217;re vacuuming on low-pile carpet or bare floors, the Navigator did spray more sand than the Apex or Dyson. If you spot a pile of sand, you should always turn off the brushroll anyhow, but the Navigator seems to have an extra-aggressive brush.</p>
<h3>Shortcomings</h3>

<p>As you can see in the clip above, the Navigator had trouble in the cereal pickup test, especially on medium carpet. Even on short carpet, where it performed much better, there was a straggler.</p>
<p>In our maneuverability tests the Navigator easily beat the Dyson, but it&#8217;s not as easy to steer as the Dirt Devil. When we asked our tester which vacuum she would most like to keep for her apartment, she passed up the Navigator&#8217;s air filtration and power for the most maneuverable choice.</p>
<p>All in all, there are a few ways the Apex is clearly a better vacuum. The Navigator keeps pace, though, and actually outperformed the Apex in some tests. For most people, this will be a great vacuum.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Navigator</a> is a tried and true value pick.</li>
<li>If your biggest concern is pet hair on mid-length carpet, get this.</li>
<li>Even the less-expensive Shark filters exhaust air even better than Dyson.</li>
<li>The Navigator is almost as quiet as the Apex.</li>
<li>A non-powered lift-away design makes this less flexible than the Apex.</li>

<h2 id="budget-pick">Budget pick: Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet</h2>

<p>Dirt Devil&#8217;s lineup of vacuums is very much focused on the budget segment of the market, with few models crossing the $100 threshold. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Razor Pet Steerable Upright</a> is the upgraded model with swivel-action steering, and we think it&#8217;s a great vacuum if your budget is tight.</p>
<p>The Dirt Devil kept pace with the Navigator through the low- and mid-pile carpet tests, so it&#8217;s a vacuum that&#8217;s capable of thoroughly cleaning your carpet. But where it really stood out was in handling. The Dirt Devil is actually slightly heavier than the Navigator, but it&#8217;s easier to maneuver and wheel around.</p>
<p>This vacuum also fits under furniture with a clearance height just slightly lower than the Apex&#8217;s. Without the lift-away feature this isn&#8217;t as versatile in some tight spots, but there&#8217;s something great about a vacuum that&#8217;s just good at what it was built for.</p>

The Razor keeps up admirably on most carpet, and it's pretty good at dust control. You don't get the bells and whistles, but you'll be impressed at how easy this is to maneuver.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>For dust control, this vacuum doesn&#8217;t have a HEPA filter or a fully sealed system. It will spread more fine dust around than the Shark or Dyson vacuums. That said, it was surprisingly good at containing the smell and dust from pet hair in one tester&#8217;s apartment. It&#8217;s also slightly quieter than a Dyson.</p>

<p>Dirt Devil includes an air-turbine-powered hand tool with this package, and it&#8217;s the kind of tool that might help in a very few situations, but for the most part you&#8217;ll probably skip it. The Shark&#8217;s motorized brush is wider, and actually has enough torque to get dirt out of carpet or upholstery fibers.</p>
<p>Dirt devil also includes a two-in-one crevice and brush tool for capturing loose objects that fall out of your pockets into your couch. The tools are friction-fit, instead of snapping in place, but they work about as well as most cheap vacuum accessories and store neatly on the side of the vacuum.</p>
<p>One of our testers advocated for a second-place ranking for this vacuum. If you&#8217;ve got a small apartment or a limited area of carpet to clean, this is a vacuum that will get the job done without any pretentious extra features.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet</a> is an easy-to-steer upright vacuum.</li>
<li>If you need competitive cleaning power on a tight budget, here it is.</li>
<li>A low-profile head makes this easier to get under furniture.</li>
<li>The Razor&#8217;s filter and noise reduction won&#8217;t beat Shark, but it keeps up with Dyson.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Dyson &#8211; Ball Multi Floor 2 is a powerful vacuum with some great design details, but after spending time with all of the vacuums in this lineup, none of our testers really liked using it.</p>
<p>Dyson products are often tricky to review. When Dyson does something well, they usually do it very well. James Dyson revolutionized vacuum cleaners and has been a dominant force since the DC07 was released in 2001. That said, Dyson has never been very competitive with price, and there are some things about this vacuum that are nearly unforgivable.</p>
<p>At about $300, the Ball Multi Floor 2 is a solid performer. We don&#8217;t want to misrepresent the performance numbers: this is clearly the best vacuum for low-pile carpet if all you care about is deep-cleaning. The track is wide, and the suction and agitation get more dirt out —  on average, the Dyson picked up 95 percent of our test samples on carpets where it will actually move effectively.</p>
<p>Dyson also makes an even more expensive vacuum, but it doesn&#8217;t solve the Multi Floor 2&#8217;s biggest problem. The Ball Animal 2 is supposed to have even more power, but if you have high-pile carpet or area rugs that&#8217;s just like throwing gasoline on a fire. Dyson does not design these vacuums for people with multiple floor surfaces.</p>
<p>The Dyson is a few pounds lighter than the Shark &#8211; Apex, but despite all the ingenuity of the rolling-ball design, this is a difficult vacuum to push around and maneuver. Compared to clunky old commercial vacuums from forty years ago the ball is a great idea, but the new swivel-head competitors are much easier to use. Again, the upgrade model from Dyson would just make the problem worse with a bigger and heavier body.</p>
<p>This might be the best upright vacuum for tile floors, since the hard brushroll doesn&#8217;t matter the way it does on hardwood, and the most important feature is suction power in that case. But it&#8217;s clear that any of the choices from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-steam-mop/">steam mop review</a> would be a better tool for cleaning tile floors.</p>

<p>One strange quirk of the new Ball 2 design that you won&#8217;t see in promotional pictures or even most video reviews is the pressure relief vent at the top of the handle.</p>
<p>When you finish vacuuming and push the Dyson up into its standing mode, the suction switches from the brush head to the handle-mounted extension hose automatically. Air starts rushing in through the cap at the top of the handle.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s a bit scary if your hand is on top of the handle when you push it into the standing mode, and it&#8217;s not something we&#8217;d seen on the other Dyson vacuums we&#8217;ve used.</strong> You&#8217;re not going to lose a finger or anything, but it was a turn-off for our testers.</p>
<p>In 2018, Dyson <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/06/dyson-announces-cordless-future-with-end-of-plug-in-vacuums" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced that they&#8217;re no longer developing</a> new plug-in vacuum designs. We chose their V8 cordless stick vacuum as a top pick in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuum review</a>, so we know they&#8217;re on to something, but there are good reasons for many of us to own a conventional upright.</p>
<p>It seems like Dyson never got further than designing around great suction and long hoses. If that&#8217;s your primary concern, then this model or the even more powerful Animal 2 will beat most other vacuums. If you want a vacuum that&#8217;s easy to push and works on other surfaces than low-pile carpet, we suggest looking elsewhere.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07J4R23VJ/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; PowerSpeed NEU180B Upright</a> isn&#8217;t a terrible vacuum. It has good reviews on the retail websites we looked at, with a 4.4 average on Amazon and a good Fakespot grade, as well, so we don&#8217;t suspect those are disingenuous reviews. Many of them seem to be cat owners, so it&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re just easy to please.</p>
<p>But about the best thing we can say about the Eureka, in comparison to the other models we tested, is that it&#8217;s very light. Compared to the Dirt Devil at the same price, or the Shark &#8211; Navigator for about $60 more, it&#8217;s just not at all competitive. Not in pickup, not in maneuverability, not in ease of use, not in noise. It doesn&#8217;t even fit under furniture well.</p>
<p>The Eureka is worthless on long carpet. No, a Dyson isn&#8217;t much better, but that&#8217;s not a good excuse when you advertise &#8220;five height-adjustment settings.&#8221; It turns out that the setting just opens or closes the suction opening at the floor very slightly and directs it away from the brushroll. This vacuum did not work on area rugs or carpet with any kind of long pile.</p>

<p>Upright vacuums are tricky beasts. Just about any upright will do a decent job of getting everyday dirt out of low-pile carpet, and so picking the very best means testing for the most extreme cases. It also means we had to be a little bit more picky about likes and dislikes.</p>
<p>After testing vacuums in a variety of real-world settings and comparing them side-by-side in controlled tests, it&#8217;s clear that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex</a> is the vacuum to beat. Good performance on every surface was definitely a winning trait, and creature comforts like handle-mounted switches didn&#8217;t hurt. The powered lift-away design isn&#8217;t everything that a canister vacuum would be, but it&#8217;s pretty darn close for a two-in-one design.</p>
<p>Even with a runner-up pick, it&#8217;s hard not to feel like we&#8217;re short-changing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Navigator</a>. It&#8217;s small and light, but it packs a lot of power into that compact frame. This value-friendly model is still dust-sealed and quiet, but it doesn&#8217;t have multi-surface power settings or run the brush head in lift-away mode.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for something even cheaper, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet</a> is a budget-friendly underdog that keeps up with the pack. There&#8217;s no dust sealing and it&#8217;s not quiet, but it&#8217;s very maneuverable and picks up dirt well.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent three days testing six of the top rust removers on the market on a variety of rusted tools, household objects and doors to determine which was superior. Ultimately, we selected <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0044F9Q52/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Iron Out &#8211; Stain Remover</a> as the best rust remover. Iron Out is simple to apply in spray-gel form, acts quickly, and for some surfaces — like rusted chrome — works to restore products to almost showroom condition. Our runner-up is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U0GIKQU/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CLR &#8211; Calcium Lime Rust Remover</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Rust is the common name for iron oxide, the combination of iron and oxygen expressed as chemical compound Fe2O3. The process of how rust works involves an electrochemical reaction involving an anode, cathode and electrolyte. For those of you who skipped chemistry class, the first two are pieces of metal that give and receive electrons, and the last element is a liquid that helps the electrons move.</p>
<p>For our review, we began by identifying highly rated products from consumer and specialist sources and then screened product reviews for authenticity. We focused on rust removal products that are convenient to use, have a wide range of applications and minimize use of toxic chemicals. Our finalists were chosen based on three factors: the best for metal, the best spray and the best liquid.</p>
<p>Of the three rust removal techniques — mechanical, conversion and direct application — all of our products fall into the last category.</p>
<p>In very broad terms, household rust removers are designed to work in one or two simple applications. They can be divided into products that are intended exclusively for metal and  products with a wider range of applications such as vinyl, ceramic tile, fiberglass and even carpet and fabrics. We sought out the best representatives for both these categories.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-rust">Types of rust</h2>
<p>While rust conditions might all look alike to the untrained eye, there are subtle differences in the nature of how rust occurs, even within the confines of a small tool like a wood plane. An ideal sample of different types of rust includes four variations: stable rust, flash rust, flaking rust and pitting.</p>
<p><b>Stable rust:</b> Occurs over long periods of time and tends to be uniform in appearance. In certain cases, like uncoated steel building panels, stable rust is considered to be a desirable aesthetic effect.</p>
<p><b>Flash rust:</b> Results from water occurring at one spot. Flash rust is frequently bright orange in color and can occur in as little as six hours.</p>
<p><b>Flaking rust:</b> Can actually take up more volume than the metal it displaces and is often found in transitional areas where a coating ends.</p>
<p><b>Pitting: </b>Results from trapped moisture and is commonly found in the cavity areas of tools and furniture.</p>
<h2 id="common-methods">Common methods for removal</h2>
<p>Rust removal is a broad topic that includes a wide range of techniques for cleaning metal and other materials where surfaces have become tarnished, stained and tainted with oxidized metal (aka rust). Dealing with rusted metal objects and surfaces can be addressed with three basic techniques:</p>
<p><b>Mechanical methods:</b> Grinding, sanding and scouring.</p>
<p><b>Conversion methods</b>: Preventing the further spread of rust by using chemical solutions to convert the rust into a protective barrier.</p>
<p><b>Direct application:</b> Soaking, spraying or wiping a removal product onto the surface.</p>
<p>In addition to metal, the word “rust” is commonly used to describe discoloration from hard-water stains and reactive stains that appear on nonmetallic surfaces such as porcelain, stone, wood, brick, concrete, fiberglass and vinyl. The rusty stains in bathtubs and toilets are common examples of nonmetallic rust.</p>
<p>The reality of rust is that it is tricky to figure out. Many household items have patches of rust intermingled with painted or other coatings. This was the case with the steel table that we tested. It had painted legs with the paint worn off in patches and with rust in-between. Our overall experience with the four (only four of our six were used on the table) rust removal products was that most of them darkened the rusted area but did not affect the paint. For heavy duty cases like this, a more labor-intensive process using a paint-stripper and/or a chemical rust remover is required.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>Home rust removers are packaged and applied in a variety of ways. The most common applications are sprays, gels and liquid (i.e., immersion) forms. Apart from considering the effectiveness of the product in question, we also delved into the features that consumers find most important.</p>
<p><b>Form of application: </b>Rust-removal products come in spray, gel and immersion form. The most convenient products are those that can be sprayed on the rust. Although spray-on application is easy, it can still be tricky knowing how much spray to use — but here’s a tip: The position of the rusted item is important. If you are spraying a vertical surface, the spray drips down the face, and it can be difficult to apply the product evenly. The best way to deal with this is to spray just a bit at a time and work it in as you go.</p>
<p><b>Toxicity: </b>This was a key consideration in our product selection. Toxicity relates to both the impact on the individual applying the product and to the disposal of the product in the environment. <b>We avoided products with oxalic acid, a comparatively abrasive and harmful chemical.</b> Instead, we focused on products that did not require respirators and special handling, although we did use gloves to avoid direct contact with the skin during application (and we recommend that you do too). Some products, like Iron Out &#8211; Rust Remover, warn that burns can occur that might not immediately be felt. It is advisable that extra care be taken when using any rust-removal product.</p>
<p><b>Odor: </b>Most of the products we tested had a fairly mild odor or no odor at all. If you are sensitive to odors, it is advisable to wear a respirator and safety glasses when applying rust removers. Since the products we tested were selected in part for being relatively environmental-friendly and nontoxic, none of the manufacturers recommended wearing a respirator during application.</p>
<p><b>Duration of application: </b>The recommended time for application is noted on all products. For some products, there is a different prescribed time that depends on the severity of the rust and the type of surface treated. Of the products we tested, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M0TLQ66/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Evapo-Rust &#8211; Super Safe Rust Remover</a> had the widest range of recommended application times.</p>
<p><b>Effectiveness based on a single application: </b>For household use, a single application is desirable. Since even the simplest application of a rust remover entails a certain amount of care, mess and clean-up, no one wants to go through multiple applications to achieve a good result unless it’s absolutely necessary.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>

<p>The first part of removing rust from household products is to assess the type of rust you’re dealing with. Stable rust and pitting rust are the most common forms found in a home. We tested our products on tools, surfaces and appliances to determine the best overall performer.</p>
<p>All rust products, even the simplest spray-on products, require a reasonable amount of preparation to protect your hands and eyes. We tested a range of product types, including sprays, gels and liquids and found ourselves liking the sprays the best for ease of applications.</p>
<p>After reviewing product instructions and optimal applications, we identified six products that provided a sufficient range of surfaces and types of rust. Not all products are created equal, so we targeted a minimum of four surfaces for each product. The six finalists can be broadly grouped into metal-specific products and nonmetal products for treating surfaces such as ceramic tile, vinyl and fiberglass.</p>

<p>The test surfaces included the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steel work table (stable rust in patches)</li>
<li>Garden tools (power washer nozzle, shovel, weeder and rakes; included a mix of stable and pitting rust)</li>
<li>Nuts and bolts (pitting rust)</li>
<li>Teapots (water stains)</li>
<li>Chrome chair legs (stable rust)</li>
<li>Stainless steel refrigerator (water stains)</li>
</ul>
<p>The products were applied according to instruction. Where a range of application times was given, we used the midpoint time. Where possible — for example, on the work table — we applied simultaneously multiple products to compare performance. For other rusted objects, such as workshop tools, we applied each rust remover separately.</p>
<h3>Outdoor furniture and tools</h3>
<p>Old tools never die, they are just left outside to rust. Rust and associated stains can be found everywhere: Tools, surfaces, bikes, cars and furniture are common victims. Most rust is treatable to some extent, and fortunately, there are excellent household products to help get the job done.</p>
<p>Our steel work table presented the biggest challenge. None of the four products we tested on the table did an effective job in cleaning the table legs. Even Evapo-Rust &#8211; Super Safe Rust Remover, which was left applied overnight, did not have much of an impact on the table legs (other than to darken them somewhat).</p>
<p>The table was our most “industrial” representative with heavy-gauge steel and a painted surface that was likely applied electrostatically. Heavy-duty products with painted or coated surfaces will typically require a two-step approach that requires removing the finished surface first and then applying the rust remover. We tested our products on the table to see if they would improve the overall rusted appearance without it turning into a major project.</p>
<p>Our garden-tool category was a bit of a mixed bag. We used four tools with stable and pitting rust: a shovel, a weeder and two rakes. The Evaporust, probably due to it being a liquid for which total immersion is possible, took most of the rust off the weeder’s tip after it was partially immersed in a bucket. We also applied Aceros &#8211; Innosoft B570 to our rusted shovel with a wet sponge as recommended. It did a credible job of cleaning the rust from the shovel and giving it an overall darkened appearance.</p>
<p>One area where all our finalists “shined” was removing pitted rust off nuts and bolts. With very small objects, complete immersion is quite practical. We saturated paper towels and then rinsed and wiped down the nuts and bolts. While all the products did an excellent job, the WD-40 &#8211; Specialist Rust Release Penetrant Spray was perhaps a bit better, pretty much as we’d expected from a product that touts nuts and bolts as a specialty.</p>
<p>Our two rakes were so heavily rusted that it was hard work for the two products we tested on them, CLR and Iron Out. Both products darkened the rakes, but the metal remained rusty. CLR, which we applied at full strength, narrowly outperformed Iron Out on this test.</p>
<h3>Indoor appliances and housewares</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Iron-Out-clip-sm.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Moving indoors, we tested our products on common appliances: a refrigerator, a stainless steel tea kettle and a steel pour-over kettle. For the refrigerator, we selected the four products that matched the assignment: Innosoft, Iron Out, CLR and Star brite. We divided a zone of the water-stained refrigerator door into four distinct areas and applied our products per manufacturer instructions.</p>
<p>Once again, Iron Out &#8211; Rust Stain Remover Spray Gel performed the best, bringing back a nice shiny surface and removing the water stains almost entirely. CLR &#8211; Calcium Lime Rust Remover also did an excellent job polishing out the water stains.</p>
<p>We then checked back in 48 hours to see if there was any “ghosting” or residual markings where the original stains had occurred. The presence of such marks would suggest that the rust-removal products had worked topically but had not penetrated the surface. Very little ghosting was evident from the sections treated with Iron Out and CLR. Star &#8211; Brite and Innosoft also worked fairly well on the refrigerator but did not quite restore the shine as much as the other two products.</p>

<p>We were delighted to find that one of the spray products performed very well across the board. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0044F9Q52/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Iron Out &#8211; Stain Remover</a> proved the best for a variety of surfaces, and it was particularly impressive at restoring our vintage chair’s chrome legs to almost showroom condition. It also quickly removed water stains from the door of our stainless steel refrigerator.</p>
<p>Iron Out’s packaging states that it’s specialized for bathroom, kitchen, carpet and fabric stains, along with chrome and other surfaces. Combined with its stellar performance on chrome, we liked how Iron Out readily applies as a spray and wipes off after only a minute or two. With nearly 1,000 positive Amazon reviews, we were not alone in thinking that Iron Out is an excellent choice for a household rust remover.</p>
<p>With Iron Out, you get the best features of all our rust removers: simple application, speedy results and the versatility to treat different surface types. Since it is a spray gel, Iron Out is simple to apply to vertical surfaces, and does not drip excessively.</p>

It's also one of the most affordable removers in our lineup.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0044F9Q52/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>One slightly tricky thing about Iron Out is that the product instructions recommend wiping it off after a few seconds. In our experience, an application of between 60-90 seconds was optimal. It also helps to use a bit of elbow grease to achieve the best results. We obtained good results using it to remove rust stains on the front of a stainless steel refrigerator door, but we had to scrub vigorously and then leave the product applied for a minute or so.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Iron Out sprayed on easily with very little overspray, and it was easy to wipe clean.</li>
<li>It yielded positive results in a matter of minutes, as compared to some other products that require hours of treatment.</li>
<li>Iron Out produces very little odor.</li>
<li>We got spectacular results on the rusted chrome legs of a vintage chair.</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing to look out for with rust products is the manufacturer’s recommended uses. The word “rust” tends to be applied to a broad range of surfaces besides metal, including some surprising materials like fabric. We appreciated <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U0GIKQU/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CLR &#8211; Calcium Lime Rust Remover</a> quite a bit, as it comes in liquid form and can be diluted to the appropriate strength as required by the job.</p>
<p>It is recommended that CLR be diluted with 50-percent water, but it can be used full strength on more stubborn stains. For our tests, we used CLR at full strength. CLR proved a consistent performer. It worked best on nuts and bolts and shined up the front of our stainless steel refrigerator nearly as well as our top pick Iron Out &#8211; Stain Remover.</p>
<p>CLR is a product that is more appropriate for surface rust stains like those found inside toilet bowls, tile grout and the calcium deposits found on shower heads and faucets. We liked that it can be used full strength for items like nuts and bolts, but can also be diluted into a more household cleaner for appliances like the refrigerator we tested.</p>

<p>Another thing we like about CLR is that it is an EPA Safer Choice product, plus it has a pleasant citrus-like odor. CLR comes in liquid form and is packaged in a plastic jug. You need to transfer it to another container like a small plastic tub if you plan to dilute it, or to apply it to a surface like a shower head. If you use it full strength, you can simply use a sponge or rag and hold it to the mouth of the jug; but in our experience CLR works best when the item can be fully submerged.</p>
<p>Like all of our tested products, CLR was easy to clean up with paper towels or a sponge, and it left little or no residue.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>CLR &#8211; Calcium Lime Rust Remover is Intended for rust stains on metal, concrete and other household surfaces.</li>
<li>CLR can be applied either by submersion or surface application.</li>
<li>You will typically want to dilute with water for ordinary stains, but it can also be applied full strength for tougher, hard-to-get-out stains.</li>
<li>It does not contain oxalic acid or other harsh chemicals, and we found it to have a pleasant citrus odor.</li>
<li>CLR is an EPA Safer Choice product.</li>

<h3>Aceros &#8211; Innosoft B570</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JG0HDLO/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aceros &#8211; Innosoft B570</a> is something of a strange product. Touted as an “organic” rust remover, it contains sodium alkyl sulfonate, which can cause serious eye damage. In that sense, the “organic” label is misleading in that it suggests the product cannot be harmful.</p>
<p>Innosoft B570 is fairly simple to apply, but the surface should be horizontal since the gel can run down in a goopy mess if you’re not careful. For the more heavily rusted products we tested, such as our garden tools, Innosoft B570 didn’t quite have enough oomph to effect any change with a single application.</p>
<h3>Evapo-Rust &#8211; Super Safe Rust Remover</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M0TLQ66/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Evapo-Rust &#8211; Super Safe Rust Remover</a> is touted as an “amazing rust eliminator,” but it was just an average performer in our group, working best on our rusted weeding tool. It works best on items that can soak for the recommended one-to-twelve hours. On the plus side, Evapo-Rust is nontoxic, biodegradable and does not contain any acids.</p>
<h3>Star brite &#8211; Rust Stain Remover</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000AY4QY/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Star brite &#8211; Rust Stain Remover</a> is closer to an overall household cleaning product than a specialized rust remover. One of its principal uses is for cleaning fiberglass surfaces such as boats. In our testing, it worked decently on nuts and bolts and also performed fairly well at removing rust from our teapot. Star brite is a spray-on rust remover. While we did not have the chance to test Star brite on a boat, it is frequently mentioned in public forums as an effective boat cleaner.</p>
<h3>WD-40 &#8211; Specialist Rust Release Penetrant Spray</h3>
<p>WD-40 is a familiar brand to many people for its household lubricant spray. We tested its sister product <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00631GQGW/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WD-40 &#8211; Specialist Rust Release Penetrant Spray</a> and loved how it can be applied in very tight spots. It worked incredibly well to stop a garage door from squeaking, and it aptly cleaned up our nuts and bolts. The drawback of this WD-40 product is that it cannot be conveniently applied to large rust patches or to irregular surfaces like teakettles.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to supplement a general purpose rust remover with a product that specializes in loosening rusted nuts and bolts and eliminating squeaky hinges, then we highly recommend WD-40 &#8211; Specialist Rust Release Penetrant Spray.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>An easy-to-use, nontoxic rust remover is a great item to have around the house to help with everything from unsticking locks, to improving the appearance of tools and equipment, to restoring metal and other surfaces to almost new condition. We tested six rust removers in gel, liquid and spray form to determine ease of application and effectiveness of results.</p>
<p>Our favorite overall product was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0044F9Q52/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Iron Out &#8211; Rust Stain Remover Spray Gel</a>, which worked extremely well on a rusty steel refrigerator door, a teakettle, as well as nuts and bolts. Another incredibly convenient product, WD-40 &#8211; Specialist Rust Release Penetrant Spray has a long nozzle designed to penetrate rusty tool parts and locks that need to be freed up. We think keeping both of these fairly inexpensive products around is a great idea.</p>
<p>The runner-up was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U0GIKQU/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CLR &#8211; Calcium Lime Rust Remover</a>, which is effective on a variety of surfaces. However, as a liquid, CLR can be more difficult to apply than a spray, gel or spray gel, especially to vertical surfaces where it will drip down.</p>

<p>We embarked on an epic research mission to uncover a broader understanding of features and characteristics most desired by the average consumer. Invaluable resources like The Wirecutter and Consumer Resorts served as springboards that inspired and guided our own choices. User reviews on Amazon and forums like Reddit&#8217;s /r/ToiletPaper gave voice to public opinions on trends and preferences. We surveyed these voices and resources into usable statistics that comprised the foundation of our testing development and criteria. The result was a stalwart top eight that best represents today’s biggest players along with notable alternative newcomers.</p>
<p>Factors like budget and environmentalism were commonly noted to affect buying habits. In order to understand consumer preferences, we researched toilet paper construction, different types of paper sources and general information to understand the ins and outs of toilet paper.</p>
<p>We found that the most popular and requested features were softness, septic breakdown, strength and lack of residual lint. A team of “experts” used each roll to completion and completed blind surveys. Our aim was to grasp general patterns of user preferences without branding bias. We combined our lab tests and surveys to create a point system to determine their ranking order. Here are the results!</p>

<h2 class="collapse">History of toilet paper</h2>
<p>Modern toilet paper as it is known today was invented in 1857 by American Joseph Gayetty, hitting the market at 50 cents for a pack of 500 sheets. The pack of stacked tissues evolved into a roll around 1883 when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet_paper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first patents for roll-based dispensers</a> were filed. China invented paper around 25 AD and were also the first to mass produce paper specifically for bathroom use as early as the 14th century. The rest of the world took about 1,300 years to catch up!</p>
<p>Before toilet paper, each great society had their own method of wiping in the loo. In some places, only the rich could afford the luxury of using soft materials like wool, lace or hemp. For others, using one’s hand to wipe was not unusual. When and where you lived determined the types of materials available for this dirty duty (pun intended!).</p>
<p>Materials ranged from plants like grass, leaves, hay and moss to more unimaginable things like wood chips, stones, seashells, corncobs and fruit skins. Anything handy and disposable seemed a worthy candidate. Ancient Romans famously used a relatively sophisticated sponge on a stick, stored and disinfected in vinegar after each use. Ancient Jewish societies reportedly kept small bags of pebbles, dry grass and or smooth pieces of broken pottery expressly for wiping.</p>
<p>It must have come as quite a relief when paper finally became the world’s standard. With it came a groundbreaking advancement in wiping: absorbency!</p>
<h2 class="collapse">How is toilet paper made?</h2>
<p>Toilet paper is predominantly made of trees and water along with whiteners, fiber-extracting chemicals and possibly other undisclosed chemicals used for processing. Factories receive reams of recycled or “virgin” paper as raw material that is then processed and packaged for retail.</p>
<p>Toilet papers look nearly indistinguishable from one another. That long roll of perforated white sheets wrapped around a cardboard core hasn’t changed much since the fifties, when <a href="http://historysdumpster.blogspot.com/2012/08/coloured-toilet-paper.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">colored toilet papers were all the rage</a>. Give them a closer look and feel and subtle differences come to light. Give them a wipe and the differences become even clearer. Each company has a signature design or texture, not only for aesthetics but for function as well.</p>
<p>Georgia-Pacific, the makers of Angelsoft and Quilted Northern, describes a method called “<a href="http://encyclopedia.toiletpaperworld.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creping</a>” to soften, strengthen and fluff their toilet paper. While the paper is drying on a large cylinder, a large metal blade scrapes the surface to create the “creping.” We found this method was common with other companies as well.</p>
<p>Kimberly-Clark, the makers of Cottonelle and Scott products, boasts about their signature ripple texture and claims it cleans more effectively. They use a patented technology that dries paper without embossing or compressing it, allowing the paper to retain its ripples when wet.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-7269 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tp-perforation-test2.jpg" alt="tp perforation test" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tp-perforation-test2.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tp-perforation-test2-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tp-perforation-test2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tp-perforation-test2-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tp-perforation-test2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tp-perforation-test2-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tp-perforation-test2-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tp-perforation-test2-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tp-perforation-test2-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tp-perforation-test2-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tp-perforation-test2-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tp-perforation-test2-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Recycled toilet paper continues to be an alternative choice that is not as prevalent as conventional virgin-sourced toilet paper. Among our Top 8, only one roll represents the recycled paper camp: Seventh Generation Natural Bathroom Tissue. This ratio is roughly representative of its availability in mainstream stores. Technological advances as of late have elevated recycled paper options from brown paper bag drags of the past into very comparable and soft rolls. We here at Your Best Digs think that recycled toilet paper deserves another look.</p>
<p><strong>New pulp paper</strong> is commonly called “virgin” paper since it comes from brand new lumber. For toilet paper, the <a href="http://www.madehow.com/Volume-6/Toilet-Paper.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blend is typically 70% hardwood and 30% softwood</a>. Softwoods like Southern Pine and Douglas Fir have longer fibers that provide more strength while the shorter fibers of hardwoods like Gum, Maple and Oak provide softness.</p>
<p>Lumber plants first <a href="http://www.madehow.com/Volume-6/Toilet-Paper.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">de-bark and cut the pieces down</a>. These wood chips then get mixed with “cooking chemicals” which turns into what is known as a “slurry.” A giant pressure cooker then cooks the slurry, which evaporates the liquids. A portion of the mixture turns into usable pulp, which is then washed of the cooking chemicals. The rest is dirty fluid ominously called “black liquor.”</p>
<p>The cleaned pulp goes to a bleaching plant where it undergoes multistage chemical processing to ensure the paper ends up as white as can be. To become paper stock, the pulp is mixed with a whole lot of water (99.5% to .05% fiber), then it is dried, matted and rolled onto giant heated cylinders. From there, each company diverges in their methods to crepe, stamp and or emboss to their completed product.</p>
<p><strong>Recycled paper</strong> used for toilet paper comes from white and colored stock collected in the recycling bin (with staples and pins removed of course). It gets “cooked” in a large vat called a “pulper” along with water and detergents until it turns into a slurry. After a washing process to remove coatings and inks, the recycled pulp undergoes a bleaching and sanitizing process using oxygen-derived bleaches like peroxide.</p>
<p>This is an important distinction from regular toilet paper, which uses a much more toxic and environmentally damaging chemical: chloride dioxide. After this processing, the rest of the procedure is the same as regular toilet paper.</p>
<h3>Recycled paper</h3>
<ul>
<li>Saves new trees from being used</li>
<li>Much safer oxygen-based chloride compounds used for bleach</li>
<li>Trace amounts of BPA found passed down from recycled paper stock</li>
<li>Uses 64% less energy to produce</li>
<li>Uses 50% less water to produce</li>
<li>Creates 74% less air pollution</li>
</ul>
<h3>Virgin paper</h3>
<ul>
<li>Some believe paper is softer, fluffier and whiter</li>
<li>Bleaching process releases carcinogenic dioxins to the environment</li>
<li>54 million trees are cut down every year for toilet paper</li>
</ul>

<p>The chlorine dioxide bleach used to process virgin-paper varieties is notoriously harmful to the environment, <a href="http://www.npi.gov.au/resource/chlorine-dioxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranking in the top 10% of hazardous compounds in the US</a>. While there are countless articles about the toxicity of chlorine in virgin paper products, we could not find an exact figure for how much of it is left in the final product.</p>
<p>Many health-minded blogs condemn using virgin-paper-pulp toilet papers, citing skin irritation and allergies. Because of the lack of citations, we consider these claims to be possibilities and not hard facts.</p>
<p>More testing needs to be done. One possible reason for the lack of information may be that the companies find ways around them. One study we found on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2860827/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chronic vulvar irritation</a> states that paper and other cosmetic tissue companies, “[refuse] to provide consumer information, claiming proprietary rights to trade secrets.” Through literature review, they further claim the fluffier and whiter a cosmetic tissue is, the more likely it contains formaldehyde, another toxic chemical monitored by consumer health watchdogs.</p>
<p>Again, we couldn’t find any formal statements about formaldehyde-urea resins or newer PAE compounds that release by-products <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27598381" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like MCPDs</a>. <a href="https://solenis.com/en/destination/history-kymene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solenis</a> explains in technical detail the development of “wet strength resin” used in the papermaking process to strengthen wet paper, and it seems clear that <a href="http://www.tissueworldmagazine.com/technical-theme/high-efficiency-wet-strength-resin-technology-breakthrough/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PAE has replaced formaldehyde-urea</a> as the resin of choice, but that just means there are new byproducts to be monitored.</p>
<p>It is troubling that manufacturers do not have to disclose the “ingredients” they use, leaving us scratching our heads. The lack of hard evidence on long term effects on health is confusing and potentially misleading in both directions: We can&#8217;t say that you&#8217;ll get irritated skin from one brand based on the label, but we can&#8217;t really tell which brands are less likely to cause it, either.</p>
<p>What is irrefutable is the deforestation and toxic waste that results in the manufacturing of virgin paper. <a href="http://encyclopedia.toiletpaperworld.com/toilet-paper-history/toilet-paper-and-the-environment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to the EPA</a>, if everyone in the US swapped one single roll of regular TP for recycled, the US would save 470,000 trees, 1.2 million cubic feet of landfill space and 169 million gallons of water. In addition, the chlorine dioxide bleaches used for virgin papers are far more toxic, releasing carcinogenic dioxins into the environment, known as one of the most toxic chemicals in the world.</p>
<p>For more environmental-friendly bleaching processes, look for the following labels.</p>
<h3>“Safer” bleaching chemicals:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>TCF</strong> (Totally Chlorine-Free) &#8211; Non-recycled stock bleached with oxygen, ozone or hydrogen peroxide</li>
<li><strong>PCF</strong> (Processed Chlorine-Free) &#8211; Recycled stock bleached with oxygen, ozone or hydrogen peroxide</li>
<li><strong>ECF</strong> (Elemental Chlorine-Free) &#8211; Stock bleached with chlorine dioxide instead of chlorine gas. An improvement over chlorine gas, but still produces dioxins.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Other labels to consider:</h3>
<ol>
<li>“<strong>Chlorine Free</strong>” &#8211; <a href="https://www.rodalesorganiclife.com/home/should-you-be-worried-about-chemical-exposure-from-your-toilet-paper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rodale’s Organic Life</a> warns us that this is an empty label and likely means that the paper is <strong>PCF</strong>, or more likely <strong>ECF</strong>. Just because chlorine gas wasn’t used in processing, doesn’t mean it is free of chlorine derivatives.</li>
<li><strong>FSC Certified</strong> &#8211; Forest Stewardship Council certifies that toilet paper is made from “<a href="https://us.fsc.org/en-us/certification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responsibly managed forests that provide environmental, social and economic benefits</a>.”</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="collapse">BPA and recycled paper</h2>
<p>While choosing recycled toilet paper may be the more eco-friendly choice, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21939283" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research</a> has shown that it contains trace amounts of BPA (along with just about any other paper and hygiene product made from recycled paper). It’s not in the processing or manufacturing of toilet paper, but from the source itself. The culprit is thermal paper &#8212; receipts, lottery tickets, luggage tags, shipping labels &#8212; that we throw into the recycling bin which ends up in the recycled stock.</p>
<p>Thermal paper is coated with a dye and developer that “prints” without ink. The BPA in the developer gets mashed and mixed together with other paper sources to form the tainted recycled pulp that is processed into new products.</p>
<p>Before you forgo all paper products, many experts tell us not to be alarmed, as we <a href="http://www.rodalesorganiclife.com/food/if-you-use-plastic-or-canned-goods-your-pee-contains-dangerous-chemical" target="_blank" rel="noopener">absorb far more BPA from handling plastic and aluminum food containers</a>. They claim that the risk to exposure with toilet paper is miniscule, at just a few micrograms per gram. Compare that to handling thermal receipts which contain a <em>milligram</em> of BPA per gram &#8212; that’s one thousand times a microgram!</p>
<h3>Benefits of using recycled toilet paper:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Uses oxygen, ozone, sodium hydroxide or peroxide to bleach, instead of harmful chlorine gas or chlorine dioxide which creates carcinogenic dioxins</li>
<li>Recycled toilet paper takes a lot less water to produce</li>
<li>Makes use of waste paper that would have otherwise been dumped or incinerated</li>
<li>According to the EPA, if everyone in the US swapped one single roll of regular TP for recycled TP, the US would save 470,000 trees, 1.2 million cubic feet of landfill space and 169 million gallons of water</li>
</ul>
<p>If softness is the main reason holding you back, fear not: <a href="http://encyclopedia.toiletpaperworld.com/toilet-paper-history/toilet-paper-and-the-environment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Toilet Paper Encyclopedia</a> says that due to technological advances, some brands of recycled toilet papers can be just as soft as regular toilet paper. Indeed, we found that Seventh Generation Natural Bathroom Tissue performed better in softness than expected at just a half point below Angel Soft.</p>
<h2 class="collapse">Is ‘cheaper’ better for the environment?</h2>
<p>Toilet-paper brand Marcal, known as an inexpensive budget brand, rebranded in 2010 to let everyone know that they have always been eco-friendly. They source paper from the “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/business/media/13adco.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">urban jungle” of New York’s recycling program</a>. Though being low-budget and environmentally friendly may have been a coincidence, we welcome it; however, it may or may not come at the cost of softness.</p>
<p>It’s good to know that there is one just cause for the rough, thin stuff found in public restrooms. 60% of them use cheaper, recycled toilet paper. Though undoubtedly stocked for the savings, we’re happy that it’s not all for naught.</p>
<h2 class="collapse">Chemical conclusion</h2>
<p>In 2009, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/26/science/earth/26charmin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times decried</a> US’s obsession with soft toilet paper, “exotic confections that are silken, thick and hot-air-fluffed,” as being partly responsible for the deforestation in North and South America, including “a percentage of rare old-growth forests in Canada.” With a mysterious cloud masking true, hard facts about manufacturing and chemicals, it’s easy to overlook the problem, or even know that one that exists. To be honest, it never crossed our minds until we discovered it in our research.</p>
<p>While it remains unclear whether or not direct contact is harmful, it is indisputable that the byproducts emitted by manufactures using chemicals like chlorine and formaldehyde are harmful to people and the environment. Depending on your personal stance on environmental issues, this may or may not affect which toilet paper you choose to take home.</p>
<h3>Different types of paper sources</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>New paper pulp:</strong> “Virgin” paper stock made of newly cut trees.</li>
<li><strong>Recycled pulp:</strong> A blend of post-consumer recycled paper stock. <a href="http://www.worldwatch.org/node/6403" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uses 50% less water</a> than regular toilet paper production.</li>
<li><strong>Bamboo:</strong> “Treeless” alternative that is sustainable and renewable. <a href="http://trueearthpaper.com/faqs-about-our-bamboo-and-the-products-that-use-them/#toggle-id-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uses 80% less water</a> than regular toilet paper production.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="collapse" id="new-alternative">New toilet paper alternative on the block: bamboo</h2>
<p>Bamboo is still an unfamiliar resource for many people, though consumers can already find it in a variety of things, from wood flooring, furniture and clothing to paper. Hardwood trees take decades to mature while bamboo only takes three to six years, which makes it a great candidate for disposable paper products like toilet paper.</p>
<p>It can take a century to regrow a forest, while bamboo regrows as soon as it’s harvested because it’s a grass, not a tree. In our line up, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CRFC6DY/?tag=ybdtp-20">Silk’n Soft Bamboo</a> is our top pick for eco-conscious consumers. Boasting a low carbon footprint, bamboo grows without herbicides, pesticides or fertilizers. As far as performance, Silk’n Soft Bamboo is comparable to virgin lumber-sourced Kirkland Signature in comfort, softness and strength.</p>
<p>To achieve the same white color as other toilet papers, bamboo requires the same type of bleach as virgin-paper stock (the more harmful chloride type). Silk’n Soft uses the ECP bleaching process (less dioxins than chloride gas), but claims that it&#8217;s used in conjunction with a “closed loop system” that treats wastewater and renders their process “nearly free of all dioxins”.</p>
<p>The Best Eco-Conscious Toilet Paper: Silk&#8217;n Soft uses fast-growing bamboo, a much more sustainable choice for paper production. This three-ply alternative scored an impressive 3.8 average score in our User Test Surveys, only second to Cottonelle. About $1.33 per rolls (five cents per square foot).</p>

<p><strong>Check the source:</strong> Look for recycled sources. The higher the post-consumer percentage of recycled stock, the more eco-friendly. This could come at the cost of softness, though there have been many technological improvements that have closed the gap. Bamboo is a good choice as it is highly sustainable and can be as soft as regular toilet paper.</p>
<p><strong>How is it bleached?:</strong> Say no to products bleached with chloride gas, which produces the greatest amount of hazardous dioxins, one of the most dangerous pollutants in the world. ECF (Elemental Chlorine-Free) emits 90% less dioxins, but is still not perfect. Recycled papers use much safer oxygen-based bleaching agents.</p>
<p><strong>BPA, Dioxins, Formaldehyde?:</strong> The truth is all toilet paper contains trace amounts of harmful chemicals due to processing. However, some are worse than others. Recycled paper products contain trace amounts of BPA, though handling paper receipts will expose you to one thousand times more BPA. Experts still endorse recycled toilet paper over virgin toilet paper, which releases highly toxic dioxins into the environment due to its bleaching process.</p>
<p><strong>Is it FSC Certified?:</strong> If you prefer regular toilet paper from virgin paper sources, look for a stamp of approval from the Forest Stewardship Council. They uphold strict standards to ensure that manufacturing is socially and environmentally responsible. This certification may increase cost up to 20%, though in our line-up, the only FSC-Certified brand is budget-friendly <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IJVUM32/?tag=ybdtp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scott &#8211; 1000</a>.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>To avoid bias with brand names, we conducted blind tests. Recycled or bamboo toilet papers were not identified in any way and scores relied purely on performance.</p>
<p>We split our testing into two main components: Lab Tests and User Test Surveys. Lab tests consist of objective measurements and grading to test for physical quality of each brand. Our surveyors took the rolls into real life testing, collecting a swath of subjective scores from our panel.</p>

<p>We took the following measurements for each roll: weight of 25 sheets, thickness of 25 sheets, width of a single sheet, length of 25 sheets and area of 25 sheets. These measurements allowed us to calculate cost per square foot and give us an overall sense of value per dollar.</p>

<h3>Durability / lint test</h3>
<p>To test for dry lint, we used a textured object and applied a swiping pressure to a rolled bunch of 25 sheets. The wet lint test was the same except we began by spraying the toilet paper with equal amounts of water. We awarded scores by visual inspection of the damage.</p>
<h3>Sheet transparency (fiber density)</h3>
<p>We graded each brand on the opacity of a single sheet, which gave us an indication of the denseness of fibers.</p>
<h3>Wet strength test</h3>
<p>Strength of toilet paper is a key measurement when comparing brands. The trick is to achieve both softness and strength while wet. To test, we attached a sheet to a plastic cup, sprayed the paper with water, placed pennies in the center of the sheet and counted how many would remain until breaking through.</p>
<h3>Water absorption test</h3>
<p>To measure how much water each brand could absorb, we dunked three sheets of each into water for 30 seconds before measuring its weight. The heavier the weight, the more absorbent the paper.</p>
<h3>Softness test</h3>
<p>Softness is of the most important factors consumers take into account when choosing a brand. We graded for softness on a scale of one to five through direct touch.</p>
<h3>Perforation test</h3>
<p>A more obscure factor, quality of perforation can make the difference between a speedy or frustrating experience. We tested perforation by tearing the sheets apart and grading the ease on a scale of one to five.</p>
<h3>Breakdown test</h3>

<p>A test spanning 24 hours checked the disintegration of each brand. We submerged one sheet of each brand into plastic cups, stirred and graded breakdown at these different time marks: two, 12 and 24 hours. These test results should be of special interest to those with sensitive septic tanks. The harder to break down, the more likely clogs will occur.</p>

<h2 class="collapse">User test surveys</h2>
<p>Our panel of testers used each brand for a week or until the roll ran out. Each brand was numbered without packaging to avoid bias. Our panel graded each criteria on a scale of one to five, with one as unfavorable and five as favorable. They tested each roll in the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Softness / comfort:</strong> A culmination of several factors like thickness, tactile softness, airiness.</li>
<li><strong>Strength:</strong> How well did the paper held up to wiping? Did it fall apart?</li>
<li><strong>Lint / breakage:</strong> Pilling, rolling, or linty residue brings the score down.</li>
<li><strong>Perforation:</strong> How easily do the sheets tear?</li>
<li><strong>Absorbency:</strong> How much can it absorb? Better absorbency means less sheets necessary and ultimately a better value.</li>
<li><strong>Value:</strong> Do you feel like you’re getting a good deal? Anything from roll size, sheer size to absorbency may affect your perceived value.</li>
<li><strong>Enjoyability:</strong> Lastly, another subjective question meant to gauge general satisfaction of their experience using each brand.</li>
</ul>
<p>The crowd favorite is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AFRSQGW/?tag=ybdtp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cottonelle &#8211; Ultra ComfortCare</a> with a total average score of 4.2.

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AFRSQGW/?tag=ybdtp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cottonelle</a> takes the crown, narrowly beating runner-ups Quilted Northern and Charmin &#8211; Ultra Strong when we combined both lab tests and user surveys. Cottonelle &#8211; Ultra ComfortCare tied with Quilted Northern Ultra Plush in multiple categories like wet strength, absorption, dry lint and width, but user surveys pushed the final score over the top. Even though Quilted Northern beat Cottonelle in the lab tests, the lead in our user surveys tipped the scales in Cottonelle’s favor.</p>
<p>In our user surveys, grades in strength and impression of quality outweighed softness. This goes to show that strength may be as important, if not more so, than softness. Maybe there’s something to Cottonelle’s claim that their signature ripple texture “cleans better” after all. The deeper grooves potentially hold and trap more. The horizontal banding is more pronounced than third place contenders Charmin &#8211; Ultra Strong, adding to the effect of fluffiness with deeper pockets.</p>

<p>Its slightly elastic feel is also unique, a quality that makes the paper feel extra strong. It lends a paper towel-like feel, thicker and more robust than the other brands. When placed side by side, Cottonelle stands out as the hardiest of the bunch, a quality that our testers prefered.</p>
<p>Some testers claimed to be able to identify Cottonelle from its signature patterning. We neither confirmed nor denied their suspicions until after we revealed the results. It is interesting to note power of brand recognition and how it may have affected an unintentional bias in our blind testing. Cottonelle’s paper indeed stands out from the rest in terms of look and feel and we think it’s possible that this aspect alone could inspire subconscious confidence in the brand, or at least make a more memorable impression.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cottonelle &#8211; Ultra ComfortCare scored highest in user test surveys</li>
<li>A slightly elastic quality gives Cottonelle a paper towel-like feel</li>
<li>Distinctive ripple pattern gives a sense of strength and extra clean</li>

<p>In our testing, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DBKRWWY/?tag=ybdtp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Quilted Northern &#8211; Ultra Plush</a> triumphed as the softest and plushest of toilet papers and therefore wins as our pick for the most luxurious roll. This one is for those who pull out all the stops for ultimate softness, regardless of strength and price. Though Charmin Ultra Strong beat Quilted Northern in the user survey, our technical tests gave Quilted Northern a slight advantage in total score.</p>
<p>The embossed design of Quilted Northern is mottled, dimensional and finely executed. It not only looks like the nicest, it feels like it too. The fluff factor is high, and the toilet paper feels silky to the touch. Air pockets between its indulgent three plies give the roll a pleasant pushback when squeezed.</p>

It doesn’t skimp on size, number of plies or softness. </p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DBKRWWY/?tag=ybdtp-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>The entire roll has a pillowy feel. If we had to choose a toilet paper to sleep on, this would be our pick, hands down. If we ran out of facial tissue, we would reach for this roll first for blowing noses.</p>
<p>As one would expect from a softer tissue, the breakage and lint factor is higher which explains some point loss in our tester surveys. Quilted Northern just may be too delicate for more aggressive wiping techniques, working better for those with a lighter, dabbing method. In addition, users may need more sheets to compensate for linting, even though it scores very high in absorption. However, there is nothing more luxurious than excess.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quilted Northern &#8211; Ultra Plush is the softest toilet paper of all those tested</li>
<li>The delicate silky touch may be suited to those who wipe with a lighter touch</li>
<li>Its softness makes it the best stand-in for facial tissue</li>
</ul>

<p>We were surprised to find that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CRFC6DY/?tag=ybdtp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silk&#8217;n Soft</a> performed quite well for an “alternative” toilet paper. In a blind test, we were unable to tell which was made of bamboo. The biggest difference was that the perforation was tougher than the rest. Matching Quilted Northern’s three-plies, it was surprisingly soft for how hardy it was.</p>
<p>In terms of strength, it was only second to Cottonelle and Quilted Northern (both tied for first). It was also the second most opaque roll just behind Quilted Northern, indicating dense fiber construction.</p>
<p>Because of its usage of highly renewable pulp in bamboo, this reasonably-priced roll was one of the most eco-friendly options of all our finalists. Choosing a bamboo-sourced toilet paper saves virgin trees from this highly-disposable fate. All from our list but Seventh Generation use virgin lumber stock. While Silk’n Soft uses the same ECF bleaching process as these virgin sources, it claims its “closed loop” processing minimizes dioxin emissions.</p>
<p>The biggest drawback of Silk&#8217;n Soft is that it performed the poorest in our Breakdown Test. As such, we recommend Seventh Generation Natural Bathroom Tissue as an eco-friendly alternative for those with sensitive septic tanks.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CRFC6DY/?tag=ybdtp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silk&#8217;n Soft</a> was second place in user test surveys, dispelling the idea that virgin paper alternatives are not as soft or comfortable</li>
<li>Bamboo is fast-growing, sustainable grass plant making it ideal for toilet paper manufacturing</li>
<li>As expensive as Charmin (at five cents a square foot), this three-ply roll feels weighty and strong</li>
<li>Not recommended for sensitive septic tanks as it scored among the worst in our breakdown test</li>
</ul>

<h3>Charmin &#8211; Ultra Strong</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0798C1NYR/?tag=ybdtp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charmin &#8211; Ultra Strong</a> came in second in our tester surveys, only a few points ahead of Quilted Northern. In our lab tests, it scored the highest average of both wet and dry lint tests, one of the most desired characteristics according to our testers. This continues the trend of our testers preferring strength over softness.</p>
<p>This roll has more of an industrial feel, a little more of a “starched” and compressed look. The embossed pattern appears sharp and uniform, the edges sturdy and crisp. It’s horizontally striated in waves, much lighter in depth than Cottonelle’s signature ripples. Overlapping circle patterns add a clean and uniform look. The texture is slightly more papery than Cottonelle and Quilted Northern, giving it a stronger impression overall.</p>
<p>Some Amazon reviewers note that the strength of paper results in less paper being used, equaling savings in the long run. Our lint and absorption tests corroborate this; however, it’s on the upper end in terms of cost at about five cents per square foot.</p>
<h3>Kirkland Signature (best value)</h3>
<p>A well-known and well-loved option for both budget and strength, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007Z8ZQQS/?tag=ybdtp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kirkland Signature</a> holds court in fifth place. It is Costco’s cash crop, the best selling item in the massive bulk-warehouse store. It’s reportedly well-researched and studied, scientifically-engineered and designed to sell, sell, sell! Indeed, they sell <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/the-costco-craze-inside-the-warehouse-giant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than a billion rolls per year</a>. It’s the perfect item to buy in bulk &#8212; who doesn’t want a seemingly infinite supply of toilet paper?</p>
<p>In line with their unspoken motto that “bigger is better and cheaper,” the Kirkland Signature toilet paper rolls are the biggest of all the other finalists at 11cm width. While virtually almost every other manufacturer has shrunken their rolls steadily over the years, Kirkland Signature has not.</p>
<p>Even though this roll costs only about two cents per square foot, it is the biggest and widest of the lot. It doesn’t excel in any category but does everything reasonably well. An overall good value, coming in massive 30-roll packages, we expect Costco to hold onto this position.</p>
<h3>Angel Soft</h3>
<p>We would plant <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FFJ2LXU/?tag=ybdtp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Angel Soft</a> brand toilet paper firmly as a middle of the road brand. It received very average scores in almost all categories. The embossed texture looks sparse and crude next to Quilted Northern.</p>
<p>Angel Soft is as cheap as Kirkland Signature at about two cents per square foot, we get the sense that Kirkland Signature is a better value. However, our scores show that they are actually pretty even.</p>
<h3>Seventh Generation</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FJWQ408/?tag=ybdtp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Seventh Generation</a> has been in the recycled-toilet-paper game since 1988. It’s the only roll in our lineup that uses recycled paper stock. However, in a blind test, we could hardly tell the difference between it and virgin toilet paper.</p>
<p>It scored only half a point below Angel Soft for comfort. Considering such a small margin, the payoff of saving trees and saving the environment from chloride bleach (and its resulting dioxins) is worth it in our eyes.</p>
<p>It is no less white in color than its virgin competitors, though it’s PCF (Processed Chlorine-Free) with oxygen based bleaches instead of the ultra-harmful chloride bleaches used for virgin paper processing. The latter releases carcinogenic dioxins into the environment, one of the most toxic chemicals on earth.</p>
<p>The danger of BPA in recycled toilet paper has been de-bunked by experts who cite that receipt paper is the real danger, containing a thousand times more BPA than toilet paper. In comparison, toilet paper contains only microns.</p>
<p>A shocking <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/feb/26/toilet-roll-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">98% of toilet paper in the United States uses virgin-paper pulp</a>, versus 60% in Latin America and Europe. To buck the trend and help relieve staggering deforestation, choosing recycled toilet paper is a good start.</p>
<p>Seventh Generation Natural Bathroom Tissue costs about $1.37 per roll (four cents per square foot).</p>
<h3>Scott &#8211; 1000 Sheets Per Roll</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IJVUM32/?tag=ybdtp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scott&#8217;s</a> single-ply roll seemed to be a bit of a novelty act, but really did last longer than the other rolls. The 1000 sheet count is more than double the second highest sheet count (Kirkland Signature at 425 sheets). In order to get enough thickness for wiping, many more rolls (or volume for gobbing into a ball) are necessary. This is a little more time consuming, but in general we did not find it to be too much of a nuisance.</p>
<p>Because it’s only one ply thick, Scott 1000 scored best in our Breakdown Test, breaking down almost immediately when in contact with water. As such, we recommend Scott 1000 for sensitive septic tanks and RVs.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it also scored the highest marks in the dry lint test. The wet lint test didn’t fare as well. The smooth face of the sheet along with the slight paper-like quality meant there was less to drag, until it was soaked with moisture.</p>
<p><strong>We were pleasantly surprised to find out that Scott 1000 is FSC-certified, meaning the manufacturing process is monitored for sustainable practices.</strong></p>
<p>While we didn’t find that the single-ply construction bad when we doubled or tripled the number of sheets per wipe, Scott 1000 is a bit of an eclectic choice amongst the competition. It definitely wins in value and eco-friendliness, but is resolutely off-trend when it comes to the luxury game.</p>
<p>We think that Scott 1000 may be geared more towards commercial uses &#8212; that single ply thinness feels hauntingly familiar. Despite having to take more time to gather more sheets for a wipe, Scott 1000 performs reasonably well. It’s just nowhere near luxury or hardy. For those eco-friendly consumers, Scott 1000 is the only roll in the lineup that is FSC certified &#8212; a big plus in our book.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>According to the Toilet Paper Encyclopedia, a whopping 84% of households prefer “premium” and “super premium” toilet papers. While more and more people concern themselves with environmental issues, the big brands still sell and rely of this preference for the softest stuff.</p>
<p>Our number one <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AFRSQGW/?tag=ybdtp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cottonelle &#8211; Ultra ComfortCare</a> sits comfortably on the throne as our pick for best overall toilet paper. With its signature ripple design, Cottonelle hits the sweet spot for both strength and softness. For those who prefer a softer and silkier touch, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DBKRWWY/?tag=ybdtp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Quilted Northern &#8211; Ultra Plush</a> is our pick for the most luxurious roll.</p>
<p>For eco-conscious consumers, many new brands now offer toilet paper made of sustainable and renewable bamboo. The National Resources Defense Council states that if every household replaced only one roll with one of recycled paper stock (or tree less options, like bamboo), we could save 423,900 trees. Our eco-friendly pick, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CRFC6DY/?tag=ybdtp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silk&#8217;n Soft</a> is a very robust three-ply option. The softness is on par with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FFJ2LXU/?tag=ybdtp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Angel Soft</a>, which is made of the much more environmentally-harmful virgin paper stock.</p>
<p>Toilet paper is by nature very <em>personal</em> and though we have done extensive research and systematic testing to determine our best picks, everyone has their own idea of toilet paper perfection.

				<description><![CDATA[With 60 hours of researching and testing, we pitted 14 soaps against each other to find that Dr. Bronner's - Sal Suds was the best dish soap for doing dishes by hand.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent nearly 60 hours between research and testing in search of the best dishwashing soap. We whittled down the list to 14 finalists and pitted them against each other to find that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00016QTYO/?tag=ybddish-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dr. Bronner’s &#8211; Sal Suds</a> is the best dish soap available. We found that it cut grease and baked-on foods with ease. The higher price tag is offset by the smaller amount needed to clean and its multiple household uses. For a more cost-efficient approach that’s still eco-friendly, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HAPEXLK/?tag=ybddish-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Puracy &#8211; Natural Dish Soap</a> is effective and scent-free.</p>

<h2 class="collapse" id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>Dishwashing soaps come in all varieties. So, in order to determine the best regular soap and the best eco-friendly soap, we first compiled a list of all of the most commonly-purchased dish soaps by looking at ratings and reviews on Amazon, Target and Walmart. By reading a lot of reviews, we found out what people liked or disliked, such as whether it was economical or sudsy enough or efficient or how it smells. We also read the reviews on the EWG site. More on that later.</p>
<p>Next, we researched and learned a bit about how dishwashing soap works so that we would understand and know what to test. Fortunately, there are a variety of online articles and blog posts about how to hand-wash dishes. <a href="http://cleanmyspace.com/10-handy-dish-washing-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Did you know you should wash your glassware first?</a></p>
<p>Through all of this research, we were able to reduce a large group of dishwashing soaps down to a manageable 14. Finally, we donned our rubber gloves and went to work individually testing each one. We looked at how effective and efficient the different brands are, along with their price and appeal.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="the-fourteen-best">Compare the best dish soaps</h2>
[table id=56 /]
<h2 class="collapse" id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Cleaning ability:</strong> Any detergent is going to cut oil and grease to a degree, but we wanted to make the test more difficult by looking at how well they cut both liquid and solid oils, as well as baked on food. In warm water (110 °F) with a teaspoon of liquid, we expect that oil and grease should dissolve and leave the dish squeaky clean. The soap should also remove dried on food without a lot of scrubbing effort.</p>
<p><strong>Environmentally and health friendly:</strong> As awareness grows, more consumers are looking for ways to reduce their personal impact on the environment. Detergents, like dishwashing soap, may have chemicals such as 1,4 dioxane and phosphates that are harmful to our water sources as well as our health. Consumers have also found that certain chemicals used in cleaning products are disruptive to their health, potentially causing asthma, skin reactions, reproductive issues and even cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals to the senses:</strong> Let’s face it — washing dishes is a chore. We might as well look for ways to make it more enjoyable. We looked at both smell and feel to provide a helpful guide. Personal taste determines whether these traits are pleasing, as some prefer a clear soap with no fragrance and others prefer something more stimulating to the senses.</p>
<p><strong>Cost per use:</strong> Lastly, all things being relatively equal, it comes down to price. These days, we all want to pinch a few pennies, so why pay more if you don’t have to? We calculated the cost per use as an additional testing metric.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="how-soap-works">How dishwashing soap works</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bubble-gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>It’s fairly well known that oil (which attracts dirt) and water don’t mix. So, manufacturers use what is known as surfactants to break up non-solubles, like oil and grease. Generally, that means either sodium lauryl ethyl sulfate (SLES) or sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). These work by solubilizing oils so that they can be rinsed away. More specifically, surfactants like SLES and SLE break up the oil into smaller drops that become water soluble.</p>
<p>A single soap molecule is hydrophobic on one end and hydrophilic on the other. The hydrophobic end repels water and attaches to the oil. The hydrophilic end attracts water. When soap is mixed with the oil in the water, it binds with the dirt and oil, separating it into small drops that are easily rinsed away.</p>
<p>We wanted to make sure we were washing dishes correctly, so we turned to howtocleanstuff.net for advice. When washing dishes, you should fill a sink with water as warm as you can tolerate, but not any hotter. Don’t add all the items to be washed as it will soil the water and could be dangerous if there are sharp items. With the dishes stacked to the side, you should wash the items that have touched your mouth first, starting with glasses.</p>
<p>But, don’t put your hand inside the glass as it could break. Wash in order of least soiled and rinse each item separately with hot water. If the water gets too dirty, don’t be afraid to change it. The most sanitary way to hand-wash dishes is to use the hottest water you can stand coupled with a clean, soapy sponge and then let them air dry.</p>
<h2 class="collapse">Hard vs. soft water</h2>
<p>Approximately 85% of households in the United States have what is known as “hard water.” Hard water is identified by the number of minerals in the water, specifically calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn). Having hard water can make it difficult to create soap suds and keep dish soap from doing its job. The minerals actually chemically interact with the surfactants in the soap, making it less effective.</p>
<p>If you aren’t sure whether you have hard or soft water, you can easily test it yourself using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DIJ0W30/?tag=ybddish-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">water test strips</a>. Be sure to test both the hot and the cold water since hot water heaters can produce minerals that lead to harder water. The water strip tests for hardness from 0 to 1,000 ppm (parts per million). The American Society of Agricultural Engineers and the Water Quality Association has a <a href="https://www.wqa.org/Learn-About-Water/Perceptible-Issues/Scale-Deposits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">degree of hardness standard</a> that will help you determine if and how you should treat your water.</p>
<h2 class="collapse">Washing dishes by hand may reduce allergens</h2>
<p>A study published in the Journal of Pediatrics suggests that families who wash dishes by hand are less susceptible to allergies than those who use dishwashers. There is increasing evidence that a little more exposure to germs can stimulate and benefit the immune system. This is called the “hygiene hypothesis” which speculates that the rise in childhood allergies may be the result of too little exposure to bacteria early in life.</p>
<p>A Swedish research team surveyed over 1,000 families in Sweden with children ages seven to eight. They found that only 23% of children whose parents used hand dishwashing had a history of asthma and eczema, compared to 38% of families who used dishwashers. Yet another good reason to continue washing dishes by hand.</p>

<p>Even with the invention of the dishwasher, people continue to wash many of their dishes by hand. Some may not own a dishwasher and others actually enjoy hand-washing. But there are actually some very sound reasons for washing dishes by hand.</p>
<p>According to Good Housekeeping, there are 13 kitchen items that shouldn’t ever be put in the dishwasher. The dishwasher can cause damage, not clean the item thoroughly or could harm the dishwasher itself.</p>
<h2 class="collapse">The EWG grade</h2>

<p>The EWG (<a href="http://www.ewg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Environmental Working Group)</a> is a non-profit, non-partisan organization working to help people live healthier lives in a healthier environment. Among other things, they research consumer products and rate them on their impact to human health and the environment.</p>
<p>They grade commonly used consumer products from A-F. They look at the ingredients to determine any chemicals known to cause skin irritations, asthma, cancer, developmental and reproductive toxicity and harm to the environment. We have included these grades in our scoring.</p>

<p>We gathered up our equipment for the testing. This included white ceramic plates, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IR3044/?tag=ybddish-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scotch-Brite sponges</a> (although we would have enjoyed the top pick in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-kitchen-cleaning-sponge/">kitchen sponge review</a>) a thermometer for testing the water and all of the bottles of dishwashing soap. Right away, we noticed that the “feel” or consistency across all of the dish soaps was nearly the same. We originally made the hypothesis that there would be some that were thinner than others. This proved not to be true. So, we removed that from our scoring.</p>
<h3>The senses test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6784 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/senses-test.jpg" alt="mini glass cups of soap for senses test" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/senses-test.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/senses-test-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/senses-test-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/senses-test-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/senses-test-300x200.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/senses-test-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/senses-test-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/senses-test-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/senses-test-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/senses-test-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We documented the color and fragrance of each dish soap. Adding color and fragrance generally means adding more chemicals. All dish soaps we tested were clear aside from Ajax (yellow), Palmolive (green) and Dawn Ultra (blue). We noticed Ajax uses what they refer to as a natural lemon fragrance, but we still aren’t sure about any added chemicals in that process as they aren’t listed.</p>
<p>Every consumer has their own preferences. Some prefer a soapy clean smell; others prefer a lighter touch or no scent or color at all. Therefore, we did not score these features, but instead, noted them during our testing as additional information.</p>
<h3>Suds Test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6785 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/suds-test.jpg" alt="hand holding soap bubbles for suds test" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/suds-test.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/suds-test-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/suds-test-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/suds-test-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/suds-test-300x200.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/suds-test-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/suds-test-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/suds-test-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/suds-test-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/suds-test-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We then filled a sink with two gallons of water at 110 °F. Next, we added a teaspoon of soap liquid and stirred it up with our hand to create bubbles. We noted the amount of foam created. Surprisingly, there was quite a difference between the different soap varieties. While this may turn out to be a personal preference, we did assign a score to each one. A score of one meant no suds, a score of three meant full sink coverage, but suds only a couple of inches deep. Meanwhile, a score of five meant dense, high suds, four inches high or more.</p>
<p>Dishwashing can take some time so we checked the lifespan of the suds to ensure they all lasted at least 20 minutes. Dishwashing soap suds will break down faster depending on the amount of food and grease introduced. However, no particular brand’s suds seemed to break down faster or slower than another.</p>
<h3>Olive oil test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6786" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/oil-test.jpg" alt="oily dishes for oil test" width="900" height="583" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/oil-test.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/oil-test-610x395.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/oil-test-768x497.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/oil-test-300x194.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/oil-test-295x191.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/oil-test-885x573.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/oil-test-360x233.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/oil-test-375x243.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/oil-test-414x268.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/oil-test-320x207.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>For our third test, we spread a tablespoon of olive oil onto a white plate and submerged it in the soapy water. We let it sit for three minutes without being scrubbed. Then we pulled it out, noting how effective (or ineffective) each soap brand was at removing the oil. Our test theory was that dishwashing soaps should bind with the oil and remove it without any need for scrubbing.</p>
<p>Olive oil is a fairly light oil that stays liquid at any temperature above 21 °F.  So it was a bit of a surprise that any dishwashing soap would struggle to remove the olive oil. However, we found that the worst dish soaps did nothing to dissolve it, leaving it on the plate nearly the same as when it went into the water. With the best dishwashing soaps, the oil slid off as we pulled the dish out of the water and the plates came out nearly squeaky clean.</p>
<h3>Burned-on food test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6787" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/burned-food-test.jpg" alt="plate with burned beans for burned food test" width="900" height="598" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/burned-food-test.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/burned-food-test-610x405.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/burned-food-test-768x510.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/burned-food-test-360x239.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/burned-food-test-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/burned-food-test-295x196.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/burned-food-test-885x588.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/burned-food-test-375x249.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/burned-food-test-414x275.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/burned-food-test-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>For the final test, we smeared a plate with a tablespoon of baked beans and baked it in the oven at 350 °F for 20 minutes, nearly burning the food onto the plate. Our test theory suggested that the burned-on food would require some scrubbing effort, requiring us to measure the amount of effort needed to thoroughly clean the plate.</p>
<p>We actually thought this would be quite the challenge, but most detergents handled it surprisingly well. After soaking for five minutes, most of the larger pieces of food came off on their own. After soaking for 10 minutes, it was quite easy to wipe the rest away. As we suspected, there were a few detergents that required a little more scrubbing with our Scotch-Brite sponge to get the plate clean. These are accounted for in the scores.</p>
<h3>Cost per ounce</h3>

<p>We went through each dishwashing soap and calculated the cost per ounce for the best price found at either Amazon, Target or Walmart. We found the range to be anywhere from $.05 to $.61 per ounce, so it really depends on the value of the features to the user. Be mindful that prices vary constantly and that this is just a general guide.</p>
<p>We found that some of these Amazon soaps require purchase through Pantry or require minimum purchases for them to even sell it to you, whereas you can get away with paying a shipping fee at Target or Walmart and buy smaller quantities at sometimes better prices.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Dr. Bronner&#8217;s &#8211; Sal Suds</h2>

<p>The EWG loves <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00016QTYO/?tag=ybddish-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dr. Bronner’s &#8211; Biodegradable Sal Suds</a> and we do too. The EWG gave it the highest rating of an A grade, with no impact to human health or the environment except for minor concerns about skin irritation and asthma. It does contain sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), coco-betaine and picea glauca leaf oil which are the only ingredients with a C grade. It contains Siberian fir oil which gives it its nice fragrance and only a B grade. The other five ingredients are all A grades. Overall, it looks like a saint when compared to C grade products, which are often combinations of ingredients with even worse grades.</p>
<p>Frankly, given it’s referred to as a biodegradable soap, we had our doubts about its potency. But Dr. Bronner’s delivered in nearly every category. It handled both oil and food stains like a champ. It has a fresh pine scent, likely due to the Siberian fir needle oil and spruce leaf oil. It didn’t foam as high as some of the other dish soaps but had enough foam to convince us it could do the job.</p>

<p>Cleaning dirty dishes is where it really shined. In the three-minute olive oil test, the oil slid right off the plate as we pulled it out of the sink. The plate hardly needed rinsing. And, in the baked-on food test, the food completely dissolved, falling off the plate as it was pulled from the water. The only unfortunate thing we could find is that your dishes will be done before you can read all the great and entertaining information on the label.</p>
<p>Apparently, washing dishes is not the only thing Dr. Bronner’s &#8211; Sal Suds is good for. It can also be used as laundry soap, an all-purpose spray cleaner, window washing spray and a vegetable wash. Because it is biodegradable, it is also the best multi-purpose soap to take camping or backpacking. Check out Lisa Bronner&#8217;s &#8220;Sal Suds Dilutions Cheat Sheet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although Dr. Bronner’s Sal Suds wins for best natural dishwashing soap, we wanted to award an honorable mention to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00016QTYO/?tag=ybddish-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Puracy&#8217;s natural dish soap</a>. Like Dr. Bronner’s, Puracy also scores an A grade from the Environmental Working Group (EWG). We really liked its light and natural-smelling fragrance and there are no colors added, meaning one less thing to harm the environment or trigger sensitivities.</p>

<p>It was an excellent degreaser, cutting the olive oil easily. It was moderate against stuck-on food, requiring just a slight bit of scrubbing.</p>
<p>Puracy Natural is a good choice for those with skin or lung sensitivities. It received a great score from the EWG in those areas. It’s also one of the least harmful to the environment, scoring well in its potential for aquatic toxicity. The satisfaction you get for its human safety and its low impact on the environment is well worth the extra cost.</p>

<p>We were able to find it for $.05 per ounce. Our average cost per ounce for all the dishwashing soaps we tested was $.21 and the highest price range was Dr. Bronner’s Sal Suds at $.61 per ounce.</p>
<p>Low cost was about the only honor we could give it, however. While it foams up nicely, it still required a bit more scrubbing to get the dishes clean, but eventually got the job done. It does have a nice yellow color and lemon scent that are quite pleasing. The scent comes from natural lemon extract, so it’s nice to know the great smell we liked is real. Reviewers on Amazon give it a 4.1 rating out of 5, so it shows many Ajax users are quite happy.</p>

<h3>Dawn &#8211; Platinum Power Clean</h3>
<p>We really liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UXT3HA8/?tag=ybddish-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dawn &#8211; Platinum Power Clean</a>. True to its reputation, it was a terrific grease cutter. In case you didn’t know, Dawn dishwashing soap is what they use to clean the oil from animals impacted by oil spills. It cuts the grease without harming the skin. Since it’s that tough on crude oil, we knew it would have no trouble with food — and we were right.</p>
<h3>J. R. Watkins</h3>
<p>Like Dawn, we also really liked <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MDR4NIE/?tag=ybddish-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">J. R. Watkins</a> for its ability to cut through grease. Though it doesn’t make a lot of suds, it sent grease sliding off the plate and cut stuck-on food with ease. It had a pleasant fragrance and is quite cost-effective. However, it only scored a C grade with EWG as it is said to contain chemicals that may impact those with skin or respiratory allergies, as well as ingredients known to be toxic to aquatic animals.</p>
<h3>Ecover</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00016QTYO/?tag=ybddish-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ecover &#8211; Naturally Derived Liquid Dish Soap</a> scored a B grade by EWG. It scored well with us too, likely because of the high EWG grade and its cleaning efficiency. Like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00016QTYO/?tag=ybddish-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Puracy</a>, it was a terrific degreaser and did fine on stuck-on food. There are no colors added but they did add a fragrance. It is supposed to smell like pink geranium. We weren’t sure what that was but we were certain it shouldn’t smell like rubbing alcohol, which it did. We must be onto something since EWG gave it a D grade for fragrance, saying it contains a certain chemical that are known allergens.</p>
<h3>Better Life</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00016QTYO/?tag=ybddish-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Better Life</a> is another reportedly eco-friendly dish washing soap. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find our version in the EWG database, so we gave it the points from a C grade. Other versions of Better Life however received A grades. Regardless, it still scored high with us. Like both Dawn and J. R. Watkins, it tested great for cutting grease and removing stuck-on food. True to its claim to be unscented, we could not detect a hint of fragrance.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Washing dishes by hand is not going to be completely replaced by the machine anytime soon. So, consumers should educate themselves to make sure they find the right balance of performance, pleasure, price and impact.</p>

<p><em>(Editor’s note: In 2019 our budget pick, the Shark &#8211; S3501, and another Shark product that we reviewed, the Shark &#8211; S3601 Pro, were discontinued. We contacted Shark and learned that they now sell only four steam mops: two high-end models and two budget models. We decided to test the new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075JT9HYP/?tag=ybdstm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; S1000A</a>, an affordable model that we have now selected as our new budget pick. We also tested another new steam mop that’s similar to the Shark, Light ‘n’ Easy, to see how it compared.)</em></p>
<h2 id="how-we-found">How we found products to test</h2>
<p>During our research phase, we read subreddits like /r/BuyItForLife/ and reviewed articles from cleaning experts to gather information on what features to look for in a steam mop. We also checked out blog reviews and YouTube videos. We narrowed down the field to 18 steam mops, then culled the list even further based on consumer reviews.</p>
<p>Our five finalists are all rated four stars or higher on Amazon.com, and each meet all or most of the criteria that we found to be the highest importance to consumers. We then put each of our finalists through a series of household tests to see how easy they were to use, and how well they performed.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5519" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steam.jpg" alt="steam coming out of a mop on hardwood floors" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steam.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steam-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steam-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steam-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steam-300x200.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steam-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steam-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steam-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steam-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steam-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Steam mops make it easy to clean and sanitize your hard floors, without the need for detergents that can contain hazardous chemicals. Since hard surfaces are porous, steam cleaning can penetrate the surface to remove embedded grime. The heat from the steam vapor loosens the physical bond between soils and the surface you are cleaning, meaning that you can remove dirt and dried food spills more effectively and without the elbow grease. Plus, you can ditch that cumbersome mop bucket.</p>
<p>At a high enough temperature, steam vapor can kill bacteria, dust mites and mold spores. While kitchen and bathroom floors may not be one of the top germ hot spots in your home (according to the <a href="http://www.nsf.org/consumer-resources/studies-articles/germ-studies/germiest-items-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Sanitation Foundation</a>’s 2011 germ study, your dish sponge and toothbrush holder are likelier culprits), floors can still harbor bacteria such as <em>Salmonella</em> and <em>E. coli</em> in lesser quantities, by contact with shoes or spills.</p>
<p>The steam mops we tested claimed to kill 99.9% of bacteria in sanitization studies. Although we didn’t perform a bacteria culture ourselves, it is true that heat above 212° F will kill most microorganisms. Sanitizing an area requires continuous steam for 10-15 seconds; you’ll want to check the user guide for specific instructions for your model.</p>
<p>Household bleach is an EPA-registered disinfectant often recommended for disinfecting by health professionals; however, the fumes can irritate the lungs and mucous membranes. With steam cleaning, you can sanitize without exposure to toxic chemicals, which is especially reassuring if you have young children or pets crawling around on your floor.</p>
<p>Steam mops also offer the benefit of using microfiber pads, which are able to capture more dirt and dust than a conventional mop, even before you use the steam function. A study completed by the <a href="https://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/2379" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of California Davis Medical Center</a> found that traditional wet mops only reduced 30% of the bacteria present before cleaning, while microfiber mops reduced 99% of the bacteria.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use">How to use a steam mop</h2>
<p>Steam mops can be used on ceramic tile, grout, sealed wood floors or linoleum flooring, but you should always check the care instructions from your flooring manufacturer to make sure you don’t accidentally void your warranty. Some types of flooring are sensitive to moisture and the <a href="http://www.nwfa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Wood Flooring Association</a> notes that “steam or excessive water may damage a wood floor.” Manufacturers such as Armstrong/Bruce Hardwood &amp; Laminate Flooring and Avaire Floating Porcelain Tile do not recommend steam mops, while LM Hardwood does recommend them. It’s best to check your warranty ahead of time to see what stance the manufacturer takes.</p>
<p>If you’ve used a wet/dry mop with a disposable pad, you’ll be comfortable transitioning to a steam mop. You attach a microfiber pad to the plastic head, fill the tank with water (most models recommend using distilled or filtered water to avoid mineral build up if you have hard water), and plug it in. Once it heats up, you can see the steam as you mop. As a general safety precaution, the user manuals recommend wearing closed-toe shoes to protect your feet.</p>
<p>Prior to cleaning, you should thoroughly sweep or vacuum your floors with <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">a vacuum we recommend</a>, and the microfiber pads should be cleaned and washed regularly. Some models come with carpet gliders, which can eliminate odors and freshen carpets, but do not remove stains. Multipurpose types have brushes and attachments to clean carpets.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-look">Important features to look for</h2>
<p><strong>Steam control:</strong> Some types of flooring may not be able to handle the high heat settings necessary for sanitization or deep cleaning. Whether a digital or dial control, being able to customize your settings means you can adjust the steam to accommodate the type of surface you are cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>Removable water tank:</strong> Not only is it easier to fill, it’s much easier to empty. This is important because you should always empty the water tank when the steam mop is not in use.</p>
<p><strong>Heats in under a minute:</strong> We all have busy lives, and no one wants to waste precious cleaning time waiting for a steam mop to heat up.</p>
<p><strong>Wide-angle swivel head:</strong> A mop with a swivel head allows you to clean hard-to-reach areas such as corners, under cupboards and along walls.</p>
<p><strong>Ready light indicator:</strong> This gives you a clear visual indication that the mop is ready to begin steaming.</p>
<p><strong>Empty light indicator:</strong> This shows you when the tank is empty, making for much less guesswork.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous steam:</strong> Most consumers purchase a steam mop because they want to decrease the amount of physical labor needed to get the job done, making a mop with continuous steam preferable to a unit that must be pumped in use.</p>
<p><strong>Multipurpose:</strong> Many steam mops can only be used on hard floors, but some are great multitaskers and take it up a notch with various attachments and brushes to clean carpets and other surfaces.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>We tested each product on linoleum flooring in the kitchen, bathroom and laundry/mud room. The multipurpose steam mops were also tested on short pile carpet and area rugs. Each steam mop was put through several rounds of general purpose mopping in the kitchen and bathroom, plus two specific performance tests:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5521" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/muddy-footprints.jpg" alt="two muddy footprints" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/muddy-footprints.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/muddy-footprints-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/muddy-footprints-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/muddy-footprints-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/muddy-footprints-300x200.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/muddy-footprints-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/muddy-footprints-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/muddy-footprints-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/muddy-footprints-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/muddy-footprints-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><strong>High traffic areas:</strong> We wanted to find out how well each steam mop cleaned up ground-in dirt and dust, and there was no better test for this than the laundry/mud room. Outside dirt is constantly tracked onto the linoleum floor here, leaving dusty and sometimes muddy footprints all over the surface. With each steam mop, we did the same number of slow passes on the floor and then checked the results. After cleaning, we considered the floor’s brightness, how it felt to the touch, and how much dirt was on the microfiber pad (meaning it was no longer on the floor!).</p>

<p><strong>Food soil:</strong> For this test, we spread a black bean paste on the floor and let it dry overnight. In the morning, we set a stopwatch as we hovered the steam mop over the stain with short passes until the stain was removed. Our intention was to stop at 20 second intervals, to prevent the floor from becoming damaged. However, in every case, the dried food soil was removed at 20 seconds or less.</p>
<p>The Bissell &#8211; 19404 PowerFresh was the top performer in both the high traffic and food soil tests. The scrubby microfiber pad (one of two microfiber pad options that come with the Bissell units) and easy scrubber brush meant that the mop required less passes and fewer seconds of continuous steaming to remove dried-on messes and ground-in dirt.</p>
<p>The Bissell &#8211; Symphony Pet All-in-One Vacuum and Steam Mop also made fast work of cleaning up food soils, but the Bissell 19404 &#8211; PowerFresh performed better in high traffic areas. The scrub tool and nylon utility brush attachments of the Steamfast &#8211; SF-370WH Multi-Purpose Steam Cleaner garnered excellent results in both areas, but it did not perform as highly with just the microfiber pad you would normally use to mop a floor.</p>

<h3>Convenience</h3>

<p>The whole idea behind a steam mop is that it offers you convenience, which means fast heat up times and fast dry times. It also means that you shouldn’t have to stop several times to refill the tank, or unplug the cord just to finish the room. After all, a longer cord allows for easier reach to electric sockets and less likelihood that you’ll have to unplug the cord and wait for the unit to heat up again just to finish a room.</p>
<p>To that end, we filled the tank of each steam mop up to 400 ml, and timed how many seconds it took to heat up at the medium setting. Then, we timed how many minutes it took before it ran out of steam, in order to test how long the tank lasted (again, on a medium setting). Once the floor was mopped, we pulled out our stopwatch one final time to test how long it took for the floor to dry.</p>
<p>While the Steamfast &#8211; SF-370WH Multi-Purpose Steam took nearly five minutes to heat up, it had the largest tank capacity by far, holding approximately 976 ml more than the other models. The other finalists all heated up in half a minute, but only had a 400-500 ml capacity. The O-Cedar &#8211; Microfiber Steam Mop was the fastest to heat up, ready to go in only 20 seconds.</p>
<p>The Bissell &#8211; 19404 PowerFresh and Bissell &#8211; Symphony Pet had the longest use times, both lasting 20 minutes (more than enough time to mop a kitchen floor). The Bissell Symphony also had the longest cord, extending 25 feet.</p>
<p>The convenience factor we appreciated most, however, was a fast dry time. If the water in the tank only reaches the boiling point, the steam tends to be wetter and the dry time is longer. The higher the temperature, the drier the vapor. The Bissell &#8211; 19404 PowerFresh and Shark &#8211; Steam Pocket Mop were both dry in two minutes, or about the time it takes to put the unit away and walk back across your floor without leaving a trail of footprints.</p>

<h3>Comfort</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5523" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bissell-holding-mop.jpg" alt="person holding a mop with one hand" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bissell-holding-mop.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bissell-holding-mop-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bissell-holding-mop-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bissell-holding-mop-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bissell-holding-mop-300x200.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bissell-holding-mop-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bissell-holding-mop-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bissell-holding-mop-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bissell-holding-mop-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bissell-holding-mop-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>This wasn’t a test, per se, but we felt it was important to judge the comfort level of using each steam mop. We considered how much it weighed, how easily the mop head maneuvered into tight spaces, how easy it was to use, and whether or not it was noisy during use.</p>
<p>The good news is that none of our finalists were noisy enough to wake up a sleeping toddler. The Shark &#8211; Steam Pocket Mop and Steamfast &#8211; SF-370WH Multi-Purpose Steam Cleaner made no noise at all except for the sound of steam being released, and the remaining mops were equally silent once they heated up (after the first fill or refill, they make an initial “knocking” sound). If you wanted to use the vacuum function of the Bissell &#8211; Symphony Pet, we might recommend waiting until after nap time.</p>
<p>At less than five pounds, the Shark &#8211; Steam Pocket Mop and Shark &#8211; Professional weighed the lightest of the mops we tested. However, the Shark &#8211; Steam Pocket Mop does require you to pump the handle and push to create steam. Even though this is the natural action of mopping, we found it more comfortable when the steam was released without manual effort.</p>
<p>This made the Bissell &#8211; 19404 PowerFresh Steam Mop Hard Floor Steam Cleaner and O-Cedar &#8211; Microfiber Steam Mop our top picks for comfort. At eight and seven pounds, respectively, they are both lightweight enough to push around the room easily, and both release a continuous steam flow without any physical labor.</p>

<p>After two weeks of testing (and moving around appliances so we could find new areas to steam), we found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0091YYUAM/?tag=ybdstm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissell &#8211; 19404 PowerFresh</a> to be the easiest steam mop to use. It was also the steam mop that gave us the best results, leaving brighter, shinier and cleaner-feeling floors.</p>
<p>The added cleaning capability was thanks to the built-in easy scrubber, which flips down with your foot and adds an extra boost to the steam power. In our tests, it took only ten seconds to clean up dried-on food soils and the easy scrubber made a clear difference in the high traffic areas. This certainly beats scrubbing with a paper towel. (Check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-paper-towels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper towel review</a> for the best ones.)  You can actually see the grime coming up as you clean, with a marked difference in the areas just steamed.</p>
<p>It comes with two microfiber pad options: a white microfiber pad for everyday use, and a striped scrubby pad for tougher messes. Both pads are treated with Microban antimicrobial protection, and have a pocket to hold an optional Spring Breeze scent disc. We found the fresh scent of a clean, steamed floor was appealing enough, but if you’re really a scent person, you can add the discs or even Bissell demineralized water in scents like Citrus and Eucalyptus Mint.</p>

<p>Our favorite feature is the removable water tank. It was so convenient to pop it out and bring it to the faucet to refill, or to dump out the extra water when we were finished cleaning. All the steam mop manuals advised not to store the mop with water in the tank, and it was a chore to hold the whole mop over the sink or outside in order to empty the tank. With the Bissell &#8211; 19404 PowerFresh, this wasn’t an issue, and we were grateful for the thoughtful design.</p>
<p>The shape of the mop head fits into corners and tight spaces (like around the toilet), but it’s still large enough to cover a lot of square footage quickly. The 23-foot cord and 20 minutes of steaming time also mean that you can cover a large area without stopping. The mop head swivels easily, and the light weight of the unit makes it easy to push around, while still being sturdy enough that it didn’t feel as if it would break easily.</p>

<p>The Bissell &#8211; 19404 PowerFresh starts heating as soon as you plug it in, and is ready in 30 seconds, when the digital indicator light stops blinking to let you know you’re all set to begin. It doesn’t have an empty light indicator (perhaps the only negative), but you can tell you’ve run out of steam when it makes a knocking sound. There are three digital settings (low, medium, and high), so you can easily vary the level of steam you want to use.</p>
<p>All in all, this mop was simple to use, super convenient for cleaning floors and reasonably priced, leading us to recommend it as the best steam mop on the market.</p>

<p>We were impressed with the wide variety of surfaces the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Steamfast-SF-370WH-Multi-Purpose-Steam-Cleaner/dp/B0051T8XMW" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Steamfast &#8211; SF-370WH</a> was able to clean, from floors and baseboards to oven racks. In fact, we were so excited that we made a whole day of it, steam cleaning our fridge, oven, and walls. Thanks to the extension wands, we were even able to reach the ceiling.</p>
<p>The scrub brush and nylon utility brushes did an amazing job on our floors and walls, removing years of grime that couldn’t be touched by other cleaning products. The nylon utility brush also refreshed our low-pile carpet, removing stains and unflattening the fibers. On the area rug, it removed stains, but did pull on the fibers, so we would have preferred a more gentle tool there.</p>

With accessories ranging from a microfiber pad to a brass utility brush, you can tackle a wide variety of cleaning projects with this all-in-one unit.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Steamfast-SF-370WH-Multi-Purpose-Steam-Cleaner/dp/B0051T8XMW" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>One of the features that is great about the Steamfast is the ability to either clean in short bursts using the steam trigger, or to push forward the steam-lock switch for a continuous flow of steam. This gives your hand a break when cleaning larger surfaces such as floors, but also gives you the ability to stop and move furniture or other objects out of the way without worrying about damaging the floors with continuous steam.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5531 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steamfast-fridge.jpg" alt="the Steamfast cleaning the top of a fridge" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steamfast-fridge.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steamfast-fridge-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steamfast-fridge-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steamfast-fridge-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steamfast-fridge-300x200.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steamfast-fridge-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steamfast-fridge-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steamfast-fridge-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steamfast-fridge-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steamfast-fridge-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>This cleaner is shaped like a tank, and with good reason. It holds up to 1,420 ml of water, so it can be used for around 45 minutes without needing to refill. That’s just over double the amount of use time as the other finalists. The only drawbacks we found were that the shape was a little more cumbersome than the models shaped like conventional mops, it took a little longer to heat up, and that the boiler was hard to fill without spilling.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple accessories that come with the Steamfast &#8211; SF-370WH  allow you to decide which attachment to use on different surfaces; soft microfiber pads work well on hard floors and delicate surfaces, the squeegee tool can be used to clean windows and nylon utility brushes provide extra scrubbing power on grout and carpets.</li>
<li>An extra-large capacity water tank gives you up to 45 minutes of steaming time, allowing you to complete several rooms or projects without stopping to refill and reheat.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="budget-pick">Budget pick: Shark &#8211; S1000A</h2>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075JT9HYP/?tag=ybdstm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; S1000A</a>, Shark made some improvements over our previous budget pick, the Shark &#8211; Steam Pocket Mop, which Shark has discontinued since our original review. The older model had a smaller (220 ml) non-removable tank that needed to be filled with a small flask. The new Shark &#8211; S1000A has a removable 400 ml tank that is easily filled from a faucet. During our tests, the tank didn’t need to be refilled for 15 minutes, which gave us plenty of time to mop our entire kitchen floor three times.</p>
<p>Like the previous model, the Shark comes with two thick pads made of 80% polyester and 20% nylon, which not only aggressively grabbed our ground-in food stains, but also rinsed clean in seconds. The pads are machine washable and emerged from the wash and dryer cycles almost like new.</p>
<p>The Shark &#8211; S1000A begins heating when it’s plugged in, and it took 1 minute 42 seconds to heat up, a full minute longer than the prior model. But once the steam began to hiss, it was ready to go. Similar to our top pick, the Bissell &#8211; 19404 PowerFresh, the Shark has a swivel head and straight edge that allows you to get into tight corners and under cabinets.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075JT9HYP/?tag=ybdstm-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="" data-srcset="" width="" height="" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Budget Pick: Shark - S1000A</h3><p>Shark made considerable improvements over its older model. With a larger removable tank, thick mopping pads and gushes of super-hot steam, the Shark -S1000A is also a great choice if you're budget conscious.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075JT9HYP/?tag=ybdstm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>You need to pump the mop a couple of times to get the steam flowing, but after that, the natural motion of mopping automatically emits gushes of very hot steam with every sweep. We needed a bit of elbow grease while mopping, but the Shark &#8211; S1000A weighs only 4.6 pounds, so although it’s not effortless, we didn’t find it tiring. Like the discontinued model, the Shark &#8211; S1000A can sanitize floors by mopping over the area 15 times, as Shark recommends.</p>
<p>Another plus is the Shark &#8211; S1000A’s price: This improved model is $20 less than the discontinued model, which, at the time of our review, we didn’t feel its cost justified buying it over the Bissell. If you don’t want to invest in our top picks, which we still recommend, the Shark &#8211; S1000A is a great performer at a budget price.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Shark &#8211; S1000A takes a little longer to heat up than other steam mops, but once it’s hot, it emits gushes of steam with every stroke.</li>
<li>Its thick microfiber pad grabs grime and dirt and rinses clean.</li>
<li>The Shark’s swivel head and straight edge lets you get into corners and under cabinets.</li>
<li>It takes a bit of elbow grease to use, but it’s incredibly well priced and a real bargain.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MVZF6X5/?tag=ybdstm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Light n’ Easy</a> steam mop is very popular with consumers, but after testing it several times, we question why. First off, it’s a half-pound heavier than the Shark &#8211; S1000A, and although that might not seem much, it was actually difficult to push the mop across the kitchen floor. Its non-removable tank holds only 200 ml of water, which needs to be slowly poured with an included plastic flask into the tank’s nickel-sized hole.</p>
<p>Each time we tested, it took only 50 seconds to heat, and though it was hissing steam during this period, it wasn’t until 2 minutes later that there was enough steam to begin mopping. The Light n’ Easy has a very thin microfiber pad, which feels more like a terry cloth dish towel. Rather than soak up food stains, it merely smeared them around: We had to mop over the same area a few times before it was clean.</p>
<p>The steam never got hot enough nor was much emitted, and after 8 minutes, the tank was empty. We found the Light n’ Easy to be less convenient than a regular sponge mop, and because we had to repeatedly go over spots it didn’t clean at the first swipe, it was also exhausting and frustrating to use.</p>
<p>Finally, the Light n’ Easy isn’t a budget product. If you want to purchase extra cleaning pads, the total cost is almost double that of the Shark &#8211; S1000A, which is a much more efficient and cost-effective steam mop.</p>
<h3>Shark &#8211; Steam Pocket Mop (discontinued)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5536 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shark-hero.jpg" alt="Shark Steam Pocket Mop solo" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shark-hero.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shark-hero-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shark-hero-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shark-hero-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shark-hero-300x200.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shark-hero-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shark-hero-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shark-hero-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shark-hero-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shark-hero-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The Shark &#8211; Steam Pocket Mop mop comes with many of the key features we looked for in a mop. It heats up in less than a minute (30 seconds, to be exact) and our test floors were dry in around two minutes.</p>
<p>It only took slightly longer to remove dried-on food soil than our top pick, the Bissell 19404 PowerFresh. It cleaned our high traffic areas at least as well as a conventional mop, without the hassle of hauling around a mop bucket and waiting ages for the floor to dry. Plus, you can start sanitizing the floor after three minutes of use, although you do need to pass over the area with a backward and forward motion at least 15 times.</p>
<p>This is the only steam mop we tested that takes elbow grease to use. You have to pump the handle to start releasing steam, which it continues to release with a push forward motion. As you push faster, the steam gets hotter. Since the mop itself is so lightweight, only four and a half pounds, this isn’t a difficult task, nor did it put any strain on our arms.</p>
<p>What we liked best about the Shark is the pocket style microfiber mop. It slips over the mop head and both sides can be used. All you have to do is easily flip the mop head, which can even be done mid-cleaning<strong>. </strong>We loved using one side of the double-sided microfiber pad to clean, and then flipping it over to sanitize with a fresh side. The Shark comes with a large rectangle shaped mop head, but you can order a triangle shaped mop head separately, if you prefer.</p>
<p>The few negatives we have to report are the fact that you have to lay the mop sideways to fill or refill tank, which was tricky and not at all convenient, and that the provided filling flask is not marked with milliliters. This made it difficult to know how much water you were putting in the tank, or if you reached capacity. (We used a separate measuring cup for our tests.)</p>
<h3>Shark &#8211; S3601D (discontinued)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5542" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/runners-up-mops.jpg" alt="four runner up mops" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/runners-up-mops.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/runners-up-mops-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/runners-up-mops-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/runners-up-mops-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/runners-up-mops-300x200.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/runners-up-mops-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/runners-up-mops-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/runners-up-mops-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/runners-up-mops-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/runners-up-mops-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
For tough cleaning jobs, the Shark  &#8211; S3601D’s heavy steam setting removes dried-on soils in 10 seconds and cleans high-traffic areas as well as our top pick.</p>
<p>Although still quiet, the Shark &#8211; S3601D does make more noise than the rest; it sounds something like a cat purring loudly. Unlike all the other finalists we tested, this one requires a Phillip head screwdriver to put together, but you only need to screw together the handle and the water tank.</p>
<p>In terms of upgrades from the basic Shark, the S3601D doesn’t require any manual effort to produce steam. It has a digital steam control with three settings for dusting, mopping and scrubbing. The scrub setting, paired with the scrubbing strips on the Sonic Lift microfiber cleaning pad, was especially effective on high-traffic areas. The other side of the pocket pad features shaggy fingers which are meant to lock in dirt and dust, which is great when you want to use the lower heat dust setting on more delicate surfaces.</p>
<p>They also extended the cord by two feet and improved the range of the swivel motion (it is pretty impressive). We tested the S3601D, with the “D” option adding a triangle mop head and pocket pad to the deal. The triangle mop head is useful to get deeper into corners and clean tight spaces, but for larger jobs, the rectangle mop head is more effective, and we found we didn’t want to switch mop heads just to finish a single room.</p>
<h3>Bissell &#8211; Symphony</h3>
<p>Both of the Bissell brand models we tested performed highly in terms of final cleaning results. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B014UM9N3I/?tag=ybdstm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissell &#8211; Symphony Pet</a> was able to remove dried-on soil in ten seconds, when using the vacuum function. It also picked up all the dirt and grime in our high traffic areas, although it wasn’t as bright of a finish as the 19404 PowerFresh.</p>
<p>If you have pets, you know how stubborn pet hair can be, even after sweeping. The Symphony gives you the ability to steam clean your floors while vacuuming up the pet hair at the same time. It features digital controls, so you can easily switch the vacuum on and off, as well as switch between high and low steam settings. We also appreciated the ready light indicator, which lets you know that the water has heated sufficiently to begin steam cleaning.</p>
<p>Although it doesn’t have a removable water tank, this was the easiest stationary tank to fill, thanks to an easy fill opening that helps prevent spills. The dirt tank is also easy to use, and features a built in Drop-IT system. All you have to do is press the lever to empty the debris into the trash.</p>
<p>The Symphony comes with the everyday use microfiber pad and scrubby pad (along with an optional scent disc, just like the 19404 PowerFresh), as well as steam-boost disposable pads. We all know that sometimes pets make messes that are better suited for the trash than the laundry, and the disposable pads are a handy option in those cases.</p>
<p>It does take longer for the floor to dry with the disposable pads (40 minutes versus the five minutes with the microfiber), and in general, we found the need to remove bottom tray to attach either style of pad a little annoying. Other than being a little more bulky than necessary for regular use, we found the Symphony to be a highly efficient steam mop that would be great for pet-owning families.</p>
<h3>O-Cedar &#8211; Microfiber Steam Mop</h3>
<p>While it doesn’t have an extra bells and whistles, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/O-Cedar-149437-Microfiber-Steam-Mop/dp/B00US9PSKU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">O-Cedar &#8211; Microfiber Steam Mop</a> was probably the fastest mop to set up and gets you started the soonest. With a couple of clicks, the addition of a velcro pad attachment that was the easiest to get on, and a fill of the water tank, you’re on your way. The best part about the O-Cedar is that it heats in only 20 seconds, the fastest heat up time of all our finalists. It weighs only seven and a half pounds, so it’s easy to push around, and it releases continuous steam until you unplug it.</p>
<p>It comes with an angled head mop, which is great for quickly covering large spaces and fitting into corners, but difficult in small spaces such as bathrooms. It does make knocking noise when heating up (just like both the Bissell models we tested), but is silent while cleaning. The reason we rated this one last is it took several swipes to remove food and dirt soil, and performed only fair on high traffic area. It also had a long dry time of 16 minutes, much like using a conventional mop.</p>
<p>The O-Cedar also comes with a carpet glider, for refreshing and deodorizing carpets. Again, it’s easy to use; you just snap the glider on over the mop head and steam away.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0091YYUAM/?tag=ybdstm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissell &#8211; 19404 PowerFresh</a> outperformed the competition in several of the key metrics we used to determine the best steam mop. It heats up in less than a minute, can be used for 20 minutes at a time, and the floor dries in less time than it takes to put the unit away. Most importantly, the built-in easy scrubber and scrubby microfiber pad work with the steam to remove soil and grime in a matter of seconds. The icing on the cake is its removable tank, which makes filling and emptying the tank with water a breeze.</p>
<p>It takes a little more elbow grease, but the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075JT9HYP/?tag=ybdstm-20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Shark &#8211; S1000A</a> is a great option for the budget-conscious, Lightweight and easy to use, the Shark &#8211; S1000A&#8217;s thick microfiber pad grabs dirt and grime in tight corners and under cabinets. Once it heats up (a little longer than the Bissell), the Shark &#8211; S1000A emits gushes of hot steam that cleans and sanitizes your floor.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Over two months and 40 hours of research and testing we found the best electric pressure washer for light and medium cleaning tasks, and the best gas pressure washer for heavy duty jobs.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter spending over 40 hours researching and testing six top residential power washers, including four electric models and two gas models, we found the electric <a href="https://www.ivationproducts.com/products/iva9175orl-electric-pressure-washer-2200-psi-1-8-gpm-with-power-hose-nozzle-gun-and-turbo-wand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ivation &#8211; IVA-9175L</a> to be the best pressure washer for most homeowners. It has an incredibly well thought-out design and is packed with features to make light- and medium-duty cleaning jobs more fun to do. For more heavy-duty cleaning, we liked the gas <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CEWUMVI/?tag=ybdwash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Generac &#8211; 6923</a>.</p>

<h2 id="why-trust-us">Why you should trust us</h2>
<p>We spent a dozen hours researching power washers to decide on our six finalists to test. Ultimately, we were able to narrow our selection down to the top six finalists. In addition, we spent over 30 hours testing all the units over a period of two months. Thankfully, we had many neighbors volunteer for free pressure-washer cleanings in their backyards.</p>
<h3>Learning from the pros</h3>
<p>We spoke with multiple professional pressure-washing-business owners in the Southern California area, including Los Angeles and Orange County. This was both interesting and informative and gave us insight into the issues that experienced professionals deal with on a regular basis.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting conversations we had was with Brett, an experienced pressure washer with <a href="https://pressurewashingoc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pressure Washing Guys</a> in Orange County. We discussed things like city regulations, methods for removing tough stains, detergents and chemicals for specific stains, and when to perform your own cleaning vs. when to hire out a professional pressure washer.</p>
<p>These guys run with equipment that cost tens of thousands of dollars — but of course, these commercial washers are much more powerful and clean faster than any home model. Brett told us that many of their jobs involve cleaning a home where the homeowner used the wrong detergent and only made their mess even worse.</p>
<h2 id="#how-we-chose">How we chose finalists to test</h2>
<p>While there are commercial pressure washers used by pros that will set you back tens of thousands of dollars, we focused only on units that a typical homeowner would use — meaning units you could buy at your local hardware store.</p>
<p>We read guides prepared by sources like Home Depot, Lowes, Consumer Reports and Popular Mechanics to determine which criteria were most important when selecting the right tool for the job.</p>
<p>The simplest way to categorize pressure washers is by their PSI, or pounds per square inch, rating and fitting them into three groups. Higher PSIs usually mean higher price tags and better cleaning power.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4206" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/three-levels.jpg" alt="Chart of three main categories of usage" width="901" height="258" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/three-levels.jpg 901w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/three-levels-610x175.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/three-levels-885x253.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/three-levels-360x103.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/three-levels-375x107.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/three-levels-414x119.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/three-levels-295x84.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/three-levels-180x52.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/three-levels-320x92.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We searched retailers, review sites and discussion boards to narrow our selection of machines. We thoroughly read actual user reviews of each product and focused our selection to products found on Amazon and Home Depot with overall ratings of 4.0 or better.</p>
<p>The bulk of pressure washers we chose would be suitable for light cleaning jobs in the backyard and house exterior and for occasional cleaning jobs. We also selected a couple of gas-powered models to test for situations when more cleaning power is needed. We considered commonly referenced models like Karcher and Greenworks, but we ultimately decided to leave them off for reasons mentioned above.</p>
<h2 id="the-six-best">Compare the best pressure washers</h2>
[table id=17 /]
<h2 id="who-needs-one">Who needs a pressure washer?</h2>
<p>It was interesting to hear from a professional in this industry that pressure washing is not a fix for every kind of stain. Brett told us, “Our idea is if you can clean it with garden hose pressure, then use that. Clean it with the lowest pressure possible to not ruin the surface. If we feel like it’s not going to get clean, we raise the water pressure. If we think it’s going to damage the surface then we don’t do it.”</p>
<p>Here is a list of cleaning jobs you can tackle at home with an electric or gas-powered washer. They are organized from easiest to most difficult:</p>
<ul>
<li>Car washing</li>
<li>Outdoor and lawn furniture</li>
<li>Windows</li>
<li>Wooden decks</li>
<li>Wooden fences</li>
<li>Cleaning sides of the house, stucco and siding</li>
<li>Cleaning concrete floors</li>
<li>Removing chipped paint</li>
<li>Oil stains</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="usage-and-maintenance">Usage and maintenance</h2>
<p>We like to think we are pretty mechanically inclined, but pressure washers were just not completely straightforward when we started testing them. Owners should fully read the instruction manuals to prevent damage to the unit, the cleaning surface and to prevent bodily harm. There are lots of usage and storage quirks that slightly differ from unit to unit, so even if you’ve used one before you’re better off not skipping the manual!</p>
<h3>Water source minimum requirements</h3>
<p>To use your washer without damaging it, you need to use a water supply that meets or exceeds the water requirements of your pressure washer. For example, if your unit is rated at 2.5 GPM (gallons per minute), the hose you hook up must supply a minimum of 2.5 GPM to prevent damage to the machine’s pump. Ideally, you want a source with even greater pressure to account for irregularities and pockets of air.</p>
<h3>Setting up and putting away the machine</h3>
<p>The order in which you set up the pressure washer is important to prevent damage to the machine. The same applies to turning it off and prepping for storage.</p>
<p><strong>To set up:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Attach the water supply hose to the machine.</li>
<li>Connect the high-pressure hose to both the pressure washer and to the spray wand/gun.</li>
<li>Turn on the water supply but not the pressure washer.</li>
<li>Squeeze the trigger on the spray wand for about 20-30 seconds until all blips from air pockets have stopped, and you have a constant flow of water.</li>
<li>Turn on the machine.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>To shut down:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Turn off the machine.</li>
<li>Shut off the water supply.</li>
<li>Pull the wand’s trigger to release pressure from the system and drain remaining water from the hose.</li>
<li>Disconnect all hoses.</li>
<li>Pull the wand’s trigger to make sure the water is removed from the wand and high-pressure hose. Leaving any water inside the wand will cause rust and can damage the unit.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Gas units require extra care</h3>
<p>Gas-powered pressure washers need a little more work and care, especially when they aren’t used every month. Two of our finalists were gas models: the Simpson and the Generac. These units have the advantage of not needing an electrical outlet, which means you have a bit more freedom when using them. However, they require a considerable amount of care compared to electric pressure washers:</p>
<p><strong>Additional work required only for gas-powered units:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Purchasing a plastic gas canister, and bring to the gas station to periodically fill</li>
<li>Add and change out motor oil for maintenance</li>
<li>Maintain air filters</li>
<li>Spark plug changes</li>
<li>When storing, add fuel stabilizer and flush water from the system</li>
<li>If temps drop below freezing you need to prep the pump system</li>
</ul>

<h3>Determining actual GPM and PSI</h3>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4102" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/PSI-and-GPM-testing.jpg" alt="A scale, plate, and water jug for PSI and GPM testing" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/PSI-and-GPM-testing.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/PSI-and-GPM-testing-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/PSI-and-GPM-testing-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/PSI-and-GPM-testing-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/PSI-and-GPM-testing-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/PSI-and-GPM-testing-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/PSI-and-GPM-testing-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/PSI-and-GPM-testing-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/PSI-and-GPM-testing-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
</strong></p>
<p>An effective way to measure the cleaning power of a pressure washer is to calculate its GPM (gallons per minute) multiplied by its PSI (pounds per square inch). This calculation works because it takes into account both how much water is output and the pressure at which the water is sprayed.</p>
<p>All of these machines were labeled with GPM (gallons per minute) and PSI (pounds per square inch). Some user reviews claimed certain units didn’t always seem to live up to their advertised stats so we wanted to test for ourselves.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4207" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/power-comparison-data.jpg" alt="PSI and GPM test results" width="901" height="566" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/power-comparison-data.jpg 901w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/power-comparison-data-610x383.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/power-comparison-data-885x556.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/power-comparison-data-360x226.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/power-comparison-data-375x236.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/power-comparison-data-414x260.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/power-comparison-data-295x185.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/power-comparison-data-180x113.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/power-comparison-data-320x201.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>First, we tested the GPM of each unit. Some reviewers actually devised a way to soften the water pressure coming out of the spray wand by muffling it with towels and catching all the water being sprayed out with a large funnel. We gave this a shot, but it’s tough to keep that muffle on and tough to prevent water from splashing everywhere. Instead, we decided to use a five-gallon water cooler jug into which to shoot the spray wand without losing water to splashing. For each machine, we pulled the trigger on the spray wand for thirty seconds and weighed the water to calculate the true GPM rating.</p>
<p>We didn’t have a way to calculate the actual PSI, but instead we devised a method to compare the relative pressures between the tested models. We started with a kitchen scale, accurate down to 0.05-ounce measurements, and placed it in a resealable plastic bag for protection from water. Then we used a dinner plate and duct-taped it to the bag to prevent sliding and without putting any extra pressure on the scale. To measure pressure, we sprayed each wand at the dish from a distance of 12 inches and recorded the readout in pounds.</p>
<h3>Paint removal test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4103" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/paint-removal-test.jpg" alt="six pieces of wood after the paint removal tests" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/paint-removal-test.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/paint-removal-test-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/paint-removal-test-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/paint-removal-test-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/paint-removal-test-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/paint-removal-test-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/paint-removal-test-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/paint-removal-test-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/paint-removal-test-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>All of these machines have lower pressure nozzles or settings you can use if you want to avoid damaging paint on your surfaces. However, some people use pressure washers to remove paint from the side of their houses or old fences, so we wanted to test if each unit had the power to accomplish this task.</p>
<p>We painted six two-by-fours and let them completely dry. Then, from 12 inches away, we sprayed each block to see if the unit had enough power to chip away paint. If no paint chipped off, we switched to a more powerful tip and moved the wand closer to the block of wood.</p>
<p>All units except The Force were able to remove paint to some degree. Some on the lower PSI end could do it but at extremely close ranges and slower rates. This may be more effective if you’re trying to remove old and already chipped paint, but it would have taken hours on a full fence with these weaker units. The gas-powered washers we used had impressive power and were even capable of severely damaging the two-by-fours. These models should be used very carefully to remove paint while avoiding damage to your property.</p>
<h3>Noise level test</h3>

<p>We wanted to know how loud these machines get during use. Noise level is not directly related to effectiveness or cleaning power, but some folks are more sensitive to noise and may have neighbors who could be as well.</p>
<p>Since pressure washers are noticeably louder when the spray wand/gun trigger is being pulled, we measured and compared this noise level using a sound decibel meter.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4208" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/noise-level-data.jpg" alt="noise level test results" width="901" height="629" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/noise-level-data.jpg 901w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/noise-level-data-610x426.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/noise-level-data-885x618.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/noise-level-data-360x251.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/noise-level-data-375x262.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/noise-level-data-414x289.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/noise-level-data-295x206.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/noise-level-data-180x126.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/noise-level-data-320x223.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>A typical user will stand about five feet from the machine while comfortably pressure washing, so measured noise levels at a five-foot distance from all around the machine to find the loudest areas and recorded the highest decibel output. No pressure washers were ‘quiet’ and we found gas models were 10-15 decibels louder than electric models.</p>
<p>According to research on our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-ear-plugs/" rel="noopener">ear plugs review</a>, the World Health Organization recommends we don&#8217;t subject our ears to noise levels over 85db for over eight hours daily. Three pressure washers measured 85db or higher, and while most of us won&#8217;t be using these for over eight hours in a day, sound levels can fluctuate with distance, and wearing ear protection while cleaning is a safe choice.</p>

<p>We observed features, product design and considered all individual components when we used each pressure washer. Parts were inspected visually as we set up each unit and hoses and their connectors stood out as we prepped to wash.</p>
<p>It quickly became apparent that not all washers had a hose reel or a way to wrap cords. The only unit with a hose reel, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002Z8E52Y/?tag=ybdwash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AR Blue Clean</a>, had a completely unusable design. Some machines had a set of interchangeable spray tips, while two models only had a “cleaning tip” and a weaker tip for pre-soaking or adding detergent.</p>
<p>Materials of the spray wands and the body helped with overall appearance and usability. Some spray wands are made of plastic while some have stainless steel on the outside. Some higher quality wands and machines used brass fittings for the hoses.</p>
<p>Not all models had onboard detergent tanks, but they all had a way to use detergent. Some units had the bottle suspended on the machine somewhere or the ability to siphon from a detergent bottle on the ground.</p>

<p>In addition to “lab-testing” these washers, we also needed to put them up against real-world cleaning tests. We were lucky enough to have neighbors that volunteered their backyards for this (thank you, Next Door) because we simply didn’t have enough grime and buildup to clean just our own things.</p>
<p>We cleaned concrete floors, wood decks, both wood and resin furniture and outdoor tables. This gave us a chance to see how their advertised power rating translated to actual cleaning effectiveness. Going through multiple cleaning sessions let us repeatedly set up, break down and test portability of these units. Many pressure washers had unique features like a hose reel, little baskets, spray wand rests, multiple spray tips and other little features we tried out on-site. We didn’t lug all six washers to each location, but testing out each unit multiple times was sufficient to put it through its paces and get a real feel for cleaning with it.</p>

<p>If you’re doing general maintenance cleaning of siding, windows and furniture once or twice a month, you’ll be very happy with this unit. It was pretty closely tied to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CPGMUXW/?tag=ybdwash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sun Joe</a>, but the more we used the Ivation, the more it became apparent that the Ivation team put lots of effort into polishing this machine’s details.</p>
<p>The first to stand out was its spray wand. Setting up the wand on this machine is straightforward, and it was better than the other models we tested. It shares the same press-and-twist action to connect the spray wand’s handle to an extension, but it’s simply better designed. It takes less strength to set up with less room for error.</p>

<p>The trigger lock mechanism for this unit is also well designed. There’s a block on the bottom of the spray wand you push over to the other side to lock, which feels very secure. It’s not easy to accidentally release or break this mechanism.</p>
<p>Of all the electric models, the Ivation takes the crown for most elegant detergent bottle design. It is the only one with a hidden, built-in detergent container. The Sun Joe had an odd design with two detergent containers loosely sitting within its frame, and the other two machines don’t have built-in containers at all.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4119 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ivation-water-supply.jpg" alt="the Ivation's water supply connection" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ivation-water-supply.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ivation-water-supply-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ivation-water-supply-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ivation-water-supply-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ivation-water-supply-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ivation-water-supply-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ivation-water-supply-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ivation-water-supply-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ivation-water-supply-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Surprisingly, the water supply connection on this unit is significantly higher-quality than the three other electric models we tested. The others had noticeably poorer quality connections, lower-quality materials and more wobbly knobs. The water supply connection can seem like a small detail, but interacting with these things add to the overall experience of using each machine.</p>
<p>Cleaning power on this unit was about on par with Sun Joe’s but better than The Force or the AR Blue models we tested. The Force and AR Blue didn’t have options for more concentrated cleaning tips, and when combined with their overall lower cleaning power, they were not as effective as the Ivation.</p>
<p>The Ivation was able to chip off paint in our paint removal test, but the power was controlled enough to clean grime off a wood deck without destroying it. The particular wood deck we cleaned had not been maintained or cleaned for at least five years so it was pretty caked on, but it would have taken a very long time to finish cleaning with this unit.</p>
<p>If you have a wooden deck you want to clean, know that this type of job is more difficult compared to spraying down siding, floors, or furniture. If you were determined to save some cash and would only be doing a large cleaning job like decks once or twice a year, you could get it done with this unit, but it will take longer than higher-powered gas units. However, if the majority of your cleaning jobs are smaller, or you just want to do light maintenance of your home’s exterior, this machine will shine.</p>
<h3>A minor issue</h3>
<p>Something odd happened with the Ivation pressure washer when we first used it. It kept getting into odd 3-6 second sprints when the motor would just keep running on its own when we weren’t pulling the trigger. It was a little bit concerning that the motor was running when we weren’t using it. We later encountered this on future uses and it goes away after a minute or so of use, so it seems to happen by design. This power loss occurs with the other electric models too. The only way to really avoid it is to switch to a gas-powered washer.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Ivation &#8211; IVA-9175L was the most well-designed electric pressure washer we tested.</li>
<li>It has sigh-quality connectors, spray wand and body.</li>
<li>The Ivation&#8217;s great for light and frequent cleaning jobs.</li>
<li>Tougher cleaning jobs like decks are possible but can be slow.</li>
</ul>

<p>This gas pressure washer is significantly heavier than the electric models because of its metal frame and engine, but it makes up for it in quality. Everything from the frame, spray wand, spray tips, high-pressure hose and connections on this engine are noticeably higher quality than every electric model we tested. And at over two times the price, we expect it.</p>
<p>The stainless steel and plastic spray wand is solidly built and had a high-quality brass connection. It has a strong frame to support the engine, a built-in detergent tank and large wheels to maneuver over obstacles and up stairs with ease. It feels powerful enough for commercial use as everything is top notch.</p>

<p>Power on this gas-powered unit is significantly stronger than all the electric models we tested, without even looking at the numbers. There’s noticeable kickback when pulling the trigger which can be more tiring to use. Since you’ll spend about a quarter of the time cleaning compared to using an electric pressure washer, we feel the extra physical effort is worth it.</p>
<p>This power was demonstrated during our paint removal test. Paint started to chip when we used the 15-degree tip, and when we switched to the zero degree tip this machine completely destroyed the piece of wood. So with enough care, you can definitely get out stubborn stains with the Generac and remove chipped paint from tougher surfaces.</p>

<p>Despite our team being relatively mechanically inclined, gas pressure washers, in general, were not as straightforward to us as electric models were. We spent much more time reading their manuals to ensure we didn’t damage it with the first use. You have to deal with adding engine oil (included) and finding a way to get gasoline to fuel it. This means buying a portable gas can and a trip to the gas station.</p>
<p>The levers on this machine just to start the engine are another small hurdle to jump over that electric models don’t have. It has a power switch, a lever for the gas line and a lever for the choke. Instructions in the manual were vague about how to use the levers and about which position was open or closed. The choke lever position was dependent on the engine too, which added to the confusion. After studying some instructional videos online, we had a clear understanding of how to start the unit, at which point the Generac became easier to start up. However, there is definitely a learning curve for those who are unfamiliar with gas-powered products.</p>

<p>This unit has more than enough power for clean siding and large decks. It will speed up your cleaning time by at least three or four times compared to the electric models we tested. It can clean large and stubborn stained items, and it has less concentrated wand tips for light-duty jobs as well. If you can justify the slightly larger size and the price tag of this, it will pay off over the years since its definitely more fun and satisfying to clean with this higher-powered machine.</p>
<h3>Some flaws we can live with</h3>
<p>One part of the engine gets extremely hot. We read reviews about people melting their high-pressure hoses on the engine when they weren’t careful. While this is definitely something you should note, it certainly isn’t a deal breaker.</p>
<p>The lock on the wand is a flip-out stop, so it’s slightly awkward. While it does work, it’s not our favorite type of lock.</p>
<p>It’s loud, and it smells. This is going to be the case with any gas pressure washer though. The Generac clocked in at about 10-15 decibels louder than the electric models we tested. Since it is gasoline powered it obviously has an exhaust you have to deal with. Just make sure you keep the doors and windows to your home closed.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In terms of power, the Generac &#8211; 6923 blows electric pressure washers away. Great for large cleaning jobs.</li>
<li>Excellent build quality in the frame, body, and all components.</li>
<li>Loaded with features and well designed.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s loud, and the exhaust smells, but that&#8217;s expected of all gas models.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Sun Joe &#8211; SPX3000 was a close runner-up to our top pick for electric pressure washers. This unit, priced very similarly to the Ivation, had lots of pleasant surprises.</p>
<p>The first thing we noticed was the build quality on the SPX3000. The high-pressure hose on this felt extremely high quality — we actually thought we mixed it up with one of the hoses on the ~$400 gas-powered units. The hose itself has a fabric-like texture on it with good-quality connectors at the ends.</p>
<p>Since electric washers are much lower in cost than gas models, we were surprised to see the Sun Joe was the only electric model to feature a stainless steel wand extension and brass fittings.</p>

<p>Given the build quality of those components, it was surprising that installing the wand storage piece on the unit was extremely difficult. This item is meant to be a rest for the wand when storing it on the unit. You have to maneuver a clip into a lower part of the washer body that requires flexing hard plastic; we were not able to accomplish this after repeated attempts.</p>

<p>Installation of the spray gun’s rest required care, because there’s a flawed choice in design for all the plastic components on this machine:  they’re too sharp. Whether it’s the designer’s fault or a limitation of manufacturing, sharp corners on the plastic parts are everywhere. We cut ourselves several times during normal usage of the Sun Joe &#8211; SPX3000.</p>
<p>We were also disappointed to have to stop and find a screwdriver to complete the initial setup process. You need a particularly slim screwdriver to fit into one of the parts too.</p>
<p>This unit leaked a bit after we plugged the power in, which we realized was our fault. So, carefully as to not give ourselves another cut, we had to tighten the hose for the water supply connection which felt a bit cheap and squeaky.</p>
<p>This machine has two pressure modes just like a few of the other electric units we tested. One is for normal, high-pressure cleaning and the second is a low-pressure mode, likely for just pre-soaking areas. You activate by pulling the trigger twice and holding on the second pull, although just like the other electric models, this can take some experimenting to figure out.</p>
<p>In the paint-removal test, the Sun Joe showed that it can’t really remove paint. It performed better than The Force and AR Blue, but it was not really effective, if this is something you’re looking to regularly do. Just like the other electric pressure washers we tested, this unit gets into some dips where it just loses all pressure and you have to wait for it to build back up.</p>
<p>This is still a pretty good pressure washer overall, and it cleaned just as well as the Ivation did. The Sun Joe as a whole has a disconnect in the whole package: the main body felt cheap, but all the components that hook up to it felt higher in quality. But given the tradeoffs we’d have to make on this unit, it couldn’t take first place.</p>
<h3>AR Blue &#8211; AR383</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4125 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/AR-blue.jpg" alt="AR Blue - AR383 disassembled" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/AR-blue.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/AR-blue-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/AR-blue-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/AR-blue-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/AR-blue-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/AR-blue-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/AR-blue-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/AR-blue-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/AR-blue-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002Z8E52Y/?tag=ybdwash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AR Blue &#8211; AR383</a> was the first machine we tested, and it was an interesting way to start. It’s the lowest-priced machine we tested, and it gets the job done, but its shortcomings became very obvious once we saw what the other machines had to offer.</p>
<p>For example, switching out the spray wand tips on this machine is by far the most frustrating. It requires more force than the other finalists do, and it was designed in a way that the tip can be on, but you still don’t know if it’s in the locked position.</p>
<p>This brand was the only to offer a slick-looking reel for the high-pressure hose. Unfortunately, this feature is nearly impossible to use without getting stuck. The design of the reel exerts extra pressure by bending the hose, and once the hose gets in a bit of a tangle the reel is basically useless. It would have been a far better experience if they completely removed this feature.</p>
<p>On the front, you’ll also notice a feature only the AR Blue had: a quick-release water-supply hose connector. This never really was something we needed to use and seems to only be helpful if you plan on having a hose dedicated for your pressure washer. This is an interesting idea for those who need it, but the connector also feels very low-quality.</p>
<p>It performed well in our real-world tests, such as removing dirt and grime in a neighbor’s backyard. It has no options for different cleaning tips, but likely because the lower power of this machine wouldn’t take advantage of them. For tougher stains, we had to move the tip closer to the surface and wait a bit longer. The power on this machine is fine for light cleaning tasks on siding, concrete and furniture if you’re on a budget. But if you can spend just a little bit more you have lots of better options.</p>
<h3>The Force &#8211; 1800</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4127 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-force-disassembled.jpg" alt="The Force - 1800 disassembled" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-force-disassembled.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-force-disassembled-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-force-disassembled-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-force-disassembled-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-force-disassembled-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-force-disassembled-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-force-disassembled-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-force-disassembled-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-force-disassembled-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We thought we were shipped the wrong item when <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NVOY8U0/?tag=ybdwash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Force &#8211; 1800</a> arrived in the mail. It’s by far the smallest pressure washer we tested. But let’s not base our results only on the size of this machine. In our own power-measurement tests, this machine ranked the weakest.</p>
<p>One thing that concerned us about The Force was water drips out the back when you remove the water-supply hose on this unit. It seems dangerous because water just sprays into the open grates on the back of the machine. We don’t know if any exposed or electrical parts are in there, and we’ll just give the company the benefit of the doubt for making this design decision.</p>
<p>Another issue, which we noticed on the Ivation only during the first minute or so of use, was that The Force repeatedly loses pressure while you use it. You have to basically stop using it and let the motor build up pressure before you can get usable cleaning power from it. This can quickly become a nuisance.</p>
<p>The wand attachment system is a little better on this one than the AR Blue, since you can see when the wand is pressed in or rotated enough to be engaged or disengaged when swapping out. The lock mechanism on the trigger is difficult to accidentally engage or disengage almost to a fault.</p>
<p>Overall, this pressure washer feels lower in quality than the others. The other electric models are made of mostly plastic too, but it really stands out on this machine, to the point of being almost toy-like. There’s a glimpse of hope for higher-quality parts with the water-supply hookup port, but it turned out to be just chromed plastic and not a stainless steel part.</p>
<p>A unique feature of this machine was its high pressure hose. It’s the only one we’ve been able to just push in to attach with an auto click and lock system. Perhaps the others have more solid designs because of the higher power they provide. Ironically, this machine didn’t generate enough force to chip any paint off the board in our test.</p>
<p>The Force &#8211; 1800 is really only designed for the lightest of cleaning jobs. It feels a bit too low quality if you plan to use it more than say, once a year and should only be considered if saving space in your garage is the top priority.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004MXKUCY/?tag=ybdwash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Simpson &#8211; MSH3125-S</a> made a good impression right out of the box but ended up being the runner-up for gas-powered models. Its design, build quality and components were all excellent.</p>
<p>We ran into a bit of a snag which may or may not be representative of all the units made by Simpson. When we used the machine for a second time, we noticed a liquid puddled up near the motor.</p>
<p>Gasoline leaked out of the machine.</p>
<p>Not wanting to risk a fire or explosion, we called Simpson&#8217;s support for help. We were informed the engine on this pressure washer was made by Honda and that Simpson couldn’t provide help, and they didn’t seem particularly interested in customer satisfaction about it either. So we called up Honda, and they had us take it into an authorized repair center.</p>

<p>The repair center diagnosed it as a carburetor leak and would not work on it until they got the clearance from Honda to service it. After about a week, a Honda representative stopped by to inspect the motor only to discover the issue had disappeared.</p>
<p>Like the Generac, it has a high-quality spray wand with a stainless-steel extension. This one comes with five spray wand tips for a variety of cleaning tasks. All the hose fittings are made of high-quality brass for secure connections.</p>
<p>Although our tests measured slightly less power on the Simpson compared to the Generac, we were unable to tell the difference in real-world cleaning. It had enough power to chip paint off in our tests and enough power to clean outdoor furniture, decks and concrete floors. This unit had considerable power, which was good enough to handle just about any cleaning task at home.</p>
<p>Extra points went to this unit for its low profile. During the warranty work trips, we were able to fit this washer into the trunk of our sedan with the handle temporarily removed. When transporting the Generac, however, we had to stuff it in the back seat and hope the seat fabric didn’t tear. We also loved the design of the cord holder and the spray wand rest on this, which made it very tidy when not in use.</p>
<p>We did notice this unit slowly rotated as it vibrated during use, which can be annoying, requiring repositioning to avoid melting your hoses. You also have to be careful when rolling it around since the frame hits your feet unless you pull the unit to your side instead of behind.</p>
<p>Overall, the Simpson is a very good machine. If it weren’t for the gas-leaking incident, we may have been able to overlook its quirks when comparing to the Generac.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>There is definitely a big range in quality of pressure washers within the same price range. Despite all being positively reviewed by consumers, we definitely noticed usability and quality variances between products. All the units we tested can get the job done, but our top picks made setting up, cleaning, and storage much more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Our top pick for electric washers &#8212; <a href="https://www.ivationproducts.com/products/iva9175orl-electric-pressure-washer-2200-psi-1-8-gpm-with-power-hose-nozzle-gun-and-turbo-wand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Ivation</a> &#8212; and our best pick for gas models &#8212; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CEWUMVI/?tag=ybdwash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Generac</a> &#8212; were solid performers. They weren’t designed for the same types of jobs. If you need a machine for light cleaning around the house and only the yearly tough job, the Ivation will suit you well. If you are constantly in need of more power from these machines, a gas one will be the way to go. They’re pricier but also have much better build quality and power to handle any home-cleaning job you throw at it.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Scrub Daddy has sold millions of units since being featured on Shark Tank. Our in-house testing indicates that it is worthy of the hype.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>ack in 2012, Aaron Krause “entered the tank” on ABC’s hit television show Shark Tank and gave one of the most successful pitches the show has seen to date. Lori Grenier, the shark known for holding more than 100 patents, her expertise and star presence on QVC, said she instantly knew the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J420JEC/?tag=ybdscrub-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Scrub Daddy</a> was a “hero.” Based on our own research and testing, we agree it’s the best sponge  on the market.</p>

<li><a href="#how-scrub-daddy-performs">How the Scrub Daddy performs</a></li>
<li><a href="#what-we-didnt-like">What we didn’t like about the Scrub Daddy</a></li>
<li><a href="#the-bottom-line">The bottom line</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Since being broadcast on Shark Tank, sales of Scrub Daddy have exploded. They are now available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J420JEC/?tag=ybdscrub-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>, as well as retail locations including Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Walmart. In addition to the original and iconic yellow smiling Scrub Daddy, the brand now includes several other product lines as well.</p>
<p>As of early 2016, sales of the Scrub Daddy had already exceeded 10 million units and $50 million in sales, and show no indication of slowing down.</p>
<p>With all the attention the Scrub Daddy received thanks to its appearance on Shark Tank, we wanted to find out whether or not the hype associated with the Scrub Daddy was really earned.</p>
<h2 id="what-sets-scrub-daddy-apart">What sets the Scrub Daddy apart from other sponges</h2>
<p>When selecting the products we wanted to test for our comprehensive <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-kitchen-cleaning-sponge/">best kitchen cleaning sponge</a> review, the Scrub Daddy started off at the top of our prospective list, alongside longstanding brand names like Lysol and Scotch-Brite. This is noteworthy in and of itself, since Scrub Daddy has existed as a brand for only a few years.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, the Scrub Daddy stands out for its friendly aesthetic. If you’re walking through the sponge aisle in a retail store, the Scrub Daddy will stand out for its bright and attention-grabbing packaging.</p>
<p>Beyond the packaging, the design and performance of the Scrub Daddy is what really makes this product stand out.</p>
<p>The Scrub Daddy is the only sponge among our finalists that is able to be both hard enough to clean a BBQ grill and soft enough to be a scratch-free cleaning solution for delicate pots, pans, and plates.</p>
<p>The Scrub Daddy is made from a synthetic (and proprietary) material which turns hard in cold water and soft in warm water. This functionality is what makes it possible for the Scrub Daddy to be both a hard scrubber and a soft sponge.</p>
<p>The design of the Scrub Daddy is unique as well. There are few consumer products on the market that are able to take something as simple as a smiling sponge and utilize each of those facial features (eyes, mouth, hair) into specific and useful features.</p>

<h2 id="how-scrub-daddy-performs">How the Scrub Daddy performs</h2>
<p>In our test of the best kitchen cleaning sponges, we tested the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J420JEC/?tag=ybdscrub-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scrub Daddy</a> alongside seven other sponges using a series of tests. Here’s how the Scrub Daddy performed across each of those tests:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3163" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data.png" alt="Sponge Data" width="880" height="586" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-610x406.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-360x240.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-375x250.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-414x276.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-295x196.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-180x120.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-320x213.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-360x240@2x.png 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Rinsability</h3>
<p>One of the main selling points of the Scrub Daddy is its ability to rinse clean. In our own testing, we found this claim to be very accurate. Running the Scrub Daddy under warm water leaves the sponge soft enough to squeeze out any flakes or material, while the temperature of the water and texture of the sponge itself helped facilitate the removal of excess waste.</p>
<h3>Scratch test</h3>
<p>While the Scrub Daddy is capable of scraping surfaces as tough as a recently used BBQ grill, it is still capable of cleaning more delicate surfaces – such as the nonstick coating of a pan – without causing scratches.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that all but one of the sponges we tested were able to clean a variety of surfaces without producing any scratches. However, the Scrub Daddy does stand out a bit thanks to its ability to alternate between a heavy scrubber and a scratch-free sponge.</p>
<h3>Ergonomics</h3>
<p>Ergonomics is another area where the Scrub Daddy really stands out from the competition. That’s because the smiling face of the Scrub Daddy is more than just an aesthetic decision.</p>
<p>The shape of the Scrub Daddy makes it perfect for most hands, and fingers can be put through the eyeholes to further improve the grip. The Scrub Daddy’s mouth is also great for cleaning silverware and even some cooking utensils.</p>
<p>The “hair” on the top of the Scrub Daddy also make cleaning glasses easier as well.</p>
<h3>Drying time</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3153" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time.png" alt="Sponge Drying Time" width="880" height="579" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-610x401.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-360x237.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-375x247.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-414x272.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-295x194.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-180x118.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-320x211.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Bacteria and other pathogens love wet environments. That’s why a sponge that stays wet for extended periods of time can breed dangerous levels of bacteria.</p>
<p>The Scrub Daddy was the fastest of our finalists to dry, but still required 7.9 hours to completely dry. While that might seem like a long time, the Natural Sea Sponge, TVTimedirect Microfiber Sponge, and Superior Performance Ultra Sponge took more than 26 hours to fully dry.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-didnt-like">What we didn’t like about the Scrub Daddy</h2>
<p>Overall, the Scrub Daddy is an excellent sponge, and easily the best kitchen sponge we tested. That being said, there were a couple of things we didn’t love about it.</p>
<h3>Absorbency</h3>
<p>The most significant thing we noticed was that the Scrub Daddy, while versatile, is not particularly great for cleaning up spills. The Scrub Daddy tied for last place in our absorbency test, and was only able to hold about three tablespoons of water.</p>
<p>To compare, the Natural Sea Sponge held 15 tablespoons of water, and the Lysol Multi-Purpose Scrub Sponge held 5 tablespoons.</p>

<p>Of course, Aaron and Lori (owner and primary investor of the Scrub Daddy brand) have come up with a solution to the absorbency issue, with the development of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RZT81HI/?tag=ybdscrub-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sponge Daddy</a>.</p>
<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>The other thing we noticed was that the Scrub Daddy is a bit more expensive to use than other sponges. That, in conjunction with the fact that the Scrub Daddy does tend to start breaking down after a month or two of heavy use means you’ll be paying a slight premium to use the Scrub Daddy.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a high-quality, versatile, hygienic sponge, the Scrub Daddy should top your list. While the Scrub Daddy does tend to be a little more expensive than other sponges on the market, for most people the cost is more than worth it to use a sponge as powerful as the Scrub Daddy.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-found">How we found the best sponge</h2>
<p>During our research phase, we read through blogs and articles to determine the qualities people look for in a sponge in order to narrow the list down to our eight finalists. We looked at subreddits, like /r/advice/, and watched YouTube reviews to gather consumer input. We did some fact-finding legwork on what to look for in a sponge, and more importantly, how to keep it clean in an environment laden with food and moisture (the kitchen sink).</p>
<p>Once we narrowed down the field, we put our eight finalists through a series of household tests to find out how much water they would hold, how fast they dried and whether or not they would scratch a frying pan with nonstick coating.</p>
<p>In addition to our specific tests, we put each of the sponges through two months of daily use to see how well they would hold up in the kitchen, bathroom and during other cleaning projects around the house.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-look">What to look for in a sponge</h2>
<p>The main purpose of a sponge is scrubbing to remove food and debris. Most often, sponges are used to remove caked-on food from dishes, pans and utensils, but in determining the best sponge, we found that it needs to be useful in a wide variety of functions. For instance, sponges are also used to scrub stovetops, BBQs, remove soap and scum from bathroom fixtures and tiles and even to wash cars.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind the number of ways you can use a sponge and the many different types of cleaning sponges that exist, there is a lot of information to consider when deciding which sponge will make your cleaning task easiest. One option is to dedicate precious shelf space to stock a whole arsenal of sponges.</p>
<p>However, your best space-saving bet is to find one or two sponges that will accomplish a wide range of cleaning goals. Obviously, this makes versatility an extremely important factor when choosing a sponge.</p>
<p>A second important component of sponges is absorbency, because sponges are often used to soak up excess liquid from spills prior to cleaning with a solvent. You also want them to be able to hold soapy water and assist in removing debris.</p>
<p>However, a sponge that holds a large amount of water is also a sponge that stays wet on your counter after you’re done using it. A wet sponge can become a breeding ground for bacteria, so you’ll want to balance absorbency with a fast drying time.</p>
<p>Last but not least, comfort is a valuable consideration. A sponge is a daily cleaning tool, so if it fits awkwardly in your hand or requires a great amount of effort to scrub off food particles, you’re not going to be inclined to use it. The less strain on your hand and wrists, the better.</p>
<p>We found that the key metrics to use when determining the value and efficiency of a sponge include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scrubbing ability</li>
<li>Longevity</li>
<li>Ergonomics/comfort in your hand</li>
<li>Absorbency</li>
<li>Versatility</li>
<li>How easy is it to rinse out?</li>
<li>Does it scratch surfaces? What types of surfaces?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="types-of-sponges">Types of sponges</h2>
<p>Different types of sponges are needed for different types of jobs. Knowing the type of sponge that works best for your particular cleaning project will save you time and energy. Here is the low-down, including pros and cons, of the different types of sponges.</p>
<h3>Cellulose</h3>
<p>These are the most common types of cleaning sponge; they&#8217;re inexpensive and absorbent. Made from wood pulp and highly porous, cellulose sponges hold water and soap for easy cleaning. However, they have a tendency to trap food particles that can be difficult to fully rinse clean and break down the life of the sponge as well as harbor bacteria.</p>
<h3>Cellulose with abrasive material attached</h3>
<p>These two-sided sponges combine the benefits of cellulose and scrubber for tough jobs like cleaning an oven or BBQ grill. The abrasive side comes in different levels of toughness and some can damage finishes.</p>
<p>Different brands use different colors to indicate abrasiveness level, so check the package to find the level of softness that works for your cleaning job. For everyday usage, a non-scratch low abrasive scrub side works best.</p>
<h3>Microfiber sponges</h3>
<p>With their soft texture, microfiber sponges can be used on any surface, which is why they&#8217;re highly recommended for washing cars and windows. The only downside is that they don’t have the grittiness to effectively remove caked-on debris, but they work well for removing oil and dirt.</p>
<h3>Natural sponges</h3>
<p>Natural sea sponges grow on the ocean’s floors and are 100-percent natural and earth-friendly. These sponges are recommended for projects like washing windows and cars, because they are soft and highly absorbent. They may be too soft to effectively remove caked-on food in the kitchen.</p>
<h3>Dry sponges</h3>
<p>These sponges are usually made from rubber and are great on surfaces that can’t tolerate water such as lampshades and fabric window coverings. They are also commonly used to clean soot after a fire. Once the dry sponge is covered with dirt or dust, you slice that part of the sponge off for a fresh sponge to clean with.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3163 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data.png" alt="Sponge data" width="880" height="586" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-610x406.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-360x240.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-375x250.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-414x276.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-295x196.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-180x120.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-320x213.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-360x240@2x.png 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Test #1: Rinsability</h3>
<p>A sponge dotted with flecks of food sitting out on the sink is unsightly and unhygienic. Bacteria thrive on the food particles and residue left behind on a sponge. Additionally, these particles break down a cellulose sponge and can create odors, so you’ll have to toss it. A sponge that rinses clean lasts longer.</p>
<p>To test rinsability, we used the sponges to remove the ultimate sticky culprits, eggs and cheese. Each sponge was used to scrub a baked egg-and-cheese dish and then rinsed thoroughly under running water.</p>
<p>The Scrub Daddy and O-Cedar Scrunge Scrub Sponge were clear winners in this category, rinsing fully clean with no need to pick little flecks off. The Lysol Multi-Purpose Scrubber, Natural Sea Sponge and TVTimedirect Microfiber Magic Sponge performed well in this test, too.</p>
<p>The other sponges we tested all had residue or food particles left behind, even after being rinsed for several minutes at full force.</p>
<h3>Test #2: Scratch test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3150" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrungeScrub-Pan02.jpg" alt="Sponge cleaning nonstick frying pan" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrungeScrub-Pan02.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrungeScrub-Pan02-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrungeScrub-Pan02-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrungeScrub-Pan02-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrungeScrub-Pan02-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrungeScrub-Pan02-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrungeScrub-Pan02-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrungeScrub-Pan02-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrungeScrub-Pan02-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrungeScrub-Pan02-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>During our research, we found that consumers are concerned about sponge abrasiveness. We wanted to make sure that our sponge finalists wouldn’t dull the surface while removing debris. When deciding which sponges made the cut, it was important for us to consider which surfaces, if any, can be scratched. Some of the surfaces we studied were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wood</li>
<li>Plastic</li>
<li>Copper</li>
<li>Cast iron</li>
<li>Fiberglass</li>
<li>Stainless steel</li>
<li>Vinyl</li>
<li>Car exterior paint</li>
<li>Nonstick coatings</li>
<li>Glass</li>
</ul>
<p>Teflon-coated or other nonstick cookware is easy to damage with an abrasive sponge, and it’s not a good idea to eat food cooked in a nonstick pan that has been scratched. We tested each of the sponges on a frying pan with a nonstick coating.</p>
<p>When you think of the types of foods that you cook in a nonstick pan, including egg and cheese, you know that you need a scrubber that is delicate and won’t scratch while still able to remove baked-on debris.</p>
<p>In order to test this, we gave each sponge a workout on a frying pan with nonstick coating. First, we whipped up a meal of scrambled eggs and cheese, undoubtedly a messy affair.</p>
<p>Then we scoured the pan with one of the sponges to remove all the dried-on bits of egg and cheese to see if it would scratch the nonstick coating in the process. We repeated the process with each of our eight finalists.</p>
<p>All of the sponges passed our scratch test. We felt most confident using the O-Cedar Scrunge Scrubber Sponge, considering that its patented non-scratch scrubbing surface is created by Teflon and endorsed by DuPont, but we were pleased to note that every sponge we tested was able to clean the frying pan in its entirety without damaging the delicate nonstick coating.</p>
<h3>Test #3: Ergonomic comfort</h3>
<p>For this test, we tackled both a load of dirty dishes and a tough bathroom job that required scrubbing a tub in circular motions. We found that in addition to the size and shape of a sponge, firmness and scrubbing power played a role in how comfortable the sponge is to use.</p>
<p>After all, the more pressure and length of time it takes to get something clean, the harder it is on your hand, wrist and arm.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PHH3HVK/?tag=ybdspon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scrub Daddy</a> was the clear winner here, because it fits perfectly in the palm of your hand and can be gripped in two different ways, easing the burden on your hand and wrist since you can change positions.</p>
<p>It’s extremely helpful to be able to change textures as you go along. You can adjust it for either more scrubbing power or softness in your hand and allow you to move along quickly.</p>
<p>We appreciated how little effort it took to get through a load of dishes with the dual scrubbing sides and ability to clean utensils. In the bathroom, we scrubbed with cold water, letting the firm texture take off the soap scum easily.</p>
<p>In the end, the least amount of effort and ability to complete the job quickly made the Scrub Daddy our pick for most ergonomic.</p>
<p>In the same vein, the scrubbing power and relatively thin shape of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0043OWF2A/?tag=ybdspon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scotch-Brite Heavy Duty Scrub Sponge</a> earned it an honorable mention in the ergonomic comfort test.</p>
<h3>Test #4: Absorbency</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3152" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency.png" alt="Sponge absorbency graph" width="880" height="579" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-610x401.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-360x237.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-375x247.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-414x272.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-295x194.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-180x118.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-320x211.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>When you’re cleaning up liquid messes, absorbency becomes a critical factor of a useful sponge. Absorbency is also important in holding soapy water for more cleaning power without scrubbing. In this test, we added one tablespoon of water at a time to each sponge until it reached its capacity.</p>
<p>The Natural Sea Sponge was superior to the other sponges in this test. While most of the sponges held a number of tablespoons, the Natural Sea Sponge held a full cup of liquid. The next most-absorbent sponge, Lysol Multi-Purpose Scrubber, held almost half a cup.</p>
<h3>Test #5: Drying time</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3153" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time.png" alt="Sponge drying time graph" width="880" height="579" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-610x401.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-360x237.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-375x247.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-414x272.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-295x194.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-180x118.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-320x211.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Drying time is important, because a sponge that stays damp for hours can breed bacteria, especially if there are food particles trapped inside. In a test of drying time, we completely soaked and wrung out a sponge and left it out on the sink to dry.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the most absorbent sponges took the longest to dry and the least absorbent was fastest, even when they were completely wrung out.</p>
<p>The Scrub Daddy, holding three tablespoons of water, dried in eight hours. The Dobie Cleaning Pad, which held the same amount of liquid, was a close second at approximately nine hours.</p>
<p>This means that you could sanitize these sponges at the end of a day, and they would dry overnight. On the other end of the spectrum, the sea sponge and microfiber sponges took a little more than 24 hours to completely dry.</p>

<p>While sponges are a highly effective cleaning tool, the downside is that they can be an ideal breeding ground for dangerous bacteria. Organisms can become lodged in between the sponge, and in this moist environment with plenty of food, new bacteria can grow at the rate of once every 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Not something you want to think about it when you’re using that same sponge on a later load of dishes.</p>
<p>In order to lower the risk of cross-contamination, we recommend that you clean your sponges daily.</p>
<p>There are a few different cleaning techniques. The best bet is to completely submerge the sponge in a bleach-and-water mixture. Make a disinfecting solution with one part bleach to nine parts water (about 14 ounces of bleach to about 14 cups of water) and soak the sponge for 30 seconds or longer. Store the excess solution in an empty plastic milk jug under the sink so you always have it on hand, since you’ll want a fresh bowl of bleach solution for each session.</p>
<p>Microwaving your sponge is another means of disinfection. The sponge should be submerged in a bowl of water and then placed in the microwave. This can be more difficult as the water must be heated to a boil in order to kill bacteria.</p>
<p>After sanitizing with either method, wring the sponge out, and allow it to dry to prevent any new bacteria from growing. Cleaning your sponge on a regular basis will help reduce the risk of growing and spreading bacteria, but you should also replace it frequently. This is especially important with kitchen sponges. Odor indicates the presence of bacteria, so if it starts to have a smell, make sure to toss it out immediately.</p>
<p>In addition to cleaning your sponge and replacing it regularly, there are a few “don’ts” to keep in mind. Remember that sponges can’t do everything. Avoid wiping up meat juices from ground beef or poultry in order to prevent cross-contamination and food poisoning. In general, avoid cleaning countertops with sponges. Your best bet in these cases is paper towels or disinfectant wipes.</p>
<h2 id="top-pick">Top pick: Scrub Daddy</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3156 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-animated.gif" alt="scrub daddy gif" width="900" height="600" /><br />
If you watch Shark Tank, you may be aware that the Scrub Daddy Original “boasts the most revenue of any business to appear on Shark Tank since the show first aired in 2009”. Priced between three to four dollars each, this sponge has received a lot of attention. We found that it lives up to the hype.</p>
<p>One of the most fascinating things about the Scrub Daddy is its ability to change texture. In warm water, it’s softer and more pliable. In cool water, it’s rigid with more scrubbing power. It only takes a matter of seconds to change textures. You can move from job to job and different types of surfaces without needing to switch sponges.</p>

<p>There are not many sponges that are both scratch-free and can be used to clean a BBQ grill. The Scrub Daddy’s silicone surface glided along the pan without any noise or snags. It removed the food and oil quickly, too, so you weren’t putting extra pressure on the pan as you cleaned.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, it fits into small spaces and has thorough coverage. It tackles both big jobs, like baked-on cheese, and delicate jobs like wine glasses. Another cool feature to the Scrub Daddy is you can use it dry to make light work of removing older, set-in stains. The upside to its relative lack of absorbency is that it dries much faster, and food particles do not stick to the surface.</p>
<p>Since bacteria thrive on a moist environment and a food supply of trapped particles, the Scrub Daddy is less likely to harbor nasty bacteria. It can also be thrown in the washing machine or dishwasher. In fact, one of the ways you can tell that this sponge is more hygienic than other sponges is its refreshing lack of odor.</p>
<p>The Scrub Daddy smile is more than just a pretty face — it’s actually part of the design. The ergonomic shape is designed to clean both sides of kitchen utensils at once, and the eye holes give you a good grip, similar to a bowling ball. The smile part of the sponge accommodates the curve of dishes and is especially convenient for cleaning spoons.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the &#8220;hair&#8221; on top of the sponge, which we found to be more effective than a bottle brush at getting into awkward corners like drinking glasses and coffee mugs.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3155 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02.png" alt="scrub daddy with spatula" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02.png 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-425x283.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-885x590.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-1-360x240.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-375x250.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-414x276.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-295x197.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-180x120.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-320x213.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Each sponge should last at least two months before becoming less effective. Some reviews suggest that the Scrub Daddy fell apart quickly, but we did not find this to be true in our testing. It may not look as fresh as one right out the box, but it was still effective and fairly sturdy after a week’s use on a variety of surfaces. At the end of two months, we found that it had held up to everyday use and fit even better into small spaces.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the bright yellow color and smiley face make this sponge fun to use (especially for kids). It’s also a little more aesthetically appealing to leave at your sink than a traditional sponge. You can thread the smile right onto your faucet handle, which keeps it off your kitchen counter.</p>
<p>We tested the drying time on the faucet handle to see if the Scrub Daddy dried faster than leaving it on a flat surface, but we found that it didn’t speed up the drying time.</p>
<p>Gravity caused the top half to dry quickly, but water pooled in the bottom half and took the same amount of time to dry as when we left it on a flat surface. We still appreciated this feature, since storing your sponge in a dry location is one of the best ways to keep your sponge clean.</p>
<p>It also has some very creative uses that you wouldn’t expect with a traditional sponge; for instance, you can use it as a loofah in the shower or remove paint from your fingernails and hands.</p>
<p>Scrub Daddy fits perfectly in the kitchen-sink drain, so you can prevent carrot peels or hard-boiled egg shells from going down the drain. Chrome fixtures shine like new when you clean them with an almost dry product. You can even use a Scrub Daddy sponge in a potted plant for an aerating effect and good drainage.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B017Y4E1RM/?tag=ybdspon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">O-Cedar &#8211; Multi-Use Scrunge Scrub Sponge</a> is a dense cellulose sponge with an abrasive side in the form of a three-dimensional scrubber. Thanks to a unique rippled surface that breaks up and lifts away dirt, it takes one-tenth the amount of elbow grease to remove debris than other sponges.</p>
<p>The O-Cedar sponge stands up to the tough jobs like boiler pans and stovetops while gliding along a nonstick frying pan. In fact, this sponge is the only product endorsed by DuPont for use on Teflon nonstick coatings.</p>

<p>What really impressed us about this sponge is how well it rinses clean. The scrubber part doesn’t trap food particles, even pesky egg and cheese residue don’t stick to this sponge. It’s no fun to switch back and forth between different types of sponges when you’re trying to clean a kitchen.</p>
<p>With the Scrunge, you can go from one task to the next, because it rinses thoroughly clean no matter what kind of job it has just tackled. This means that it can stand up to a lot of use.</p>
<p>The sponges are reported to be up to 20 percent more durable, and they are odor resistant up to two months, so there are no foul smells. The thickness of the cellulose sponge makes it more absorbent than some of the other brands, yet it still fits comfortably in the palm of your hand. At two dollars a sponge, the Scrunge Scrub Sponge gives you a lot of bang for your buck.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Scrunge Scrub Sponge is the only sponge recommended by Dupont® for use on their Teflon® coated cookware.</li>
<li>The Scrunge Scrub Sponge rated high in our rinsability test, thoroughly removing the egg, cheese and other food particles.</li>

<p>Sometimes you need a scrub sponge that will go above and beyond the call of duty. When you need to clean pots that you left overnight or scrape off baked-on food from oven racks, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0043OWF2A/?tag=ybdspon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scotch-Brite &#8211; Heavy Duty Scrub Sponge</a> is the one to use.</p>
<p>The Scotch-Brite sponge is softer than steel wool but equally effective on deep cleaning projects. Do make sure to test this sponge in a hidden area because it is tough enough to damage some finishes and you won’t want to use it on stainless steel appliances.</p>

<p>We found it especially useful in the bathroom, where we used it with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004PWPE6O/?tag=ybdspon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bon Ami Polishing Cleanser</a> to attack soap scum on tile and the tub. At three-fourths of an inch thick, this sponge is thinner than the other dual-sided cellulose sponges we tested and comfortable to hold. They stayed intact (the abrasive side didn’t separate from the cellulose sponge) even with some heavy duty cleaning.</p>
<p>At less than a dollar per sponge, these are handy to keep around for all of your tough cleaning jobs and cheap enough to toss out after really nasty cleaning projects, or if they begin to harbor any odors.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When we needed to bust out the big guns, the Scotch-Brite Heavy Duty was our answer.</li>

<p>Unlike synthetic sponges (often made from polyurethane foam) or even cellulose sponges (which can have a polyester filling and/or nylon scrubbing pads), The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000I1RUXG/?tag=ybdspon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Natural Sea Sponge</a> is 100-percent biodegradable, free from toxins and hypo-allergenic.</p>
<p>They’ve also been used for more than 2,000 years, for a variety of purposes, so you know you aren’t falling for the latest fad. The Natural Sea Sponge is a quickly renewable natural resource that is native to the waters surrounding Florida.</p>

<p>While the size and soft texture of this sponge made it a little unwieldy for doing dishes, we were impressed with its versatility. If it’s a little too large for your job, you can cut it in half without damaging the sponge.</p>
<p>The softness, incredible absorbency and pliability make it a great choice for washing floors, upholstery, windows and cars. This sponge is especially popular for cars, because it won’t scratch the metal. It held a cup of water in our test and made a fine lather with liquid soap.</p>
<p>These sponges are often used when painting to create a textured look and are great for clean up, because they rinse out well and stand the test of time. They can even be used in the shower as a personal care product.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s nice to know that you’re not harming the planet when you purchase a sustainably harvested natural sponge.</li>
<li>This sponge holds a full cup of water and is incredibly soft, making light work of your Saturday afternoon car washing chore.</li>

<h3>Scotch-Brite &#8211; Dobie Cleaning Pad</h3>
<p>This sponge is an old faithful that you probably saw in your mom’s kitchen. It’s been around for years. When a sponge has been around since 1958, you know that countless numbers of consumers have tried, approved and continue to buy this classic product.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001E6KF5Y/?tag=ybdspon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dobie Cleaning Pad</a> is like two sponges in one: a soap-holding sponge wrapped in nylon netting. It has exceptional scouring power without being as abrasive as steel wool. We found it to be quite versatile and was equally effective at removing lasagne residue from pans and insects from a car window. It lasted two months with regular cleaning, and you can toss it in the dishwasher.</p>
<p>Compared to other sponges, the Dobie Cleaning Pad is thin and easy to hold. Even while completely dry, it can easily be manipulated and fits into the palm of your hand. This may not be the sponge you want to use to soak up a large liquid mess, but we appreciated how quickly it dries out, making it a less hospitable environment for bacteria.</p>
<p>Food particles can get caught in the netting, so it does need to be rinsed thoroughly after cleaning dishes. You’ll also need to be careful when cleaning knives, as it can cut the netting. It has a special coating that glides over surfaces, giving it a slippery feeling, especially when used with <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-dish-soap/" rel="noopener">dish soap</a>.</p>
<p>In our testing, the Dobie Cleaning Pad did not scratch Teflon nonstick, stainless steel, glass, plastic or tile surfaces. However, you still should be careful and always test first in an inconspicuous area. It should not be used to clean glass aquariums or painted surfaces.</p>
<p>It will remove paint, and while that makes it less valuable in the scratch-free metric, it also makes the sponge versatile when you need to remove paint from surfaces and is yet gentle enough to remove paint from your skin.</p>
<h3>TVTimedirect &#8211; Microfiber Magic Sponge</h3>
<p>There’s a lot to be said about a microfiber sponge that can absorb dirt and oil but is soft enough that it won’t scratch or damage surfaces. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VSB7YE/?tag=ybdspon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TVTimedirect Microfiber Magic Sponge</a> is a greener option than other sponges, because it can be washed in the washing machine and requires little or no detergent.</p>
<p>One side is microfiber and when used dry, works like a microfiber cloth and naturally attracts dust. When used wet, it soaks up a spill and doesn’t leave any liquid on your counter or floor. On the other side with dark- and light-blue lines, the surface has a dual-action surface that scrubs and absorbs.</p>
<p>We found the scrubber side was able to able to remove cheese and egg without any detergent. It did take extra pressure to remove the cheese, which was more tiring on the arm, but because it’s so soft, it didn’t cause any damage to the frying pan. It also rinses clean, so you don’t have to worry about food particles going in the washing machine.</p>
<p>These cost about two dollars each when purchased in a value pack and are able to be washed and reused, so it’s an economic and environmentally friendly choice.</p>
<h3>Lysol &#8211; Multi-Purpose Scrub Sponge</h3>
<p>Found in multipacks for around a dollar a sponge, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005HGRL2M/?tag=ybdspon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lysol Multi-Purpose Scrub Sponge</a> is great for everyday use, because it’s durable, rinses clean and contains an antimicrobial agent built into the fibers that inhibits the growth of odor-causing bacteria.</p>
<p>We appreciated the dense, super-absorbent sponge that feels nice in the hand and allows you to create a soapy lather on your dishes. Since it soaks up almost half a cup of liquid, this is the sponge to grab if you spill a glass of water.</p>
<p>The scrubber is non-scratch and passed our nonstick coating test, but you’ll want to test the scrub part on your surface in a hidden area as some dulling of finish can happen.</p>
<h3>Superior Performance &#8211; Ultra Micro Fiber Sponge</h3>
<p>This is another reusable sponge that functions more like a dishrag than a sponge, as it can be thrown in both the washer and dryer when it needs cleaning. You can also rest easy knowing this sponge is fume and chemical free.</p>
<p>These absorbent sponges are ideal for wiping up spills, and they hold soap well, but we found them to be on the soft side for cleaning jobs that need a little more oomph, and food particles did stick to the fabric.</p>
<p>Unlike with cellulose sponges, food residue isn’t an issue in terms of longevity, because the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J4QUJQQ/?tag=ybdspon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superior Performance &#8211; Ultra Micro Fiber Miracle Sponge</a> is washable and reusable. They are on the thicker side and we found them to be a little too large to hold comfortably for long periods of time. It was also harder to clean smaller items like the insides of glasses.</p>
<p>Overall, we found this sponge to be a good go-to for general purpose use and safely cleaning nonstick cookware.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>We found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PHH3HVK/?tag=ybdspon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scrub Daddy</a> was the most versatile, able to wash dishes, remove soap scum from a bathtub and scour the insects off of a tire wheel and car exterior without scratching the paint.</p>
<p>Out of our five tests — Rinsability, Scratch Test, Ergonomic Comfort, Drying Time and Absorbency — the Scrub Daddy surpassed the other sponges four out of five times. Scrub Daddy dried the fastest of all eight finalists. Thus, despite its lesser rating for absorbency, the Scrub Daddy has high value, being extraordinarily versatile and ultra hygienic.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Eight household tests of seven different glass cleaners, including a DIY option, led us to pick Windex as the best overall window cleaner. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter nearly 40 hours of reading, researching, spraying and wiping, we determined that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FIG975O/?tag=ybdwind-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Windex</a> is the best window cleaner available. It’s powerful enough to break up grease and food stains on a variety of surfaces without leaving behind spots or streaks. Windex outperformed seven other glass cleaners by consistently eliminating blemishes and impurities and producing crystal-clear views and reflections. For a glass cleaner that attacks grease — like on your microwave — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000W6AUT8/?tag=ybdwind-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Weiman</a> proved a star performer.</p>

<h2 id="how-we">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We started by reading user reviews, marketing materials, consumer reports, and homecare blogs. Then, we dove into the science and debate about chemicals, exposure, safety, and do-it-yourself alternatives.</p>
<p>We looked at subreddits, like /r/homemaking, /r/diy, and even /r/autodetailing to find out what consumers think about the best glass cleaners on the market. With this information, we whittled our field down to six brands that represented the different methods of cleaning glass.</p>
<p>We opted to try one homemade recipe, one plant-based product, two cleaners containing ammonia, two aerosol sprays and one of the most well-known window-cleaning brands. We tested these products for their ability to eliminate dirt and germs on a variety of glass and other surfaces while leaving a streak-free finish.</p>

<h2 id="why-you">When you need to use window cleaners</h2>
<p>Window-cleaning products became popular because they don’t leave behind the streaks that soap and other common cleaners often leave. A window or mirror looks clean when the oils and dirt are removed to reveal a crystal-clear view or reflection. But when glass is obstructed by streaky residue, it can be an eyesore.</p>
<p>You don’t want glass surfaces to just look clean, you want them to be disinfected and completely free of germs. Each one of our top seven products have ingredients that specifically disinfect surfaces.</p>
<p>While ammonia alone may kill many germs, like salmonella and E. coli, it isn’t recognized as a disinfectant by the FDA. Even when combined with isopropyl alcohol — as in Windex — it is not an effective defense against staphylococcus and other dangerous bacteria.</p>
<p>Other chemicals commonly used in glass cleaners offer more protection against germs, but if used improperly, they can cause irritation to the skin and respiratory system. Vinegar is a great natural antibacterial disinfectant, but many find the smell offensive, and it sometimes fails to thoroughly clean tough jobs.</p>
<h2 id="when-you">When you shouldn’t use glass/window cleaner</h2>
<p>While window cleaners are great products for many jobs around the house, they need to be kept away from certain tasks.<strong> For the most part,</strong> <strong>window/glass cleaners are not intended for use on automobile surfaces and tinted glass</strong> <strong>because common ingredients will damage them.</strong></p>
<p>Many manufacturers of glass cleaners offer separate products for automobile use, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Glass-Premium-Cleaner-91164/dp/B0007OWD2M?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ybdwind-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stoner</a> does claim that their glass cleaner spray is safe for car surfaces.</p>

<p><strong>Televisions and computer monitors shouldn’t be cleaned with glass-cleaning solutions</strong>. Unlike televisions from 20 years ago, modern TVs aren’t made of thick glass but of extremely thin layers of plastics, adhesives, display elements, and other materials.</p>
<p>When liquid penetrates these delicate layers, the monitors are ruined. A dry microfiber sheet should easily alleviate smudges, smears, and fingerprints from any modern monitor or display.</p>
<p>Another common mistake is using glass cleaner to scrub eye glasses. Yes, “glass” may be in the name, but eyeglasses are covered with a coating that’s unique to the prescription and ensures proper vision. Soap and warm water are best.</p>
<h2 id="the-best">The best way to clean windows</h2>
<p>Professional window washers tend to use soapy water and a squeegee for commercial jobs. While this is an effective technique for large outdoor projects, it’s not a practical solution for most indoor home cleaning.</p>
<p>Inside smudges and fingerprints are caused by oily residue that must be cut by something other than water and soap alone. In addition, the squeegee technique can be messy: each stroke creates an excess of water that must be deposited somewhere and inevitably ends up on window sills and floors.</p>
<p>Particularly indoors, you want to use a fabric that collects the liquid that’s sprayed on the glass — but which fabric?</p>
<p>While <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-paper-towels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper towels</a> are useful to keep around the house, we found through our research that they’re not ideal for cleaning glass. First, they are made with dyes and adhesives that actually bind sheets together to make rolls of two-ply. These substances will leave streaks of their own, separate from those left by any residual cleaning liquid. Paper towels also leave behind lint, and they’re not the best choice for the environment or your wallet.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2367" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GlassCleaners_DirtyWindow-Spray.jpg" alt="dirty window" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GlassCleaners_DirtyWindow-Spray.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GlassCleaners_DirtyWindow-Spray-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GlassCleaners_DirtyWindow-Spray-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GlassCleaners_DirtyWindow-Spray-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GlassCleaners_DirtyWindow-Spray-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GlassCleaners_DirtyWindow-Spray-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GlassCleaners_DirtyWindow-Spray-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GlassCleaners_DirtyWindow-Spray-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GlassCleaners_DirtyWindow-Spray-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GlassCleaners_DirtyWindow-Spray-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Many people swear by using newspaper to clean their windows. It does a great job of eliminating streaks, but it lacks real absorbency, which means going through lots of it or using a paper towel first and then buffing away the streaks and lint with a sheet of newspaper.</p>
<p>We found that microfiber towels were the easiest to use and the most reliable for cleaning dirt, absorbing liquid, and leaving no trace of streaks or residue. Microfiber towels are constructed with a synthetic blend of polyester and polyamide. The fibers are extremely small, measuring about ⅕ the diameter of human hair. This means they’re soft, durable and absorbent — perfect for cleaning not just windows but almost anything.</p>
<p>Once we selected the proper tool, we started researching method of cleaning. Interestingly, we learned that the weather can have a significant impact. We found that if you’re cleaning windows on a hot sunny day, you’ll end up with streaks — no matter what kind of material or product you use. The sun will dry the liquid on the glass before you’re able to wipe it clean, so it’s best to wait until dusk or a cloudy day.</p>
<p>Before we tested our products, we practiced several variations of wipe strokes, amount of liquid, and timing and application. The following steps are our recommendations for cleaning all glass surfaces.</p>
<h2 id="how-to">How to clean glass</h2>
<ol>
<li>Hold the nozzle six inches from the surface.</li>
<li>Spray directly onto the glass.</li>
<li>Spray evenly in horizontal rows, six inches apart. This should ensure that the circumference of the sprays overlap on the glass.</li>
<li>Using a microfiber towel, slowly swipe left to right once over each row, applying a gentle to slightly-moderate amount of pressure.</li>
<li>The second time through, use a motion from the top of the glass to the bottom, applying a bit more pressure to absorb all the remaining liquid.</li>
<li>Finally, use a fresh, clean, dry microfiber towel to vigorously buff out any imperfections left on the glass.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="other-uses">Other uses for window/glass cleaners</h2>
<p>Glass cleaners are perfect for tackling dirty windows and mirrors, but they’re also capable of doing so much more.</p>
<p>We found that glass cleaners can be used to clean the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>The surfaces of kitchen appliances</li>
<li>Doorknobs</li>
<li>Bathtubs</li>
<li>Dry-erase boards</li>
<li>Fabric</li>
<li>Carpet</li>
<li>Jewelry</li>
</ul>
<p>Surfaces other than glass — like granite, marble, laminate, and tile — are safe to clean with most glass/window cleaners. The same ingredients designed to cut oily smudges on mirrors will also cut the greasy buildup on kitchen appliances, like blenders and coffee makers. Even stains on fabric and carpet can be broken up and easily removed by applying glass cleaner.</p>
<p>Another great task for glass cleaners is jewelry. Sterling silver and diamonds in particular can really be made to sparkle and shine with a just a small bit of the solution.</p>
<p>The most fascinating application of glass cleaner is combatting insects. A small bowl of the glass cleaner can be left out on the counter to deter them from a particular area. A small amount rubbed onto the skin can even relieve pain from a bee sting.</p>
<h2 id="the-diy">The DIY movement</h2>
<p>The do-it-yourself, or DIY, movement has coincided with the rise of the internet in the last 20 years. The substantial amount of information available on DIY projects — from automotive repair to better housekeeping — is easily accessed through blogs, video tutorials and social media. Projects that were once thought of as challenging, or even impossible, are now easily demystified.</p>
<p>DIY solutions are appealing because they can be personalized, can utilize natural ingredients and can be cheaper than some commercial offerings.</p>
<h2 id="diy">How to make DIY window cleaner</h2>
<p>Many glass cleaners rely on a solution of chemicals, including ammonia. While commercial glass-cleaning products are considered safe for regular home use, there are ways to avoid them.</p>
<p>The best way is to make your own glass cleaner using white vinegar, cornstarch, water and essential oils.</p>
<p><a href="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/diy-window-cleaner.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3774 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ig-btn.png" alt="link to DIY window cleaner infogrpahic" width="900" height="179" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ig-btn.png 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ig-btn-610x121.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ig-btn-885x176.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ig-btn-360x72.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ig-btn-375x75.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ig-btn-414x82.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ig-btn-295x59.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ig-btn-180x36.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ig-btn-320x64.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></a></p>
<p>While the end result may not be as streak-free as a window cleaned with Windex, using a homemade cleaner could be worthwhile for those who want to save some money and also want to use a product that only includes ingredients they are comfortable with.</p>
<p>We could have devoted an entire post to the topic of creating the best DIY window cleaner. Many people believe that simply mixing water with soap is sufficient, while others claim it’s not enough to avoid streaking. Some tout the advantages of rubbing alcohol, lemon juice and ammonia, but there are just as many who swear by vinegar alone.</p>
<p>We wanted to create an alternative that was all-natural, so we disregarded recipes that called for ammonia. We also avoided using dish-washing liquid or other manufactured soaps that relied on buying and watering down a store-bought cleaning solution.</p>
<p>We tried several combinations of the most popular ingredients with varying results. We decided to move forward with a slightly modified version of a recipe provided by <a href="http://www.crunchybetty.com/battle-of-the-homemade-glass-cleaners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crunchy Betty</a>, who performed similar tests using different natural ingredients and concluded that warm water, white vinegar and cornstarch provided the best results.</p>
<h2>Ingredients in the Crunchy Betty DIY Solution</h2>
<p><video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" muted="" width="100%" height="auto"><source src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ybd-glass-cleaner-675.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video></p>
<p>Vinegar is by far the most recommended household cleaning alternative to a store-bought product. Vinegar is a weak form of acetic acid that is formed by the fermentation of sugars or starches. It cuts through grease and dirt and is a powerful disinfectant against common household bacteria. Vinegar can also help remove odors from the air and from surfaces.</p>
<p>Corn starch is an important ingredient because it eliminates streaking. Streaking happens because glass is not entirely smooth. The surface of glass contains microscopic pits and divots that collect water molecules, which bond to other water molecules as a cleaner is being wiped off.</p>
<p>This results in a streak of molecules fighting to bond with the water stuck in the tiny pits of the glass. Corn starch disrupts the ability of hydrogen atoms — found in both the glass cleaner and in water — to bond, thus making it easier to remove all the water from the glass.</p>
<p>Water is essential to combine, dissolve and deliver all of the ingredients onto the glass. We recommend using filtered or even distilled water to avoid dirt or contaminants leaving any visible residue on the glass’ surface. Warm water will help to diffuse dust and carry away impurities.</p>
<p>Finally, we wanted to add essential oil to our homemade glass cleaner. We love essential oils because they leave a clean, long-lasting smell. (Read our post on <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-essential-oil-diffuser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">essential oil diffusers</a> for more information.) We also discovered that, similar to cornstarch, essential oil helps combat streaking by preventing the bonding of hydrogen atoms in water molecules.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>Manufacturers of window cleaner rely on a variety of chemicals and compounds to create their products. Learning just a bit about these substances will help you make an informed decision about their effectiveness and potential health impact. Because glass surfaces, like mirrors and windows, are cleaned frequently and touched regularly, it’s important to understand what exactly goes into their cleaning products.</p>
<p>A substantial amount of information is available about many of these ingredients. It can sometimes be complex, contradictory, alarmist and hard to interpret. For those who are interested, we encourage you to look into it for yourselves. What follows is an introductory discussion about some of the most featured ingredients in glass cleaners.</p>
<h3>Ammonia</h3>
<p>Ammonia is one of the most widely used chemicals in the United States. It’s mostly added to fertilizer and other agricultural products as well as cleaners, pesticides, plastics, and water purifiers. It is an active ingredient in both Windex and Zep Streak-Free Glass Cleaner. The other five products we tested are ammonia-free.</p>
<p>Ammonia is included in many household cleaners because it evaporates fast, preventing streaks — which our testing confirmed. Because it evaporates so fast, many argue that health risks are minimal. However, ammonia is extremely toxic, and overexposure can cause respiratory and skin irritation as well as asthmatic and allergic reactions. Contact with the eyes or accidental ingestion of products containing ammonia will require professional medical attention.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that not only is ammonia highly flammable, but it can also create a dangerous chemical reaction when combined with bleach. When bleach is mixed with ammonia, toxic gases called chloramines are produced. These chloramines can cause nausea, shortness of breath and fluid to accumulate in the lungs. Be sure to keep these two chemicals away from each other and away from children.</p>
<h3>Glycol ethers</h3>
<p>Glycol ethers are a group of solvents that are common in many cleaners, degreasers and water-based paints. In addition to causing a sore throat when inhaled, glycol ethers can contribute to narcosis, pulmonary edema and severe liver and kidney damage when inhaled in significant quantities, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/haps/health-effects-notebook-hazardous-air-pollutants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the EPA</a>. Chemicals that fall under the glycol ether umbrella include 2-Butoxyethanol (an ingredient in Weiman Glass Cleaner and Zep Streak-Free Glass Cleaner), propylene glycol (an ingredient in Windex) and methyl ether (an ingredient in Glass Plus Glass Cleaner Trigger).</p>
<p>Glycol ethers attack dirt, grease and soap scum by dissolving them and making them easier to remove. When cleaning with products containing these chemicals, proper ventilation is essential. Turn on fans, open windows, and go outside for fresh air at the first signs of discomfort or irritation.</p>
<h3>Fragrances</h3>

<p>Almost all the products we tested (with the exception of Seventh Generation Free &amp; Clear Glass &amp; Surface Cleaner and our DIY solution) contain some type of fragrance agent. In an effort to protect proprietary information, manufacturers do not break down exactly what creates these scents. Often, fragrances are made with phthalates, which have been linked to several adverse medical conditions, including damage to the liver, kidneys and lungs.</p>
<p>Phthalates also cause a reaction in the endocrine system that leads to disruption and ultimately impacts reproductive health, particularly male sperm count. Again, because companies are not required to disclose the components of their fragrances, it’s impossible to determine which do and do not contain phthalates and in what concentrations.</p>
<h3>Other ingredients</h3>
<p>There are many other ingredients that go into creating our top six products. Some have raised more concerns than others. Manufacturers of these products are not required to list the ingredients on the bottle, and most don’t. While some companies provide a list of ingredients online, there is no guarantee that these lists are complete.</p>
<p>Recently there have been efforts at both the state and federal level to require disclosure of all ingredients in household chemicals directly on the packaging. Because information and transparency are essential to making fair comparisons and wise decisions, we encourage you to do some of your own research into these products and others that you use frequently around your home.</p>
<p>Regardless of which product you buy, there are several universal rules for increasing safety and limiting exposure to any potentially damaging chemicals.</p>
<h4>Rules for Safe Cleaning</h4>
<ol>
<li>Increase ventilation as much as possible. Open windows and turn on fans.</li>
<li>Do not use glass cleaners on dishware, cooking utensils or children’s toys.</li>
<li>Keep away from open flames and high heat.</li>
<li>Store out of reach of children.</li>
<li>Use as directed and contact a medical professional if you experience any alarming symptoms.</li>
</ol>
<p>While all the products we tested are liquids, they are delivered by two different methods: spray bottle and aerosol can. The offerings from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Glass-Premium-Cleaner-91164/dp/B0007OWD2M?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ybdwind-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stoner</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weiman-Glass-Cleaner-Aerosol-19/dp/B000W6AUT8?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ybdwind-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Weiman</a> are both aerosols, though neither contains CFSs, which have been proven to slowly deplete the ozone layer.</p>
<p>These cans are metallic, and their contents are under extreme pressure. Exposure to high heat or accidental puncture of the cans can be dangerous.</p>
<p>The advantage of aerosol is that it produces more of a foaming substance when it’s applied to a surface. These foams provide more complete coverage and saturation while also breaking down difficult-to-remove fats and sediment.</p>
<p>All of the other products, including the one we made ourselves, are applied with a spray bottle. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seventh-Generation-Surface-Cleaner-Ounces/dp/B0004JKOVW?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ybdwind-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Seventh Generation Free &amp; Clear Glass &amp; Surface Cleaner</a> comes in a bottle with a childproof mechanism that makes it very difficult to remove the nozzle. Even though Seventh Generation has the least objectionable ingredients, this is a nice feature to guard against accidental ingestion by children.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2415" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/window-cleaners_overall-chart.png" alt="window-cleaners_overall-chart" width="880" height="701" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/window-cleaners_overall-chart.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/window-cleaners_overall-chart-610x486.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/window-cleaners_overall-chart-360x287.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/window-cleaners_overall-chart-375x299.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/window-cleaners_overall-chart-414x330.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/window-cleaners_overall-chart-295x235.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/window-cleaners_overall-chart-180x143.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/window-cleaners_overall-chart-320x255.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>In order to fairly compare the prices of our products, we calculated their price per ounce based on popular packaging sold on Amazon at the time of publishing.</p>
<p>To calculate the cost of our DIY glass cleaner, we also combined the costs of the ingredients we used, which were purchased at local grocery stores. We then calculated the cost based on the portion of the product we used for our mixture.</p>
<p>Our simple, homemade Your Best Digs cleaner is by far the cheapest way (per ounce) to clean glass surfaces although it is more costly, both in time and money, upfront.</p>
<p>Windex is the least expensive commercial product, but it should be noted that buying large refill containers, like the 128-ounce Windex offering on Amazon.com, typically lowers price regardless of the brand. Seventh Generation is the most expensive because of its plant-based ingredients.</p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2373" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/window-cleaners_streak-chart.png" alt="window cleaner streak chart" width="880" height="653" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/window-cleaners_streak-chart.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/window-cleaners_streak-chart-610x453.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/window-cleaners_streak-chart-360x267.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/window-cleaners_streak-chart-375x278.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/window-cleaners_streak-chart-414x307.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/window-cleaners_streak-chart-295x219.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/window-cleaners_streak-chart-180x134.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/window-cleaners_streak-chart-320x237.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Windows must be cleaned from both the inside and the outside. We simulated cleaning the outside of a living room window by smearing mud and dirt on it and letting it set. Then, we pressed an olive oil-coated hand against the window and smeared it around to mimic greasy palm prints. After five minutes, we used each product to tackle the job of cleaning the window.</p>
<p>In terms of both removing the substances and leaving a streak-free finish, the products from Windex and Zep Streak-Free Glass Cleaner distinguished themselves as superior to the others. Both glass cleaners clung to the window without running, which helped them penetrate the more difficult stains. The complete absence of streaks or fog left the windows stunningly clear.</p>

<p>The two aerosol products, Weiman Glass Cleaner and Stoner Invisible Glass Cleaner, proved to be powerful as well. The foaming spray loosened up even the toughest parts of the mess, allowing it to be easily wiped away. However, they also left the windows just a bit streaky. The streaks were not distracting or even all that obvious, but they were noticeable from certain angles. The Glass Plus Glass Cleaner Trigger also cleaned well but left even more noticeable streaking.</p>
<p>Seventh Generation Surface Cleaner and our DIY cleaner had more difficulty eliminating signs of the mess — especially the oily hand prints. While the prints themselves were removed, residue from the oil remained on the window and left visible streaks. Even after prolonged buffing, the windows weren’t as clean as they were when we tested Windex and Zep.</p>
<h3>Mirrors</h3>
<p>If windows account for the largest surface area of glass in the house, mirrors are probably second. And although this is technically a review of window cleaners, you may apply the cleaner in other contexts. Bathroom mirrors in particular put up with a lot of abuse. Sprays, gels, creams, lotions and fingerprints smudge mirrors on a daily basis.</p>
<p>To simulate these real-world cleaning situations, we applied a dime-sized amount of toothpaste to a fingertip and smeared it across the bathroom mirror. We then did the same with a dime-sized drop of hair gel. We let the smudge marks set for 15 minutes and then used our glass-cleaning method to tackle the task.</p>
<p>Many of the products easily removed the stains, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Windex®-Complete-Glass-Surface-Cleaner/dp/B01FIG975O/?tag=ybdwind-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Windex</a> did so with only moderate pressure being applied and it required very little buffing to completely eliminate streaks. The mirror simply looked the best after it had been cleaned with the Windex solution.</p>
<p>Glass Plus was effective, but we needed to apply more effort and pressure to scrub away the toothpaste. There were also slight streaks left on the surface.</p>
<p>The products from Weiman Glass Cleaner and Zep Streak-Free Glass Cleaner left behind faint streaks that were detectable depending on our angle and distance from the glass.</p>
<p>Our homemade solution easily removed the blemishes but left the mirror looking cloudy and a bit dull. It was a noticeable difference compared to the commercially available options.</p>
<p>Seventh Generation took care of the problem substances just fine but failed to remove lingering specks of dust. Even prolonged buffing could not eliminate these tiny but visible imperfections.</p>
<p>The Stoner cleaner worked on the hair gel quickly but required additional applications to fully scrub off the toothpaste. The instructions on the can state that second and third applications may be needed to loosen and absorb trace deposits. But even after the third application we still observed a bit of residue.</p>
<h3>Exploding chili in the microwave</h3>

<p>Having put our finalists through a battery of traditional test situations, we wanted to see how they stood up to a particularly dirty and all-too-frequent occurrence — food exploding in the microwave. Our microwave has a rotating glass tray, a plexiglass door and plastic interior surfaces.</p>
<p>We put a glass bowl of chili in the microwave and cooked it for six minutes on high, which eventually produced a mess that we’ve all seen before. After each explosive event, we let the chili dry for 30 minutes and then used each glass cleaner to attempt to make our microwave sparkle again.</p>
<p>The two aerosol products, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Glass-Premium-Cleaner-91164/dp/B0007OWD2M?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ybdwind-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stoner’s Invisible Glass</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000W6AUT8/?tag=ybdwind-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Weiman Glass Cleaner</a>, emit a foamy, thicker substance that attacked the chili much better than our other finalists. It was incredibly easy to remove even the dried portions of our lunch that had set into the inside of the door.</p>
<p>Among the liquid spray options, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Windex®-Complete-Glass-Surface-Cleaner/dp/B01FIG975O/?tag=ybdwind-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Windex</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zep-Commercial-ZU112032-Streak-Free-Cleaner/dp/B002ZZDQ0Y?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ybdwind-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zep Commercial Glass Cleaner</a> performed the best. Although both required a bit more elbow grease and attention, we were able to completely remove any evidence of the chili.</p>
<p>Our homemade cleaner, Glass Plus, and Seventh Generation were all disappointing in the chili test. Glass Plus and Seventh Generation couldn’t break up the caked mess. The DIY solution did eventually get the job done but required quite a lot of scrubbing and several sprays over the same spots.</p>
<p>We understand that glass cleaners may not be designed to perform such chores, but it is nice to know what they’re capable of. While we may end up cleaning the windows around the office with another product, we’ll keep our cans of Stoner and Weiman handy for this particular problem.</p>
<h3>Scent</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2372" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/window-cleaners_smell-ranking.png" alt="window cleaner smell test" width="880" height="394" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/window-cleaners_smell-ranking.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/window-cleaners_smell-ranking-610x273.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/window-cleaners_smell-ranking-360x161.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/window-cleaners_smell-ranking-375x168.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/window-cleaners_smell-ranking-414x185.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/window-cleaners_smell-ranking-295x132.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/window-cleaners_smell-ranking-180x81.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/window-cleaners_smell-ranking-320x143.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The aroma created by these cleaning products is not a small metric to consider. When cleaning windows and mirrors with airborne sprays, smell is an important and quickly noticeable factor.</p>
<p>Most of these cleaners do not smell good, falling somewhere between vaguely unpleasant (Stoner Invisible Glass) and extremely off-putting (Zep Streak-Free Cleaner). The two ammonia-based cleaners, Zep and Windex, left by far the worst smell. The powerful scent of ammonia produces an almost nostril-burning effect. While the scent doesn&#8217;t linger long, the experience of using the spray is poor because of it.</p>
<p>The most pleasing aroma came from our own mixture of vinegar, cornstarch and essential oil. Just 10 drops of the highly concentrated peppermint essential oil in our 20-ounce spray bottle made all the difference in the user experience of the homemade cleaner.</p>
<p>The great thing about making your own cleaner is you can select your favorite fragrance. Essential oils come in dozens of scents, including rosemary, lavender, tea tree and lemongrass.</p>
<p>Seventh Generation has a neutral scent that is hard to discern. It may not make you smile like the aroma of your favorite essential oil, but neither will it turn you off as many of the other products did.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-cleaner">Top Pick: Windex &#8211; Complete</h2>

<p>Our pick for best overall glass cleaner is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Windex®-Complete-Glass-Surface-Cleaner/dp/B01FIG975O/?tag=ybdwind-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Windex</a>. It simply cleans and eliminates streaking better than any of the other products we tested. Windex proved to be up to even the most difficult challenges. The ammonia-based cleaner broke up difficult compounds and consistently removed dirty, sticky, greasy blemishes on mirrors, windows and other surfaces.</p>
<p>While the scent of ammonia is powerful and unpleasant, it doesn’t linger in the air or on the cleaned surface. Just a few minutes after use, there’s no detectable fragrance.</p>

<p>It’s not just the smell that disappears quickly; it’s the ammonia. Because ammonia evaporates quicker than water, there is very little health risk shortly after cleaning. Only large amounts of high-concentrate ammonia can be dangerous if inhaled.</p>
<p>Finally, Windex is incredibly versatile. It took care of our messy, chili-covered microwave with only a bit of effort. The ammonia-based product is also great for tackling soap scum on bathroom fixtures and stains on tiled floors, polishing up old jewelry and even repelling insects.</p>
<p>For the dirtiest jobs on the widest variety of surfaces, Windex is the best product available.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>

<p>The other finalists we tested all were capable of clearing surfaces of grease and grime. Where they mostly fell short was failing to eliminate streaks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seventh-Generation-Surface-Cleaner-Ounces/dp/B0004JKOVW?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ybdwind-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Seventh Generation Free &amp; Clear</a> is a great product. Its plant-based cleaning agents are strong on messes, and it’s safe for the environment and your health.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Glass-Premium-Cleaner-91164/dp/B0007OWD2M?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ybdwind-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stoner Invisible Glass Premium Glass Cleaner</a> proved very versatile, performing well at cutting through food spills in our microwave test. But like Glass Plus, it could not completely keep away streaks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zep-Commercial-ZU112032-Streak-Free-Cleaner/dp/B002ZZDQ0Y?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ybdwind-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zep Streak-Free Glass Cleaner</a> did a better job cleaning without leaving streaks, but the odor was too unpleasant. The strong scent of ammonia takes away from an otherwise very effective product.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The best product for getting reliably clean and clear glass is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Windex®-Complete-Glass-Surface-Cleaner/dp/B01FIG975O/?tag=ybdwind-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Windex</a>. It can be used on a variety of surfaces to clean without leaving streaks, and it’s strong enough to get rid of tough stains.</p>
<p>Whichever cleaner you choose, how you clean is just as important. We recommend microfiber towels for both wiping up messes and buffing out streaks. We also encourage you to keep these and all cleaning products away from children and increase ventilation as much as possible while cleaning by opening windows and turning on fans.</p>
