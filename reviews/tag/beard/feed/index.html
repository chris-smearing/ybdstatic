				<description><![CDATA[For nine weeks we tested seven great trimmers. The Wahl - PowerPro is the best overall, with a ton of attachments at a low price.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>or nine weeks, we tested seven beard trimmers on beards of all lengths. We washed the trimmers, tested battery life and compared their attachments. Ultimately, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006NXRD58/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wahl &#8211; PowerPro 9686</a> earned our pick for best beard trimmer. It’s a corded trimmer with great blades and uses clip-on attachments just like your barber&#8217;s. If you don’t mind recharging, our top cordless pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M24BKOZ/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; ER-GB370K</a>, has an adjustable comb guide that replaces a mountain of clip-on attachments.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>To track down a lineup of worthy candidates, we checked out reviews from solid publications like Wirecutter. We were disappointed with most of the info we found, most of the content from magazines and style websites seemed more like promotional info.</p>
<p>Youtube reviews of clippers wound up being some of the most solid info we found, though most of the great in-depth reviews are from a barbershop perspective, so not many gave in-depth info about attachments useful for self-trimming.</p>
<p>We filtered retailers ratings and user reviews extensively, ruling out models with poor review scores on Amazon. We looked for the most popular models from established manufacturers, and selected models that were new or recent updates if a popular brand had multiple offerings.</p>
<p>Consulting with barbers at <a href="https://www.thestatesmangrooming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Statesman in Anaheim</a> and <a href="https://www.floydsbarbershop.com/tustin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Floyd&#8217;s in Tustin</a> gave us some assurance that we were looking at solid brands and useful features.</p>
<p>We only selected one corded trimmer for review. Compact corded trimmers (which are mostly tools for barbers and stylists doing detail work) tend not to include the attachments you&#8217;d want to have for beard-keeping. You could buy a hair clipper set, like the Wahl &#8211; Super Taper with eight attachments, but those clippers are just too big to be convenient.</p>
<p>If you do need a corded trimmer with more oomph to cut through your super-hard alpha-hairs, the Wahl &#8211; 5 Star Detailer or Andis &#8211; T-Outliner are barbershop-grade trimmers with adjustable blades. They don&#8217;t come with many attachments, though, and most beards won&#8217;t require the extra power.</p>
<p>Our top cordless pick from Panasonic also has a pro-grade bigger brother: the ER-GP80 is a top-class cordless hair trimmer with a fancy linear motor. But it&#8217;ll set you back about $180, and that&#8217;s just too much for most of us to spend on a beard trimmer. Likewise for the new Bevel Trimmer, which looks great for edging and stubble but doesn&#8217;t have any attachments for maintaining beard length.</p>
<p>We also dismissed gimmicky features like vacuums and digital speed controllers. If we got those features for free in a proven product we wouldn&#8217;t turn them down, but the core features need to be the priority.</p>

[table id=153 /]
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Battery or plug-in power:</strong> Cordless trimmers are significantly more popular than their corded predecessors, and it&#8217;s easy to make a case for the convenience. How much motor speed you give up going cordless depends on the model, but all batteries will die eventually.</p>
<p><strong>Size of blade:</strong> Wider blades make for quick work and straight edges, while narrower trimmers can be easier to work with around the chin and nose.</p>
<p><strong>Waterproof operation:</strong> If you have a shower mirror, waterproof cordless trimmers are great way to avoid leaving tiny hairs all over your bathroom. They&#8217;re also easy to clean, just soap and rinse the head under running water! You might also want to apply some clipper lube when you&#8217;re done, just to keep rust at bay.</p>
<p><strong>Stands and travel cases:</strong> The most sophisticated kits in this lineup included a pouch to store accessories or a stand for convenient countertop charging, but we didn&#8217;t find any models with both. Good travel cases are pretty easy to find, charging stands not so much.</p>
<p><strong>Attachment guides:</strong> The comb-toothed attachments on a trimmer will keep it at a consistent distance from your face, which makes it easy to keep your beard at a consistent length. Which attachment works best depends on what kinds of trimming you do most, and how you like to shape your beard.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories:</strong> A few of these kits include accessories like nose hair trimmers, narrow-blade detail trimmers or even foil shavers. We think the nose hair trimmer attachments are a nice bonus, but the shavers were basically junk.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>After leading a team of testers in our nine-week <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-beard-oil/">beard oil review</a>, our &#8220;bearditor&#8221; took his six-month beard progressively down to nothing with each of these trimmers.</p>
<h3>Trimming long beards</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/longbeard.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Using a comb, freehand trimming and the longest of the included guide attachments, we tested which trimmer works best for maintenance of a beard longer than one-half inch.</p>
<p>The difficulty of freehand trimming made this the trickiest category to judge. Using a guide like the No. 8 clip-on attachments for the Wahl trimmers means you won&#8217;t have to worry as much about taking a random chunk out of your beard. But, in the era of &#8220;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/yeard/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yeards</a>&#8221; an inch barely counts as &#8220;long.&#8221; If you want to join that club and keep your beard looking neat, you&#8217;ll need to learn how to shape a beard with a comb and the bare trimmer blade.</p>
<p>We gave this test to the Wahl trimmers simply because of the versatility of these kits for shaping and blending, especially as you&#8217;re figuring out how long your mustache can get before it starts stealing your beverages.</p>
<p>The Wahl T-shaped blades were great for freehand shaping, though the wide Panasonic blade is stiff competition if you don&#8217;t need the longer attachments anyway.</p>
<h3>Trimming with a shorter attachment</h3>
<p>For short beards, a guard or comb attachment make it much easier to maintain a consistent length. All of the trimmers except the OneBlade included at least a ⅜&#8221; comb, and even this is longer than what was once considered &#8220;groomed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every attachment we tested is very capable of helping you keep your beard at a consistent length, but we noticed that most adjustable guides were only adjusting the height of the blade, with no protection from the tips.</p>
<p>Except for the Panasonic with its longer teeth, the adjustable combs won&#8217;t keep you from &#8220;dipping&#8221; the teeth into your beard as you run it over tricky areas. We also preferred the Panasonic&#8217;s wider blade for quicker twice-weekly trimming; it&#8217;s tricky to use around the nose at first, but we think it&#8217;s worth the learning curve.</p>
<p>For most beards, we also think a built-in adjustable guide makes more sense than the various clip-on guides than barbers use on their trimmers. The Andis and Wahl trimmers perform very well and are great to use, but if the attachment pops off and falls behind something when you&#8217;re travelling, your trimmer basically becomes worthless until you can replace it.</p>
<h3>Stubble maintenance</h3>
<p>Using the shortest guide combs and the bare trimmer edge, we tried to maintain perfect groomed stubble with each model.nThe ideal trimmer will allow a perfect fade from bare neck to slightly-longer stubble along the jawline, then back to a shaven finish on the upper cheeks.</p>
<p>The Philips &#8211; OneBlade was the only trimmer that got anywhere close to an all-in-one solution for this look. If you want to keep permanent five o&#8217;clock shadow, the bare trimmer shaves close enough that you can actually create some contrast with the shortest attachment. This way you can leave a little more fuzz on your face but clean up the edges with the bare trimmer blade, which helps you look &#8220;groomed but rugged&#8221; rather than lazy.</p>
<p>Other trimmers will get close enough to leave an even scruff, but you&#8217;d definitely need to clean up with a razor if you want to keep your neck and cheeks looking clean.</p>
<p>A notable performer in this test is the Andis &#8211; Slimline. The trimmer blade is designed for lining up perfect edges on barbershop fades, and you can even &#8220;zero-gap&#8221; the blade halves to get it cutting closer than the other conventional trimmers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUFb7NWuios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instruction videos</a> and plastic templates make it pretty simple, but note that a zero-gapped blade can scratch you if you&#8217;re not careful. So the OneBlade&#8217;s design still has an edge for casual users.</p>

<h3>Battery life</h3>
<p>We topped off the battery on each trimmer, then ran it until the blades stalled. Every model (except the bargain-priced Remington &#8211; PG6025) could run for longer than 90 minutes, which is plenty of battery for weekly trimmings. They were all running strong enough to cut hair reliably until the end.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re using these in a barbershop, the extra runtime from the gigantic battery in the Wahl &#8211; 9818 is a great bonus, though we should note that it&#8217;s also the heaviest trimmer by far.</p>
<p>The Andis &#8211; Slimline Pro Li runs less than half as long as the Wahl, but that doesn&#8217;t take it out of the running: if you use a trimmer for extended periods, the handy charging stand means the overall battery life isn&#8217;t as important, and the light weight and adjustable blade will probably be worth that tradeoff.</p>

<p>The corded <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006NXRD58/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wahl &#8211; PowerPro 9686</a> stands out in this crowd because you&#8217;ll never have to worry about the battery running flat, and with two trimmer blades and the biggest set of attachments it&#8217;s a bargain.</p>
<p>We paid about $25 for this setup, and it has everything you could ask for. The detail trimmer blade even works quite well for nose hair.</p>
<p>Guide combs are most useful in beards shorter than a half-inch. Once you get past that length, things get tricky: a uniform 1 inch of chin hair usually looks kind of bulbous, so most beardsmen are going to start tapering. The longer guards in this kit might just stay in the box.</p>
<p>That said, it&#8217;s good to have options. Even if you&#8217;re just starting your journey toward a monster beard, the guides will help you learn about the grain and texture of your beard while you psych up for freehand trimming and shaping with a comb.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of this array of attachments but were hoping for something cordless, the Wahl &#8211; 9818 is just that. Beyond cutting the cord (and doubling the price) the differences between the two trimmers come down to attachments. The cordless model has a more nostril-friendly ear/nose trimmer and a (poorly-performing) tiny shaver, while this corded model has a barely-functional six-position guide that you could leave attached to its second trimmer blade.</p>
<p>Wahl also includes some &#8220;stubble guides&#8221; that protect your skin from the points of the blade while cutting closer than the 1/16&#8243; guide comb. These work well to reduce scratching, though they don&#8217;t trim nearly as close as the short settings on other models. The bare blade trims closer than the Panasonic, about the same as the Andis out of the box, but you can&#8217;t zero-gap these Wahl blades.</p>

The detail blade even works for nose hair!</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006NXRD58/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The only real drawback to this set is that there are so many pieces to keep track of, and most are only good, not great. The adjustable guide is actually pretty bad compared to other trimmers. If you need the longer clip-on attachments for blending out to a longer beard, it works. If you don&#8217;t need anything longer than a half-inch, the Panasonic is a better design that you&#8217;ll probably be happier using.</p>
<p>Wahl includes a zip-up pouch to keep all the attachments together, but let&#8217;s face it, fishing through a pocket that has eight of these combs in it isn&#8217;t actually convenient. (Note: You can put white paint on the size markers to help you read them.)</p>
<p>If you want a corded trimmer with more oomph, the Wahl &#8211; 5 Star Detailer or Andis &#8211; T-Outliner are barbershop-grade trimmers with adjustable blades. They don&#8217;t come with many attachments, though, and most beards won&#8217;t require the extra power. The Wahl &#8211; Peanut is another popular offering, again with few attachments, we also like the rocker power switch better than the slide switch on the Peanut.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Wahl &#8211; PowerPro is a great trimmer with a full set of attachments and a five-year warranty.</li>
<li>It isn&#8217;t cordless, and it isn&#8217;t waterproof, but you&#8217;ll never have to worry about an aging battery.</li>
<li>Includes 12 guide combs, everything from long stubble up to a full inch.</li>
<li>This wide T-blade makes detailing edges a little easier.</li>
<li>The accessory detail trimmer is a nice touch, though many won&#8217;t ever use it.</li>

<p>This was a tough pick. Each trimmer we tested has a strength (and a weakness) for particular applications, but the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M24BKOZ/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; ER-GB370K</a> rose to the top of the cordless ranks. Panasonic&#8217;s great features make this easier to use than most other trimmers, and both the motor and blade are top-class.</p>
<p>The Panasonic is versatile enough to do nearly everything, from stubble to shaping full beards, with just its one built-in attachment. This adjustable comb doesn&#8217;t go at long as some of the fixed-length clip-on attachments for other trimmers, but for beards less than 1/2&#8243; (where a length guide is most useful) we love that this wide, sturdy guide won&#8217;t pop off in use or get lost in a drawer.</p>
<p>The teeth on this guide attachment are a little longer in the front than on the other adjustables, so it&#8217;s tricky to go straight up under your nose for a close-trimmed mustache. But they help maintain a consistent length better on the rest of your face, and that&#8217;s what the guide is for anyway.</p>

<p>The Panasonic&#8217;s battery isn&#8217;t as long-lasting as some other trimmers, but the wall-mount charger is convenient and avoids the tangle of cords you usually face with a charger. The two pieces are a lot easier to keep in a drawer between trims than most other models.</p>
<p>Panasonic has one big advantage over the Wahl &#8211; 9818, and that&#8217;s a waterproof design. You can wash the trimmer without taking it apart, and also use it in the shower. The Philips &#8211; 5210 is also waterproof, but we like the wider blade and the closer-cut stubble on the Panasonic.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Panasonic&#8217;s GB370K is cordless, waterproof and doesn&#8217;t burden you with accessories to keep track of.</li>
<li>A strong, but quiet motor makes this easier to live with.</li>
<li>This versatile guide comb adjusts from stubble to bushy in precise steps.</li>
<li>If you remove the comb, this wide blade cuts closer than most other trimmers.</li>
<li>The battery life is short, but the price is also low.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078BDHV9P/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; OneBlade Face + Body</a> has a unique blade design, one of the only successful new designs since motorized hair clippers were invented. It&#8217;s also nearly perfect for keeping a short beard or stubble looking neat.</p>
<p>Rather than just making a row of v-shaped shears sliding against each other, Philips took the one-dimensional concept and made a trimmer that cuts on both edges.</p>
<p>These are also much thinner blades than most clippers, so you can cut very close to the skin without risking scratches from the tips of the blade. This means that you get real contrast between areas you want to look clean and areas where you want to leave some scruff.</p>
<p>The following guide comb attachments are included, along with three blades:</p>
<ul>
<li>3/64&#8243; (1mm)</li>
<li>5/64&#8243; (2mm)</li>
<li>1/8&#8243; (3mm, #1 hair clipper guide equivalent)</li>
<li>3/16&#8243; (5mm, shorter than a #2 equivalent)</li>
<li>A separate 1/8&#8243; comb for body hair use</li>
<li>An &#8220;edge guard&#8221; for shaving delicate skin</li>
</ul>
<p>This is halfway between the other trimmers and the real electric shavers we tested. That&#8217;s going to seem a bit silly for some people, since it&#8217;s not doing either job all the way: You won&#8217;t get smooth shaves, and the short guide combs won&#8217;t help in longer beards. But, if you&#8217;ve got a shorter beard or if you just want to keep your stubble looking neat, it&#8217;s a pretty perfect tool.</p>

<p>This wouldn&#8217;t be our first pick for freehand shaping longer beards, but the blades are quite capable even in that role. Most guys who aspire to full-length beards aren&#8217;t going to be using the bare blade for lining up edges anymore, but if you do it&#8217;s a versatile tool.</p>
<h3>Also a great body hair trimmer</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for one device that can manage all of your grooming, this has you covered below the neck, too. If your back hair is out of control, our other <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-body-hair-trimmer/">body hair trimmer picks</a> are still better at helping you reach, but for everything else the Philips &#8211; OneBlade is a pretty compelling pick.</p>
<p>Is it gross to say that you can use a beard trimmer as a body hair trimmer? Yes, but in this case Philips has kind of cheated. The package comes with three completely separate blade assemblies that you can dedicate to whatever funky fate you choose.</p>
<p>You even get a specific comb attachment for body hair that will help you keep your blades from getting mixed up. This is also by far the easiest trimmer to wash thoroughly, so you won&#8217;t need to worry about contaminating your Dopp kit.</p>
<p>The &#8220;edge guard&#8221; works pretty well for keeping delicate skin out of the blades, but the foil shaver on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0037HP9OA/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Bodygroom</a> is still the safest pick for getting right to the skin in sensitive places.</p>
<h3>What about upgrade options?</h3>
<p>We tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078BDHV9P//?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">mid-tier &#8220;Face + Body&#8221; kit</a>; it has a slightly bigger battery and more attachments than the base kit. For $15 more, we think that&#8217;s a great deal, but spending around $40 more on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072DTDVMC/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OneBlade &#8211; Pro</a> isn&#8217;t quite as compelling.</p>
<p>The Pro features an adjustable guide attachment with a 10mm length, which brings it up to par with the rest of the trimmers we tested for mid-length beards, but the attachment isn&#8217;t as wide or sturdy as the guides bigger trimmers like the Panasonic have.</p>
<p>The Pro doesn&#8217;t come with the spare guides or blades that you can dedicate to body-hair use, which dampens our enthusiasm for it. You can buy those separately for about $30; you can&#8217;t buy a longer guide comb for the base OneBlade.</p>
<h3>How well does it shave, though?</h3>
<p>Our tester used these beard trimmers at the same time as early testing for our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-electric-shaver/">electric shaver guide</a>, using the shavers on neck and cheeks with the beard trimmers to maintain a goatee. We tried the OneBlade in this role, and it&#8217;s not the same class of shave as any of our top picks. If you&#8217;ve got anyone inspecting how close you shave, (be that a domestic partner or a Sergeant), this won&#8217;t do the job.</p>
<p>If you just need to be technically clean-shaven, but you&#8217;re not worried about the prickly feeling of stubble, the OneBlade is cheaper and just as easy to use as an electric shaver. If your hair is light enough, you might even fool people; it&#8217;s a good deal closer than any of the other trimmers.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The OneBlade Face + Body works very well for shaving down to a clean-but-prickly shadow.</li>
<li>This kit includes comb attachments up to three sixteenths of an inch to maintain a shorter beard or mustache.</li>
<li>Philips included the longest-lived battery among the waterproof trimmers.</li>
<li>Also a great body hair trimmer, this model comes with a spare blade and comb just for that purpose.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Wahl &#8211; 9818</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058SY1XQ/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wahl &#8211; 9818</a> is basically a cordless version of the PowerPro trimmer we picked for long beards. The cost is double, but it has the longest battery life on any cordless trimmer we tested.</p>
<p>Battery life isn&#8217;t the only factor to consider when you&#8217;re buying a cordless tool, but it&#8217;s nice to see these kinds of specs. We were happy that we could even get inside to see what kind of battery it is (an off-the-shelf 1000mAh 14650-size cell soldered to the control board).</p>
<p>The battery and heavy steel body are the only parts that got a real upgrade, though. More critical features, like the guide attachment design, are identical to every other cheap Wahl trimmer. OK, not amazing.</p>

<p>That said, if you want to maintain a 3/4&#8243; longer beard at a set length, Wahl&#8217;s clip-on attachments are basically your only option.</p>
<p>For this more expensive cordless trimmer, our standards are a bit higher, and we&#8217;re disappointed that Wahl still uses these flimsy attachments. They&#8217;ll pop off if you put a lot of pressure on them, and you have to squint to read the size markings.</p>
<p>Waterproofing is also a missing feature that would make this a much better cordless trimmer. No, it&#8217;s not a must-have feature, but most of us don&#8217;t have a giant can of clipper spray always at the ready. A waterproof design would make use and cleaning much easier.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to put up with the fussy cleaning requirements of a pro-style clipper, we&#8217;d like to see some pro-grade design considerations, too. Wahl uses a cheap, spring-tensioned blade assembly here, not an adjustable blade like the Andis &#8211; Slimline Pro.</p>
<p>Wahl sets these to trim pretty close, so most people aren&#8217;t going to miss out on gap adjustment, but it&#8217;s another win for the Andis trimmer if you&#8217;re looking for a line-up trimmer.</p>
<p>Wahl still has a more versatile kit than any other trimmer, but most users would trade half of the attachments for some missing features. The build feels solid, but that&#8217;s entirely because of the stainless body tube; the internal components are just as cheap as any of the other trimmers. (A point borne out by the spotty reliability record in the Amazon reviews.)</p>
<h3>Andis &#8211; Slimline Pro Li</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01499YQP2/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Andis &#8211; Slimline Pro Li</a> is a small, light, versatile tool that finds its way onto many barbershop and stylist workstations. It&#8217;s missing some features that would make it an easy top pick, but for some people it might still be the right tool.</p>
<p>The Slimline is at its best without a guide comb. That&#8217;s how most barbers use it, and the few guides that are included makes it clear that Andis knows this. Barbers also complain about these attachments, just like the Wahl attachments.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t need the #4-#8 attachments that the Wahl has, there are a few things this trimmer has going for it. It&#8217;s slimmer and lighter, so it&#8217;ll be easier to pack for travel even if you don&#8217;t have to hold it up all day. The blade is also adjustable to &#8220;hit&#8221; a zero-gap line, so you can get right down to the skin if you want to. (Be careful, and check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019WSCKL2/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">templates that can help you</a> line up the edge.)</p>
<p>If it weren&#8217;t for the OneBlade, then, this might be our pick for trimming close-cropped and precisely-lined beards. With that option on the table, though, the only reason to go for the non-waterproof and more-expensive Slimline is if you find that the OneBlade blades won&#8217;t cut your hair well.</p>
<h3>Philips &#8211; 5210</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017YNUH9E/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Philips Norelco &#8211; 5210</a> is another very close contender for our top cordless pick. The battery runs just a hair longer than the Panasonic&#8217;s, and the adjustable guide combs it comes with will cover beard growth that&#8217;s just a bit longer, too, out to a #4 equivalent with the two longer attachments.</p>
<p>We like the design of these guides for close-cropped beards, and in those conditions we think this is going to be a better choice than the Panasonic, since the long &#8220;teeth&#8221; on Panasonic&#8217;s guide aren&#8217;t really needed.</p>
<p>That said, the 5210 has a stubble-length adjustable guide that&#8217;s deceptive: adjustment marking indicate that you can go from 0.4 mm to 0.8 before you get to the 1mm height setting, but in real-world conditions these settings are no different from taking the attachment off. You won&#8217;t get any contrast from different stubble lengths using these shortest settings.</p>
<p>The OneBlade is a more versatile system for short beards, and it has a much longer battery life and better design overall if that&#8217;s the kind of job you need to do. For beards longer than a #3 guide comb, the Panasonic takes over as a more capable trimmer, with a wide blade and one do-it-all attachment for Philips&#8217;s 3.</p>
<h3>Remington &#8211; PG6025</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H2B4H2M/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Remington &#8211; PG6025</a> is the multi-use pick from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-body-hair-trimmer/#grooming">body hair trimmer</a> review, and it&#8217;s still a good trimmer for $20. The nose hair trimmer attachment is as good as Wahl&#8217;s, though for $5 more Wahl has a much more complete beard trimming package.</p>
<p>Remington&#8217;s budget-priced trimmer had the weakest battery of our lineup, and it&#8217;s not waterproof. The included shaving foil isn&#8217;t really worth using, maybe it&#8217;d be OK on your legs or for other areas that are less sensitive than your face.</p>
<p>The adjustable guide Remington uses is decent enough to work. Remington calls their three snap-on guides &#8220;beard and stubble combs&#8221; and the 8-step adjustable a &#8220;hair&#8221; comb. You&#8217;ll be fine whichever attachment you pick for beard trimming, but none of them are especially good.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Picking the best beard trimmer is a bit like picking the best beard: Every man is going to have different preferences. We narrowed down three picks that will excel in three different beard lengths, and we think that&#8217;s the best way to approach this decision.</p>
<p>For average-length beards on average guys, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M24BKOZ/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; ER-GB370K</a> has everything you need and nothing you don&#8217;t. It trims close enough for clean edges, but it also has a versatile guide comb that works very well in mid-length beards. The plug-in charging stand is also a nifty way to cut down on bathroom clutter.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We gave 10 bearded gentlemen eight samples of the most popular beard oils. After a two-month blind comparison trial, the overall value champion is Mountaineer Brand.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent weeks researching and two months blind testing eight oil blends with a group of 10 bearded gentlemen to determine the best beard oil. The differences between beard oils are subtle, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K9KEQA6/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mountaineer Brand beard oil</a> wins this roundup with a great blend of effective oils at a very good price. Our top pick also comes in five scents, and it&#8217;s easy to find. For our runner-up, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WF6VFSS?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Gentlemen&#8217;s Beard</a> ranked highest overall with a near-perfect blend of different oil weights, but it&#8217;s far more expensive than it should be.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Our resident beard-guy has tried various substances on his beard for conditioning and itch-relief, so he thought he understood the basic principles fairly well before he started researching this category. Oil is oil, right? He found out that there&#8217;s far more nuance to the topic than he expected.</p>
<p>A casual perusal of the relevant subreddits, forums and Facebook groups yields a lot of great info on what to try and what to avoid, but we were looking for more specific information on what&#8217;s in beard oil and why it works.</p>
<p>Reading up on the science of hair care, we quickly discovered that the warnings about supermarket hair conditioner are based on a simple but strong principle: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12715094" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mineral oils and silicones coat your hair</a> to make it shiny and smooth, but they don&#8217;t actually penetrate inside to moisturize the hair.</p>
<p>That took oils with ingredients like siloxane and dimethicone off our list categorically. The effects might not be as disastrous as some imply, but for helping your beard stay soft and pliable, it&#8217;s clear that oils should be able to soak in.</p>
<p>Most of the other nearly scientific content we found was either targeted at hair care or basically promotional in nature. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be anyone doing studies on specific oils for beards, so we had to rely more heavily on anecdotal consensus.</p>
<p>We looked at lists of beard care products in mainstream publications, but for the most part it seemed clear that if the list was <a href="https://www.toolsofmen.com/best-beard-oil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">based on actual testing</a>, products were rarely ranked for any specific reason.</p>
<p>YouTube is practically flooded with reviews of oils, balms and other grooming products, so we tried to come up with a list of must-try brands from as many different reviewers as we could consult. (Total YouTube watching time for this research: eight hours, and that&#8217;s with skipping ahead through top-ten-lists.)</p>
<p>As always, we rely on customer reviews from sites like Amazon to guide our assessment of long-term use and obvious problems with a product that might be missed in a quick review. We didn&#8217;t find many negative reviews, and even using the <a href="https://www.fakespot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fakespot</a> review-analysis system to filter out products with obviously fake reviews didn&#8217;t help much to narrow the field.</p>
<p>In the end, we focused on brands that have easy-to-understand ingredients labelled clearly and hopefully come in more than one scent and with an unscented option.</p>
<p>We set our per-ounce budget at $20 to see if a premium brand would actually do anything different than a cheap oil. We also bought some popular ingredients in bulk: fractionated coconut oil, so we&#8217;d have a simple, cheap lightweight control in our test, and olive oil for a heavier control sample.</p>

<h2 id="do-oils-help">Do beard oils help grow a beard?</h2>
<p>This is a common question. But if you were looking for the &#8220;best beard growth oil,&#8221; the answer we have is probably not the one you were hoping for.</p>
<p>Beard growth is almost entirely down to genetics. We&#8217;re still in early days of understanding how beard and hair traits work, <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/genetic-clues-to-monobrows-and-bushy-beards-revealed-1.19483" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but there are some clear markers</a>.</p>
<p>The other factor to think about is your diet. Your skin and hair need oil, protein and water to grow, but there&#8217;s no clear link we could find between any specific foods and hair growth. Studies have definitely found <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28243487" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a link between malnutrition and hair loss</a>, though. So, step one: don&#8217;t spend your food budget on beard oil, but don&#8217;t overbuy trendy food, either.</p>
<p>So, is that a &#8220;no&#8221; then? Definitely. But also, kinda-sorta-maybe technically yes.</p>
<p>Honest beard oil companies will tell you two things that their products <em>can</em> do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Beard oil keeps your beard hairs soft, healthy and under control.</li>
<li>Beard oil keeps your skin moisturized to reduce itching and flaking.</li>
</ol>
<p>The biggest struggle most men have growing a beard is itchy skin and frizzy, dry hair. Usually after the first three weeks of growth, you start thinking about shaving it all off.</p>
<p>So while beard oil may not be able to sprout new follicles or change the diameter of your hairs, it can stop you from cutting your beard off prematurely in itchy frustration.</p>

<p>While there are as many different kinds of oil as there are plants (you can extract oily compounds from almost everything that&#8217;s alive), a few oils have become very popular. Ingredients on personal care products are listed in &#8220;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/IngredientNames/ucm2005218.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">order of predominance,</a>&#8221; but with any more than two oils in a blend, it gets increasingly difficult to say how much of a particular oil is present from just the ingredient list.</p>
<p><b>Jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) oil:</b> The seeds of the Jojoba, a shrub from North American deserts, contain an inedible long-molecular-chain wax (similar to the once-popular whale oil). The &#8220;oil&#8221; is non-greasy and often used in skin-care because it has properties very similar to the sebum oil that our skin produces. Research involving its application to hair is limited, but it&#8217;s a very trendy oil. The only oil we tested that doesn&#8217;t include Jojoba is our top pick, Mountaineer Brand.</p>
<p><b>Argan (Argania spinosa) oil:</b> Argan oil is extracted (usually by hand) from the seeds of a tree native to Morocco. This oil has achieved a near-legendary status in the world of natural cosmetic products, and it&#8217;s the most expensive edible oil. While it&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3723062/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">known antioxidant</a> there is only limited research data on how it&#8217;s absorbed by your hair.</p>
<p><b>Castor (Ricinus communis) oil:</b> Castor oil is one of the thickest oils typically found in beard oil. This has been a popular medicinal product for thousands of years, though mostly as a strong laxative. In beard oil it should give a bit more control. Popular claims of hair-growing properties are unproven, though it does <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11263183" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boost prostoglandin levels</a>, which are linked to hair growth.</p>
<p><b>Coconut (Cocos nucifera) oil:</b> While this trendy oil has spawned countless clickbait articles, it does at least have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12715094" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some research to back up its popularity</a>. It has proven to be great on hair, but it&#8217;s not as common as we expected in beard oil, probably to avoid <a href="https://www.byrdie.com/coconut-oil-for-acne" target="_blank" rel="noopener">problems for acne-prone users</a>. We used refined coconut oil as a control in our testing, and most of our testers did say that it disappeared into their beards quickly. (Raw coconut oil, which is solid at room temperature, makes a good beard butter.)</p>
<p><b>Other oils: </b>We found <a href="http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/oils-which-ones-soak-in-vs-coat-hair.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some basic information</a> about common oil types and how well they soak into hair. This isn&#8217;t the only relevant factor in a beard oil, but it&#8217;s good to know that the beard-oil artisans aren&#8217;t just grabbing totally random ingredients.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>This is typically the part of a review where we would tell you what&#8217;s most important about the winning products, but&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Beard oil is both too simple and too complicated to understand from a set of features on a box.</b> You could have two different blends of the same base ingredients and get different performance, but the difference isn&#8217;t huge.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re confident that most beard oils out there will do a good job. You could use vegetable cooking oil if you wanted and get fairly similar results. That said, there are some factors that could make the difference between an oil you like and an oil you love:</p>
<p><b>Scent:</b> Finding a scent you can live with (or even enjoy!) is a big part of choosing a brand, though some people are less picky than others. Most of the brands we tested feature an unscented choice, but not all.</p>
<p><b>Packaging:</b> We encountered three different types of bottle in our research. A <strong>reducer-type bottle</strong> has a plastic insert that makes it easier to get drops of oil rather than accidentally dumping out half an ounce. A <strong>dropper</strong> makes applying the oil even easier, since you can control exactly how much goes on your beard. A <strong>pump dispenser</strong> works OK, but we found it didn&#8217;t give quite as much control as a dropper.</p>
<p><b>Availability: </b>There are now hundreds of different beard oils you can choose from, but it&#8217;s nice to be able to pick up a bottle on short notice. Shipping internet orders is getting easier and easier, but it&#8217;s always nice to be able to see (and smell) a product.</p>
<h2 id="make-my-own">Can I make my own beard oil?</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to make your own beard oil blend, that&#8217;s usually a sign you&#8217;re very passionate about beard care or very frugal. If you have the time, it can be a rewarding pursuit.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of recipe resources on the web, and once you find an enclave of beard enthusiasts you like, you&#8217;ll typically find offers of recipes and even free samples passed around. For example, Reddit&#8217;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beardoil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beard oil sub</a> is mostly devoted to discussions about DIY beard oil experiments.</p>
<p>One cool benefit of mixing your own beard oil is that you can add your own scent ingredients exactly as you like them. But the long and winding road toward the dark art of perfumery is not for the faint of heart. <a href="http://www.basenotes.net/forums/15-Fragrance-DIY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Basenotes.net</a> is probably the best place to start learning about what makes a scent blend work, though nobody wants a beard oil to be as strong as a cologne.</p>
<p>Be careful with <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-essential-oils/" rel="noopener">essential oils</a> and other fragrance ingredients. Buy from a reputable seller and understand that some ingredients can be dangerous in high concentrations.</p>
<p>Applying a highly diluted blend like a beard oil (where each ounce of oil should have only a few drops of essential oils or even less fragrance added) is even less risky than the common approach of using <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-essential-oil-diffuser/" rel="noopener">a diffuser</a> for aromatherapy, but it still pays to make sure you aren&#8217;t highly sensitive to something. Never apply something to your skin out of a bottle unless you know how concentrated the contents are.</p>

<h3>Base oils and control testing</h3>
<p>In our first week of blind testing, our ten beard-scientists were given two oil mixes in bottles with only testing labels (E and F) to try out: a blend of slow-absorbing extra-virgin olive oil and 10-percent jojoba oil, then a blend of fast-absorbing coconut and 10-percent jojoba oil. This established a baseline of how the guys responded to thicker or thinner beard oil blended from popular ingredients.</p>
<p>Over the following eight weeks, we asked the volunteers to blind-test pairs of oil samples side-by-side, with one oil on each side of the beard. They had no idea what the products were, which gave us some hope to see if they could tell the difference between the samples. Testing two at once to controlled for some day-to-day variables that might come from applying every sample one day at a time.</p>
<p>We asked our testers to note results in five categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Softness:</strong> How much softer does the hair feel when it’s moisturized?</li>
<li><strong>Absorption:</strong> Does the hair feel greasy a few hours after oiling?</li>
<li><strong>Skin condition:</strong> Does the oiled beard help itch and flakes, or does it cause breakouts or other problems?</li>
<li><strong>Control:</strong> Does the oil help keep frizz and curls manageable?</li>
<li><strong>Lasting:</strong> How frequently do you need to reapply the oil?</li>
</ul>

<p>We followed the testing period with an exit poll and were surprised by the results. Top brands with established credibility got lower average scores, while some unknown brands or blends of &#8220;boring&#8221; oils without many obvious advantages scored better on average.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s tricky to calibrate self-reporting on this scale, since we&#8217;re asking for testers&#8217; opinions about qualities that are hard to measure precisely. Our sample size is on the small side, and it could be that there&#8217;s just too much error in the way our testers were reporting to draw any valid conclusions.</p>
<p>That said, the results demonstrate that beard oil in a blind test isn&#8217;t all &#8220;the same.&#8221; There was a consistent preference for the more complex blends of commercially produced oil over the simple oils. The fact that one tester picked olive oil as his favorite shows that oil shouldn&#8217;t have to be expensive to help your beard.</p>
<h3>Beard oil and acne</h3>
<p>We asked testers to report how the oils affected skin condition, and this was the category that our testers were most obviously not getting any significant data for; nearly all of the responses hovered around four out of five.</p>
<p>We had hoped to find something like &#8220;the best beard oil for acne-prone skin,&#8221; but our results are nowhere near that conclusive. Mountaineer Brand got highest score for skincare by a few percent, but on the whole we didn&#8217;t consider this data worth including in our averaged score.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t claim that the results we&#8217;ve gathered will be universal, even with the range of skin and hair types in our sample group. If you get breakouts or acne after using a beard oil, you should definitely stop using it and try again with a different oil after your skin gets a chance to recover.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">The best overall: Mountaineer Brand</h2>

<p>Mountaineer Brand is a solid oil from a little company that really cares about making great beard-care products. The blend doesn&#8217;t use exotic oils like argan and jojoba, but that didn&#8217;t stop it from getting solid scores across the board.</p>
<p>This is one of three blends we tested that uses castor oil paired with grapeseed oil, and it&#8217;s a combination of thick and light that works very well. Mountaineer also adds almond oil, and the recipe seems fine-tuned for a balance between fast-enough absorption with long-enough staying power.</p>

This is a brand that has worked hard to establish themselves as the best value in beard oil.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K9KEQA6/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The most critical factor in this pick is price. There are cheaper ways to care for your beard (hair conditioner or veggie oil from your kitchen), but our testing shows Mountaineer&#8217;s blend is definitely a step up. At about $6.50 per ounce, though, you&#8217;re not just throwing money away on trendy ingredients.</p>
<p>We tested Mountaineer&#8217;s &#8220;Barefoot&#8221; unscented blend, but they also have three other scents and a medicated blend.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H5UGUTS/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WV Timber</a> is a top-selling woodsy scent.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IBOJ1BG/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WV Coal</a> is &#8220;clean, cool and musky.&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0149MGRH4/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Citrus &amp; Spice</a> rounds out the lineup with clove, orange and grapefruit notes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pine Tar is an ingredient long used for skin problems, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5434829/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seems to relieve some psoriasis</a>, though it&#8217;s not well understood how exactly the different tar compounds work. If that sounds like something that could help your skin, Mountaineer sells a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LW5J1EM/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pine Tar beard oil blend</a>.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Mountaineer Brand is one of the least expensive ways to try a reliable, high-quality beard oil.</li>
<li>Relative performance is balanced; not too thick, not too thin, average all around.</li>
<li>Three scents to try and a unique pine-tar option means there should be something for everyone.</li>
<li>Easy to find at local retailers if you run out and need an emergency replacement.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Gentlemen&#8217;s Beard is an out-of-nowhere Amazon storefront with luxury branding cues that more or less work despite the unfortunate name. (Who are these gentlemen, and why do they share a beard?)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC-k8c3MgtI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The YouTube video</a> is a cringe-fest, but these guys have picked solid ingredients and come up with a recipe that works just a bit better than anything else.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WF6VFSS/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-gentlemens-beard-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-gentlemens-beard-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-gentlemens-beard-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-gentlemens-beard-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-gentlemens-beard-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-gentlemens-beard-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-gentlemens-beard-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-gentlemens-beard-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-gentlemens-beard.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>The Best Oil Blend: The Gentlemen's Beard</h3><p>This is a recipe that works better than the rest for almost all of our testers. Even at flash-sale prices, though, it's very expensive.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WF6VFSS/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The premium ingredients on offer include the usual suspects: super-trendy oils like jojoba and argan, as well as reliable standby sunflower. Evening primrose oil is an unique addition, it&#8217;s <a href="https://nccih.nih.gov/health/eveningprimrose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not as well-studied</a> as something like coconut oil or olive oil for hair care, but it has been used in traditional medicine for a long time.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear if there&#8217;s anything particular that makes this oil better than others; one tester even called it &#8220;boring,&#8221; and on reflection, some testers said it was their least-favorite. That said, the blind-test ratings were consistently a few points higher for this oil in every category.</p>
<p>Scent options are diverse and mostly come from added essential oils:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MQKODUO?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cedarwood</a> is the ever-popular choice of lumbersexual instagram influencers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0182RJU3K?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sandalwood</a> adds a little more heat than cedar for an exotic touch.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016J3G9MO?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bay Rum</a> is a classic aftershave scent, distant cousin of Old Spice. Also includes coconut oil.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MRLZXJ7?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gentlemen&#8217;s Scent</a> offers a captivating, manly aroma.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WF6VFSS?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Unscented</a> is what we tested. It&#8217;s definitely scent-free.</li>
</ul>
<p>The catch, then, is price. It&#8217;s not clear if The Gentlemen&#8217;s Beard is paying a lot of extra money for the unique ingredient, maybe they&#8217;re buying it in 4-oz bottles. At nearly $20 for an ounce, this is a very expensive product.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.target.com/p/beardbrand-153-blank-slate-beard-oil-1-fl-oz/-/A-52735474" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Beardbrand</a> and a few other carefully marketed &#8220;premium&#8221; brands are aiming for even bigger margins, but at least in this case we found that maybe a little bit of the extra cost was justified.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Gentlemen&#8217;s Beard is an Amazon-exclusive beard care company that has picked just the right blend of oils.</li>
<li>All the expected premium oils are here, and evening primrose oil is a unique addition.</li>
<li>Four scents and an unscented blend, so everyone should be able to find something that works.</li>
<li>That price, though. Ouch.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="great-value">Great value, smells funny: Honest Amish</h2>

<p>Sometimes you try a personal care product that works well, but has a scent you dislike, and Honest Amish was that way for many of our testers.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M49SG0Q/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honest-amish-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honest-amish-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honest-amish-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honest-amish-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honest-amish-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honest-amish-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honest-amish-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honest-amish-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honest-amish.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Another Great Value: Honest Amish</h3><p>If you're OK with the licorice scent, this is another great oil blend, tied for lowest price.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M49SG0Q/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The performance, value and availability of Honest Amish are all great; very close to our top pick, with slightly better performance on average. The trouble, then, is that it comes in one scent: a faint-but-distinct blend of essential oils, the strongest notes being clove and anise.</p>
<p>If you love black licorice, you might love this; maybe even better if your partner loves black licorice. For the rest of us (especially those with spouses who veto the scent) it&#8217;s a no-go.</p>
<p>Honest Amish is one of the older beard-oil-makers, starting up in 2012 after selling a successful balm recipe at Pennsylvania flea markets. They didn&#8217;t have any other scents available when we started our testing, but it looks like they may be launching two other scents. More options from this company would be very welcome!</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Honest Amish beard oil ranked best overall for softening beards.</li>
<li>This isn&#8217;t quite as long-lasting as our top pick, so keep the bottle handy on dry days.</li>
<li>Value is great, with a big dropper bottle for a low price.</li>
<li>The scent is polarizing; do you want your beard to smell like black licorice?</li>

<h3>Cremo</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JQXACS6/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cremo</a> is a brand that has done impressive work building an empire of grooming products. Starting with a super-concentrated shaving cream (which we named <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-shaving-cream/">best shaving cream</a>), they&#8217;ve expanded into all corners of the shaving aisle: pomade, body wash, solid cologne and a lineup of beard oils, balms and shampoos.</p>
<p>For performance factors, Cremo ranked in the solid upper-middle of our samples. A little longer-lasting than most, but on the whole a very average oil. Looking at the ingredients, that&#8217;s no wonder: there&#8217;s basically every kind of oil imaginable in this blend.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for trustworthy ingredients and a small bottle you can buy at a local discount retailer for a gift, Cremo&#8217;s stuff is easy to find and comes in a range of four scents. At $12.50 per ounce, though, it&#8217;s closer to the &#8220;luxury&#8221; end of the pricing scale.</p>
<h3>V76 by Vaughn</h3>
<p>The V76 label is a luxury brand that&#8217;s purportedly curated by a top hairstylist, with products made by some cosmetics company somewhere &#8220;exclusively&#8221; for the private label. As skeptical as that idea makes us, their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EBTAUNW/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">V76 beard oil</a> is unique enough to get an inclusion here.</p>
<p>This blend of oils includes a long list of nearly every obvious skin and hair care oil we can think of. The consistency, though, is different than every other blend we tried; it&#8217;s very nearly sticky, so it seems to give a little bit more weight to beard hairs than the other oils.</p>
<p>That said, in a blind test this oil didn&#8217;t really garner any more or less praise than average. The most notable thing about it is a strong sandalwood scent; if that&#8217;s your thing it should be fine, but it&#8217;s a more concentrated smell than most scented oils we tried.</p>
<h3>Ranger</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0118B5O7I?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ranger</a> is a spin-off from the Leven Rose line of essential oils. At $16 per ounce it&#8217;s actually on the upper end of the price scale we tested, though still far less than buying EE blends through your friend&#8217;s girlfriend&#8217;s MLM company.</p>
<p>This is just rosehip, argan and jojoba oil, so it absorbs quickly; second-fastest according to our blind test. Two essential oil scent options and an unscented blend make this a solid line of beard oils, but not exceptional.</p>
<h3>Beardbrand</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.target.com/p/beardbrand-153-blank-slate-beard-oil-1-fl-oz/-/A-52735474" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Beardbrand</a> is the two-ton gorilla in this lineup. Eric Bandholz turned his love for sweet beards into an explicit mission: to &#8220;change the way society views beardsmen&#8221; through a lifestyle brand. He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXyeYhT7NYQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed that mission accomplished in 2017</a>, making his new tagline &#8220;keep on growing.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a meteoric rise following an appearance on Shark Tank (where he happily admitted that his $25-40 bottles of oil cost about $2 to make), Bandholz has turned his oil into the fuel for a beard-centered lifestyle brand juggernaut. Now there&#8217;s a network of beard bloggers and Instagrammers sharing how awesome it is to have a beard, sponsored by the best-known beard oil.</p>
<p>That said, Beardbrand has drawn its share of criticism. One prominent YouTuber even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0hwNjX3BUI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called out Beardbrand on the &#8220;premium&#8221; label</a>, noting that nearly every beard oil is using &#8220;premium&#8221; ingredients and that the price brackets are all about tricking people.</p>
<p>Bandholz basically <a href="https://youtu.be/oEskpW6X7kg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted this in his rebuttal</a>, but he&#8217;s unapologetic about creating a successful business that makes people happy (and happy to spend lots of money).</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in more sophisticated scents than bare-bones cedar or sandalwood oil, Beardbrand &#8220;<a href="https://www.beardbrand.com/products/gold-line-beard-oil-collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gold line</a>&#8221; of Temple Smoke, Four Vices and Old Money is aimed at you.</p>
<p>The catch, for us, was performance. Overall, our testers felt that the oil (&#8220;designed to be very lightweight&#8221; says the ad copy) just didn&#8217;t have the staying power they were looking for. If it were the same price as other oils, we could call that a matter of preference, but $25 per ounce is pretty steep.</p>
<p>Beardbrand used to only sell direct through their website, but they&#8217;ve got their two most popular oils in <a href="https://www.target.com/p/beardbrand-153-blank-slate-beard-oil-1-fl-oz/-/A-52735474" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Target</a> at $15 now. If you find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IZMZGWM/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Beardbrand on Amazon</a>, it&#8217;s probably someone re-selling a bottle they bought directly, with prices to match.</p>
<p>Now that it&#8217;s available for $15 per ounce, we look more favorably on Beardbrand&#8217;s product, but Cremo has a growing line of scents and accessories that looks like it&#8217;s beat Beardbrand to the punch. (Plus, we liked Cremo&#8217;s eye-dropper bottles better for dispensing oil.)</p>
<h3>Grave Before Shave</h3>
<p>If you bump into a display of beard oil at a hip barbershop, it&#8217;ll likely have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V53NTKO?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Grave Before Shave</a> products. The guys at Fisticuffs LLC have targeted their brand at the bearded-skull-tattoo subculture (we didn&#8217;t really realize that was a thing, either) and they&#8217;ve grown into a mainstay among the more bombastic bearded bretheren.</p>
<p>Grave Before Shave has a solid list of ingredients, including tea tree oil for a little tingle, but the oil performed about as well as straight-up fractionated coconut oil. It&#8217;s not bad, but most people will prefer something more balanced.</p>
<p>The strength of this company is the huge range of scents offered. When we were selecting products, they had nine on offer, and most of them can be found on Amazon or in a sample pack from the company&#8217;s website.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After a few months of testing a wide range of oils, our testers said they were between 20- and 30-percent confident they could tell an oil they liked from an oil they didn&#8217;t. What&#8217;s more, many of our testers started to find that they were looking for a little more hold and control than beard oil offers and asked repeatedly if we were going to test <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ybdbeardo-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=8de1ccfe9bf75885defe8507d786d4cc&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;index=hpc&amp;keywords=beard%20balm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">beard balms</a>.</p>
<p>All things considered, though, any beard oil definitely helps a dry and itchy beard. Even if you just use whatever vegetable oil you have in the cupboard, it&#8217;ll help if you find your beard dull and frizzy or if beardruff is cramping your style at formal events.</p>
<p>At a price that&#8217;s very reasonable for a big bottle, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K9KEQA6/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mountaineer Brand</a> is our best buy. It&#8217;s definitely better than buying bulk coconut oil or jojoba oil, and it comes in a range of scents that can add some spice to your beard-care routine.</p>
<p>There are some oils that use a balanced blend of carefully selected oils that get even better performance, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WF6VFSS/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Gentlemen&#8217;s Beard</a> had the best score overall in our tests. We don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth the money for most people, but if you&#8217;re looking for a particular scent then it might be worth a splurge.</p>
