				<description><![CDATA[After testing four top-ranked options, the Brita - BB10 won our pick as the best filtered water bottle for safe-to-drink city water.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter using four top-ranked bottles at home, on the go and in the great outdoors, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H1F6N2F/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; BB10</a> won our pick as the best filtered water bottle for better taste from safe-to-drink city water. If you&#8217;re going out into the wilderness, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C6HAYCS/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Grayl &#8211; Ultralight</a> is a purifying water bottle that removes organisms like bacteria and protozoa, as well as mineral contaminants like heavy metals.</p>
<h2>How we selected</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve tested a lot of water filters over the years, including <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">the best water filter pitchers</a> and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-faucet-water-filter/">faucet filters</a>. Our staff has come to appreciate the taste of chlorine-free drinking water without the added expense of buying bottled water.</p>
<p>We looked for systems in two different classes:</p>
<p>First, we looked at filters that were designed to remove only bad-tasting elements like chlorine from treated, safe-to-drink water. The standards for this type of filter are fairly easy to meet, but they&#8217;re specific. An activated carbon block or column of granules will capture most of the stuff you can smell in city water.</p>
<p>Second, we looked at bottles designed for use in the back country and overseas travel, where the concern is more for biological contamination than taste. We consulted guides from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/backcountry_water_treatment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Center for Disease Control</a> and <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/t-d/pubs/pdf/hi_res/07231304hi.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forest Service</a> to ensure we were checking for the right factors.</p>
<p>We narrowed our choices to bottles that had affordable replacement filters and were easy to purchase. A few other picks, like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075X5R67T/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Katadyn &#8211; BeFree</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078WYNCZ5/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LifeSaver</a>, weren&#8217;t available when we tested and weren&#8217;t competitive with the LifeStraw on pricing despite using similar technologies.</p>
<h2>Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Carbon filters</strong> &#8211; If you want a filter to remove the taste of chlorine and other volatile substances, activated carbon is economical and very effective. It isn&#8217;t effective at removing dissolved minerals, though, and the size of particles carbon passes through will depend on the design. Carbon filters soak up less and less contaminants the more they&#8217;re used, and they can&#8217;t be cleaned.</p>
<p><strong>Ion-exchange filters</strong> &#8211; If you want to remove the dissolved salts and metals in water, ion-exchange resin will grab them. Some new tests also show that this works to capture microbial contaminants. This is one of the technologies used in <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">Zero Water filter pitchers</a> to get rid of all dissolved solids. Like activated carbon, the filter is used up as it cleans water, but you can&#8217;t tell how much it has left unless you count the number of times you fill the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>Particle filters</strong> &#8211; If you&#8217;re mostly worried about avoiding beaver fever while backpacking, a hollow-fiber or ceramic filter can be effective at removing everything from silt to tiny virus and bacteria organisms, depending on the size of the holes. In the extra-dense microbiological filters they require hand-pump pressure or hours-long gravity filtration to make questionable water safe. These filters are fairly easy to clean and continue using for a long time, but they don&#8217;t do much to improve the taste of city water or if you use treatment drops.</p>
<p><strong>Particulate ratings</strong> &#8211; NSF International and other water quality testers rate filters based on the largest compounds they can possibly let through. A smaller class number or absolute filter size will be more effective, but it will also stop working more quickly. Class I is the important class, since this means the filter stops particles larger than 0.5 microns, and that category includes some of the most worrisome organisms in mountain streams.</p>
<p><strong>Effectiveness against biological contaminants</strong> &#8211; Class I particulate ratings — or better still, testing that shows compliance with the NSF Standard 53 or 58 for “cyst reduction / removal” — mean filters can trap protozoan cysts like giardia or cryptosporidium. However, these filters might still let some bacteria (which can be as small as 0.2 microns) through. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/backcountry_water_treatment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC highly recommends</a> using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075XVMZG2/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">chlorine dioxide treatment</a> or just boiling water before you filter it.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re travelling in populated areas, virus-size organisms are a bigger concern and require an even tighter, slower filter that meets <a href="https://www.msrgear.com/blog/water-101-decoding-water-filter-testing-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the strict P248 standard</a> for worst-case water supplies. That kind of filter requires a high-pressure hand pump or a slow gravity-drain mechanism.</p>
<p>Bottles like Grayl and Seychelle claim to be effective at removing viruses with ion-exchange filters, but they don&#8217;t publish the specifications of their tests and they&#8217;re definitely not P248-rated.</p>
<p><strong>Flow rating</strong> &#8211; The more quickly water flows through a filter, the easier it is to use. That&#8217;s almost always a trade-off with effectiveness, though. Also remember that if you use water that&#8217;s cloudy, the particles will plug up your filter more quickly and reduce the flow.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter comparing lab tests from dozens of filter systems, we bought the four top faucet water filters and compared them with filtered water from pitchers, reverse osmosis and bottled water suppliers. The best faucet water filter was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IV0P/?tag=ybdfctflt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; FF100</a>, with its compact size and excellent performance certifications. Brita also adds a multi-pattern spray and push-button filter replacement. Our runner-up is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VZ2LMM/?tag=ybdfctflt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DuPont &#8211; WWFM350</a>, which will go longer between filter changes but isn&#8217;t as compact.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>To find the best water filter for faucets, we started with searches for reviews. The number of comprehensive reviews that compare the best on-faucet water filter systems is surprisingly low, with top hits giving little if any evidence they&#8217;d actually used the products or compared to competing products.</p>
<p>Faucet water filters are a niche category; they’re not as popular as the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">water filter pitchers we&#8217;ve tested</a> but are easier to purchase and install than under-sink filtration systems. The big players from the world of pitchers are selling faucet-mount systems, but there are also hundreds of imitators cashing in.</p>
<p>The price of a mystery-brand filter is usually slightly lower than the faucet-mount water filter systems you&#8217;d recognize, but you&#8217;re giving up a lot of confidence for a few dollars per year. Some of the cheapest filters aren&#8217;t even specifying what kind of filter they use.</p>
<p>To ensure we were testing products that are trustworthy, we only bought filters that had been <a href="#NSF">independently certified by NSF International</a>. These certificates mean that a filter will perform as advertised even well beyond the rated life of the filter, and their laboratory controls are far more comprehensive and strict than we could hope to achieve in our test homes. NSF doesn&#8217;t make recommendations about the quality or suitability of a product, but they do tell you what a filter actually takes out of your drinking water.</p>
<p>The tricky part of choosing a water filter, even with that assurance, is that not every filter is given the same tests. A manufacturer chooses which compounds to test against, and NSF only lists a pass rating. If a certain contaminant was tested and the filter was poor at filtering it, neither the manufacturer nor NSF has to tell you.</p>
<p>We searched the NSF database for faucet water filters that had been tested and listed, and we bought all the most recent models that had been at least tested to remove lead.</p>
<p>We considered countertop units that attach to a faucet with hoses, but after comparing cost of ownership and the reliability and awkwardness (not to mention the increased up-front cost and the awkwardness of the hoses) we decided to stick with filters that mount directly to the faucet spout.</p>
<p>After finding the brands who had paid for comprehensive testing of filter performance, we checked customer reviews to see if there were features that stood out or had reliability concerns.</p>
<p>Sadly, all of the filters we found with trustworthy reviews have reports of failure. Any time you&#8217;re running water through small tubes and channels, mineral build-up is going to cause problems. The restricted flow of the filter only makes that worse. Still, we weighed the reports of filters popping off and splitting apart carefully when weighing the different models available.</p>

[table id=282 /]
<h2 id="what-to-filter">Do I really need a filter?</h2>
<p>This is the hardest question for us to answer. In many ways, the answer for most people with internet access will typically be &#8220;you don&#8217;t need to filter anything, your water is safe.&#8221; But that&#8217;s not exactly the whole picture.</p>
<h3>U.S. water safety</h3>
<p>Water treatment is what makes drinking water safe for most of us. Some people have a private well that they need to monitor themselves, but the vast majority of the United States relies on a local water authority. You can look up who that is and how well they&#8217;re managing your water <a href="https://ofmpub.epa.gov/apex/sfdw/f?p=108:200::::::" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) database</a>. This tracks who supplies water and whether contaminants have been found above allowed levels.</p>
<p>If your local water authority doesn&#8217;t mail it directly to you, you can also read <a href="https://ofmpub.epa.gov/apex/safewater/f?p=136:102::::::" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a consumer confidence report, also tracked by the EPA</a>. This lets you see not just a passing grade but also details about how close household water is to goals set by community health agencies. They&#8217;ll also report on &#8220;secondary&#8221; standards, which cover water-quality factors that aren&#8217;t considered health threats.</p>
<p>If you see a listed contaminant that&#8217;s too close to the limit for comfort, you can check for that contaminant on filter ratings before you buy.</p>
<h3>Chlorine and taste</h3>
<p>The main reason to filter drinking water is that chlorine — the disinfectant used in civic water supplies — doesn&#8217;t taste very good. The amount of chlorine used is regulated and checked by your water authority, but you can make most city water taste better by filtering out chlorine.</p>
<p>When we checked with brand-new and well-used water-pitcher filters, we found that even &#8220;used up&#8221; granular carbon filters are very effective at removing chlorine. This is all covered in NSF standard 42, which is a common certification for consumer water filters.</p>
<h3>What about Lead pipes?</h3>
<p>Water in our tester&#8217;s city is clean, but the local consumer confidence report says that over 90 percent of the homes have some lead in water tested from the tap. That&#8217;s all because of old pipes inside houses, not from the civic water supply. It&#8217;s about one third of the allowable level of lead but well above the public health goal.</p>
<p>This is a similar situation to homes in Flint, Michigan before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flint water crisis</a>, where switching water supplies caused old pipes, formerly safe, to release lead at unsafe levels.</p>
<p>In response to the Flint crisis, lead filtration has become one of the most heavily-advertised features of water filters. All of the filtration systems we recommend are specifically certified to remove lead.</p>
<h2 id="NSF">NSF filter ratings</h2>
<p>NSF International started as a branch of the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan. The name of the agency then was the &#8220;National Sanitation Foundation,&#8221; though they&#8217;re officially just NSF International these days.</p>
<p>NSF works with many food, health and safety agencies worldwide as a private certification agency.  Along with other standard-setters like with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) they establish what&#8217;s safe, then test and certify products ranging from bakeware to medical devices. They&#8217;re the main certifier of water filtration equipment, and they set tests standards based on input from various stakeholders, including manufacturers of water filters.</p>
<p>NSF isn&#8217;t an agency that recommends products, though — they only test and certify. If you see an advertisement claiming NSF testing, that advertisement doesn&#8217;t tell you the complete story of what was or was not successful in the product&#8217;s testing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nsf.org/consumer-resources/water-quality/water-filters-testing-treatment/standards-water-treatment-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There are two standard tests for NSF-certified water filters</a>, and many more that aren&#8217;t commonly requested or advertised:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NSF/ANSI standard 42</strong> certifies that a water filter can &#8220;reduce aesthetic impurities such as chlorine and taste/odor.&#8221; This is not linked to any health claim, and it&#8217;s an easy standard to meet with activated carbon. Basically every water filter more sophisticated than a mesh strainer meets this standard.</li>
<li><strong>NSF/ANSI standard 53</strong> is the other common test, and in this case certifies that a filter can reduce levels of tested contaminants in water from unsafe to safe. Every filter we looked at has some NSF 53 certification, though not all are certified for the same contaminants; the manufacturer chooses what to test for.</li>
<li><strong>NSF/ANSI standard 53 &#8211; VOC</strong> is a subset of the safety test that covers volatile organic compounds (&#8220;VOCs&#8221;). These are compounds that evaporate quickly and require a different testing regimen: typically, VOC performance is tested by filtering water loaded with chloroform through the filter, and NSF infers the results for other contaminants based on past lab work. A longer list, then, doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean anything.</li>
<li><strong>NSF/ANSI standard 401</strong> is another sub-set of standard 53. This test specifically covers 15 contaminants that aren&#8217;t yet regulated by health or water quality agencies. These include pesticides, flame retardants, detergents and pharmaceuticals. Only two of the brands we tested had been certified with these specific tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that not every filter is rated for the same compounds makes comparing results tricky.</p>
<p>For example, it could be that one filter manufacturer has embedded some other filter medium in their activated carbon block so that it will capture metals better; if another manufacturer hasn&#8217;t advertised their filter removing that metal, it could be that the filter failed a test.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it could simply be that the filter manufacturers are counting on the public only looking at a few key contaminants. Testing for lead, for example, is a no-brainer after the highly-publicized Flint water crisis, but few consumers are actively seeking solutions for mercury contamination. Leaving mercury off the test list might be a cost-saving measure, or it could even be that the performance is just slightly poor enough (say, only 85 percent removed instead of 98 percent) that it sticks out on the data sheet and makes the filter look worse than it would otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="water-test-scam">The water test scam</h2>
<p>Hardware stores often provide &#8220;free&#8221; water testing kits, but be careful: the hardware store test kits are specifically designed to get you to buy a reverse osmosis system by emphasizing the mineral content of your water.</p>
<p>Some salesmen will even use deceptive tests to convince you that you have things in your water that aren&#8217;t actually there. See <a href="http://chemistryhall.com/dont-get-tricked-water-purification-scams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this account of a chemist explaining false tests to a salesman</a> who doesn&#8217;t even seem to understand what he&#8217;s actually testing.</p>
<p>Many consumers have been duped into paying for a system at above-market-value, and often on a store credit card with predatory interest policies.</p>
<p>Agencies like the <a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/environment/water/docs/factsheet/beware.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minnesota Department of Health</a> and the <a href="http://myfloridalegal.com/__85256CC5006DFCC3.nsf/0/3D0FD1650FC920C485256CC900698282?Open&amp;Highlight=0,in-home,water,test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida Attorney General</a> have issued statements specifically advising consumers to be cautious about purchasing filters after seeing tests performed by installation companies. Class-action lawsuits are being fought all over the country, and one has even reached <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/17-1471.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Supreme Court</a>.</p>
<p>You can pay an independent laboratory for water testing, but you still need to know what is a safe and reasonable amount of the contaminants they find, and you still have to decide what else you might want to improve.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Installation: </b>Faucet filters thread onto your faucet spout so pressure can force water through the filter. Each system comes with three thread adapters for all the common kitchen faucet aerator fittings, but none will work with a pull-out hand sprayer or other non-threaded spouts. Bathroom faucets won&#8217;t usually work, either.</p>
<p><b>Size and bulk:</b> The systems we found all use approximately the same size of filter cartridge, but some are much bigger than others. A big filter system could get in the way when you&#8217;re trying to wash dishes or fill a stock pot.</p>
<p><b>Flow options:</b> All faucet-mount filters allow you to bypass the filter. You don&#8217;t want to deplete the filter and settle for reduced water pressure when you&#8217;re washing dishes. Some filters automatically switch back to unfiltered water with a spring-return switch, while others offer multiple spray patterns in the unfiltered position.</p>
<p><b>Filter ratings:</b> All of the filters we found use carbon block filters, so they&#8217;re comparable. They&#8217;re not all certified to remove the same contaminants, though. <a href="#NSF">See our section on NSF certification for the details</a>.</p>
<p><b>Vertical or horizontal filter: </b>This is one of the biggest differences between designs. A vertical filter mount gives you a bit more room around your faucet spout, but they can drip a little leftover water from inside the filter. In comparison, horizontal-mount filters won&#8217;t dribble as much after you shut off the flow.</p>
<h2>How carbon filters work</h2>
<p>All of the water filter faucets in this category rely on carbon block filtration. That&#8217;s different from activated carbon granules, like you&#8217;d find in the budget pick from our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">water filter pitcher review</a>.</p>
<p>A sheet of carbon sticks to other atoms and most carbon-based (organic) molecules, which also tend to be the worst-tasting. Activated carbon has so many microscopic pores, it has an active surface area of almost a million square feet per ounce.</p>
<p>Carbon block filters use compressed charcoal as a medium, which means the paths through the filter will capture most particles larger than a micron. It takes extra pressure to get water flowing through: Granule-based filters pass water much more easily and can use gravity-feed systems, but they also allow more contaminants to slip past.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, carbon filters are very good for capturing everything in water except dissolved minerals, metals and salts. Carbon filters are even great at filtering chlorine, which is typically the worst-tasting stuff in city water.</p>
<p>So, what about those dissolved minerals? Well, there&#8217;s good news and bad news. If you&#8217;re worried about heavy metals like lead, newer carbon filters work much better than traditional granulated carbon systems like the classic Brita pitcher. All the filters we tested are certified to handle lead, and most are also certified to take out mercury.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re worried about fluoride and other dissolved minerals, you&#8217;ll have to use a more complicated system with another filter type alongside a carbon filter or a full-on reverse-osmosis system or distiller that removes basically everything.</p>
<p>The ion-exchange beads in a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/zerowater/">Zero Water gravity filters</a> (and by many water softener systems) are the most effective way to get rid of the rest of the dissolved minerals in tap water. We started using a Zero Water to eliminate &#8220;white dust&#8221; mineral residue from hard water after testing for our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-humidifier/">humidifier review</a> and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-essential-oil-diffuser/">essential oil diffuser review</a>. It&#8217;s an effective solution that doesn&#8217;t require any expensive equipment installations. The more minerals you&#8217;ve got in your water, though, the more quickly a Zero Water filter will be used up.</p>
<p>If fluoride is the compound you&#8217;re specifically trying to eliminate, an activated alumina filter medium can be used in multi-stage filter systems along with carbon  filters. The alumina requires a much slower flow rate to be effective, though, so this is not a common design, even in under-sink filter systems. Usually the best way to remove fluoride is a full reverse-osmosis system.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/faucetfilter_install.mp4.mov" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Installing and using these filters was, thankfully, very easy. All the kits came with adapters for internal or external threading, but you will need to install it on a faucet with a threaded aerator of some kind. If you have a pull-out hand sprayer or other unique spout, these filters won&#8217;t be able to attach.</p>
<h3>Cost of ownership</h3>
[table id=280 /]
<p>We looked at average prices for filters and compared the cost of filtering a gallon of water every day with each system. We also factored the cost of replacing the system itself every 18 months.</p>
<p>Most people will be able to run these systems for much longer than that, but if you get sediment or calcium building up inside, any of these could start to leak from the pressure forcing water through the carbon block. Also, you can&#8217;t replace the battery for any of the filter replacement lights.</p>
<h3>Taste testing</h3>
<p>We got our family of taste-testers to compare these filters to our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">top-ranked water filter pitchers</a>, the Zero Water and Brita &#8211; Longlast. On the whole, the faucet filters were neck-and-neck with the Brita and just ahead of Zero Water. The average scores in the blind test were very close.</p>
<h3>Dissolved solids and lab tests</h3>
[table id=281 /]
<p>We used a conductivity meter to test for electrolytic dissolved minerals in our water, which includes everything from salt to sulphates. The faucet filters are leaving basically the same amount of dissolved minerals in our (fairly hard) Southern California water as the Brita &#8211; Longlast pitcher does. Even the best water filter for a sink faucet can&#8217;t match <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/#top-pick">Zero Water&#8217;s party trick</a> of removing all dissolved minerals.</p>
<h3>Chlorine</h3>
<p>We wanted to see if any of these filters would show a different result when it comes to taste’s biggest enemy, chlorine. Our chlorine test kit can detect a .01 part-per-million difference in total chlorine.</p>
<p>The tap water we tested had between 0.7 and 1 PPM of chlorine. We found that any water filter we try, no matter how long it had been in use, would remove all detectable traces of chlorine. The faucet filters gave the same great results.</p>
<h3>Size</h3>

<p>As we used these filters over our first week of daily testing, we quickly realized that size was a more important factor than performance for kitchen use. The filters didn&#8217;t prevent our filling a stockpot or washing dishes, but when we rinsed off a baking sheet or did other awkward sink-filling work it was more difficult with the bulky filter in the way.</p>
<p>You can remove and re-attach these filters without tools in most cases, so you could take off a filter if it gets in the way of filling or washing something on occasion, but it became quickly apparent that the smaller filters were easier to live with.</p>
<h2 id="top-pick">Top pick: Brita &#8211; FF-100</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IV0P/?tag=ybdfctflt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; FF-100</a> faucet water filter system squeaks ahead of every other filter system we tried in most respects. Brita has been around the home water filter market longer than anyone, and their experience shows in the refinements they&#8217;ve made to this system.</p>
<p>First and foremost, this is the most compact faucet filter we found. It&#8217;s still an awkward lump hovering over your sink, but the vertical orientation of the filter cylinder gives you a little bit more access than other designs. The fact that the filter output comes from the bottom means some dripping after you turn off the flow as gravity pulls the last few drops out of the filter block, but on the whole, it makes more sense than a horizontal filter.</p>
<p>This is an update of Brita&#8217;s old filter design, the SAFF-100. The plug-in filter cartridges are the same across old and new Brita faucet-mount systems, so performance is identical.</p>
<p>The main difference between the two systems is how the flow selection works: The old system used a wing-nut-shaped twist-knob, while the new system is a paddle that you push back and forth. The size and shape of the paddle is similar, but it&#8217;s slightly easier to push than to twist.</p>
<p>Brita also added a second spray pattern to the non-filtered flow outlet. A spray stream on your faucet, like the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-shower-head/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spray-type shower heads we&#8217;ve reviewed</a>, typically uses less water to do the same washing and may be even better for rinsing if you have low water pressure.</p>
<h3>Filter Performance</h3>
<p>Brita&#8217;s certified filter performance is good. It doesn&#8217;t have the very best numbers in every category, but water-filter performance is tricky to evaluate: How many parts per trillion of atrazine or mercury is a problem if you&#8217;re drinking from a safe water source?</p>
<p>We relied mostly on the NSF tests to evaluate filter performance for this review, because, let&#8217;s face it, we can&#8217;t be more thorough than they are. More to the point, these filters are all basically the same. Carbon-block filters capture very small particles as well as most important chemical compounds that we worry about.</p>
<p>Brita does list certification for VOC removal, which means if you have dissolved solvents and gasses in your water, the Brita is certified to remove most of them. The fact that some filters don&#8217;t list VOC performance isn&#8217;t much of a concern, since it&#8217;s a standard benefit of using a carbon block, but it&#8217;s reassuring that Brita has paid to show what this filter can do.<br />
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IV0Pybdfctflt-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="" data-srcset="" width="" height="" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Overall: Brita - FF-100</h3><p>The compact design and extra features make this filter a stand-out winner. Brita has all the certificates to show how well this filter works, and the flow switch makes it easy to use at your main kitchen sink. So long as you've got a standard faucet, this is a good choice for on-demand drinking water.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IV0Pybdfctflt-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<h3>Cost vs. convenience</h3>
<p>The twist-open container designs used on the other filter systems aren&#8217;t difficult to open or close, but Brita&#8217;s design is more compact. These plug-in cartridges have a downside, in that they use slightly more plastic and need to be replaced more frequently.</p>
<p>Also, some users report that mineral build-up can make the seals leak and even prevent the filter from attaching securely. Mineral build-up will ruin any pressurized filter system eventually, so we factored an 18 month replacement cycle into our cost calculation.</p>
<p>Brita will pay for shipping to send in the filters so they can recycle them, but you need to collect the filters for years before you&#8217;d have a full shipment of five pounds.</p>
<p>Unlike the gallon-counting LCD screen on the DuPont, Brita just gives you a bare-bones LED indicator to tell you when to change the filter. We weren&#8217;t able to filter the full 100 gallons on ours before press time, but given that the digital readout on the DuPont wasn&#8217;t accurate, it&#8217;s hard to give either system any extra points.</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/faucetfilter_use.mp4.mov" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Another downside, as you can see in this video clip, is that the filter outlet does take a few seconds to empty after each use.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the difference between the Brita and the long-lasting Culligan system worked out to about $11 per year, $52 vs. $41, when we compared average filter prices and estimated replacing the whole system every 18 months. (In worst-case hard-water conditions these systems start to plug up after that long.) That&#8217;s about the same price you&#8217;d pay using a Brita filter pitcher with a Longlast filter.</p>
<p>No matter which faucet filter you choose you&#8217;re adding an obstacle to your sink, but the Brita gives you the most room. It&#8217;s slightly more expensive in the long run, but the replacement filters are also easy to get.</p>
<p>Adding in the extra utility of a second spray pattern with an easy-to-flip selector, the Brita was somewhat more useful for washing dishes as well. When we had to decide on a system we liked using most, this was a pretty easy pick.</p>

<p>If you want maximum filter life and maximum performance, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VZ2LMM/?tag=ybdfctflt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DuPont &#8211; WWFM350</a> has you covered. The filter included with the FM350 is rated for double the number of gallons that Brita certifies for their filter, though the system costs slightly more overall. In the long run, you could save some money with the DuPont filters.</p>
<p>DuPont also makes this system in a chrome finish, which might go better with your kitchen than Brita&#8217;s white plastic.</p>
<p>Compared to the long list of solvents and organic compounds that Brita has tested their filter against, Dupont lists fewer results overall. They did get their filter certified to remove mercury, however, which is a notable absence on the Brita performance sheet.</p>
<p>There is one quirk about the performance sheet that we found disturbing: The results of the NSF International tests for both DuPont&#8217;s 100-gallon &#8220;extra protection&#8221; filter and the 200-gallon &#8220;ultra protection&#8221; are identical. The ultra protection filter is probably thicker to provide more surface area and last longer. It&#8217;s only a 50-percent price increase for a 100-percent increase in filter life, so it&#8217;s not a rip-off, but the labels imply a bigger difference than there is.</p>

The performance is also certified to be top-class. The system itself is bulky compared to Brita's, though.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VZ2LMMybdfctflt-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>In terms of potential filter performance, let&#8217;s say this again: It would be surprising to see any meaningful difference between these systems we tested. We couldn&#8217;t even pick out anything distinctive about the taste from any of the water samples.</p>
<p>A unique feature of the DuPont is the flow counter: A small LCD screen on the side of the filter holder counts up the number of gallons passing through on the way up to the rated limit of 200. We weren&#8217;t impressed by the accuracy of the counter on the unit we bought: It only showed a few gallons used after the initial &#8220;flush&#8221; indicator went away and we used the filter for a few days of drinking water, making coffee and cooking. When we measured the meter with three gallons of water a week into our test, the digital &#8220;gallons filtered&#8221; display only ticked over after an average of one quart extra was filtered.</p>
<p>The major downfall of the DuPont compared to the Brita was size, though. Even if you don&#8217;t want the extra spray mode the Brita spout provides, the more compact size is a big help. DuPont made their system about 30 percent smaller than the PUR, though, so it&#8217;s not the worst offender.</p>
<p>If the counter had been more accurate or the design had been more compact this could have earned a stronger recommendation, but at the end of the day it&#8217;s just a bulky alternative to the Brita.</p>

<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VZ2LMM/?tag=ybdfctflt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DuPont &#8211; WWFM350</a> filters twice as many gallons as the Brita for a few dollars more per filter.</li>
<li>This is a more expensive system to buy up-front, so this is a longer-term investment.</li>
<li>The gallon counter is kind of nifty, but it&#8217;s a big, clunky filter compared to the Brita.</li>
<li>Comes in imitation nickel, chrome or white plastic finishes.</li>

<p>If you want the lowest possible up-front investment, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01E1FMZ5C/?tag=ybdfctflt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Culligan&#8217;s FM-100c</a> offers most of the benefits of the other filters for less than $20. It&#8217;s a mid-sized system, a little bit smaller than the DuPont but not as compact as the Brita.</p>
<p>Culligan&#8217;s FM-R filters are rated to last a full 200 gallons like Dupont&#8217;s, but they&#8217;re not as cheap or easy to find. If you have to pay more than the list price for filters, it might be cheaper to replace the whole filter system than to buy a refill. Culligan is still the least-expensive filter system over time, though, if you ever have to replace the whole unit because of a plugged-up switch or leaking seal.</p>
<p>Culligan&#8217;s system is simple. Rather than a knob or paddle switch, you get a spring-loaded plunger that switches flow between filtered and unfiltered spouts. This plunger returns flow to the unfiltered spout when you shut off the water, which is good for conserving your filter. That said, if you&#8217;re filling multiple drinking glasses or water bottles, it&#8217;s annoying that you need to switch it every time you turn off the tap. You&#8217;ll also have to wiggle it sometimes to get the flow entirely to the filter.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we don&#8217;t have any serious problems with the Culligan system, but it feels like every feature winds up being a compromise rather than a benefit.</p>
<p>Even the performance certificate feels like a cost-cutting exercise, with no VOCs tested and only three of the most worrisome compounds listed. It&#8217;s a safe bet that this filter performs almost the same as the others, but it seems the manufacturer wasn&#8217;t invested in showing that. The Culligan did show the lowest amount of dissolved solids in a conductivity test, but it was less than a 10 percent difference.</p>

<p>PUR is one of the biggest filter names in the North American market, nipping at Brita&#8217;s heels. The <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/PUR-Chrome-Horizontal-Faucet-Mount-System-PFM400H/300173955" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PUR &#8211; Advanced PFM400H</a> uses a top-tier carbon-block filter, but the device is just too bulky to win applause from our testers.</p>
<p>Of all the filters we tested, this was the largest. Any lump of chrome-painted plastic on the end of your faucet is going to get in the way to some degree, and we can&#8217;t say that this one was a particular problem, but you won&#8217;t forget it&#8217;s there.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that PUR hides the size and shape of their filter in the advertising and packaging by only showing it from the side lost them a few points of our esteem.</p>
<p>The flow-diverter switch is the one highlight of this filter: It&#8217;s a big, smooth, easy-to-flip lever. There aren&#8217;t any extra faucet-spray features like Brita has, but it does feel nicer than the other filters in that one regard.</p>
<p>This is the mid-range model from PUR&#8217;s newest lineup, and at about $32, it&#8217;s on the upper end of the range we tested. The filter only lasts for 100 gallons, but they&#8217;re slightly cheaper than the Brita refills. Since the unit itself is so expensive, the real gamble is that the body might plug up with mineral residue and start leaking before you see any benefit from the cheaper filters.</p>
<p>PUR does have a <a href="https://www.target.com/p/pur-ultimate-faucet-filtration-system-with-bluetooth/-/A-50968052" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bluetooth-enabled version of this system</a>, but there are almost certainly better ways to track your water intake than a water filter app. It&#8217;s nice to have a definite number for the life of the filter, but we don&#8217;t have much confidence that the flow meter on PUR&#8217;s system would be more accurate than DuPont&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The PUR &#8211; Advanced model we tested does have one premium feature we were eager to try: The RF9999 &#8220;MineralClear&#8221; filters are supposed to add a small amount of dissolved minerals back into your water after it passes through the carbon block.</p>
<p>We couldn&#8217;t really taste a notable improvement, though the water from the PUR system did have about five percent more dissolved minerals than the average. Note that that&#8217;s in a range of 260 to 290 parts per million of dissolved minerals, fairly hard water that was basically unchanged by the other filters. You don&#8217;t have to worry about a faucet mount system taking away all the benign or beneficial minerals the way you do with reverse osmosis or a Zero Water system.</p>
<p>Pur&#8217;s MineralClear filters are certified to take out more contaminants than the other three filters we tested, with basically the same test certifications as DuPont. This is a good filter, but it&#8217;s not obviously doing more than any other carbon filter to give you clean water.</p>

<p>Faucet mount water filters are easy to install and work well. When we&#8217;re testing for our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-water-bottle/">water bottle review</a> and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-drip-coffee-maker/">coffee maker review</a>, it&#8217;s easy to grow tired of waiting for a pitcher to gravity-filter enough water. Faucet-mounted filters mean on-demand water without giving up any under-sink space for pressure tanks or filter manifolds that come with larger systems.</p>
<p>So long as you have a standard faucet spout with a threaded aerator — and not a pull-out hand-sprayer — any of these filters will install quickly and give you great-tasting water. They all use activated carbon blocks, so the results are similar.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IV0P/?tag=ybdfctflt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; FF-100</a> is a clear winner despite the similar-tasting water. The body is compact and keeps mostly out of the way, and the extra spray option might even make this a handy faucet upgrade for some people. It&#8217;s still less expensive to run this filter than to buy Brita&#8217;s pitcher filters, so as long as you don&#8217;t need your water chilled by the fridge, this is a great option.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[The Brita has outstanding filter time and brand recognition, but it's not the best overall water filter pitcher given average filtering and ergonomic design. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>rita water filters are the indisputable market leaders in the pour-through water filter market, with an estimated 70 percent of the overall market. Since 1988, when Brita was licensed in North America, they have dominated the industry. To many, Brita is synonymous with water filters due to decades of successful marketing, low cost and availability. However, as highlighted below, we believe that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0073PZ6O0/?tag=ybdbrita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater &#8211; 10-Cup Pitcher</a> is the best water filter pitcher on the market.</p>

<h2 id="do-filters-work">Do Brita filters work?</h2>
<p>In short, the answer is yes. Brita filters are <a href="http://info.nsf.org/Certified/DWTU/Listings.asp?Company=06710&amp;Standard=042" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certified by NSF International</a>, including NSF/ANSI Standards 42 and 53. In short, this means that Brita filters are able to remove significant amounts of harmful contaminants from your water, including chlorine and several harmful metals.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HEYJ08S/?tag=ybdbrita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita filters</a> are also able to filter water quickly. In fact, during our testing, we found that the Brita filter was actually the fastest at filtering a cup of water out of all 5 water filter pitchers we tested.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter.png" alt="how long to filter water" width="880" height="590" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-610x409.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-360x241.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-375x251.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-414x278.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-295x198.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-180x121.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-320x215.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Brita filters are also quite inexpensive. While the prices will vary depending on where you are buying (and what the current deals or promotions are), overall Brita filters offer among the lowest cost per cup of water filtered.</p>
<p>The filters for a Brita water pitcher are also easy to find, which makes replacing them notably easier than for some of the less well-known brands.</p>
<h2 id="did-not-likes">What we didn’t like about the Brita pitcher</h2>
<p>While there are certainly things to like about the Brita water filter pitcher, there were several issues we found while testing them.</p>
<p>First (and arguably most importantly), Brita filters simply do not filter as well as other filters on the market, according to certifications like the ones provided by NSF International.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1.png" width="880" height="608" /></p>
<p>ZeroWater filters, for example, are able to reduce significantly more contaminants from the water, while MAVEA filters work better than Brita filters <i>and</i> are able to filter at a more consistent rate for the life of each individual water filter.</p>
<p>We also found the Brita &#8211; 10-Cup Everyday Water Pitcher to be bulky and cumbersome to carry and use. Whether we were carrying the pitcher to or from the sink, or simply pouring water into the glass, it felt like there was a lack of attention to detail when designing the Brita pitcher.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3044398/most-creative-people/can-this-startup-end-britas-water-market-dominance-with-a-more-beautifu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other publications have noted</a>, Brita water filter pitchers are not exactly the type of product you would feature on a magazine cover, or even at a dinner party. While this isn’t the most important consideration when purchasing a water filter pitcher, the fact that there are other products which look better <i>and</i> filter better as well is worth noting.</p>
<h2 id="place-in-market">The Brita water filter’s place in the market</h2>
<p>There is no doubt that the Brita water filter is the undisputed market leader. The combination of low-cost filters and pitchers, nearly three decades in the North American market, and a series of successful marketing and retail placement campaigns have ensured that Brita will be a popular water filter brand for many years to come.</p>
<p>Brita’s competitors are fighting for a comparatively small slice of the market. ZeroWater, in particular, has targeted and focused on the higher end of the market, while still keeping their filters reasonably affordable &#8212; though they are more expensive than Brita filters.</p>
<p>Other brands, like MAVEA, are fighting for some of the same market share as Brita. While MAVEA is fighting against an entrenched incumbent and literally decades of brand recognition, the impressive ergonomics and water filter quality of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002U50QQQ/?tag=ybdbrita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MAVEA</a> brand have allowed them to eke out a small but growing segment of the market.</p>
<p>Time will tell if Brita is able to remain the market leader, or if they will gradually lose market share to competitors like ZeroWater (now the #2 brand in pour-through water filter pitchers) and MAVEA.</p>
<h2 id="how-brita-compares">How do Brita filters compare to others?</h2>
<p>Although it doesn’t tend to market itself as such, Brita is effectively the “discount brand” in the water filter pitcher market. In addition to being among the least expensive, it is simple, reliable, and virtually ubiquitous.</p>
<h3>Brita vs. PUR</h3>
<p>Pur is another popular brand, primarily in the sink filter market. We weren’t particularly impressed with it because filtration time was notably slow, and many of our taste testers found the water to taste “artificial”.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013FQ8QHO/?tag=ybdbrita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PUR 7 Cup Pitcher</a> is similar to the Brita pitcher, in the sense that it isn’t particularly ergonomic or visually appealing.</p>
<p>If you’re choosing between a Brita pour-through water filter pitcher or one by PUR, we would recommend Brita.</p>
<h3>Brita vs. MAVEA</h3>
<p>Both the Brita and MAVEA filters use similar technology. This makes sense, given that the MAVEA brand is the same team that was behind the launch of Brita water filters in North America in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>Despite their similarities and shared history, the minds at MAVEA have clearly evolved their water filters over the years. According to our research and testing, water filtered by MAVEA water filters tastes better, and MAVEA’s water pitcher design is more ergonomic and visually appealing.</p>
<h3>Brita vs. ZeroWater</h3>

<p>Brita and ZeroWater are the two industry leaders in the pour-through water filter pitcher market, with Brita owner the vast majority of that market (around 70%).</p>

<p>That being said, Brita and ZeroWater occupy vastly different segments of the market. While Brita water filters are inexpensive and able to filter water very quickly, ZeroWater filters are more expensive and are able to reduce contaminants in the water to effectively zero.</p>
<p>The bottom line: Brita wins on cost and speed, while ZeroWater wins on water quality and ergonomics.</p>
<h2>Should you buy a Brita water filter pitcher?</h2>
<p>If you want a water filter pitcher that is cheap and ubiquitous, Brita is certainly worthy of consideration. There’s a reason why Brita water filters have been popular for so long.</p>
<p>That being said, we do think that there are better options on the market.</p>
<p>The ZeroWater 10-Cup Pitcher utilizes the more effective ZeroWater filter, is more ergonomic, and includes a spout for easy pouring while leaving the pitcher in the refrigerator.</p>
<p>We also found the MAVEA Elemaris XL 9-Cup Pitcher to be the best product overall, when everything from ergonomics, to filter quality, to cost were taken into consideration.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After two years of testing seven different pitchers, we've determined that the ZeroWater is the best water filter pitcher. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent more than 60 hours researching and testing seven of the most popular water filter pitchers on the market. We determined the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> ZeroWater &#8211; 6-Cup Pitcher</a> to be the best water filter pitcher on the market. ZeroWater is expensive, but it deionizes the water to remove nearly everything. If you don&#8217;t need that level of purification, the new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU7973W/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; Longlast Filter</a> improves the taste of tap water and works about six times longer than the ZeroWater filter.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-found">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We spent more than 30 hours researching water, and the concerns and preferences that consumers having regarding their drinking water. We read studies on the types of contaminants that need to be filtered out to produce safe drinking water, and how the various water filters on the market work.</p>
<p>We also spoke with representatives and executives from the companies whose water filter pitchers we tested in order to learn more about how the different filters work, and what differentiates them from one another.</p>
<p>Our research also included a deep dive into sources widely considered to be authorities on water safety, such as the <a href="https://www.wqa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Water Quality Association</a> and <a href="http://www.nsf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NSF International</a>.</p>
<p>We read reviews, forums, and Reddit threads to determine which water filters were the most popular. More importantly, we looked to see which filters were certified by NSF International, a third-party organization that provides ratings and certifications for water filters, to remove harmful contaminants from water.</p>
<h3>Updates</h3>
<p>In 2017 our old favorite pitcher and filter, the Mavea &#8211; Elemaris, was discontinued. For our 2019 update, we searched far and wide to find an equivalent replacement, but nothing was better than what we&#8217;d already tried. Brita and ZeroWater are still the standout systems.</p>
<p>We switched our top pick to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater &#8211; 6-Cup Pitcher</a> with some caveats. The extreme level of purification means that ZeroWater filters don&#8217;t last as long as we&#8217;d like, and for people with heavy mineral content in their water, it probably would be cheaper to buy bulk bottled water at the grocery store.</p>
<p>ZeroWater now sells compact filters for an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012CEY1H4/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">On-The-Go cup</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073VWDJS9/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita-compatible pitchers</a>, but the expected life is just five gallons, so we didn&#8217;t even consider testing them. We looked at alternative filter replacements that might be just as good, but they weren&#8217;t actually more cost-effective than buying from ZeroWater. We also looked around for a prefilter setup or bulk refill media and didn&#8217;t find anything simple enough to recommend for most households.</p>
<p>We saw reports of improved performance in Brita&#8217;s new Longlife Filter (now certified to remove lead) and decided to test it alongside our ZeroWater pitcher in a 2019 update.</p>
<h2 id="the-five-best">Compare the best water filter pitchers</h2>
[table id=156 /]
<h2 id="who-should-buy">Who should buy a water filter pitcher</h2>
<p>The benefit of filtered water is primarily taste. Even the most harmless particles can change the taste of your water, whether you&#8217;re consuming it by itself or in a brewed beverage like our picks for <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-cheap-coffee/" rel="noopener">the best coffee</a>.</p>
<p>If you don’t already have a reverse-osmosis system, or some other type of water filtration system in your home, a water filter pitcher is an easy and convenient way to get clean, great-tasting water. If you live in a city that has notoriously poor tap water, having some type of water filter system is even more important.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know anything about what chemicals and minerals are slipping through your local water treatment system, water providers in the US are required to provide a &#8220;consumer confidence report&#8221; that lists testing results. You can look up a report or contact information for your local agency <a href="https://ofmpub.epa.gov/apex/safewater/f?p=136" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the EPA&#8217;s site here</a>.</p>
<p>Problems with your water might not show up on regional test, though: If you have a source of contamination in your own plumbing, or if you&#8217;re on a well or other private supply, it&#8217;s up to you to get it tested. Many water services or filter installers will test a sample of your water for free, and sometimes you can get mail-in tests for free at hardware stores, but remember that these tests are specifically designed to convince you to buy a treatment system.</p>
<p>All reputable water filter pitchers (including all five that we tested) are certified to remove a specific list of harmful contaminants by <a href="http://www.nsf.org/consumer-resources/water-quality/water-filters-testing-treatment/contaminant-reduction-claims-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NSF International</a>, an independent not-for-profit agency. While each of the water filters we tested have different certifications, all of them significantly reduce harmful contaminants in the water.</p>
<p>Filters also remove treatment additives like chlorine, which often have the most significant impact on water taste. Last but not least, filtered water won&#8217;t build up mineral scale in your <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-drip-coffee-maker/">coffee maker</a> or <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-electric-kettle/">electric kettle.</a></p>
<p>Using water filter pitchers can also be significantly less expensive and less wasteful than installing a reverse-osmosis system in your kitchen. &#8220;R-O&#8221; systems dump a lot of water down the drain, and usually take up valuable storage space under your sink.</p>
<p><b>Please note: None of the water filters we tested is certified to remove biological contamination</b>. If you get a &#8220;boil water advisory&#8221; for your area, you should boil your water for one minute (and let it cool) even if you run it through a top-rated filter system to improve the taste.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>In order to determine the best water filter, we used a combination of quantitative and qualitative tests to compare each of the water filters. The following are the tests we used in our ranking of our water filter finalists:</p>
<h3>Taste test</h3>
<p>One of the first tests we conducted was a blind taste test. To conduct this test, each of our testers were given a cup of water from each of the water pitchers without knowledge of which pitcher each cup of water came from.</p>
<p>For each cup of water, testers were asked to tell us whether they agree or disagree with six positive descriptive words, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pure</li>
<li>Crisp</li>
<li>Refreshing</li>
<li>Tasty</li>
<li>Thirst quenching</li>
</ul>
<p>They were also asked to rate each cup of water using two negative descriptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dirty</li>
<li>Artificial/chemical</li>
</ul>
<p>The MAVEA water filter (now discontinued) stood out by leading in both categories &#8212; with the best average score on positive descriptions and the best (i.e. least negative) on the negative scores.</p>

<h3>How quickly each water pitcher filters water</h3>
<p>We also tested each filter to determine how long it would take, on average, to filter one cup of water. While one could argue that more time might be necessary for a more thorough filtration, we still thought it was important to consider this metric &#8212; even if it wasn’t the most critical factor.</p>
<p>For this test, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HEYJ08S/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita filter</a> performed best, taking just 40 seconds on average to filter one cup of water. On the other side, the PUR filter took a shockingly long 3 minutes and 40 seconds to filter one cup of water.</p>
<p>After doing some research, we thought the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B013FQ8QHO/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PUR filter</a> we had might be defective. However, after trying filters from two different packages, our results were essentially the same.</p>
<p>Other than the PUR outlier, the slowest water filter was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater filter</a>, which took an average of 1 minute and 50 seconds to filter one cup of water. We spoke with the CEO of ZeroWater, Doug Kallam, and brought this question up. He told us that it’s true that ZeroWater filters take longer than other filters, largely because of the ion-exchange process that ZeroWater filters use to deionize the water.</p>
<p>The MAVEA water filter (discontinued), was right in the middle of the pack, averaging about 1 minute and 5 seconds per cup of water filtered.</p>

<h3>Ergonomics</h3>
<p>While our ergonomic testing was largely qualitative, we made a point of looking for specific ergonomic elements on each water pitcher. Most importantly, we looked to see whether the pitcher was comfortable to hold, even when it was completely full of water.</p>
<p>We also checked to see how stable the pitcher was when placed on various surfaces, including tile, a table, and inside a refrigerator.</p>
<p>Finally, we made note of any additional features each pitcher had. Examples included the pour-through lid on the MAVEA and BWT pitchers and the spout on the ZeroWater pitcher.</p>
<h3>2019 update testing</h3>
<p>For our 2019 update, we pitted the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU7973W/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">new Brita &#8211; Longlast Filter</a> against the ZeroWater in a household of three, using the same methodology of double-blind taste-testing.</p>
<p>For controls, we also included unfiltered tap water, bottled distilled water and water that had been run through used-up filters from Brita and ZeroWater that were well past their useful life. The &#8220;old&#8221; ZeroWater filter allowed between 005 and 007 PPM of TDS through, right on the line for replacement; the &#8220;old&#8221; Brita filter had filtered approximately 50 gallons of water, also just past its expected life of 40 gallons.</p>
<p>When we tallied all the positive and negative taste reports, we found that the results were surprisingly close to results from our earlier test at the office. From this new group of testers, positive scores came in a bit higher overall, with negative scores reserved for tap water and the used-up ZeroWater filter.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note, however, that these testers have been using a Brita system in their home for more than a decade but mostly out of habit. When we asked them how effective they thought their Brita pitcher was before the test, they said &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t seem to be doing anything.&#8221; They were surprised at how easily they could tell the difference between the taste of tap water and a standard Brita filter.</p>
<p>We discovered that the distilled water (which had been sitting on a shelf in its plastic jug for a few months) actually had a worse taste than the tap water, &#8220;almost like an artificial flower taste.&#8221; This is an unusual result, but goes to show that storing distilled water has its own set of problems.</p>
<p>We asked our testers to rank the the taste of the top-scoring filtered water before we told them anything about tallied scores or brands, and they all picked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU7973W/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; Longlast</a> over the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater filter&#8217;s</a> taste, with the Brita standard cartridge coming in a more distant third.</p>
<h3>Chlorine removal</h3>

<p>We wanted to see how much difference filter type really makes with taste&#8217;s biggest enemy, chlorine. We called in a Hatch chlorine test kit that can detect a .01 part-per-million difference in total chlorine.</p>
<p>The tap water we tested had between 0.7 and 1 PPM of chlorine. We found that any water filter we tried, no matter how long it had been in use, would remove all detectable traces of chlorine. This lined up pretty well with what we found in taste-tests: The worst offenders for taste are the easiest to remove.</p>
<h3>Brita filters: Standard vs. Longlast</h3>
<p>We wanted to see if the new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU7973W/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; Longlast Filter</a> was more effective at removing the dissolved solids in our water than the older <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004SU18/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Standard &#8211; Filters</a>. The tap water in our testers&#8217; home reads between 250 and 300 parts per million on an electrical conductivity tester (the ubiquitous TDS tester): standard Brita filters don&#8217;t do anything to reduce the TDS count with this particular water source, but the new Longlast filter brings it down to 200.</p>
<p>That 20% change between the Brita filters is enough of an improvement that, with this household&#8217;s water, it won the taste test. After a few weeks of use, though, it seems like whatever mechanism Brita is using to get that boost is depleted and it reads the same as a standard Brita filter.</p>
<h2 id="top-pick">Top Pick: ZeroWater &#8211; 6-Cup Pitcher</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-923 size-large" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ZeroWater-6cup-1.jpg" alt="ZeroWater_TDS03" width="1024" height="683" /><br />
Of all the water filters we tested, none were able to create pure water as effectively as the aptly-named <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater filter</a>.</p>
<p>ZeroWater filters are different from all the other filters we tested. Instead of only using an activated carbon filter, ZeroWater filters actually deionize the water. In other words, the ZeroWater filter removes essentially <i>everything</i> reactive from the water itself &#8212; which is why they advertise the fact that their filters produce a reading of “000” on a “total dissolved solids” (TDS) meter.</p>
<p>In independent laboratory testing, ZeroWater consistently beats every other water filter on the market when comparing the number of dissolved solids left in the water after filtering. This includes everything from dangerous contaminants like lead, to contaminants that impact taste more than anything else &#8212; chlorine, for example.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-924 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1.png" width="880" height="608" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1-610x421.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1-360x249.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1-375x259.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1-414x286.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1-295x204.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1-180x124.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1-320x221.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The upsides of this are apparent, particularly in areas where water quality is questionable or even dangerous. For example, the Flint water crisis of 2014 left residents with drinking water that contained unsafe levels of lead and other contaminants. Water filters such as ZeroWater are able to filter those contaminants out of the water and to produce water that is safe to drink.</p>
<p>ZW gets rid of all dissolved solids. This leaves water tasting complete pure. Interestingly, this isn’t universally regarded as a good thing. That’s because not all dissolved solids are harmful. In fact, some of them, such as magnesium, are beneficial for your health <i>and</i> improve the taste of the water.</p>

The ion-exchange technology won't stay effective for long if you've got a lot of minerals in your water, but it's very consistent and effective while it lasts.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>For a popular example: Naturally carbonated bottles of water, such as Perrier and Pellegrino, contain high levels of dissolved mineral solids, which contribute significantly to their flavor profile.</p>
<p>We spoke with the CEO of ZeroWater, Doug Kallam, and he told us that ZeroWater does in fact remove the “taste profile” of water as a result of the deionization process. The plus side of this is the fact that essentially all heavy metals are removed, at rates notably higher than other filters on the market.</p>
<p>Interesting, during our testing we found that some people did not like the taste of ZeroWater, and some even thought it had a “chemical” taste. This is fascinating, because as we mentioned ZeroWater is scientifically proven to contain the fewest chemicals (if you exclude the chemical H2O). Our theory is that we are all so used to there being dissolved solids in our water (both tap and filtered) that it tastes strange to us when we drink water that is genuinely pure.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17090" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ZeroWater_TDS03-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<h3>Things we liked about the ZeroWater pitcher</h3>
<p>After using the 10-cup ZeroWater pitcher for a few years, we have to admit that it&#8217;s a bit bigger than we like. We tried out the 7-cup pitcher, and it&#8217;s easier to pour from than most 10-cup pitchers. Not only is the filled pitcher lighter, but the spout design is less likely to dribble or splash when you&#8217;re filling a narrow-neck bottle like the winner of our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-water-bottle/">water bottle review</a>. The spigot at the base of the 10-cup pitcher was a neat idea, but in practice it was so slow to drain, and we stopped using it. So, we&#8217;ve switched our recommendation to the 7-cup model.</p>
<p>The filters are large, but don’t require any presoak, which makes replacing the filters much easier than filters which require a presoak process before being used for drinking water.</p>
<p>We also like the fact that the ZeroWater pitcher comes with a TDS meter. Before you ask: Yes, we checked the results against another TDS conductivity meter, and no, ZeroWater isn&#8217;t tricking you with some kind of rigged tester that only works with their own filters.</p>
<p>ZeroWater instructions recommend that the filter be replaced when the meter reads “006”. This is helpful because you don’t have to remember how long it’s been &#8212; or estimate how many gallons you’ve poured &#8212; when replacing a filter. Instead, you can simply check on the TDS meter and replace when the reading hits 006.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://www.zerowater.com/docs/ZeroWaterRecycling.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZeroWater has the best recycling program</a> of all the water filters we tested. <b>ZeroWater will actually pay $5 for each filter that is returned.</b> This means that customers will be much more incentivized to hold onto the filters and send them back, reducing contributions to landfills.</p>
<h3>Things we didn’t like about the ZeroWater pitcher</h3>
<p>ZeroWater filters are the most expensive of the pitchers we tested. While this is offset by occasional email promotions and the recycling rebate, customers will still need to spend more money to filter water with ZeroWater than any other filter &#8212; particularly if they live in a city where tap water has high levels of dissolved solids.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater</a> is an excellent option for those who want the purest water possible. If you want to add back some flavor, a slice of lemon does the trick.</p>
<h3>Updated testing</h3>

The performance of the ZeroWater filters is very consistent, but expensive. We looked around for alternatives that might allow cheaper replacement of the ion exchange resin beads, but on the whole, the filter fits in at an uncomfortable middle ground. It&#8217;s just barely cheap enough to buy these filters that a DIY refill or regeneration of the media just isn&#8217;t going to be worthwhile for most people.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got more than 300 PPM of dissolved solids in your water, though, ZeroWater cartridges might need to be replaced frequently. A reverse-osmosis system that includes an ion-exchange stage is a better buy for filtering more than a gallon per day of mineral-rich water.</p>
<p>On the whole, the suitability of ZeroWater depends entirely on what&#8217;s in your water and how badly you want to filter it. If your water has a low enough mineral content (around 200 PPM) that the filter lasts for a month, you&#8217;ll be very happy with the consistency of the water you get.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater</a> filters use ion exchange technology to remove almost all dissolved solids.</li>
<li>ZeroWater&#8217;s minimal taste came in a close second in our blind preference test.</li>
<li>The compact 6-cup pitcher is easy to pour from, even while it&#8217;s still filtering.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;ve got a lot of minerals to filter out, the ZeroWater filters might be more expensive than bottled water.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="budget-pick"><b>Budget pick: Brita &#8211; 10-Cup Pitcher + Longlast Filter</b></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-926 size-large" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/BRITA_Pour-1024x683.jpg" alt="BRITA_Pour" width="1024" height="683" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HEYJ08S/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita</a> is perhaps the most well-known brand of water filter pitchers, and they are largely responsible for the growth in popularity of filter pitchers since the late 1980s when they first came to the U.S. market. They are the undisputed market leader, with more than two-thirds of the overall water filter pitcher sales.</p>
<p>The standard Brita filter doesn’t remove the number of contaminants that a filter like ZeroWater does. With the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU7973W/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">new Longlast filter, model OB06</a>, Brita is trying to up their game: In the aftermath of the Flint water crisis, it&#8217;s no mistake that &#8220;99% lead reduction&#8221; is front and center in Brita&#8217;s promotional material.</p>
<p>Which filter you choose is definitely going to be a matter of choice for most people. Brita&#8217;s system is sufficient to improve taste, and both the NSF and other independent tests show <a href="https://www.wqa.org/Find-Products/ctl/Detail/mid/1054/cid/BRITA_LP/sid/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it will remove heavy metals</a>. For the vast majority of us, chlorine reduction is going to be the major concern, and safeguarding against accidental exposure to lead, cadmium and mercury is a bonus.</p>
<p>When we checked our water with a chlorine reagent test, though, we were surprised to find out that chlorine reduction was identical between a used-up Brita filter and a new one. Even a fresh Brita filter didn&#8217;t change the taste of mineral-heavy well water when tested it.</p>

<p>Brita&#8217;s new Longlast filter is a clear winner for the cost of filtering chlorine and other easily filtered contaminants. The Longlast is also cheap enough that it&#8217;s worth trying a blind taste test yourself if you&#8217;ve already got an older Standard filter on hand.</p>
<p>Sadly, Brita doesn&#8217;t sell any pitchers packaged with a Longlast filter, but the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FXN3E74/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">10-Cup Everyday Pitcher</a> or any other standard Brita pitcher can use the new blue filter.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="other-finalists">Other finalists we tested</h2>
<p>The other three water filter pitchers we tested all performed well. All three were able to filter out significant levels of contaminants according to NSF International, and had solid design and build quality.</p>
<h3>BWT Designer Water Filter Pitcher</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B011N5PM0S/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BWT pitcher</a> has an interesting and innovative design, and the filter itself actually adds magnesium to the water, presumably to improve taste and increase the health benefits of the water. However, some of our taste testers did not like the flavor of the water filtered by the BWT pitcher.</p>
<h3>PUR 7-Cup Ultimate Pitcher</h3>
<p>The water produced by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B013FQ8QHO/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PUR water filter</a> was polarizing among our taste testers. Some loved it, while for others it was their least favorite. After doing some digging, we found that those who had a preference for PUR water either used PUR filters in their home already, or had used them in the past &#8212; which goes to show the importance of familiarity with regards to taste.</p>
<p>From a safety perspective, PUR is on par with the other filters we tested (excluding ZeroWater), however our biggest issue with the filter was how slow it filtered, averaging nearly 4 minutes to filter 1 cup of water after several tests and three different filters.</p>
<p>The feedback we found online was mixed, with some reporting similar stories and others saying the filters needed to be “shaken and mixed.” Ultimately, we think there are simply better options to choose from, with or without slow filtration times.</p>
<h3>MAVEA</h3>
<p>This was one of our top picks, but in 2017 MAVEA stopped distributing its products in North America so we&#8217;ve moved it to our &#8220;other picks&#8221; section, but don&#8217;t want to dismiss its quality or original ranking.</p>
<p>2019 has seen the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002T2MS1Q/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">filters come back in stock</a>, which is great news for those who bought one of these pitchers a few years ago. Despite indications they&#8217;re thinking about <a href="https://www.mavea.com/faq.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">selling in North America again</a>, there&#8217;s still no sign of the pitchers at retail.</p>
<p>The design of the MAVEA stood out as particularly outstanding. The use of rubberized materials &#8212; both on the four feet and the handle &#8212; significantly improve stability when holding the pitcher or placing it on a surface. Overall, holding the MAVEA pitcher is comfortable, balanced, and stable &#8212; whether the pitcher is completely empty or completely full.</p>
<p>Unlike many of the other water filters on the market (including several we tested), the MAVEA filter does not need to be presoaked before use.</p>
<p>MAVEA also claims that the water filter works more consistently than other filters, thanks to its design. While we did not test this ourselves, the general consensus among reviewers and the others we spoke to indicates that MAVEA filters do seem to be more consistent in their filtration lifecycle.</p>
<p>Finally, one sometimes-overlooked feature is MAVEA’s recycle program. Any time you have six or more used MAVEA filters, you can use the company’s contact form to print out postage to ship the filters back to MAVEA for free. MAVEA then recycles 100% of the materials in the filter &#8212; which means you can drink clean water without worrying about contributing to environmental damage.</p>
<p>There was lots to like about the MAVEA pitcher. We hope they can bring a system to market in North America again.</p>

<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you’re looking for water that is as pure as possible, and completely free of <i>all </i>dissolved solids (both beneficial and harmful), the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater filter</a> is a great option, however you will be paying a little more than average for their more thorough filters.</p>
<p>Ultimately, any of the five water filters we tested will remove some contaminants from your tap water, and they easily improve the taste by removing chlorine. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU7973W/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita&#8217;s Longlast filter</a> is by far the most cost effective, filtering three times more water than most of the others and more heavy metals than the basic Brita. You&#8217;ll have to buy a Brita Pitcher to go with it, and we liked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FXN3E74/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">10-Cup Everyday Pitcher</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>oth Brita and ZeroWater filters make tap water safe to drink. However, we wanted to know which was the best option for consumers. After more than 50 hours of research and testing, including four months comparing Brita and ZeroWater pitchers side-by-side, we&#8217;ve determined that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater &#8211; 6-Cup Pitcher</a> is the better choice of the two and stands out as the best water filter pitcher on the market.</p>
<p>In order to determine the best water filter pitcher on the market, we tested five of the leading water filter pitchers, and compared them against one another.</p>
<p>This review will focus on the differences between the Brita water filter and the ZeroWater filter. But check out our full <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/" rel="noopener">best water filter review</a> if you&#8217;re curious about the competiton.</p>

<p>In order to compare the Brita and ZeroWater filter pitchers, we noted differences in water filter quality, ergonomics, water filter speed, and a taste test. We also used our general impressions of the products during everyday use over the course of two years of in-home testing.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="water-filter-quality">Water filter quality</h2>
<p>When buying a water filter pitcher, the first and most important metric is how effective the filter actually is at removing harmful substances. Both Brita and ZeroWater have received certifications from <a href="http://www.nsf.org/newsroom/statement-regarding-flint-water-system-lead-issue-and-to-certification-nsf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NSF International</a>, which ensures that both are able to remove lead and other specific harmful materials from municipal tap water.</p>
<p>However, both NSF International and other reports have determined that the ZeroWater filter is significantly better than other filters on the market — Brita included — when it comes to removing virtually <em>all</em> harmful contaminants from tap water.</p>
<p>This is because ZeroWater utilizes a 5-stage filter which includes a large amount of ion-exchange resin, a technology commonly used in reverse-osmosis systems. The ZeroWater filter attracts metal ions in the water, which effectively eliminates all inorganic dissolved solids like metals. This is why ZeroWater (accurately) reports that their water has zero “dissolved” solids — a point they prove by including a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002C0A7ZY/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TDS tester</a> with their pitchers.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-923 size-large" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ZeroWater_TDS03-1024x683.jpg" alt="ZeroWater TDS Reading 000" width="1024" height="683" /></p>
<p>The Brita filter, on the other hand, utilizes an industry standard two-stage activated carbon filtration system. It’s worth noting that this filter has been an industry ever since Brita popularized the water filter when the brand first started selling in North America in 1988. There are actually some ion-exchange beads in a Brita filter, too, but not nearly on the same scale.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when it comes to a straight comparison of which water filter works best, it is largely undisputed that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001CUQ1C8/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater filters</a> are the best in the industry.</p>
<h2 id="ergonomics">Ergonomics of each water filter pitcher</h2>
<p>The ergonomic of a water filter pitcher are important as well. A water pitcher should be easy to hold and easy to pour. In addition, the pre-filtered water reservoir should be large enough to fill at least half of the pitcher.</p>
<p>Both the Brita and ZeroWater pitcher reservoirs were able to fill at least half of the pitcher itself, so we looked at the remaining ergonomic factors to differentiate between the two.</p>
<p>We found the Brita pitcher to be somewhat awkward to hold and pour. The weight doesn’t feel particularly balanced, particularly in conjunction with the handle itself. Overall, the Brita pitcher feels like a simple, utilitarian product without much emphasis placed on aesthetic or ergonomic elements.</p>
<p>While we don’t expect the ZeroWater pitcher to be winning any awards for artistic inspiration, we did find the ZeroWater pitcher to be a more ergonomic experience overall. In addition to being easier to hold and to pour, the handle felt more comfortable in our hands.</p>
<p>The first ZeroWater pitcher we tried was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0073PZ6O0/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater &#8211; 10-Cup Pitcher.</a> This design has a spout on the bottom of the pitcher, which is a great idea for those who don&#8217;t want to lift a heavy pitcher all the time, but the flow rate is so slow that one test family said they totally ignored it after a week.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re after a pitcher that&#8217;s more convenient, we like that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater – 6-Cup Pitcher</a> fits more easily in a refrigerator and isn&#8217;t so heavy when full. You&#8217;ll definitely have to refill it every time you use it, though.</p>
<h2 id="water-filter-speed">Water filter speed</h2>
<p>The next metric we measured was the amount of time each water filter took, on average, to filter one cup of water. While water quality and ergonomics are certainly more important considerations, we still found that the ability to filter water reasonably quickly was valuable, particularly for anyone having guests over.</p>

<p>This is one area in which the Brita water filter really stood out. We found the Brita water filter did its job significantly faster than the rest of our finalists, averaging just 40 seconds per cup of water filtered.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HEYJ08S/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brita-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brita-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brita-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brita-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brita-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brita-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brita-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brita-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brita.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Low-Priced and Fast: Brita</h3><p>The Brita water filter leads the industry, with around 70% of the pour-through water filter market. It is inexpensive and filters water quicker than all of the water filter pitchers we tested.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HEYJ08S/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Our ZeroWater filter, on the other hand, was on the other end of the spectrum with an average of one minute and 50 seconds per cup of water filtered — second only to the incredibly slow PUR water filter, which averaged an astonishing three minutes and 50 seconds per cup of water filtered.</p>
<h2 id="taste-test">Water filter taste test</h2>
<p>Comparing the taste of two different water filters is difficult, largely because it is simply so subjective. Nevertheless, we did set up a taste test, and found that Brita beat ZeroWater overall.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-919" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings.png" alt="water filter pitcher taste test" width="880" height="651" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings-610x451.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings-360x266.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings-375x277.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings-414x306.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings-295x218.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings-180x133.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings-320x237.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The first score was based on positive taste attributes (clean, pure, refreshing, etc.), with a maximum of 30 points possible. Brita earned a positive score of 21.125, while ZeroWater received a score of 20.8125.</p>
<p>The second score was based on negative taste attributes (dirty, artificial), with a maximum score of 10 (lower is better). Brita earned a negative score of 3.75, while ZeroWater received a score of 3.875.</p>
<p>Ultimately, while Brita did beat ZeroWater in both categories, the differences in each score were fairly minor.</p>
<h3>2019 update testing</h3>
<p>For our 2019 update, we pitted the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU7973W/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">new Brita &#8211; Longlast Filter</a> against the ZeroWater in a household of three, using the same methodology of double-blind taste-testing.</p>
<p>For controls, we also included unfiltered tap water, bottled distilled water and water that had been run through used-up filters from Brita and ZeroWater that were well past their useful life. The &#8220;old&#8221; ZeroWater filter allowed between 005 and 007 PPM of TDS through, right on the line for replacement; the &#8220;old&#8221; Brita filter had filtered approximately 50 gallons of water, also just past its expected life of 40 gallons.</p>
<p><strong>When we tallied all the positive and negative taste reports, we found that the results were surprisingly close to results from our earlier test at the office.</strong> From this new group of testers, positive scores came in a bit higher overall, with negative scores reserved for tap water and the used-up ZeroWater filter.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note, however, that these testers have been using a Brita system in their home for more than a decade, but mostly out of habit. When we asked them how effective they thought their Brita pitcher was before the test, they said &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t seem to be doing anything.&#8221; <strong>They were surprised at how easily they could tell the difference between the taste of tap water and a standard Brita filter.</strong></p>
<p>We discovered that the distilled water (which had been sitting on a shelf in its plastic jug for a few months) actually had a worse taste than the tap water, &#8220;almost like an artificial flower or perfume taste.&#8221; This is an unusual result, but goes to show that storing distilled water has its own set of problems.</p>
<p>We asked our testers to rank the the taste of the top-scoring filtered water before we told them anything about tallied scores or brands, and they all picked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU7973W/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; Longlast</a> over the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater filter&#8217;s</a> taste, with the Brita standard cartridge coming in a more distant third.</p>

<p>We wanted to see how much difference filter type really makes with taste&#8217;s biggest enemy, chlorine. We called in a chlorine test kit that can detect a .01 part-per-million difference in total chlorine.</p>
<p>The tap water we tested had between 0.7 and 1 PPM of chlorine. <strong>We found that any water filter we tried, no matter how long it had been in use, would remove all detectable traces of chlorine.</strong> This lined up pretty well with what we found in taste-tests: the worst offenders for taste are the easiest to remove.</p>
<h3>Filter life</h3>
<p>This is the trickiest factor to rate. These filters all rely on capturing particles or attracting ions to an activated medium, and that means they have a limited life. Unlike a ceramic or mesh filter that simply clogs up and doesn&#8217;t pass water anymore when it&#8217;s dirty, these activated filters will just become less and less effective over time as the contaminants build up and the water just flows past. If you let them go long enough, things can even start growing inside these filters.</p>
<p>Brita rates their standard filter for 40 gallons, and the new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU7973W/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Longlast Filter</a> at 120. That&#8217;s compared to an average of 15 gallons for a ZeroWater filter before it becomes ineffective.</p>
<p>Those &#8220;average&#8221; numbers are assuming a lot, though. If you&#8217;ve got more than 400 PPM of dissolved solids in your water, ZeroWater cartridges might need replacement after just ten gallons. A reverse-osmosis system is a better buy for filtering more than a gallon per day of something like mineral-rich well water.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Brita filter is doing comparatively little to filter minerals, so it lasts longer. We watched the readings from a new Longlast filter for a few weeks, and after about ten gallons the 20% improvement it showed over a standard Brita filter disappeared. You might get better-tasting water for 120 gallons, but after a month we doubt the filter is actually doing much more than removing chlorine.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to be diligent about replacing filters, the ZeroWater system is better at letting you know what&#8217;s going on. You can check periodically with the included tester and see when the total dissolved solids climbs up from zero to 0.006, and replace the filter before it stops working altogether. When the filter media is saturated with metal ions, it actually starts to release some back into the water, and you&#8217;ll immediately notice a sour or fishy taste. In comparison, you never really know how effective a Brita filter is.</p>
<h2 id="which-is-best">Which water filter is best?</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-928" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ZeroWater_Pour01_CC-1024x683.jpg" alt="ZeroWater filter pitcher pour" width="1024" height="683" /></p>
<p>Both the ZeroWater and Brita water filter pitchers each have compelling arguments in their favor. Both are certified by NSF International to remove harmful materials, such as lead and other metals, from the water.</p>
<p>Both Brita and ZeroWater also offer a recycling program, which helps prevent unnecessary materials from ending up in a landfill. However, it’s worth noting that ZeroWater offers a credit of $5 per filter shipped back to them toward new filters, whereas Brita only offers free shipping.</p>
<p>With everything considered, we found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater &#8211; 6-Cup Pitcher</a> to be the better choice overall. The ZeroWater pitcher simply utilizes better filtration technology, and is overall easier to use.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HEYJ08S/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; 10-Cup Pitcher</a> uses less expensive — and less effective — water filters. It is also able to filter water more quickly. If you’re looking for a simple, inexpensive water purifying solution, the Brita filter is a worthwhile product to consider.</p>
<p>If you want to make your economical-but-effective pitcher even better, the new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU7973W/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; Longlast Filter</a> is more effective at removing dissolved minerals like lead, and lasts for three times longer than a standard Brita filter.</p>
<p>So, if you want the best water you can get, without spending thousands of dollars on a reverse-osmosis system, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater</a> is the way to go.</p>
