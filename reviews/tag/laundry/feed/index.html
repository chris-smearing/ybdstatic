<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We started by collecting the top-rated and reviewed items from retailers such as Amazon, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Target. A simple Google search revealed topics and concerns from relevant blogs and subreddits for obsessives like /r/BuyItForLife. Further digging revealed niche markets and hobbyists: in our case, crafters, quilters and sewers.</p>
<p>We spoke to experts and professionals, like Nichole Ramirez, quilter and co-author of <a href="https://www.thefussycutsampler.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Fussy Cut Sampler</a>, who provided a deeper insight to the demands and needs of those who use steam irons comprehensively. Fashion designer Deanna Molina gave us insight on what she looks for in an iron.</p>
<p>Amateur reviews by real people on YouTube rounded out our sample group as we determined the most desired features in steam irons: heat-up speed, steam output, anti-drip and safety. With these features in mind, we narrowed down our vast list to a concise but diverse group of finalists.</p>
<p>From there, we developed a rigorous routine of tests designed to address various issues like delicate fabrics, tough fabrics, water leakage and ease of use and storage. Considering speed and convenience, we also looked carefully at product and interface design from the process of filling up water to how the cord functions in operation and storage.</p>

<h2>Who needs a steam iron?</h2>
<p>Let’s face it, a tumble in the dryer or a hang in a steamy shower will get you part way there, but nothing can take place of a good, old-fashioned steam ironing. For anyone who needs a pressed and prim, crisp, fresh look, a steam iron is a must. For artistic or practical uses, steam irons can prep fabrics, provide a heat source for transfers and iron clothing or other fabrics related to set dressing. Professionals, the general workforce, stay at home domestic partners, amateur sewers, quilters and crafters will all find steam irons to be an essential tool.</p>
<p>Whether it is ironing on transfers or preparing fabrics for sewing and construction, crafters make up a group of steam-iron users whose needs are only slightly divergent from the average consumer. If you want a much quicker, albeit less precise way to remove wrinkles, check out our review of <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-clothes-steamer/" rel="noopener">the best clothes steamer</a>.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Efficient heat-up and temperature-ready alert:</b> Time is money, and the sooner you can start ironing, the sooner you’ll be done. For those who rush in the morning to those who just want to be done quicker, a fast heat-up time will give you a slight bump. In our study, we found that the indicator light or sound to signal when the iron is ready for use is just as crucial as the time it takes to heat up. We favored more obvious indications, like an audible “beep” or obvious indicator light, and factored this feature in our score for heating speed.</p>
<p><b>Steam output:</b> The more steam, the quicker the job. This category includes a grading of steam burst, ease of use and and oft-touted feature called “vertical steaming,” which turns a horizontal iron into a freehand steamer that removes wrinkles without direct contact.</p>
<p><b>Anti-drip:</b> One of the most annoying yet unavoidable symptoms of a steam iron is dripping water. When the temperature of the soleplate drops down to silk and synthetic ironing temperatures, it is not hot enough to produce steam, potentially dripping water. Anti-drip measures aim to prevent drippage when set to lower temperatures.</p>
<p><b>Compatibility with tap water (anti-scale / anti-calcium):</b> These days, many irons accept tap water almost exclusively. Gone are the days of buying a big jug of distilled water solely for the purpose of ironing. Good riddance! However, most manuals state that if you have very hard water, you can mix it 50/50 with distilled water.</p>
<p><b>Auto shut-off:</b> High-powered heat and forgetfulness do not mix. An auto shut-off feature ensures that if you accidentally leave the iron plugged in or face down on fabric, it will not cause a fire.</p>
<p><b>Soleplate material:</b> Depending on your needs, you should consider the soleplate material. The main types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Stainless steel:</b> Better option if you iron more natural fabrics like cotton and wool, as it conducts heat better, resulting in better steam. It is also better than ceramic for pressing creases on sleeves and pant legs. Crafters should be aware that stainless steel plates can stick to glues and decals at higher temperatures.</li>
<li><b>Aluminum:</b> A slightly cheaper soleplate to manufacture, also better at distributing heat evenly across garments.</li>
<li><b>Ceramic:</b> Typically made of aluminum that is coated with a ceramic layer. If you need to iron a lot of synthetic fabrics, ceramic resists static, but is more likely to absorb colors from natural fibers like cotton and wool. Ceramic can also peel or wear down over time.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Warranty:</b> Steam iron warranties tend to range from one to three years</p>
<h2 id="how-irons-work">How do steam irons work?</h2>
<p>Dating back at least a thousand years, the practice of using heat to smooth fabrics has seen many technological advances, culminating in the modern electric iron we see in most households today. Steam now comes standard with consumer grade irons, making ironing tougher fabrics like cotton and linen much easier.</p>
<p>The combined force of heat and steam work together on a molecular level to get your fibers in line. More particularly, the long chains of polymer molecules can be moved and shaped with the application of heat and then cooled in place. This is the reason why ironing experts suggest cooling just-ironed clothing before wearing them. Reader’s Digest even suggests <a href="https://www.rd.com/home/cleaning-organizing/are-you-ironing-wrong-8-tips-on-getting-it-right/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cooling for hours</a> to allow creases to set.</p>
<p>Professor Mark Lorch at the University of Hull explains that wrinkles happen when water comes into contact with fabrics, such as in a washing machine. He <a href="http://theconversation.com/how-chemistry-can-make-your-ironing-easier-74563" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explains</a> “water molecules insert themselves between the cellulose molecules, break up the hydrogen bonds and act like a lubricant, allowing the cellulose molecules to slide over each other.”</p>
<p>The application of heat and steam works to break these hydrogen bonds again, and the weight of the iron forces the cellulose molecules to line up, in effect “ironing” the fabric flat.</p>
<p>Until 2012, it was believed that steam and water helps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loosen cotton fibers</a> and other tough fabrics, which makes the straightening of polymers easier. Researchers at Laboratoire de Physique de la Matiere Condensee et Nanostructures de Lyon found that water vapor acts on the <a href="https://phys.org/news/2012-02-physics-role-humidity-ironing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>contacts</i> between fibers</a> of woven material. Over time, a crease will unfold itself very slowly as the capillary bridges between fibers reorganize themselves. The study found that raising the level of humidity considerably speeds up this process.</p>
<p>This explains why the application of steam helps get out wrinkles more quickly and effectively. An iron with more steam will therefore help you get through the pile of clothes more quickly.</p>
<h3>What about starch and wrinkle-free fabrics?</h3>
<p>Starch has been used as early as 800 BC to aid in ironing. When starch penetrates cotton fibers and dries, its molecules bind to one another and stiffen the fiber. It is a temporary solution and will keep the cellulose molecules in line until the next washing.</p>
<p>Formaldehyde had first been used in the 1930s to treat fabrics for a permanent solution to those wretched wrinkles. Formaldehyde &#8212; a human carcinogen &#8212; emits a foul odor, and in the 1990s, manufacturers started squeezing out excess formaldehyde with large rollers and curing the fabrics in ovens to decrease its output from finished fabrics.</p>
<p>Formaldehyde was then combined with other chemicals to form “cross-links,” which help keep the formaldehyde at bay. However, newly developed cross-linking agents like dimethyloldihydroxyethyleneurea (DMDHEU) and ethylene-urea/melamine-formaldehyde (EUMF) still output small amounts of formaldehyde. Manufacturers of “permanent-press” instituted a “Sealed Jar Test” to measure the amount of formaldehyde released from fabric in order to better monitor its levels.</p>
<p>Since the 1960s, polyester fabrics gave us another wrinkle-free alternative. Since this notoriously uncomfortable fabric has fallen in and out of favor over the years, permanent-press cotton is still popular. Formaldehyde-free agents such as dimethylurea glyoxal (DMUG) exist, but they are expensive and not as effective.<b> </b></p>
<p>As such, formaldehyde-emitting permanent-press fabrics are still used today, though they are <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/usasciencefestival/2012/10/19/new-feature-chemistry-in-the-spotlight-just-ironing-things-out-submitted-by-joe-schwarcz-usa-science-engineering-festival-nifty-fifty-speaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ten times less harmful</a> than its original formulations. It’s best for those with sensitive to skin allergies to avoid permanent-press fabrics altogether and go back to the ironing board.</p>

<h3>Heating speed</h3>

<p>To test heating speeds, we timed how long each iron heated up to its maximum temperature (typically the linen and or cotton setting).  This category takes both speed and usability into account for optimum efficiency.</p>
<p>We also considered how the iron indicated that it was ready to use, either by a light or sound. More discreet alerts may go off unnoticed, which may result in waiting longer than necessary. For instance, the Maytag has one light that simply shuts off when the iron has reached the set temperature. Some irons, like the Rowenta and T-fal do the same, except the indicator light is dedicated only to this purpose which is clearer. Others like Oliso and Panasonic &#8211; NI-L70SRW Cordless Iron have indicator lights that share other duties for indicating on/off or auto-off.</p>

<p>BLACK+DECKER &#8211; Digital Advantage Professional stands out here: Although it was not the fastest (13 seconds behind the fastest, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AW51G2Y/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Maytag</a>), its digital dial with audible “beep” was the most user-friendly, which frees you from keeping an eye on the iron while you wait. Most notably, the Black+Decker was one of two brands that also indicated correct set temperature when going from higher to lower temperatures, the other being Oliso &#8211; Pro TG1600 Smart Iron.</p>
<p>When ironing multiple items, being able to switch temperatures without guesswork plays into overall efficiency and usability of the iron. Without any sort of indication, Sunbeam falls to the bottom in this category. It’s up to you to wait for two minutes, as the manual suggests. To be fair, it is the most inexpensive iron of our finalists, roughly <i>seven times less</i> than the most expensive (Oliso).</p>
<p>By our measurements, Sunbeam took about 1 minute 37 seconds to reach its max temperature, just ahead of the slowest, Panasonic &#8211; NI-L70SRW Cordless Iron, which clocked in at 1 minute 53 seconds.</p>
<p>With all irons heating up under two minutes, we found that how the irons were designed to indicate a “ready” state was equally as important.<b> </b></p>

<p>Steam is the jelly to heat’s peanut butter. They work okay on their own, but together they really excel. On a particularly wrinkly swatch of thick cotton, a dry iron can only get you so far. A couple puffs of steam speeds up the process considerably. Among the most-desired features of irons, we tested steam output in the following subcategories:</p>
<p><b>Steam burst:</b> A feature of most new steam irons that shoots out a puff of steam from the soleplate. We graded the amount of steam and consistency from consecutive bursts.</p>
<p><b>Ease of use:</b> Steam button and dial feel and responsiveness and general ease of use.</p>
<p><b>Steam dispersion:</b> How well steam is dispersed and general functionality of steam during ironing.</p>
<p><b>Vertical steam:</b> Another method of removing wrinkles by holding the irons upright and subjecting the fabric to steam without the pressure and contact of the heated soleplate. We graded the functionality of this secondary feature.</p>
<p><b>Ease of filling water:</b> An important aspect of using steam, grading the design and functionality of the water intake.</p>
<p>Electronics and water don’t mix, so it’s up to each brand to design an experience that is both safe, easy and minimal in drippage. We started by filling each iron with water to capacity. Irons that have tricky hatches, hard-to-read “max” lines or just feel plain awkward can be difficult or uncomfortable to use. The last thing we want is to iron atop a damp board or have to wipe off the counter afterwards.</p>
<p>Oliso and Rowenta delivered top scores in <b>water filling</b> scores. They both came with plastic water filling cups well suited to their respective filling spouts. Both were remarkably drip-free on the first try. BLACK+DECKER and Maytag included identical filling cups, which were difficult to pour without spilling.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000P6CRLO/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; NI-L70SRW Cordless Iron</a> deserves special mention as it has a <i>removable</i> water reservoir which can be accessed even as the iron recharges. Since you can fill it under the sink, there is no worry about spillage.</p>
<p>Next, we graded the power of each iron’s <b>steam bursts</b>. This feature now comes standard on nearly every contemporary steam iron; the functionality is identical to one another. A button atop the handle has somewhat of a hydraulic action that pushes extra air through the steam. The extra burst of steam adds extra wrinkle-busting power where it’s needed, stubborn cotton or linens, especially.</p>

<p>To grade <b>steam dispersion</b>, we graded both continuous steam output and steam bursts on the highest heat setting. BLACK+DECKER, Maytag and Sunbeam models fell short here because the steam burst function got uncomfortably hot on the handle with repeated use. On the other hand, the Rowenta impresses again with a forceful steam burst that also felt well controlled and dispersed.</p>
<p>Each one of our finalists list <b>vertical steam</b> as a feature, but we found that they were all not well-suited for this task, and some were worse than others. This feature hopes to double their function as both a heavy iron and a steamer used on hanging clothing. It’s best left to dedicated steamers which have a lightweight hose end with an easier to press button. Here, the user must press and or pump the same steam burst button in order to output usable steam.</p>
<p>With all the weight of an iron without the advantage of pressure, their use as a vertical steamer is pretty dubious. We concluded that if you really have to use one, steam irons might <i>somewhat</i> work as a vertical steamer. If this is an important feature for you, definitely stick to either Panasonic &#8211; NI-W950A or Rowenta.</p>

<p>Overall, Rowenta wins in overall steam output with Panasonic &#8211; NI-W950A not too far behind. Despite being cordless, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000P6CRLO/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; NI-L70SRW Cordless Iron</a> surprised us in strength, coming in third. It suffered low marks as a vertical steamer because it did have trouble with leaking during continuous use.</p>
<p>In fact, all of the steam irons start leaking water at some point due to continuous usage of steam burst. By nature, steam and especially steam bursts push water vapor which cools down the soleplate. Eventually, the soleplate and water aren’t hot enough to vaporize. Oliso addresses this issue in their instruction manual, stating that the user must wait three seconds between every steam burst.</p>

<p>The ubiquity of steam irons might cause you to forget that it is a high-watt appliance that can cause serious damage without caution. Fortunately, the automatic safety features mostly come standard now. Design and construction also contribute to the overall safety of steam irons. We took a look at a few subcategories and graded each for effectiveness and quality:</p>
<p><b>Stability on heel:</b> We applied some force in different directions to determine the stability and balance of each iron while standing on the heel.</p>
<p><b>Cord design:</b> A crucial point in design with steam irons. We grade how well it stays out of the way, how it packs for storage and its overall quality.</p>
<p><b>Auto shut-off:</b> Some irons have multi-way auto shut-offs, safeguarding your fabric and your home from scorching or fire.</p>
<p><b>Overall construction:</b> Considering metal and plastic parts near high heat and high-wattage electrical heating elements, quality construction is a must. We graded the overall feel and construction of each iron.</p>
<p>As far as stability while standing on its heel, all of the irons were great. From our lowest price to highest, all of them scored top marks. By the feel of stability, they all felt like high quality irons that were weighted and balanced well.</p>
<p>When it came to cord design, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000P6CRLO/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; NI-L70SRW Cordless Iron</a> was our favorite. Its charging base had a nice retractable cord that worked well and cleaned up easily. As for the iron itself, there was no cord to contend with, meaning high mobility and lightness.</p>
<p>Rowenta edged out the other finalists with Oliso and T-fal not far behind. These three had small hooks to help wrap the ends of a cable to itself, making things a little easier and tidier.</p>
<p>While retractable cables are a great usability feature, the Sunbeam was a little difficult to use. It was a common negative comment among Amazon reviews, and we agreed. The release button was too fast and forceful, which made retracting the cable more of a hassle than it should be. It’s liable to cause minor injury if allowed to snap back without manual guidance. Otherwise, once it’s retracted, it’s nice and easy to store with no danger of tripping or getting pulled by the wire.</p>
<p>In general, all finalists had well-designed cords that were strong and effective at staying away and being hardly noticeable. A feature we are happy to see standard now is a ball bearing joint that attaches the cable to the iron.</p>
<p>Auto shut-off features varied with each model but its goal is common: prevent burns. All finalists performed as expected. Maytag, Rowenta, Sunbeam and T-fal scored best marks for having multi-way auto shut-off with visual indication.</p>
<p>Oliso takes auto shut-off to the next level with a feature that lifts the iron up when it senses it’s stopped moving. Though impressive, it was almost too responsive, lifting at any hesitation, which caused some dragging on the fabric of the lifters when moved again. Luckily there is an on and off switch to disable this feature.</p>
<p>For overall construction, Oliso and Rowenta impressed us the most. With easy-to-press buttons and an overall professional and well-engineered feel, we believe they would last longer and be less likely to fail mechanically.</p>
<p>In total, it’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004ILTH1K/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rowenta</a> again, followed by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000P6CRLO/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; NI-L70SRW Cordless Iron</a> and T-fal / Oliso in a tie for third as our top safest irons. Thankfully, the rest of the finalists rank average or above.</p>

<p>In a series of performance tests, we put our finalists through the real test: ironing different types of fabrics. We took the following criteria into account:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>General ease of use</b> &#8211; A culmination of good design and construction.</li>
<li><b>Interface design</b> &#8211; We grade the functionality of parts and features and how they affect overall usability.</li>
<li><b>Ironing samples</b> &#8211; Real samples of fabrics to test the variable temperature settings and steam in action: Cotton, silk and linen.</li>
<li><b>“Glideability” </b>&#8211; Smoothness of soleplate while in use.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of clean-up and storage</strong> &#8211; We measure the ease of emptying water and putting the iron away.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006ZUHR0/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BLACK+DECKER</a> was a favorite in interface design, with its easy-to-read digital screen and audible beep indicating it’s ready. The compact and easy to use and read dials of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AX6RCD8/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sunbeam</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041KVL2Q/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oliso</a> are our favorites of the dial types.</p>

<p>Maytag and Panasonic &#8211; NI-W950A suffered from poorly designed dials, which were hard to read. The arrows indicating selected choice were not immediately obvious. While using the Maytag, we accidentally moved the dial, switching the fabric option to linen from cotton. The dial on the Panasonic got noticeably hot during use.</p>

<p>One aspect we were eager to test was claims made by different brands, especially of their soleplate. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004ILTH1K/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rowenta</a> is known for its “Precision Tip,” a slight tapering towards the tip of the iron. In our testing, it did feel slightly more nimble, especially going around buttons. We felt that it did make a difference in usability, which we scored high across all three ironing samples.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009AM8SMG/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; NI-W950A</a> has a unique symmetrical eyeball shape that promised a “multi-directional” experience. We experienced a slight advantage in maneuverability. It was possible to back up into more spaces, like around buttons and around edges and iron from the back. Of course the surface area of the soleplate is slightly reduced, but we didn’t feel a difference in terms of coverage. We can see how sneaking back into fine spaces could be useful for more intricate garments.</p>
<p>T-fal went so far as to trademark the word “ultraglide,” but that only brought us disappointment. The only ceramic soleplate of the bunch, the T-fal, did not impress. We thought that even our low-budget finalist, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AX6RCD8/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sunbeam,</a> gave us a smoother ride. It particularly faltered in our silk test, feeling slightly sticky in comparison to the rest.</p>
<p>Since ceramic soleplates are favored for resisting static cling, T-fal may be a better choice if you iron a lot of synthetic fabrics. But for cotton, linen and silk, its grades are middling.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000P6CRLO/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; NI-L70SRW Cordless Iron</a> offers a few unique features that may appeal to those with specific needs. Professional crafter and co-author Nichole Ramirez cited the usefulness of lightweight and cordless irons for those who need to iron for hours at a time.</p>
<p>Though the Panasonic&#8217;s test results were about average, the fact that it’s easier to use for longer stretches of time could make all the difference. That it comes with a cover, a retractable cord (for the base) and a removable water tank make it an appealing choice for crafters and those who favor lighter irons.</p>
<h3>Leak tests</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/leak-test-clip2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, we have our series of leak tests. Water leaks can hamper your overall speed of ironing. The more leaks you get, the more you need to slow down as the soleplate needs more time to heat back up.</p>
<p>In order to test for leaks, we agitated the irons with repeated steam bursts in three different states:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upright</li>
<li>Down and flat</li>
<li>While ironing</li>
</ul>
<p>To test the anti-drip features, we set the irons to a high setting and then turned them down. This feature closes off the holes in lower temperatures where the water has trouble vaporizing due to reduced heat.</p>
<p>Again, Rowenta sweeps the top, next to Panasonic &#8211; NI-W950A in second and T-fal in a close third.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Rowenta &#8211; DW5080 Focus</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rowenta-ironing-clip.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>After clobbering every other steam iron in almost every test category, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004ILTH1K/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rowenta &#8211; DW5080 Focus</a> walks away effortlessly as our pick for best overall steam iron. From initial unboxing, manual design, iron and steam performance to cleanup, the Rowenta was a cut above the rest. The best part is that it’s about median price &#8212; not the cheapest and not the most expensive &#8212; but a sensible investment that can potentially save some time in the long run.</p>
<p>Users tend to agree, as it rates consistently well on Amazon. Even more impressive, it grabbed the #1 spot on other reviews we looked at such as TechGearLab&#8217;s.</p>

<p>As a renowned name in irons since 1919, Rowenta boasts a long history of manufacturing home appliances. Paired with German engineering, the Focus steam iron achieves a superior feel from every button and dial, down to the soleplate. Not to mention, it is the only finalist that is manufactured in Germany, unlike the rest that are made in China.</p>
<p>Its “Precision Tip” soleplate design proved to be a simple yet effective innovation. While maintaining a sturdy, wide base that felt solid and substantial, the tapered tip allows for more nimble navigation around buttons and collars.</p>
<p>The Rowenta comes with a plastic water-filling cup, which worked well with its own filling spout, making water-filling a tidy no-brainer. The spout even has a slight spring-loaded action, which snaps in nicely when shut. The steam and spray buttons have a satisfying deep plunge action that doesn’t stick as it did with some of the other irons we tested. It’s these simple solutions to common difficulties in ironing that puts Rowenta over the top.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Rowenta’s “Precision tip” is not just hype but an effective and practical feature especially helpful for navigating the more difficult parts of collared shirts.</li>
<li>Rowenta gave us the most robust and consistent steam output, which should result in quicker ironing times.</li>
<li>Many generations of steam irons dating back to 1919 result in clever and solid engineering and design.</li>
<li>The only steam iron of our finalists <i>not</i> manufactured in China, but in Germany.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006ZUHR0/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BLACK+DECKER &#8211; Digital Advantage Professional</a> is the best lower-priced alternative to the Rowenta. The digital interface is very simple, but well-implemented, including a feature that we think should be included in all steam irons: an audible beep to indicate that it’s ready to use.</p>
<p>In general, the technology behind steam irons remains quite basic and simple in comparison to all the wireless, voice-command, smart-appliance doodads out there. We have simple circuits that turns voltage to heat up a conductive soleplate. It’s almost comical that having a very basic digital readout is the crowning feature of this iron, but it does the job well and scores high in usability.</p>

<p>The Digital Advantage excels in one aspect we were baffled to find lacking in the others: “Temperature-ready” status going from higher to lower settings. The Oliso is the only other iron that does this but at a price that&#8217;s more than <i>four time</i>s that of the BLACK+DECKER. The BLACK+DECKER’s alert is audible, which is more user-friendly than the Oliso to boot. Like the other finalists, Oliso’s temperature light switches off and on to indicate “ready” status. This works but is easily overlooked, requiring you to keep a close eye on the iron.</p>
<p>Another advantage to note is that the BLACK+DECKER is the only iron that doesn’t need to be emptied of water after each use. This is a boon for those who are always in a rush and rely on every spare second. Every other finalist emphasizes the need to be emptied or else risk build up that would require extra time and care to clean. This is a great plus in our book. It’s a wonder why they don’t make this feature more prominent!</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The BLACK+DECKER &#8211; Digital Advantage Professional has a solid build and above average performance at a lower price-point.</li>
<li>Digital temperature interface is simple to use.</li>
<li>Audible “beep” to indicate when ready works going from higher to lower temperature as well.</li>
<li>The only iron you don’t have to empty after use.</li>

<h2 id="best-for-crafters">Best for crafters: Oliso &#8211; Pro TG1600 Smart Iron</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041KVL2Q/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oliso &#8211; Pro TG1600 Smart Iron</a> deserves special mention as an iron designed for creative types. It’s the most high-tech and forward-thinking of all the finalists with its unique innovations. Its construction and engineering is high-quality, well-executed and on-par with our #1 pick, Rowenta.</p>
<p>Its most unique feature is its “iTouch Technology,” which enables touch sensors to mechanically lift the iron up when not in use to prevent burning and scorching of fabrics. With crafters and creators at the forefront, this feature is wonderful for those who need to multi-task and or work with sensitive fabrics. It works surprisingly well, speaking to its overall high-quality design.</p>

<p>In a line-up, its soleplate design also stands out. While stainless steel is notorious for sticking to crafting materials like transfers, Oliso overcomes this shortcoming by adding a textured surface. This solution gives us the benefit of higher conductivity of stainless steel without the usual stickiness. Ceramic would typically be the better choice for crafting and synthetic fabrics, but it has its own flaws of color transfer in higher temperature and rubbing off over time. Oliso’s unique stainless steel soleplate gives us the advantages of both stainless steel and ceramic without their drawbacks.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Oliso &#8211; Pro TG1600 Smart Iron was specially designed for crafters, sewers and quilters.</li>
<li>Its stainless steel soleplate is textured and has flat, minimal holes designed to work with transfers and adhesives.</li>
<li>Oliso’s patented “iTouch Technology” is a clever feature that lifts the entire iron once it senses there is no movement, which makes it great for super sensitive fabrics or multi-tasking.</li>

<h3>Panasonic &#8211; NI-W950A</h3>
<p>Panasonic’s second entry, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009AM8SMG/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NI-W950A</a> earned a #2 ranking on Consumer Reports and with good reason. It went neck to neck with our #1 pick, earning just a few points less. Though it’s the only iron with an aluminum soleplate within our finalists, the material difference was not noticeable in our iron testing. As with Rowenta, it performed very highly in steam output and is generally well made.</p>
<p>The soleplate’s unique shape, advertised as “Multi-directional” was an interesting feature that could be useful for those with more intricate ironing. The back of the plate comes to a point exactly like the front in a football shape.</p>
<h3>T-fal &#8211; FV4495 Ultraglide</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HG84YQU/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ultraglide iron</a> highlights its unique feature: a ceramic soleplate. Typically made of aluminum coated with ceramic, this material is best suited for ironing synthetic fabrics due to its resistance to static electricity. Natural fibers like cotton and wool can possibly rub off in high heat.</p>
<p>Ranking #4 on Consumer Reports, it fared satisfactorily in our testing. We weren’t too impressed by the instruction manual, which we found a little confusing and set in small type. However, it excelled in heating speed, only six seconds behind the fastest, clocking in at 1 minute 9 seconds to maximum heat.</p>
<p>Other quirks, like difficulty filling water and the fact that the “Ultraglide” was not so “ultra” knocked its grades down. The relatively smaller soleplate (which likely aided in quicker heating) leaves your hand closer to the steam, which may get slightly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It performs notably well with continuous steam. This in combination with its relatively lighter weight makes the T-fal more practical as a vertical steamer.</p>
<h3>Panasonic &#8211; NI-L70SRW Cordless Iron</h3>
<p>For those wondering about cordless irons, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000P6CRLO/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic’s NI-L70SRW</a> entry does a solid job. You might expect the heat and steam to be weak, but it really did not disappoint here. The biggest drawback is that it loses steam a little sooner, but we believe that it’s enough for regular use.</p>
<p>In general, this iron is well designed, engineered and constructed. Controls are thoughtful and simple, and instructions are easy to understand. The main difference in function from corded irons is that you return the iron to the base instead of standing it on the heel when you make adjustments to your garments.</p>
<p>This model has a removable water reservoir, which means you can go to the sink to refill with tap water while leaving the iron in the base to charge. This also means that the heating element stays farther away from running water.</p>
<p>Most Amazon user reviews were favorable, expressing a similar pleasant surprise at its strength. Some note that this iron is great for the elderly because of its lighter weight. It is also popular among those who need to iron for hours at a time.</p>
<h3>Maytag &#8211; M400</h3>
<p>A long trusted name in home appliances, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AW51G2Y/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Maytag’s M400</a> is a solid, if not unremarkable steam iron. It’s named the “Speed Heat Iron” and in that respect, it does not disappoint. It’s the fastest heating iron by six seconds. The box claims 55 seconds, but we clocked it in at 1 minute 3 seconds.</p>
<p>We liked that the water filling position is down flat, reminding that you must unplug it before refilling. The water-filling hatch is easier to access, because it’s more stable to hold than at an angle.</p>
<p>Steam output, however, is a bit of a weakness here, with the area of steam burst just a bit smaller than other top performers. It unsurprisingly struggles as a vertical steamer, not unlike the rest. Leak tests show below average results, leaking a little bit during the silk ironing test.</p>
<h3>Sunbeam &#8211; Steam Master GCSBSP-201-FFP</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AX6RCD8/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">This Sunbeam iron</a> represents the best of lower-budget irons and rightly so. Though the cheapest in price, it performed almost as well as the T-fal model which cost almost twice the amount.</p>
<p>The Sunbeam looks and feels more “budget,” but it has many of the same features as irons are that double, triple, quadruple, etc. in price (sevenfold for the Oliso model). In fact, the retractable cord is an added feature that none of the others have in-unit. The execution of this feature is <i>almost </i>there. The retracting button is too harsh, requiring attention to the receding end. However, the effort pays off with not having to deal with a long, dangling cord in storage.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Clothing steam irons are the type of item you want to purchase far and few in between. We expect it to be well-constructed and last a long time, which we believe indicate an ultimately safer iron. Fast heating, robust steam and good engineering and design are the cornerstones of a steam iron that can save you time.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004ILTH1K/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rowenta &#8211; DW5080 Focus</a> excelled in these areas and won our confidence as the Best Overall Clothing Steam Iron. For crafters, sewers and quilters, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041KVL2Q/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oliso &#8211; Pro TG1600 Smart Iron</a> is the top of the line. For those who want quality performance without breaking the bank, our pick for best lower-priced alternative is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006ZUHR0/?tag=ybdiron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BLACK+DECKER &#8211; Digital Advantage Professional</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>There are quite a few options for baby detergents. First, we looked at articles written by pediatricians, to see if we should stick to baby detergents or if we could safely consider other free and clear options. After our initial research, we decided to follow in the footsteps of <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/16/consumer-reports-laundry-pods/30210873/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Reports</a> and weed out any pod-style detergents due to the danger they pose to children and pets.</p>
<p>Once we determined what features to look for in a baby detergent (and which ingredients are best to avoid), we scoured subreddits like /r/BabyBumps, blog articles and YouTube reviews to get an idea of which detergents caregivers liked best for their baby&#8217;s laundry.</p>
<p>We then gathered up our loads of baby clothes and headed to the laundry room for hands-on testing. We had brand new clothes that needed to be washed before wearing and pre-loved clothes with those ubiquitous yellow stains that mysteriously appear during storage.</p>

<h2 id="why-use">Why use baby laundry detergent</h2>
<p>When choosing a detergent to wash your baby’s clothes with, the goal is to find a balance between effectively removing stains and being sensitive enough for a baby&#8217;s delicate skin.</p>
<p>Many dermatologists, pediatricians and parents would agree that using a laundry detergent specifically designed for babies is not necessary, but does offer benefits.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers-clothing/Pages/Cleaning-Baby-Clothes.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthychildren.org</a>, baby laundry detergent is designed to leave behind less residue in order to prevent baby’s sensitive skin from becoming irritated. Additionally, the <a href="https://www.aap.org/en-us/Pages/Default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> recommends washing baby items separately with a milder detergent since fabric softeners and soap flakes can strip away the flame-retardant properties of sleepwear.</p>
<p>Babies (and even adults) can have skin sensitivities and allergies to fragrances, dyes or other irritants found in regular laundry detergents. These can cause contact dermatitis and chemical sensitivities. Contact dermatitis can result in itchy, dry skin. Chemical sensitivities can cause skin allergies or respiratory issues.</p>
<p>None of the baby detergents we tested contain dyes, but if you find that these milder detergents do not have the cleaning power you desire, there are other great <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-laundry-detergent/" rel="noopener">free &amp; clear detergent options</a> you can try. However, if you notice that your baby is developing a skin rash or redness in an area where clothing touches their skin, it’s a good idea to go back to a detergent specifically formulated for baby laundry.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Hypoallergenic:</strong> When listed on the label, hypoallergenic tends to mean “dye-free,” but you also want to be wary of other ingredients that can be irritating to baby’s delicate skin and lungs. These can include fragrances, softeners and optical brighteners.</p>
<p><strong>Effective on baby stains:</strong> It doesn’t take long to figure out that babies are messy creatures; a baby detergent needs to be able to remove spit-up, human waste and food. Although cloth diapers should be washed separately and with special care, it’s nice to have a baby detergent that can do double duty on clothes and cloth diapers.</p>
<p><strong>Cost-efficient:</strong> Caring for a newborn costs a significant amount of money, so saving money on laundry detergent means you have more to spend on a car seat, stroller and all the other baby must-haves.</p>
<p><strong>Dermatologist/pediatrician recommended:</strong> While the American Academy of Pediatrics acknowledges that parents often wash baby clothes with regular detergent and that it is generally safe to do so, it’s still nice to know that your baby’s detergent has the seal of approval from dermatologists, pediatricians and allergists.</p>
<p><strong>Residue free:</strong> <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/404_can-i-use-regular-detergent-to-wash-my-babys-clothes_1368463.bc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BabyCenter</a> expert and pediatric dermatologist Mary Spraker recommends using a liquid detergent on baby clothes since it rinses cleaner (especially in hard water) and is, therefore, less likely to irritate baby’s sensitive skin.</p>
<p><strong>Scent:</strong> Some parents love the classic baby scent, while others are concerned about fragrance allergies. As long as your baby doesn’t have an allergic reaction, this is a personal choice. Since scent can sometimes be an irritant for babies, we considered fragrance-free to be an important quality in determining key metrics for baby detergent.</p>
<p><strong>HE formula:</strong> High Efficiency (HE) washing machines use less water in the wash and rinse cycles, so HE detergents are formulated to disperse quickly, use fewer suds and hold soils in lower water volumes.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients in baby laundry detergent</h2>
<p>Although a quick scan of the list of ingredients in baby detergent may worry you, their intended functions are easy to understand. Here is a quick review of common ingredients you’ll find in a baby laundry detergent, along with their uses.</p>
<p><strong>Surfactants:</strong> Generally these are the staple ingredient of laundry detergents. These molecules separate grease and soil from the water and prevent it from redepositing back on clothes. While warm water alone can remove some soils, surfactants help loosen particles and soil by reducing the surface tension of water. The end result is cleaner clothing, which is especially important when you have diaper disasters. These cleaning compounds can be synthetic, mineral-based or plant-based.</p>
<p><strong>Fragrance:</strong> <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/10/101026091559.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ScienceDaily</a> reports that hundreds of unlisted chemicals can be labeled under the single term “fragrance,” and that these synthetic scents can contain chemicals that are defined as hazardous by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. On the other hand, Dr. Mary Spraker of BabyCenter states that “allergies to fragrances in laundry cleaners are rare.” If you love the smell of freshly washed baby laundry but you suspect your little one has a fragrance allergy, you can try detergents scented with plant-based essential oils.</p>
<p><strong>Optical Brighteners:</strong> These agents make clothes appear whiter by absorbing ultraviolet light and cast it out as a visible blue light which disguises yellowing and stains. While the Environmental Protection Agency includes several brighteners on their <a href="https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/safer-ingredients" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safer ingredients list</a> (meaning they are not dangerous in and of themselves), they are designed to deposit particles on fabrics. The residue can cause allergies to those with sensitive skin, so it may not be something you want in your baby detergent.</p>
<p><strong>Enzymes:</strong> Industry expert Mary Marlowe Leverette explains that the use of naturally-occurring enzymes allows for cleaning in cooler temperatures and less detergent. There are different enzymes, each of which targets a specific type of soil. For baby clothes, proteases are the most effective because they break down protein-based stains (breastmilk, formula, and bodily fluids). On the other hand, proteases keep on working after they break up stains, so remaining residue left on the fabric can irritate baby’s skin.</p>
<p>If you use cloth diapers, you’ll want to make sure the ingredients don’t void your warranty. For example, the warranty on bumGenius cloth diaper products is void if you use a detergent with enzymes or brighteners. On the other hand, other cloth diaper companies recommend the use of enzymes.</p>
<p>The same goes for washing baby carriers, which require special care so as not to damage the fibers and structure of the carrier. Babywearing International recommends using a detergent without softeners or optical brighteners for this reason. Additionally, silk wraps should be washed with an enzyme-free detergent so it does not damage the delicate fibers.</p>

<p>As you could imagine, some of the stains babies are known for don’t lend themselves to testing (After all, babies tend not to spit up on command). However, spit-up and leaky diapers are protein stains, as are breast milk, formula and most food stains. So we chose three popular “first foods” for babies, as well as Nutramigen infant and toddler powder formula, and stained each Gerber onesie with a tablespoon each of these four substances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pureed cooked carrots</li>
<li>Applesauce</li>
<li>Mashed bananas</li>
<li>Formula</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we let the stains sit for 48 hours — because let’s face it, hardly anyone with a newborn has a chance to get clothes in the laundry the minute they get dirty. Just to get an idea of the workload each detergent would need to handle, we washed a onesie in plain warm water. We found that the warm water alone was able to remove the formula stain and that bananas left the darkest stain. Armed with this knowledge, we tested each of the detergents by washing a stained onesie in warm water.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/17/business/cold-water-detergents-get-a-chilly-reception.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times</a> reports that when you reduce thermal energy to clean clothes, a detergent needs to compensate with surfactants and enzymes that work better in cold water. Two of our finalists, Attitude &#8211; Little Ones and ECOS &#8211; Baby, are specifically formulated to be washed in cold water. We tested these two finalists by first washing them in cold water. After we recorded the results, we washed again in warm water to see if stains were further removed. The results were the same, which is great news in terms of saving energy by using cold water versus warm water.</p>
<p>The good news is that all of our finalists were nearly equal in terms of stain-removing power, meaning that you should feel confident choosing any of the finalists based on other factors, such as scent, cost or eco-friendliness. The Biokleen Baby had a little more trouble removing the applesauce stain than the others, leaving a medium color versus a light color.</p>

<h3>The pH test</h3>
<p>Since most soils are acidic, a detergent on the alkaline side of the pH scale would produce more effective results. This is because pH measures the potential of hydrogen ions and alkaline detergents neutralize the impact of the acidic ions. A pH level of 7.0 is considered neutral, but tap water is rarely neutral. The first thing we tested was our water source as it filled the washing machine. Our water tested at a pH level of 5.75, so this was our basis of comparison.</p>
<p>The baby detergents we tested were less alkaline than the regular detergents we tested in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-laundry-detergent/" rel="noopener">laundry detergent review</a>. For example, Biokleen Free &amp; Clear Laundry Powder has a pH level of 8.0, while Biokleen &#8211; Baby liquid detergent has a pH level of 5.0. Since the cleaning properties of the baby version aren’t as strong, you’re trading a more mild product for a few stains. In terms of alkalinity, the detergents that had the most cleaning power (with a pH level of 6.0) were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VND51XE/?tag=ybdtrg-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dreft Stage 1: Newborn</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00412S07I/?tag=ybdtrg-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Purex Baby</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0091DS0U4/?tag=ybdtrg-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Seventh Generation Baby</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to babies, you don’t want any detergent residue left on the clothes that could irritate their sensitive skin. If you decide to use regular detergent, you may need to add in a second rinse cycle. A baby detergent eliminates that step, and we were impressed with the fact that nearly all of our finalists rinsed completely clean (returned to the base level pH of 5.75). The only detergents that left a minimal amount of residue were the Babyganics Fragrance Free and ECOS Baby, which both had a pH level of 5.5 when we tested the water during the rinse cycle.</p>
<p>One interesting fact we found is that Puracy tested at a pH level of 5.75 during the wash and rinse cycle, meaning it didn’t change the pH level of the water at all. At the same time, it was equally as effective on stains as some of the “stronger” detergents.</p>

<h3>The price test</h3>
<p>The most recent report from the United States Department of Agriculture estimates the annual cost of raising a child to be between $12,350 and $13,900 annually. With those kinds of numbers, it’s no surprise that new parents want to save money where they can. We pulled prices from Amazon and then divided the price by the number of loads in each bottle to find the cost per load.</p>
<p>At the time of publication, Purex &#8211; Baby was less than four dollars per 75 fluid ounce bottle at Amazon and Walmart. With 50 loads to each bottle, this puts the cost at only $.08. At $.10 per load, Biokleen &#8211; Baby was another good low-priced option. On the high end of the range, Attitude &#8211; Little Ones was the most expensive choice at $.56 per load.</p>

<p>We loved how soft, clean and fresh-smelling our baby clothes came out after washing in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NGLIZSE/?tag=ybdtrg-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Puracy &#8211; Natural</a>. Based on our own research and testing, we found that Puracy led the pack in baby detergents, so it&#8217;s no surprise that Amazon users agree.</p>
<p>With nearly 700 customer reviews, Puracy has a four and a half star rating. It is listed as the number one seller in cloth diaper laundry detergent, meaning that it effectively removes stink and stains without harsh chemicals. This powerful stain-fighting ability is due to a quadruple plant-based enzyme formula, with proteases to remove protein stains like baby formula and amylases to remove baby food. It also contains the mineral zinc ricinoleate to combat odors and bad smells.</p>
<p>Since newborns need to be changed several times a day, the laundry adds up quickly. They also don’t like to be put down very often, so you can end up doing all of that extra laundry the way you do most things when there’s a newborn in the house — with one hand. For these reasons, we greatly appreciated Puracy’s pump top. The pump top eliminates mess, hassle and confusion over how much detergent to distribute — and saves money by preventing overuse.</p>

It is formulated to effectively remove stains with the power of enzymes — but without perfumes, dyes or harsh chemicals.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NGLIZSE/?tag=ybdtrg-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The 10x concentrated formula means you get 95 loads out of a 25-ounce bottle, which is great because the last thing you need as a new parent is one more thing to carry. It also reduces plastic, water and energy by more than 80%. Because it is so highly concentrated, the detergent works well as a pre-treatment for stains. While we didn’t include pre-treatment as part of our stain test, we found it worked well when applied to stains on clothes during regular laundry use. Finally, Puracy is non-toxic and safe for kids and pets. While a newborn isn’t likely to get into things, babies quickly grow into curious toddlers.</p>
<p>One drawback to the product is its low score on EWG’s Guide to Healthy Cleaning. This is due to the use of sodium borate (Borax). However, the co-founder of the company states that the use of Borax represents less than 1% of the formula. It is used as a stabilizer for the enzymes and serves to extend the shelf life of the detergent. The other <a href="http://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners/6009-PuracyNaturalLaundryDetergentFreeClear?formulation=6551" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ingredients</a> in the product receive A, B and C ratings.</p>
<p>We chose the free and clear version for a baby detergent, which is created by doctors for users with sensitive skin, but they also offer a scented version in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YFKX3AA/?tag=ybdtrg-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fresh Linen</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reasonably priced at only $.17 per load, Puracy helps you save money and reduce waste with its pump top which eliminates measuring and spilling.</li>
<li>Puracy pulls triple duty in the laundry room, can be be used on cloth diapers, baby clothes and the rest of the household’s laundry.</li>
<li>Coconut-based cleansers, plant-based enzymes and minerals add up to a gentle-yet-effective formula that is safe for use around babies and pets.</li>

<p>At less than four dollars per 75-ounce bottle, you would be hard-pressed to come up with a more cost-efficient way to wash your baby laundry than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00412S07I/?tag=ybdtrg-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Purex &#8211; Baby</a>. When you break it down, each load only costs $.08, so it’s quite a savings compared to the average cost of $.25 cents per load.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00412S07I/?tag=ybdtrg-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/purex-baby-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/purex-baby-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/purex-baby-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/purex-baby-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/purex-baby-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/purex-baby-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/purex-baby-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/purex-baby-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/purex-baby.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Budget Detergent: Purex - Baby</h3><p>In our testing, Purex - Baby was able to perform equally as well as our other contenders but at roughly one-third of the cost per load as compared to competitors. It's dye-free, but be aware it does have a synthetic fragrance.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00412S07I/?tag=ybdtrg-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The best part is, Purex tested equal to the other finalists in terms of removing protein stains like baby formula, carrots, applesauce and bananas. In the wash cycle, it tested at a 6.0 pH level, making it one of the higher ranking detergents in terms of alkalinity. We also found that there was no remaining detergent residue left in the rinse cycle, meaning that it rinsed completely clean.</p>
<p>Purex features the Dirt Lift action of other Purex detergents, but is dye-free, dermatologist-tested and formulated to be extra gentle. It does have a synthetic fragrance, so if your baby has a fragrance allergy, this detergent may not work for you. However, many consumers report that they love the lingering baby powder smell on their little one’s clothes. In fact, 78% of reviewers on Amazon and 86% of reviewers on Walmart give it a 5-star rating.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At only $.08 per load versus the average cost of $.25 per load, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00412S07I/?tag=ybdtrg-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Purex</a> offers significant savings.</li>
<li>Purex was able to remove protein stains as well as the other finalists and rinsed completely clean, leaving no residue which could cause irritation to baby’s skin.</li>

<h2 id="green-pick">Most eco-friendly: Attitude &#8211; Little Ones</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5813 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/attitude-detergent-solo.jpg" alt="Attitude detergent solo" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/attitude-detergent-solo.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/attitude-detergent-solo-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/attitude-detergent-solo-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/attitude-detergent-solo-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/attitude-detergent-solo-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/attitude-detergent-solo-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/attitude-detergent-solo-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/attitude-detergent-solo-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/attitude-detergent-solo-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/attitude-detergent-solo-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>When it comes to the detergent with the absolute safest ingredients, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002HQGVT4/?tag=ybdtrg-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Attitude &#8211; Little Ones</a> is the clear winner. It receives an A rating on the EWG’s Guide to Healthy Cleaning, meaning that it has good ingredient disclosure and that these ingredients have few or no known health/environmental hazards. As a company, Attitude prides itself on making products without contaminants or carcinogenic ingredients. Their products are made using 100% renewable energy, reducing their carbon footprint.</p>

It's designed for cold-water washing, which helps you save money on monthly energy bills.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002HQGVT4/?tag=ybdtrg-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Attitude is also certified eco-friendly by Eco Logo, one of the oldest and most recognized green labeling programs. In order to receive this voluntary certification, a product has to undergo rigorous scientific testing and comply with stringent environmental performance standards.</p>
<p>One bottle offers 35 loads for just over $17, so at $.56 per load, it is the most expensive detergent of the finalists we tested. On the other hand, it is formulated to be washed in cold water (you can also use warm water). Washing your clothes in cold water not only helps the planet by reducing energy use by 90%, but it also offers cost savings on your energy bill. The <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/The-Simple-Dollar/2012/0119/Here-s-exactly-how-much-you-ll-save-doing-laundry-in-cold-water" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christian Science Monitor</a> estimates that washing and rinsing in cold water uses an average of 0.3 kWh per load versus 4.5 kWh per load in a hot water wash/warm water rinse, thus saving you $.64 per load.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Attitude &#8211; Little Ones is formulated with only five ingredients, and receives an A rating for safe ingredients and ingredient disclosure from the Environmental Working Group.</li>
<li>Formulated to be washed in cold water, Attitude can save up to 90% in energy use and $60 annually on your utility bill.</li>

<h3>Seventh Generation &#8211; Baby</h3>
<p>Similar to our leading contender, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0091DS0U4/?tag=ybdtrg-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Seventh Generation &#8211; Baby</a> features a quadruple enzyme formula to target tough baby stains. We also found that it was one of the more alkaline of the baby detergents we tested, with a pH level of 6.0. It is a USDA-certified biobased product, meaning the ingredients come from renewable biological sources. Seventh Generation is free of dyes, synthetic fragrances and optical brighteners. It is also 2x concentrated, so you get the same amount of loads with a smaller bottle.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0091DS0U4/?tag=ybdtrg-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/seventh-generation-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/seventh-generation-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/seventh-generation-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/seventh-generation-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/seventh-generation-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/seventh-generation-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/seventh-generation-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/seventh-generation-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/seventh-generation.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Also Great: Seventh Generation</h3><p>Seventh Generation delivers strong cleaning power that's double concentrated in a smaller bottle, which helps economize storage. It's free of synthetic fragrances but still comes with a fresh scent due to its essential oils and botanical extracts.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0091DS0U4/?tag=ybdtrg-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>What we liked best about Seventh Generation is that it has a fresh scent that is 100% derived from essential oils and botanical extracts. Consumers describe it as a light lemon scent. If you love burying your face in fresh laundry and inhaling the scent of newly washed clothes but are worried about allergies to synthetic fragrances, this detergent offers the best of both worlds. We weren’t the only ones who were fans: the product receives a 4.3 star rating from over 500 reviewers on Amazon.</p>
<p>However, since Seventh Generation had a majority of ingredients that earned a C rating from EWG, it didn’t earn top marks as our best overall or most eco-friendly detergent.</p>
<h3>Dapple &#8211; Baby</h3>
<p>GoodGuide’s methodology gives Dapple Baby a 7.0 (good) rating out of 10, based on its health risk assessment and data adequacy. The line of Dapple products is created by two moms who wanted plant-based and baby-friendly cleaning products for their own little ones. Dapple is biodegradable, and formulated without parabens, phthalates, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, fragrance or dyes. It is also pediatrician recommended, so you can feel confident using it on your baby’s clothes.</p>
<p>The coconut-based cleansers are paired with protease and amylase enzymes to more effectively remove stains, and the detergent is enhanced for use on cloth diapers.</p>
<p>Unlike our top finalists, it is not recommended by Fluff Love University due to its “weak” formula and possible build up on fabric.</p>
<h3>Babyganics &#8211; Fragrance-Free</h3>
<p>With a 3x concentrated power, plant-based cleansers and two enzymes (protease and amylase), Babyganics Fragrance Free is great for fighting stains and safe for babies. It is tested by both pediatricians and dermatologists and is non-allergenic.</p>
<p>In our tests, the detergent left a slight amount of residue in the rinse cycle with a pH level of 5.5, so it didn’t earn one of our top spots.</p>
<p>However, it is formulated without optical brighteners, chlorine, phthalates, phosphates, artificial fragrances or dyes. You can feel confident that the ingredients don’t contain some of the primary triggers for allergies or skin sensitivities. Similar to Puracy, it does get a low EWG for its use of sodium borate as an enzyme stabilizer.</p>
<h3>ECOS &#8211; Baby</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B4V6N0A/?tag=ybdtrg-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ECOS &#8211; Baby</a> is another great eco-friendly option. It is formulated to be washed in all water temperatures, so you can save both money and energy by washing it in cold water. Earth Friendly Products, the makers of ECOS, were designated as the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EPA’s Safer Choice </a>2015 Partner of the Year. ECOS Baby is a certified Safer Choice product.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B4V6N0A/?tag=ybdtrg-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ecos-baby-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ecos-baby-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ecos-baby-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ecos-baby-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ecos-baby-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ecos-baby-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ecos-baby-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ecos-baby-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ecos-baby.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Good Eco-Friendly Option: Ecos - Baby</h3><p>Another eco-friendly option, ECOS is great in all water temps, and it's effective at cleaning without using enzymes. It fell behind our top pick since it's non-concentrated formula comes in much bigger, more cumbersome container.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B4V6N0A/?tag=ybdtrg-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>We were impressed that ECOS Baby removed stains as well as its counterparts without the use of enzymes. This 100% natural, plant-based formula uses coconut-based cleansers and is free of phosphates, chlorine, dyes and petroleum. We tested the free and clear version, but if you prefer a scent, the lavender and chamomile versions are a great option. The fragrance is achieved with essential (you guessed it, lavender and chamomile flower) oils, so you don’t have to worry about allergies associated with synthetic fragrances.</p>
<p>ECOS was a strong runner-up for best overall and best eco-friendly detergent. Unlike our top choices though, ECOS isn’t a concentrated formula and so the container was a little unwieldy.</p>
<h3>Dreft &#8211; Stage 1: Newborn</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most well-known of baby detergents, Dreft has been around for more than 80 years and there’s a reason for its longevity. It has a hypoallergenic (dye-free), gentle formula that is designed to rinse clean while still targeting tough stains. In our tests, we found this to be true. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VND51XE/?tag=ybdtrg-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dreft &#8211; Stage 1: Newborn</a> was one of the three detergents on the alkaline side, and did not leave any residue in the rinse cycle.</p>
<p>It is the detergent most recommended by pediatricians, and also by Pampers. We tested Stage 1 for newborns, and it removed stains equally as well as our other finalists, but there is also a Stage 2 designed for active babies that have started solid foods and are crawling all over the floor.</p>
<p>Dreft boasts a 4.5 star rating on Amazon, with 74% of users giving it 5 stars. Consumers are big fans of the classic baby scent, which leaves a strong lingering fragrance on baby’s clothes after washing.</p>
<p>However, since some babies have allergies to synthetic fragrances, we didn’t choose this detergent as our best overall. It is comparable to Purex, but Dreft is four times the cost and one of the more expensive finalists.</p>
<h3>Biokleen &#8211; Baby</h3>
<p>If you find that enzymes are problematic for your little one, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DCG0EJ0/?tag=ybdtrg-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Biokleen &#8211; Baby</a> is an excellent option. In was slightly less effective at removing stains than our other finalists, so it didn’t make it as one of our top picks. However, it’s nice to know that this gentle formula only uses plant-based surfactants and grapefruit seed extracts to clean. It rinses completely clean and doesn’t leave any fumes, residues or harsh chemicals on baby’s clothes.</p>
<p>Biokleen doesn’t use any materials listed as hazardous by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, or phosphate, chlorine, ammonia or petroleum solvents.</p>
<p>We loved the environmentally-friendly and compostable packaging, which uses 70% less plastic than traditional bottles and is made from recycled cardboard and newspaper. It’s also 3x concentrated, so the bottle is small and light.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Each of our finalists were good choices for baby detergent, with the same amount of stain removal capability and little to no residue left in the rinse cycle. In the end, the choice comes down to your preference in fragrance, cost and whether or not a natural formula is important to you. We found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NGLIZSE/?tag=ybdtrg-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Puracy &#8211; Natural</a> to be an excellent choice for its enzyme-powered stain fighting ability, coconut-based cleansers and easy-to-use pump top. For budget-minded consumers, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00412S07I/?tag=ybdtrg-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Purex &#8211; Baby</a> did the same job at a lower price.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent many hours over the span of a few weeks steaming shirts, drapes and dresses with 10 different steamers to find the best clothes steamer. This brought us to the conclusion that the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018ZHHS4/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Jiffy &#8211; ESTEAM</a> is the best handheld-steamer option available. It has a sturdy, functional design that got rid of wrinkles in no time. If you need something with a larger tank to steam lots of clothes, the Jiffy &#8211; ESTEAM&#8217;s older brother, the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000665TD/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Jiffy &#8211; J-2000</a>, wins our pick for best standing steamer. This standing model performs very well, heats up in about two minutes and gets 90 minutes of steam on one full tank.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We wanted to test the gamut of steamers in the way most people use them and decided to test both handheld and standing steamers. These tests were done in a home with the average consumer in mind and wasn&#8217;t meant to cater to any factory or commercial settings where you can just be steaming for hours on end.</p>
<p>Much of our selection was narrowed down by searching retailers such as Amazon to find the best-rated products. Luckily there were a lot of brands available to compare, and we were able to avoid testing any products with enough complaints from previous owners.</p>
<p>Two of the brands we included were just to test brand variety, although they didn&#8217;t rank above four stars: the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006CR9KGA/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair &#8211; ExtremeSteam</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BQRD0I/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Steamfast &#8211; SF-407</a>.</p>
<p>Testing Jiffy&#8217;s standing unit, the J-2000 was a no-brainer since it was rated very well by customer reviews, and fared well in <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-clothing-steamers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wirecutter&#8217;s review</a> for heavy use.</p>
<p>Many brands here had multiple steamer models available and aside from the Jiffy, we avoided doubling up to get a better feel for what other brands had to offer.</p>

<p>Steamers and irons are both built to get the wrinkles out of your clothes, but there are a few notable differences.</p>
<p><strong>Traditional Electric Irons:</strong> Irons are the most popular product used for removing wrinkles from clothing. You’ll typically need a large enough space to bring out an ironing board to do your work, a kink that steamers don’t have. With steamers, you can’t always replicate that freshly pressed look that irons create. For pleats and hard lines, irons are still the go-to.</p>
<p><strong>Electric Steamers:</strong> Some people dismiss the idea of using steamers on clothes completely, because it’s argued that the steam can damage fabrics. This is especially argued with dressier clothing like men’s suits &#8212; it’s been <a href="http://putthison.com/post/38959291784/beware-of-steamers-a-garment-steamer-like-the-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared</a> to blowing smoke through curled hair. With that in mind, steamers still remain popular alternatives to irons for many reasons.</p>
<p>Steamers don’t need ironing boards. Anyone who’s looking to conserve space would appreciate this. They&#8217;re are also much more efficient for jobs with large fabrics, like drapes or tablecloths. Hanging these up and steaming is much easier than having to drag the fabrics over an ironing board.</p>
<p>Compactness aside, steamers can go over delicate fabrics such as silk and satin without causing harm. Since the hot plate doesn’t actually touch the garments it also helps protect the shape. They will save you trips to the dry cleaners, considering you can steam out wool and suits without having to take them for professional care.</p>

<p>Standing steamers are larger and take up much more vertical space. They&#8217;re more geared toward high-volume steaming. If you have a lot of things you need ironed at once, then this is the route for you. High volume would mean about a dozen shirts at a time or more heavy duty materials like wool or dress pants.</p>
<p>Clothing stores tend to use standing steamers, because there&#8217;s no substitute for the larger capacity and speed of these models. You might want to buy one if you’ve got a big family and a large volume of clothes to steam, or if you have particularly difficult or delicate clothes that ironing may damage.</p>
<p>Handheld steamers can be convenient travel companions when you need to iron out wrinkles on the go. They can fit in suitcases and be brought along for the ride, so your clothes can get refreshed from being in garment bags. Not only that, they’re convenient for in-home wrinkle erasing. They’re also a good idea to consider for touch-ups, since you don’t have to pull out the ironing board.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We wanted to put these steamers through the paces by testing capacities, effectiveness as well as practical use testing to discover any potential issues.</p>
<p>Typically, the most difficult wrinkles to remove are on thick cottons, linens and silk. So we put all three to the test on each one of these steamers. We filled each tank with water from the sink to the fill lines and got to steaming.</p>

<p>The steam time was determined by filling up the reservoir of each machine and letting it warm up. Once the machine began producing steam, we started the timer.</p>
<p>When the steamers ran completely out of water in the reservoirs and no longer steamed the clothes, the timer was turned off and the time was recorded. This was done in one round specifically to measure steam time.</p>
<p>The tests to measure effectiveness on t-shirts, dress shirts, silk and drapes were done separately.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5692" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wrinkled-mens-shirts.jpg" alt="wrinkled mens dress shirt and t-shirt" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wrinkled-mens-shirts.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wrinkled-mens-shirts-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wrinkled-mens-shirts-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wrinkled-mens-shirts-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wrinkled-mens-shirts-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wrinkled-mens-shirts-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wrinkled-mens-shirts-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wrinkled-mens-shirts-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wrinkled-mens-shirts-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wrinkled-mens-shirts-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We used the same size large men’s cotton dress shirt for every steamer to measure the results. After steaming, we washed the shirt until it was entirely soaked in water and threw it in the dryer to get it nice and wrinkled again. Imagine the level of wrinkled your mother would scold you for &#8212; that was our sweet spot. Quantitatively, there were about three major wrinkles on both the front and the back of the shirts.</p>
<p>After testing the results on the cotton dress shirt, large cotton men’s t-shirts were steamed to see how many shirts the steamers could steam on one full tank. The shirts were deemed “finished” when all the wrinkles on the front, back and sleeves had been steamed out.</p>
<p>Again, that “pressed” look couldn’t be achieved with any steamer except for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0047E11LC/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark Press and Refresh</a>, but the shirts were considered finished when they looked good enough to wear to your company dinner party.</p>
<h3>Linen Drapes</h3>

<p>Next, we wrinkled linen drapes to wrinkle them by taking them off the rods and bunching them in a pile until the wrinkles held. Then we set the steamers on them. The drapes were about 33 x 53 inches and were steamed while hanging on the curtain rod. They were finished when all wrinkles were removed.</p>
<p>Standing steamers were not ideal for ironing drapes taller than 53 inches, since it can be a stretch to reach the very top. In our test, we could reach the top of these shorter drapes to steam out any wrinkles. For anything taller than this, we recommend using the handheld steamers or taking your drapes off the hanging rods for better accessibility.</p>
<h3>Silk Shirts and Dresses</h3>

<p>We wrinkled and steamed silk dresses and shirts to test effectiveness of each machine. Like in the other testing, it was deemed finished when all wrinkles were gone. Interestingly, none of the steamers, even the lower powered ones, had a difficult time with silk.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000665TD/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jiffy &#8211; J-2000</a> gets a standing ovation. Not only did the J-2000 have the longest steam time at 100 minutes, but it steamed with more power than the rest. It performed well with all the fabrics, and it did it fast. Set up was incredibly easy, and it made the actual steaming an enjoyable process too. The price tag may be a bit higher than the others, but in terms of build quality, the Jiffy clearly stands out.</p>
<p>The barebones design might make it seem like it’s missing something, but even without any attachments the Jiffy didn’t suffer in performance. In fact, the simplicity was welcomed after piecing together the extras that came with the others brands. The design itself is extremely sturdy.</p>
<p>The pole connected firmly into the base and stood over five feet tall &#8212; the tallest pole of all the machines &#8212; making steaming even more convenient. And if you need some attachments, its detailed handbook lists the many that are available, from crease tools to power converters.</p>

Great build quality without frills -- an excellent choice for a standing steamer.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000665TD/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The J-2000 steamed for a whopping 100 minutes. That basically means you can flip the Jiffy on along with your favorite movie, and the run time will be the same. We’re hoping that you won’t have that much work to do in one sitting, but if you do, the Jiffy’s got your back. The extra steam time also allows for assurance that you won’t have to rush while steaming and prolongs the time between refills.</p>
<p>Dress shirts were steamed in about four minutes, while the silk dress required only one pass of the steamer to remove wrinkles. The steam head is fairly wide with six holes, which provided just the right amount of steaming power. It tackled a wool sweater with no issue and took on any garment with simplicity, getting the wrinkles out easily.</p>
<p>The handle stayed cool while heating, a bonus for comfort level on an already well-designed machine. And when you need to move the machine around a bit, all four wheels roll easily. We didn’t have to move it much when in use, but when it was time to wheel it away, the job was simple.</p>
<p>The water chamber is clear, which lets you see how much water is left in the steam cycle. It’s also designed with an effective carrying handle, which made transporting to and from the sink much less awkward than its competitors.</p>
<p>If you don’t like ironing and have lots of stuff to steam, the Jiffy might the answer you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000665TD/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jiffy &#8211; J-2000</a> garment steamer was a standout for its sturdiness and quick steam time;  it had all we wanted from a steamer.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006VPLS04/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rowenta</a> at about $100 less is a cost-effective option for people looking to save, as it does a solid job of going over clothes and straightening them out in about one pass, but the quality is clearly lower than the Jiffy.</li>
<li>All of the standing steamers tested were more or less effective in de-wrinkling clothes, but the Jiffy was considerably more powerful, more efficient and less of a hassle.</li>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018ZHHS4/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jiffy &#8211; ESTEAM</a> handheld steamer provides almost as much power as the larger J-2000 Jiffy Steamer, but it did so in a compact unit. Unlike the other handheld models, the steam head is square, which provides more precision for going over corners of pockets and pressing into the fabric more effectively. And unlike the majority of the others, for a smaller unit, it packed a lot of power.</p>
<p>First impressions on appearance aren’t leaning in the ESTEAM&#8217;s favor, but it grew on us. It sort of looks like a stylized coffee pot. Unlike the others, it doesn’t have a max fill line for the water. You just fill the chamber all the way up, which is nice and simple.</p>
<p>Also unlike the others, it doesn’t have a power switch but turns on immediately when plugged in. This adds to the simplicity of the device, but if you ever want to turn it on and off during the steaming time, it’s slightly more cumbersome to have to unplug the cord rather than flipping a switch. This can be a good way to make sure you just unplug it and don&#8217;t accidentally leave a unit on while plugged in.</p>

Built to last many years, for a fairly reasonable price.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018ZHHS4/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>User reviews mention their Jiffy steamers lasted for years, mainly due to its sturdy design. With other steamers set to break down after a year or two, this slightly more expensive model would eventually pay for itself.</p>
<p>The steamer maneuvered very well, with no danger of leaking when moved around the garments. With a total steam time of nearly 20 minutes, it blows the other steamers out of the water. Especially if you’re just doing touch-ups while traveling, the steam time being one step above the rest means you’ll have more time to perfect the look of the clothes.</p>
<p>The ESTEAM heats up in two minutes and 20 seconds, and when it does it’s fairly calm and doesn’t shake from the bubbling inside the chamber. For a total of 19 minutes, it steamed much longer than the rest of the other handheld steamers.</p>
<p>In particular, it straightened out wrinkly shirt pockets quickly, a task that was difficult for most of the steamers we tested. Drapes were steamed with ease and the silk items were wrinkle free after just one pass. While it is a little on the pricier end in the handheld category, it&#8217;s a solid machine all around that warrants the price.</p>
<p>At three pounds, it’s light for travel. It’s slightly bigger than some of the other options, but its quality makes up for where it lacks in compactness. Overall, this should prove to be a long-lasting, effective choice for any time you need to steam either on the go or at home.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Options like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G9MC7GC/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">URPOWER</a> and Epica (discontinued), for the price, will not let you down. But if you’re willing to spend a little more, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018ZHHS4/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jiffy&#8217;s ESTEAM</a> delivers better quality.</li>
<li>Some models, like the Conair and the Shark, were either too much hassle or didn’t provide enough steaming power. Not every steamer steams equally &#8212; you can actually go wrong with this purchase.</li>
<li>Every steamer had trouble making creases, even the ones with specific tools to attempt to create them. For that, ironing just can’t be beat.</li>

<p>For travel needs you’re going to want compact and quick, and that’s what the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G9MC7GC/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">URPOWER</a> delivers. At 1.2 pounds, it’s easy to tuck away inside a travel bag.</p>
<p>The URPOWER heats up quickly, another bonus for when you’re on the go and need something steamed fast. The auto turn-off is a nice bonus too; if you’re rushed and forget to turn it off, this feature prevents overheating and causing a house fire (unfortunately, we know someone this happened to).</p>

<p>The design is comfortable, and the twist-off reservoir is easy to use. The water can be seen heating up right away in the small chamber. This unit takes one minute 20 seconds to start producing steam, which is relatively quick compared to the competition.</p>
<p>It gives off some initial pops and creaks when first heating but then simmers down. It required running over some garments twice to completely steam out all the wrinkles, but it did the job well.</p>
<p>Because the steamer is pretty small, the water chamber is also small, but it will still give you around nine minutes of steam, which isn’t too shabby. The URPOWER didn&#8217;t have as much power as other contenders, but it was enough to get our shirts done.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The hassle-free <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G9MC7GC/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">URPOWER</a> works well and requires no pesky set-up tricks to get you on your way.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s a great size for travel, with an acceptable tradeoff in steam power.</li>
<li>While it may lack some power, it will eventually get all of your fabrics looking wrinkle-free.</li>

<h2 id="best-budget">Budget pick: Epica &#8211; Handheld Steamer</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5686" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/epica-hero.jpg" alt="Epica steamer next to $20 bill" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/epica-hero.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/epica-hero-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/epica-hero-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/epica-hero-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/epica-hero-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/epica-hero-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/epica-hero-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/epica-hero-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/epica-hero-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/epica-hero-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>March 2019 update: the model we tested seems to have been discontinued, but Epica offers a few other units at a similar price point.</p>
<p>For around 20 dollars, the Epica  is a steal for its unexpectedly powerful steaming capability. It also promises a three-year warranty, so you can be confident in your purchase.</p>
<p>The Epica tends to sputter upon initial plugin, but it quickly recovers and starts steaming in two minutes. The steam is hot and works well, but you do get more than what you paid for. The 10 foot cord was also a nice feature, giving some extra play in the ability to move around with the steamer.</p>
<p>The Epica is compact, so you can pop it into your suitcase for travel. It’s not for heavy duty or high-volume garment steaming, but it will get you through your touch-ups and typical needs.</p>
<p>It heated up in two minutes flat and had a total steam time of 13 minutes. The design has a very wide steam head, which is a bonus for being able to go over larger sections quickly, but also slightly sacrifices on the ability for precision depending on what was being ironed; for shirt pockets, it required a little extra work. For drapes, it worked well and steamed out the wrinkles without difficulty.</p>
<p>This little guy was a pleasant surprise. It’s not the most powerful machine amongst the ones we tested so didn’t get top pick, but it&#8217;s simple and effective for the price. Sadly these days you can’t get much for 20 dollars, but you can get the Epica and make your clothes look like a million bucks.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The price of the Epica is unmatched in terms of value. With a three year warranty, this is a solid purchase for anyone looking to save money.</li>
<li>Performs as well as the more expensive handheld steamers we tested.</li>
<li>It has a few flaws including the water spurts and some shaking while in use, which don&#8217;t affect the overall performance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rowenta &#8211; IS6200</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5722" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rowenta.jpg" alt="Rowenta's IS6200 steamer" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rowenta.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rowenta-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rowenta-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rowenta-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rowenta-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rowenta-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rowenta-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rowenta-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rowenta-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rowenta-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006VPLS04/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rowenta IS6200</a> steamed out wrinkles well from all fabrics. The attachments were an added bonus if you like getting fancy; we could take them or leave them. You won’t be going wrong if you choose this option, but you won’t be getting top tier in terms of quality.</p>
<p>Aside from being fairly difficult to take out of the box, the Rowenta made for an easy set-up. The hanger head has a handy slot where the steamer head is stored.</p>
<p>It boasts a 60 second heat-up time, which in reality took closer to 90 seconds. A cotton men’s dress shirt took around four minutes to straighten out. It glided smoothly over the silk dress and immediately ironed out wrinkles with no more than one or two passes of the steamer. The hose of the Rowenta became noticeably hot but never too hot to use.</p>
<p>The product comes with three attachments: a fabric brush, a crease attachment and a lint pad. The fabric brush didn’t make a noticeable difference from using the regular steam head. An included crease tool sets out to solve a steamer’s biggest flaw: It can’t create creases. The creases were visible but not as defined as those created with a typical iron.</p>
<p>Oddly, there was a small pool of water left in the bottom of the machine after use and removing the water tank, but it wasn’t difficult to empty out of the chamber.</p>
<p>The “tilt-and go” feature was slightly awkward compared to its rolling competitors. Another bonus feature is the power switch, essentially a large foot pedal that’s stepped on to activate the steamer. The Rowenta is a decent pick, but it doesn’t particularly shine.</p>
<h3>Pure Enrichment &#8211; PureSteam XL</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5756" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/puresteam-xl.jpg" alt="Puresteam XL" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/puresteam-xl.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/puresteam-xl-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/puresteam-xl-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/puresteam-xl-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/puresteam-xl-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/puresteam-xl-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/puresteam-xl-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/puresteam-xl-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/puresteam-xl-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/puresteam-xl-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0161N956Y/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PureSteam XL</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BQRD0I/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Steamfast</a> were actually very similar in design, also both clocking in at 1500 watts. The first impression of the PureSteam is that it’s definitely cute; it almost looks like a little Star Wars droid.</p>
<p>There was some initial concern that the tube for the steam was inflexible and was going to make it difficult to maneuver around the garments, but once the machine heated up, the tube warmed and became more bendable. The mesh covering on the outside of the hose kept it from getting hot to the touch.</p>
<p>The PureSteam heated up in 60 seconds, even though it advertised 45. It gave 40 minutes of steam time, and it took about five minutes to iron one shirt, making it seem slightly less powerful than its competitors. One full tank could get about eight shirts done. It performed well on silk and ironed the wrinkles out efficiently.</p>
<p>It also worked well on wool, even with the steaming power being a little weaker. This is a great steamer for lighter fabrics as it’s simple and easy to use, but heavier garments like thick cotton and khakis would require much more work.</p>
<h3>Steamfast &#8211; SF-407</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5731" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steamfast.jpg" alt="steamfast standing unit with accessories" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steamfast.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steamfast-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steamfast-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steamfast-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steamfast-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steamfast-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steamfast-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steamfast-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steamfast-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steamfast-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Again, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BQRD0I/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Steamfast</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0161N956Y/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PureSteam XL</a> were highly comparable to one another. Either are decent picks, giving about 40 minutes of steam time and effectively steaming your clothes. The tubing is the same, the steam head rests are the same and the power is about the same.</p>
<p>The Steamfast didn’t come with a hanger attachment, which was a non-issue since the head for the pole was the exact same make as the PureSteam and functioned well for placing hangers.</p>
<p>The water tank is clear with small indents for carrying purposes that are not as handy as its competitors but still fairly easy to carry. There was a 60-second heat-up time, and one tank lasted for 40 minutes. Each shirt only required a slow pass with the steam head about one time with some touch ups on problem areas like pockets or collars.</p>
<p>Silk wrinkles were removed with ease, and the head is fairly large and able to cover more surface without being bulky or ineffective. When the tank was about three quarters of the way empty, it started making loud gurgling noises. It didn’t hinder the performance of the steamer, but it did terrify the cat.</p>
<p>The Steamfast only sort of lived up to its name, getting the job done at a moderate pace.</p>
<h3>Shark Press and Refresh GS500</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5750" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shark-press-refresh.jpg" alt="Shark - Press and Refresh" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shark-press-refresh.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shark-press-refresh-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shark-press-refresh-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shark-press-refresh-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shark-press-refresh-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shark-press-refresh-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shark-press-refresh-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shark-press-refresh-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shark-press-refresh-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shark-press-refresh-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>In a steamer, you want dependable and effective, not quirky and difficult to get to know, which is exactly what the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0047E11LC/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark Press and Refresh</a> was. The iron bar is neat but dangerous, and the concept of the press pad is innovative but imperfect.</p>
<p>The Shark Press comes with a vertical press pad, which promises easy set-up on any door. The concept that seems awesome in theory. In actual practice, it’s more or less a hassle. It also comes with a steam bonnet to place over the head of the iron to prevent burns.</p>
<p>The press pads attach using adjustable handle straps that loop around the edges of the door. It doesn’t particularly work on every single door, as some of the doors we tried still graze the top part of the doorframe when open and don’t create enough space for the loop straps to fit around. The strap got stuck once, and we thought we’d have a press pad stuck to our door forever, but it eventually came free.</p>
<p>The steam bonnet takes some fiddling when removed to fit other parts onto it. It takes about three minutes to heat up, and you don’t know it’s ready unless you press the handle, which is the only way to emit steam, unlike the others that steam continually.</p>
<p>The Shark Press takes a lot of getting used to. But once it’s given a few tries, it actually proves itself to be revolutionary: Because of the vertical press pad and leaning against the door, it’s a steamer that can create sharp creases. It has a lot of steaming power and was able to de-wrinkle shirts with ease, and the wrinkle remover acted basically as a quasi-iron. That being said, acting as what’s basically a tiny iron bar, it gets hot. Very hot &#8212; if you accidentally touched it, you’d get burned.</p>
<p>It gives 25 minutes of steam time, likely attributed to the press trigger that allows you to choose when you want to steam.</p>
<p>If you’re into bells and whistles, this is a viable option, but overall gave an average performance. It’s not a walk in the park to set up, and takes some skill to start using to its full effect. It was reminiscent of a good ol’ regular iron.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MG2OOHK/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PurSteam</a> was decent, but nothing makes it really stand out. It steams your clothes and gets the wrinkles out. It’s a little shaky and can crackle occasionally but works well enough.</p>
<p>If you like big, silver heat-resistant mittens, the PurSteam comes with one to protect your hands while ironing. This was a thoughtful inclusion, but we didn’t find it necessary.</p>
<p>The heating chamber is clear, and the bubbles can be seen while the device is heating up. It took two minutes for the steam to get hot, and once it became useable, the boiling of the water shook the device a noticeable amount. It calmed down after one minute of use with the occasional crackling noise.</p>
<p>The steam head dribbled a small amount of water from the holes at first, which created some water spots on the shirts if the fabric was touched. It took a few passes on a cotton dress shirt, which was fully steamed in about eight minutes. In all, it gave 10 minutes of steaming time on one fill.</p>
<p>The PurSteam did decently well with drapes, gliding up and down and removing wrinkles with two passes. Still, it’s probably not the purchase for a perfectionist because of the average amount of steam power.</p>
<h3>Conair ExtremeSteam</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5751" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/conair-extremesteam.jpg" alt="Conair - ExtremeSteam" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/conair-extremesteam.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/conair-extremesteam-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/conair-extremesteam-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/conair-extremesteam-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/conair-extremesteam-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/conair-extremesteam-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/conair-extremesteam-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/conair-extremesteam-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/conair-extremesteam-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/conair-extremesteam-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Because of its lower power and ineffectiveness, we do not recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006CR9KGA/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair ExtremeSteam</a>, no matter how cool it looks. You’ll spend a lot of time getting frustrated and not a lot of time actually ironing your clothes, so we’d opt out on this choice.</p>
<p>The ExtremeSteam is definitely a looker, slightly resembling the Star Trek Enterprise. And like a ship, it’s big; it’s probably not the steamer you want to take along with you on your travels. It comes with a fabric brush, creaser and soft cushion brush.</p>
<p>Filling the tiny water tank on this unit is difficult. When it’s plugged in, it starts buzzing loudly and steam initially dribbled out the front. The steamer has a lock on the trigger to allow you to decide if you want constant steam, or to be able to press the trigger down and only have it steam when pressed. It also has a high and a low heat setting.</p>
<p>Here’s the bad news, the low-heat setting was like feeling the steam coming off a cooling cup of coffee. The high-heat setting wasn’t better. It eventually ironed out wrinkles but took a very long time. The head attachments weren’t effective either, as they would have required more power and hot steam to work.</p>
<p>When it was done steaming &#8212; as though it was breathing a huge sigh of relief &#8212; it whooshed out one last puff of air and then was done. It lasted about 15 minutes. The Conair ExtremeSteam would be elected most creative for senior superlatives, but it’s not the steamer you want to buy for the sake of functionality.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>We’ve got to hand it to Jiffy &#8211; their steamers are impressive. For a standing steamer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000665TD/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jiffy J-2000</a> powered through garments like no others, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018ZHHS4/?tag=ybdstmr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jiffy ESTEAM</a> performed just as well in the handheld class. Get anything Jiffy and your clothes will look like new. You want steam power, a simple, no hassle experience and quality, that’s what Jiffy will give you.</p>
<p>In general, with a few exceptions, most of the steamers we tested worked. You’ll want to hold off on buying from Conair and Shark, but the others will do the job if you’re not picky. Still, we recommend Jiffy for the best of the best.</p>
<p>Standing steamers are your go-to for big projects and lots of work. They’re not stored as easily as handheld steamers, so keep that in mind when deciding. If you are looking to save some space, then look to handhelds.</p>
<p>While ironing is definitely a chore, steaming actually was strangely entertaining in a way. So if you’re looking for an alternative to ironing, give one of these a try; you won’t be disappointed.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent more than 45 hours on research and in-home testing to determine which of the top-rated laundry detergents on the market outperformed the rest. Our findings lead us to recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JC60526/?tag=ybdlaun-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tide &#8211; Coldwater Clean</a> as the best laundry detergent available. It made our clothes come out brighter and smelling terrific, and best of all, this was achieved by washing in cold water. We found that Tide Coldwater gives the most bang for your buck.</p>

<p>Our research phase began by checking out online reviews from retailers like Amazon.com, reading through blog articles and subreddits like /r/howtodolaundry, and watching YouTube video reviews. This gave us an idea of what consumers look for in a laundry detergent, so we could form some key metrics to use for comparison. It also allowed us to narrow down a vast selection of laundry detergents to eight finalists.</p>
<p>Then we delved into the <a href="http://www.cleaninginstitute.org/laundry-basics/">science</a> behind laundry detergent in order to decide which tests would help us determine the best laundry detergent. Last but not least, we headed to the laundry room with our eight finalists and loads of dirty clothes that included sheets, towels, and the toughest of all laundry tasks &#8212; toddler laundry. In this way, we could see how well each detergent handled food stains and ground-in dirt, while keeping our sheets soft and our towels absorbent.</p>

<h2 class="collapse">Why use laundry detergent</h2>
<p>By itself, water alone will not remove oil and grease from clothing because oil and grease repel water molecules. This is why we need to add laundry detergent. Laundry detergent contains surfactants, which help the water pull away dirt and grease, break it up, and wash it away. Surfactants do another job too. They hold soils and fabric dyes in suspension and prevent them from being redeposited back onto the cleaned laundry.</p>
<p>Laundry detergents remove soils and stains from clothing, but they also disinfect, deodorize, freshen, and brighten fabrics as they clean. The end result are clothes and fabrics that look better and last longer.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="what-to-look">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5082" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/detergent-features.jpg" alt="detergent feature comparison chart" width="901" height="718" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/detergent-features.jpg 901w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/detergent-features-610x486.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/detergent-features-768x612.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/detergent-features-300x239.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/detergent-features-295x235.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/detergent-features-885x705.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/detergent-features-360x287.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/detergent-features-375x299.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/detergent-features-414x330.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/detergent-features-320x255.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><strong>Cost-effective:</strong> Americans wash <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rainer_Stamminger/publication/225802892_Electricity_and_water_consumption_for_laundry_washing_by_washing_machine_worldwide/links/546b42d00cf2397f7831b8eb.pdf">300 to 390 loads</a> of laundry a year on average. Switching from a premium-priced to a more inexpensive detergent can help you save $50 a year. If you live in a larger household with more laundry, the savings can be even greater.</p>
<p><strong>Versatile:</strong> A laundry detergent that is effective in all temperatures gives you the option to wash your clothes in cold water without sacrificing cleanliness. Generally available at the same price point, detergents formulated to wash in cold water save energy, prevent shrinking and fading and keep dark clothes from bleeding dye onto lighter items. Cold water detergents can also be used in warm and hot water, so you can change temperatures without needing to change detergents.</p>
<p><strong>Sensitive skin:</strong> Dyes and fragrances can cause rashes and skin allergies in certain individuals. Dye- and perfume-free laundry detergents (which often have the phrase &#8220;free and clear&#8221; on the label) are the best to use if you have sensitive skin or baby laundry to do.</p>
<p><strong>Eco-friendly:</strong> All chemicals are added to detergents for a specific purpose, but some companies position themselves as eco-friendly. They avoid chemicals that are categorized as potentially harmful to our health and environment by the Environmental Protection Agency and/or the <a href="http://www.ewg.org/">Environmental Working Group</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Scent:</strong> A lingering scent on your clean clothes tends to be a love it or hate it option. The best smelling laundry detergent for one person may be overpowering and unpleasant for another. When it comes to laundry detergent, you have lots of choices, from free and clear to heavily scented.</p>
<p><strong>HE safe:</strong> If you have a front-loading washer or high-efficiency top-loader, you’ll want to use a detergent specifically labeled for high-efficiency (HE) machines.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="how-do-laundry">How do laundry detergents work?</h2>
<p>Laundry detergents are made up of surfactants and builders. We went into detail about types of stains and how to remove them on our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-laundry-stain-remover/">laundry stain remover review</a>. Here’s a quick chemistry lesson to explain how surfactants (short for “surface active agents”) are the most important part of any cleaning agent.</p>
<p>Surfactants are long molecules with a water-loving (hydrophilic) head and a grease-loving (hydrophobic) tail. The attractive forces between the head and water cause the grease to be lifted from the surface, surrounded by detergent molecules, and washed away by the water. Surfactants reduce the surface tension of water so that a cleaning solution can better penetrate the clothes and loosen particles and soil.</p>
<p>There are different types of surfactants that can be found in laundry detergents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mineral based</li>
<li>Synthetic</li>
<li>Plant based</li>
</ul>
<p>Builders enhance the efficiency of the surfactant, primarily by reducing the hardness of the water. They also maintain alkalinity, which helps to remove acidic, fatty and oily soils, and keeps soils from redepositing during the wash cycle.</p>
<p>According to a professor at the <a href="https://www.eng.umd.edu/~nsw/ench485/lab2.htm">University of Maryland</a>, half of the liquid laundry detergents on the market use enzymes in conjunction with surfactants. While not necessary, enzymes are especially effective in removing protein from clothes.</p>
<p>Detergents usually only contain one type of enzyme, though some have two or three. Proteases are effective on protein-based stains such as blood or egg, amylases help break down starch-based stains, and lipases break down fats and grease. Enzymes occur naturally in our environments and work in the same way as enzymes do in the body.</p>
<p>Optical brighteners are used to make the fabric look whiter by increasing the overall amount of blue light reflected. In the past, bluing was used to achieve the same effect. Instead of a blue dye, optical brighteners deposit reflective particles onto fabrics. Some brighteners can cause allergic reactions to those with sensitive skin, but for most, it isn’t a problem.</p>
<p>There is some concern that optical brighteners have a negative environmental impact, but the Environmental Protection Agency lists several optical brighteners on their <a href="https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/safer-ingredients">Safer Chemical Ingredients List</a>, and categorizes them as “not associated with a low level of hazard concern for all human health and environmental endpoints”. Since optical brighteners decompose relatively slowly and have fluorescent properties, they do serve as an useful indicator in pollution screening.</p>
<p>Some companies, such as <a href="http://www.seventhgeneration.com/product-science/why-we-wont-use-artificial-brighteners">Seventh Generation</a>, <a href="https://www.ecover.com/global/faq/does-ecover-use-optical-brighteners/">Ecover</a> and <a href="http://biokleenhome.com/faqs/">Biokleen</a> make it a company policy not to use optical brighteners.</p>

<h3>Liquid detergent</h3>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Liquids dissolve better in both warm and cold water, making them more energy efficient. They work well on food, grease and oils. As liquids, they are also good for pretreating stains.</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong>: <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2013/03/confusing-laundry-caps-can-lead-to-overdosing/index.htm">Consumer Reports</a> found that confusing markings on caps (meant to indicate different load sizes and machine types) can cause you to use too much detergent, leading to wasted detergent and longer rinse cycles.</p>
<h3>Powder detergent</h3>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Surfactants are more stable in powders, so they have a longer shelf life than liquid detergents. This means you can buy in bulk (which saves money and cuts down on excess packaging) without it becoming ineffective over time. They are especially effective on ground-in dirt, making them ideal for children’s play clothes.</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong>: Powders dissolve better in warm water, which uses more energy than cold water. If not measured correctly, it can also leave behind residue.</p>
<h2 class="collapse">What is hard water?</h2>
<p>Hard water contains minerals such as calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn). According to the <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/hardness.html">U.S. Geological Survey</a>, hard water is not a health concern, but it can cause detergents to perform poorly and shorten the life of fabric and clothes. It affects 85% of households in the United States and is an important consideration when choosing a detergent, because the minerals chemically interact with the surfactants in detergents, making them less effective.</p>
<p>If you suspect that you have hard water, you can take a sample to be tested at your local pet supply or pool supply store. It’s also easy to test yourself with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DIJ0W30/?tag=ybdlaun-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">water strip test</a>. It’s best to test the water directly out of your washer, and to test both your cold and hot water since hot water heaters can produce a higher mineral content. The strip tests for hardness from 0 to 1,000 ppm (parts per million), and you can refer to the <a href="https://www.wqa.org/Learn-About-Water/Perceptible-Issues/Scale-Deposits">degree of hardness standard</a> as established by the American Society of Agricultural Engineers and the Water Quality Association to determine if and how you need to treat your water.</p>
<p>If you find you do have hard water, you can treat it by adding a water softener to your wash cycle. For slightly or moderately hard water, you may want to add half a cup to three fourths of a cup of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003Y5AQGQ?tag=ybdlaun-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Borax</a> water softener to your laundry. For very hard water, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CNJREKK/?tag=ybdlaun-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Calgon</a> water softener is recommended as it targets a wider range of minerals.</p>

<p>High efficiency washing machines are gaining in popularity because they use less water, spin faster, and get clothes cleaner than traditional washing machines. The savings in water (up to 66%) and therefore, energy (up to 50%) translates to both long-term cost savings and environmental benefits.</p>
<p>Since HE washing machines work in a completely different way than a traditional washing machine, it’s important to choose an HE laundry detergent for use in one. While you may have heard that it’s okay to “use less” of a non-HE detergent, this is problematic for several reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional laundry detergents can impact proper cleaning by creating a cushion of excess suds between the surfactants and the soil, which prevents the detergent from being able to grab the soil and remove it.</li>
<li>The use of a non-HE detergent in your HE machine mashing can invalidate the warranty.</li>
<li>The soil can’t be removed without the appropriate levels of detergent, leaving you with dirty clothes. (You should always use the recommended amount based on the size of your load. The detergent may also specify different volumes for HE and traditional washers.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to low water levels in an HE washer during the wash and rinse cycles, HE detergents must work differently from traditional laundry detergents. They are formulated to be low-sudsing and quick-dispersing to make the most of your HE washer. They also need to be able to hold soils in low water volumes, so they don’t redeposit onto your clean clothes.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="diy-laundry-detergent">DIY laundry detergents</h2>
<p>You’ve seen the tutorials for DIY laundry detergent all over Pinterest. For budget-minded and environmentally-conscious consumers, you have to admit they look pretty appealing. They use only a few simple ingredients that you can easily pronounce, and can be as cheap as $.02 per load. If they truly live up to their claims, they’d be the most cost-effective and eco-friendly option out there, but how well do they really work?</p>
<p>After taking a closer look at the recipes, we found that DIY laundry detergents don’t live up to the hype. It’s one of those cases where if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. The problem has to do with using soap.</p>
<p>Most homemade detergents call for a combination of:</p>
<p><strong>Water softeners:</strong> Borax, washing soda and baking soda are generally recommended to soften hard water, which allows the cleaning agent to pull out and trap soil. It’s worth noting that baking soda doesn’t actually soften water, but it may work as a booster.</p>
<p><strong>Boosters:</strong> While <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-laundry-stain-remover/">we highly recommend OxiClean</a> as an oxygen-based stain remover, boosters like OxiClean or OxoBrite are intended to aid a cleaning agent in whitening or stain removal, not replace it.</p>
<p><strong>Soap:</strong> Some recipes don’t even contain a cleaning agent at all. Most call for you to grate or melt soaps like Fels Naptha (meant for pre-treating stains), castile soaps or other various soaps into the detergent.</p>
<p>While water softeners and boosters make sense in a laundry detergent, the ratio of booster to cleaning agent (soap) in these recipes leaves you with a large proportion of ingredients meant to be additives and which give you very little actual cleaning power.</p>
<p>However, the real issue with DIY laundry detergents is that soap uses <a href="http://www.cleaninginstitute.org/clean_living/soaps__detergents_chemistry.aspx">oil-based surfactants</a> which don’t rinse clean from cloth fibers. Because it does not rinse away easily, soap can leave visible residue on your clothing and the inside of your washing machine. Just imagine the soap scum that builds up in the shower. Do you really want that in the fibers of your clothes?</p>
<p>Depending on what drew you to use a DIY laundry detergent, you’re better off finding a commercial laundry detergent that meets your needs. For instance, if you like the idea of using a more natural product, a plant-based detergent like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NFM9OPM/?tag=ybdlaun-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ecover &#8211; Zero</a> could work for you. If the low cost factor drew you in, there are several inexpensive options that will help you save money.</p>

<h3>The stain test</h3>

<p>The science behind stains gives you a good idea of how to treat specific stains. For example, proteins like blood and egg are best removed with a protease enzyme to digest protein stains. For a laundry detergent, the goal is to remove the widest variety of soils and stains. Starting with a detergent that is an effective stain remover saves you time and energy. You’ll only need to pre-treat and soak the most stubborn stains.</p>
<p>In order to find out which detergent was the best at removing stains and brightening fabrics in general, we took eight 100% cotton Hanes &#8211; classic t-shirts and stained them with four different types of common stains.</p>
<p><strong>Bleachable:</strong> Since you’re just waking up, the first cup of coffee of the day is bound to end up on your clothes. Coffee (and tea) stains are considered a bleachable stain, which means these stains are removed with an oxidizing agent or bleach.</p>
<p><strong>Oil:</strong> Oils and grease stains usually come from food. Since real life tends to be be more complex than dealing with a simple stain, we created a combination stain of oil and bright dye with a red lip gloss.</p>
<p><strong>Carbohydrate:</strong> You may have noticed that carbohydrate stains such as ketchup seem preternaturally attracted to white t-shirts. We painted our t-shirts with a blob of ketchup to see how well our detergents would remove one of the more prevalent types of stains.</p>
<p><strong>Tannin:</strong> Tannin stains like red wine and fruit juice can be tricky to remove. We applied two tablespoons of red wine to each shirt to see how the detergents would fare.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5081" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stain-removal-results.jpg" alt="stain removal results chart" width="901" height="775" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stain-removal-results.jpg 901w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stain-removal-results-610x525.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stain-removal-results-768x661.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stain-removal-results-300x258.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stain-removal-results-295x254.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stain-removal-results-885x761.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stain-removal-results-360x310.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stain-removal-results-375x323.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stain-removal-results-414x356.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stain-removal-results-320x275.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We let each of the stains set overnight, because realistically, most of us don’t wash our laundry every day and stains on our clothes are most likely to have dried before we get around to washing them out. For the detergents that with formulas that worked in cold water, we washed them in cold water first. Then we washed them a separate time in warm water. The rest of the detergents were washed in warm water.</p>
<p>During the month of testing, we found ourselves gravitating toward <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JC60526/?tag=ybdlaun-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tide &#8211; Coldwater</a> when it came to washing loads with tough stains. It lightened the bleachable and tannin stains and removed the carbohydrate stain, all in a cold water wash. Washing in warm water lightened the stains even further. The other top stain remover was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016BAODG4/?tag=ybdlaun-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wisk &#8211; Deep Clean</a>, which did an excellent job of removing each of our stains in warm water.</p>
<h3>The pH test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5078" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ph-testing-data.jpg" alt="pH testing results" width="901" height="651" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ph-testing-data.jpg 901w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ph-testing-data-610x441.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ph-testing-data-768x555.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ph-testing-data-300x217.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ph-testing-data-295x213.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ph-testing-data-885x639.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ph-testing-data-360x260.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ph-testing-data-375x271.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ph-testing-data-414x299.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ph-testing-data-320x231.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>pH stands for “potential of hydrogen”, and is a measure of the hydrogen ion concentration in a liquid solution. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. A pH of 7 is neutral. The lower the number, the more acidic it is, while the higher it is, the more alkaline it is.</p>
<p>Detergents are more effective when they are alkaline, so we wanted to test the pH of the different detergents using pH strips. We also wanted to see which detergent had the lowest pH level after washing, indicating that the detergent had left behind a minimum of excess laundry detergent.</p>
<p>In order to test this, we measured the correct amount of detergent for a medium-sized load and took a sample of the dissolved water to test its pH level. After the cleaning cycle ended and the rinse cycle began, we obtained another sample of the water and again measured the pH level. We repeated this process for each of our finalist detergents.</p>

<p>Typically, water is normally somewhere between 6.5 and 8.5 on the pH scale. The water coming out of our washer (with no detergent or clothes) tested at a 5.5 pH level, so this is the level we expected to see the second sample return to in an ideal scenario.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001WY7V32/?tag=ybdlaun-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Biokleen</a> was the most alkaline of the detergents we tested, and while this didn’t necessarily translate directly to stain removing potential, it cleans well with the most basic (and pronounceable) ingredients. It was also one of the detergents (along with Tide Coldwater Clean and Wisk Deep Clean) that provided the lowest pH levels during the rinse cycles. This means these detergents had the least amount of excess laundry detergent after the wash cycle.</p>

<p>For most households, choosing a detergent is a matter of finding the most effective at the best deal. We looked at the average prices of our top finalists at online retails giants like Amazon.com, Target.com, and Walmart.com. Then we divided the lowest price option by the number of loads in each bottle to find the cost per load.</p>
<p>The cost per load ranged from .8 to .29 cents per load, with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q8JJ23S/?tag=ybdlaun-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Arm &amp; Hammer &#8211; Clean Burst</a> being the most economical choice. Not far behind was Biokleen Laundry Powder at .11 cents per load. Most of the detergents landed in the .17 to .23 cents per load price range, which gives you several options at the same price point. The most expensive detergent we reviewed was All Free &amp; Clear, a good choice if you don’t mind paying a little more for a premium detergent.</p>
<h2 id="the-best">Best overall: Tide &#8211; Coldwater Clean</h2>

<p>The U.S. Department of Energy reports that 90% of the energy used by clothes washers is for heating the water. In addition to saving money on energy bills, washing in cold water gives better color protection (prevents fading) with less chance of dye transfer onto other clothes. We were really impressed by the ability of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JC60526/?tag=ybdlaun-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tide &#8211; Coldwater Clean</a> to remove stains and brighten clothes in cold water.</p>

<p>Of the three cold-water formulas we tested, Tide &#8211; Coldwater Clean performed the best in cold water conditions. In terms of stain removal, it beat out six of the other detergents and tied with Wisk Deep Clean, which needed warm water to do the job. It can also be used in warm or hot water, making it a versatile option for those who prefer cold water for delicates and warm water for messier clothes.</p>
<p>With 70% of Amazon reviewers and 66% of Walmart buyers who used Tide &#8211; Coldwater rating it five stars, we weren’t alone in our findings. In fact, it was highly rated with consumers who wash cloth diapers for its performance in removing both stains and odors. The negative reviews mainly related to the scent, however, there were a few reports of dye remaining on the clothes. We didn’t experience this, and because the dye is water-soluble, it can be removed with hot water.</p>
<p>If you own a HE washing machine, you’ll appreciate the HE TurboClean technology that P&amp;G introduced in 2015 and is available in the Tide &#8211; Coldwater Clean formula. It uses quick-dissolving suds that prevent HE machines from running additional rinse cycles, which can save up to 10 gallons of water, not to mention your valuable time.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our top stain fighter, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JC60526/?tag=ybdlaun-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tide &#8211; Coldwater Clean</a> not only performed better than the other three cold-water detergents, it removed stains more or equally as effectively as all the detergents we tested in warm water.</li>
<li>An excellent detergent for a middle-of-the-road price, the energy you save by washing in cold water will also reduce your electric bill.</li>
<li>Tide Coldwater Clean features HE TurboClean technology, a proprietary formula that quickly collapses suds and targets tough stains.</li>

<p>Formulated with baking soda, this detergent is designed to power out odors and freshen clothes. It works well on protein-based stains like egg and grass, but struggles with some of the tougher stains. While not the best option for stain removal, it doesn’t cause any unusual wear and tear on fabric, which can often be the case with inexpensive detergents.</p>
<p>One <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nKpb_WzupY">YouTube reviewer</a> suggested Arm &amp; Hammer &#8211; Clean Burst as a good alternative to Tide (which can be pricier), thanks to its fresh scent and ability to get clothes clean without adding boosters or bleaches.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Giving you more detergent for less money, Arm &amp; Hammer is a great option for households that wash multiple loads of laundry each week or just want to save money.</li>
<li>The natural freshening and deodorizing power of baking soda, combined with a lingering scent, make this detergent a great choice for those who love the smell of fresh linen.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the eco-friendly or natural detergents were less effective at removing stains, we couldn’t get enough of how soft our laundry felt after washing it in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NFM9OPM/?tag=ybdlaun-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ecover &#8211; Zero</a> laundry detergent. It contains a plant-based fabric softener that works well on natural fibers but can reduce absorbency in towels. We loved it on our sheets, and it was nice to know that the fabric we had next to our skin all night was washed in a detergent that has met the highest standards for safety and environmental impact.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NFM9OPM/?tag=ybdlaun-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ecover-zero-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ecover-zero-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ecover-zero-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ecover-zero-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ecover-zero-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ecover-zero-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ecover-zero-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ecover-zero-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ecover-zero.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Natural Detergent: Ecover - Zero</h3><p>Safe for you and the environment, it leaves your clothes incredibly soft and fresh-smelling with zero fragrance or chemical dyes.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NFM9OPM/?tag=ybdlaun-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>Ecover scored an A rating in the EWG’s Guide to Healthy Cleaning and has met a thorough list of requirements to be Green Certified by Whole Foods Market. Their ingredient disclosure is good, and the biodegradable formula (made from plant-based ingredients) is packaged in a bottle made with recycled plastic and plastic made from sugarcane.</p>
<p>Not only is Ecover eco-friendly, it’s formulated to be washed in cold water so it’s energy-efficient as well. However, we recommend a warm water wash when you need to remove set in stains.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to EWG, Ecover &#8211; Zero is formulated with few or no known/suspected hazards to health or the environment.</li>
<li>Completely free of fragrance or dyes and tested by dermatologists, this detergent is an excellent choice for those with sensitive skin.</li>
</ul>

<h3>All &#8211; Ultra Free and Clear</h3>
<p>A premium detergent, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UATIX0U/?tag=ybdlaun-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">All &#8211; Free and Clear</a> is highly recommended by reviewers for those with sensitive skin. It has been awarded the NEA Seal of Acceptance by the National Eczema Association, and removes everyday and seasonal allergens such as pet dander, dust mite matter, and pollen. Even without a harsh formula, it still rated well in our stain removal test. Some consumers balked at the cost, but for those with sensitive skin, it was well worth the price.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UATIX0U/?tag=ybdlaun-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="" data-srcset="" width="" height="" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>For Sensitive Skin: All - Ultra-Free and Clear</h3><p>Great for users with sensitive skin, and does a good job removing tough stains without a harsh formula.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UATIX0U/?tag=ybdlaun-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>It does contain sodium cocoate, which reduces allergens in clothing, but is a soap that can build up at too high a concentration. It’s also a no go for absorbent items like towels, since it can coat fibers and cause water repelling issues when you later use it to dry off. It also contains optical brighteners, which may cause issues for those with sensitivities.</p>
<h3>Biokleen &#8211; Free &amp; Clear Laundry Powder</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001WY7V32/?tag=ybdlaun-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Biokleen</a> is another eco-friendly choice that scored an A rating on EWG’s Guide to Healthy Cleaning, indicating the lowest concern for suspected hazards to health or the environment.</p>
<p>All Biokleen products are free of chlorine bleach, synthetic colors, or artificial fragrances, and the Free &amp; Clear is the company’s most popular option. It is formulated with a basic set of ingredients such as sodium carbonate, surfactant, and hydrogen peroxide, and Biokleen has received kudos for their good ingredient disclosure.</p>
<p>As a powder detergent, Biokleen does not dissolve in cold water (it could leave white streaks) and like the other eco friendly detergents we tried, it doesn’t fully remove stains. However, as the most inexpensive of the eco-friendly detergents we tested (and second most inexpensive of all our finalists), it’s a practical choice for those looking to protect their health and the waterways.</p>
<h3>Gain &#8211; Icy Fresh Oxi Boost</h3>
<p>With the cleaning power of Oxi (oxygen bleach) and a lingering scent that locks in to keep your clothes smelling fresh longer, reviewers on Walmart.com nearly unanimously gave <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ITOINB2/?tag=ybdlaun-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gain &#8211; Icy Fresh Oxi Boost</a> a five-star rating. It is optimized for use with cold water, and the clothes we tested came out clean and bright, although it didn’t remove stains as well as the Tide Coldwater.</p>
<p>The selling point for most purchasers is the Icy Fresh Fizz scent, which is described as clean and invigorating, and the Oxi Boost, which helps to get clothes brighter without the need for hot water. It also contains enzymes, so this detergent is especially effective on bleachable and protein stains.</p>
<h3>Seventh Generation &#8211; Free &amp; Clear</h3>
<p>Of the three eco-friendly laundry detergents we reviewed, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002KCGATG/?tag=ybdlaun-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Seventh Generation</a> was the best at removing stains and freshening clothes. Although it does not contain optical brighteners, dyes, fragrance, or phosphates, it only scored a C rating from EWG due to its use of methylisothiazolinone. On the other hand, it has met the Environmental Protection Agency’s Safer Choice Standards since 2009.</p>
<p>Balancing green certification with a decent stain-fighting ability and a reasonable price, this detergent is a good option for those who want an eco-friendly detergent that doesn’t require extra pretreating steps.</p>
<h3>Wisk &#8211; Deep Clean</h3>
<p>If we were to choose a runner-up for the best laundry detergent, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016BAODG4/?tag=ybdlaun-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wisk &#8211; Deep Clean</a> would be our pick. It was excellent at removing stains, left our clothes smelling great, and reasonably priced at only .17 cents per load.</p>
<p>Amazon users who purchased the product agreed, with 80% giving it a five-star rating. They loved how well it breaks down grime and grease, and lingering (but not overpowering) scent. It’s specially formulated to wash out trapped body oils and sweat in your clothes, leaving you with a deep clean that goes beyond visible stains.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>When it comes to dirty laundry, buyers look for a detergent that balances performance and price. Tide &#8211; Coldwater Clean comes in as our top choice for its ability to brighten clothes and lighten tough stains and at a price that compares with most of the other detergents we reviewed. While Wisk &#8211; Deep Clean was also a great stain remover, once we factored in the energy savings and versatility of Tide &#8211; Coldwater Clean, it was our clear winner.</p>

<h2 id="finding-the-finalists">Finding the finalists</h2>
<p>You’ve been there before: you sit at the coffee shop across from a friend when your elbow slips on the table. Suddenly you’re wearing your latte on your favorite pants.</p>
<p>It is a common memory for most of us: a mother, pre-treating stains on the knees of our pants, scrubbing at the material with a toothbrush, or the scolding remark, “Your clothes are not napkins.” Even as adults, we’ve all lost a favorite, treasured item to a forgotten spill after it’s been through the washer and dryer.</p>
<p>But it is difficult to find the time and patience to scrub stains with a toothbrush. That’s why, in preparation for this article, we spent more than 30 hours researching stains, fabrics and stain removers with ease and effectiveness in mind.</p>
<p>In order to find the best stain remover, it was necessary to understand the science behind stains. What causes color to stick to material? Why are some stains more stubborn than others? And what role do fabrics play in the treating process?</p>
<p>Once we were fully researched on the chemistry of stains, we moved onto understanding stain removers. Which have a positive reputation? What chemicals are used? How does each product work? Do the products perform better on certain stains than on others? Are most stain removers similar in design?</p>
<h2 id="why-stain-remover">Why you should use a stain remover</h2>
<p>In order to know which stain removers work the best, we first have to know what they are up against.</p>
<p>Stains are chemical reactions. Rather than resting on top of clothing and other fabrics, food, liquids and countless substances that stain actually bind to the surface of material fibers.</p>
<p>The naturally occurring elements in most food and drink are hardwired to bind and stick to objects on a molecular level. Sometimes clothes are stained by substances designed to stain and pigment, like inks and dyes, which also chemically bind.</p>
<p>Additionally, stains are both complex and sensitive. Aside from the interactions that occur between the staining substance and material, any change in temperature or additional substances — like water, for instance — can change the chemical bond that occurs in a stain, rendering it worse.</p>
<p>Coffee spills cause stains because of its composition of tannins and heat. This is why you should be particular about washing certain stains in hot or cold water. Similarly, you should avoid drying anything that is stained because the hot temperature can worsen a stain alone. Because of their difficulty, some textiles are manufactured to be stain-resistant.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3328" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laundry-pile.jpg" alt="pile of dirty clothing" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laundry-pile.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laundry-pile-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laundry-pile-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laundry-pile-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laundry-pile-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laundry-pile-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laundry-pile-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laundry-pile-180x119.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laundry-pile-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Which substances cause stains?</h3>
<p>Tannins are an organically occurring substance in nature. Tannins are astringents and make up part of that bitter taste in wine or tea. It has the effect of either drying out one’s mouth or giving a mouth-puckering sensation. Food and drink such as berries, cocoa, wine, beer, tea and coffee contain tannins.</p>
<p>When an oily substance hits fabric, the molecules bind to the surface material in the same way tannins do. However, because it is not water soluble (like the familiar cliche, “oil and water don’t mix”), a simple run through the washing machine won’t successfully break up the stain. Oil and fat-based stains like butter, olive oil, and grease can be especially stubborn on fabrics.</p>
<p>Similarly, protein-based stains (including blood, grass, and milk) are not water-soluble, and therefore require the introduction of another chemical to sever their bond to fabric. Unseasoned meat tenderizers can even be helpful in breaking up the protein in a stain.</p>
<p>Lastly, dye-based stains adhere to materials because of the pigments and dyes necessary to create color in products like ink, paint and hair dye.</p>
<p>To complicate matters further, most stains are not only tannin stains or only oil stains; rather, they are a mixture of multiple chemical bond reactions. For instance, if someone spills a cup of coffee mixed with cream, the stain reaction is a combination of tannins, protein, and heat.</p>
<p>Furthermore, other substances, such as sugar or acid, increase the chance of staining, because they eat away at surfaces. This is why white wine stains.</p>

<h2 id="different-stain-removers">Why different stain removers exist</h2>
<p>The purpose of a stain remover is to break up the chemical reaction that created a stain. Because stains occur in many shapes, sizes, colors, and compositions, there are numerous types of stain removers on the market. Each product contains multiple chemicals and even more combinations of these chemicals with the intent to treat the reactions that occur in a single spill. Different ingredients treat tannin, oil, protein, and dye-based stains.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3399 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stain-remover_ingredients-1.png" width="880" height="624" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stain-remover_ingredients-1.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stain-remover_ingredients-1-610x433.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stain-remover_ingredients-1-360x255.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stain-remover_ingredients-1-375x266.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stain-remover_ingredients-1-414x294.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stain-remover_ingredients-1-295x209.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stain-remover_ingredients-1-180x128.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stain-remover_ingredients-1-320x227.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Tannin stains</h3>
<p>To combat tannin stains, one should search for a detergent that oxidizes the stain. In layman’s terms, this means the stain remover interacts with the molecules to remove colorization but does not necessarily get rid of the stain.</p>
<p>This can be done with oxygen-based or bleach-based treatments. Hydrogen peroxide is a well-known oxidizing agent that, unlike bleach, doesn’t irritate eyes, throats, and lungs. Dye-based stains are the most difficult stains to get rid of and will most likely require a tough bleach to resolve.</p>
<h3>Protein-based stains</h3>
<p>When working with protein-based stains, seek a stain remover that has an enzyme-based agent. Enzymes are biological catalysts, which means that they either speed up or change a chemical reaction. When you use an enzyme-based agent, the enzyme enters the stain and breaks up the non-water soluble molecules into smaller, more soluble molecules.</p>
<h3>Oil and fat-based stains</h3>
<p>When dealing with an oil or fat-based stain, surfactants make the stain more water soluble too, but not by breaking up the molecules into smaller ones like enzyme-based treatments. Instead, they lower the surface tension between the stain and the material so the oil and fat molecules can be dissolved.</p>
<p>The trick here is to match your stain remover to the stain. Though stain removing products don’t always print the ingredients on the bottle, they do seem to mention most of the active ingredients, and a quick online search can assist one in finding out if it is the solution you need.</p>
<h3>Which fabrics are more sensitive to treatment?</h3>
<p>The final element to consider when treating stains is the stained fabric or material itself.</p>
<p>All stain remover instructions recommend that you test the colorfastness of an item before using the product on it. This way, you find out if the dyes used in your clothing will be ruined during the stain-removing process.</p>
<p>Oxidizing agents, like bleach, are a big threat to non-colorfast materials because they work by removing coloring agents of a stain, and will also remove the dye. Even subtle colors like those used in khakis can be affected by laundry stain removers.</p>
<p>In addition to being colorfast, make sure that the fabric to be treated is not dry clean only. Silk, velvet, wool, leather, taffeta, and other delicate fabrics might not react well to the water in the stain remover, shrinking or changing texture along with the stain treatment.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-chose">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>After hours of researching online articles and scouring customer reviews, we compiled a list of seven products to test in-house. These items had the most consistent, positive reviews on Amazon and Google, and are of well-known name brands in the laundry industry.</p>
<p>The highest rated products are advertised to work on the widest variety of stains: tannins, oils, proteins, and dyes. This is evident in the names of many of the products; for example, “oxy” stands for oxygen-based and “enzyme” represents protein stain fighters.</p>
<p>Our research also showed that customers favor stain removers that come in a spray bottle for convenient application, or fabric pens for on-the-go application. An added benefit for all of the products is the ability to work quickly while requiring a minimal amount of effort.</p>

<p>In order to test the effectiveness of each stain remover, we decided to test four different stains: chocolate, wine, coffee, and ink. These stains are both common and representatives of the different types of stains.</p>
<p>Ink is dye-based with added pigments. Coffee and wine both contain tannins. Chocolate hazelnut spread is a trifecta of staining agents: tannins, oil, and protein. In addition, the sugar in wine and chocolate adds to the difficulty because of its ability to eat away at the fabric with which it’s bound.</p>
<p>We chose plain, white cotton fabric so as not to complicate the study with the science of fabrics and colorfastness. White cotton is one of the easiest fabrics to stain, and stained white fabric is perhaps the most obviously destroyed. We splashed the fronts of seven shirts with the four staining substances and then hung them to dry and set-in for a week.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3330" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stained-shirt.jpg" alt="stained shirt" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stained-shirt.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stained-shirt-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stained-shirt-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stained-shirt-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stained-shirt-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stained-shirt-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stained-shirt-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stained-shirt-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stained-shirt-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stained-shirt-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>A week later, before we tested each product, we added fresh stains of the same substances to the backs of the shirts. We completed the pre-wash treatment process for each product according to the instructions on each label. These processes varied from five minutes to six hours.</p>
<p>Then, we washed each shirt with the same laundry detergent, as to avoid bias. We also washed each shirt with a different load of laundry so that the effectiveness of the remover wasn’t cross-contaminated by another in the same load. Then, we dried each shirt in the dryer.</p>

<p>Our selection for the best overall stain remover is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005GI8UOO/?tag=ybdstn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OxiClean &#8211; Versatile Stain Remover</a>. It worked better than any of the other products we tested on each of the four different stain types.</p>
<p>The oxygen-based stain remover successfully eliminated the most difficult of substances from white cotton shirts without damaging the fabric. Time is not the enemy of this super-charged stain remover; it worked even on week-old, set-in stains.</p>
<p>The powdered product started off the test ahead of all the others. First, it comes in a 7.22-pound box, which can treat 156 loads for about $12 dollars. That works out to seven cents a load — and that’s if you&#8217;re treating an entire load. If you only used it for spot removal, the product would last much longer.</p>
<p>The next benefit of this product, which is alluded to in its name, is its versatility. There are instructions on the box for use with loads of laundry, spot cleaning, soft surfaces (such as upholstery), and hard surfaces (like grout and patio furniture). While the box is large, it can easily replace several cleaning products one might currently own.</p>

We think it's the best laundry stain cleaner on the market and can replace several products in the laundry room.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005GI8UOO/?tag=ybdstn-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>OxiClean is also easy to use in most cases. When researching stain removal, many blogs and articles discussed the importance of pretreating a stain by scrubbing or sponging. Scrubbing is that can potentially damage fabric, while tedious sponging relies on complicated methods like back-sponging and front-sponging for different stains. But the informative instructions on the back of the OxiClean box offers one set of instructions for any type of stain: soak for best results.</p>
<p>We filled a clean sink with one gallon of cold water, filled the scoop up to the second line with the product (though you can fill the scoop as high as the sixth line), added it to the water, allowed the powder to dissolve, and put in a cotton shirt stained with one-week of coffee, wine, ink, and chocolate on the front, and fresh stains on the back. The shirt soaked for six hours.</p>
<p>Using hot water can also help treat the fabric depending on the stains, but make sure not to let things soak for longer than six hours — it could potentially start to damage the fabric. The instructions also advise to check for colorfastness of materials, but the product should be safe on all colors.</p>
<p>Note: Do not let the solution soak into your skin for a long time, since it can cause severe drying and cracking. Gloves are recommended for a long spot-treating session.</p>
<p>The water turned slightly murky brown from the combination of fresh chocolate, tannins, and ink released from the fabric. It bubbled at first and turned an odd tint of green, but by the end of the six hours, the water was mostly clear. Amazingly, all of the stains were completely gone — both old and new — except for the one-week-old ink stain, which faded to a light shadow of what it was before.</p>
<p>Another benefit of this product is that after pre-soaking, one can add the stained product to the wash, or use another detergent for a second application. Unfortunately, in our test, this did not get rid of the ink completely, but it came very close with minimal effort. Giving the stain a second soak in the OxiClean would have done the trick.</p>

<p>What this means is that even though OxiClean is an oxygen-based stain remover and should work best on stains caused by coffee and wine (tannins), it successfully broke down dyes and the complex chocolate spread stain with protein and oil, as well.</p>
<p>Though articles and websites boast about using the right solvent for the right stain, it seems like OxiClean is the right solvent for most stains.</p>

<h2 id="best-quick-fix">Best quick fix: Tide &#8211; To-Go Liquid Pen</h2>
<p>Though the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C3NAT16/?tag=ybdstn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tide &#8211; To-Go Liquid Pen</a> didn’t work the best on any stain, the portable design is convenient and easy to use for taking care of spills as soon as they happen. None of the other products are small enough to carry in a purse or a pocket, or can be used while you are still wearing the stained garment.</p>
<p>Further, using a Tide Pen appears to be a useful pre-treatment option, when finding somewhere to soak or spray your clothing is not an option.</p>
<h2 id="best-for-fabric">Gentlest on fabric: Shout &#8211; Advanced Gel</h2>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HXCNL90/?tag=ybdstn-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shout-advanced-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shout-advanced-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shout-advanced-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shout-advanced-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shout-advanced-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shout-advanced-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shout-advanced-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shout-advanced-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shout-advanced.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Gentlest on Fabric: Shout - Advanced Gel</h3><p>Shout is gentle enough to leave on fabric overnight for extra tough stains without damaging your favorite clothes.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HXCNL90/?tag=ybdstn-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Though it didn’t work the best on the chocolate stain, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HXCNL90/?tag=ybdstn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shout</a> is the best treatment to use when concerned about damaging fabrics. The instructions did warn about colorfastness with khaki, but it was the only product that suggested leaving the product on the stain overnight without concern to your fabric.</p>
<p>By comparison, OxiClean suggests that you don’t leave it on a garment for more than six hours, because it can start to damage the fabric. One should still be careful not to use the product on dry-clean-only clothing, but if you’re doing laundry late at night, leaving Shout on a stain overnight is a risk-free treatment.</p>
<h2 id="the-others">Other finalists we tested</h2>

<p>The other products we tested were of different stain-treating compounds and popular brands. These included Clorox &#8211; OxyMagic, Grandma’s Secret, Resolve Max (now more commonly sold as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004X1VR72/?tag=ybdstn-20">Spray N&#8217; Wash Max</a>), Shout Advanced, Tide to Go Instant Liquid Stain Remover, and Zout &#8211; Triple Enzyme Formula. Our research told us these would be the most effective, reliable products and ranked comparably to OxiClean.</p>
<p>While browsing the products on Amazon, it became clear how great a bargain <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005GI8UOO/?tag=ybdstn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OxiClean</a> is. These products all came in spray bottles or pens, varying between 14 to 22 oz, and cost anywhere from eight to 11 dollars. While OxiClean could launder up to 156 loads, none of these other products could successfully clean 156 stains.</p>
<p>For example, a 3-pack of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C3NAT16/?tag=ybdstn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tide</a> pens cost 10 dollars and contains only an ounce of stain removing fluid. None of the products were as versatile as the winner, which was the only one that claimed to work on non-fabric stains like grout.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that small packaging means limited room for instructions. None of these products offered the soaking option, and none indicated that you should scrub the fabric first to break the substance from the material.</p>
<p>Though pre-treating seems to be the essential step in stain removal, these products all suggested the same method: spray on the remover, let it sit for five to ten minutes, and wash (besides <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HXCNL90/?tag=ybdstn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shout gel</a>, which said one could let it penetrate overnight and then wash, which we did).</p>
<p>All of the products said to check for colorfastness, though Spray N&#8217; Wash Max and Shout gel said outright that they should not be used on khaki. All the products said that if the stain didn’t come out on the first try one should reapply.</p>
<p>Shout refers to their website on the back of the bottle in case a buyer wants to know more about using the product. In this instance, I see the benefit in OxiClean’s large box — no extra searching is required to know how to use the product.</p>

<p>For those products that require spray, it takes quite a few sprays to saturate a stain larger than a golf ball, so that the solvent can soak through the fabric. Any surface underneath the fabric is then covered in a slimy, filmy residue.</p>
<p>Of course, five to ten minutes is a smaller time frame for the pre-treating process, which makes the other products appear easier than OxiClean. Unfortunately, these products did not measure up to the simple soak that OxiClean offered in ease or effectiveness.</p>
<p>Spending less time treating the fabric before washing proved to be a huge problem in the results of this study, in that none of the products besides OxiClean removed a stain entirely in one treatment, regardless of whether they were fresh or set-in. For the fresh stains, all products besides OxiClean left behind a very light or partial stain, and for the set-in stains, the remnants were darker depending on the product.</p>
<p>It was surprising that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000QR94VI/?tag=ybdstn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zout &#8211; Triple Enzyme Formula</a> couldn’t remove the chocolate stain as well as OxiClean despite being manufactured to knock out proteins. And though the other products, like Spray N&#8217; Wash Max and Clorox &#8211; Oxymagic, include oxidizing and surfactant agents, the combination of efforts couldn’t beat any of the stains completely.</p>
<p>Though cleaning products don’t have to list all of the ingredients on the bottle, a little research gave us the following information about the chemical makeup of stain removers:</p>
<p>If we were to rank the products, second place would go to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HXCNL90/?tag=ybdstn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shout &#8211; Advanced Gel</a>, which worked second best on all of the stains besides chocolate. (Zout was a close third; the stains were just slightly darker). To us, this seems like it has something to do with the pre-treatment process of letting the product sit on the stain overnight — which is the only clear similarity between the products, besides their ability to oxidize a stain.</p>
<p>While a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C3NAT16/?tag=ybdstn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tide pen</a> is convenient for instant-stain prevention (besides ink!), in terms of price and effectiveness, a buyer should weigh his or her needs. The Tide pen costs more money for less product, but can be used conveniently and quickly.</p>

<h2 id="Best-practices">Best practices</h2>
<p>Through our study, we discovered that pre-treating or soaking the stained product allows the stain time to break down in the solution of your choice. Though we tested stain removers with different combinations of coffee, wine, ink, and chocolate fighters, the ones that worked the best were those that sat on the fabric and penetrated the chemical reaction the longest.</p>
<p>While five minutes is convenient, it doesn’t have the lasting effect that soaking does (and the stained item may require another wash). The process of preparing a sink to soak the clothing only takes a few minutes, and if you set an alarm, then the stained fabric can be forgotten about for six hours.</p>
<p>Know your stains and fabrics.  Knowing the stain and fabric will always help assess the difficulty of the situation. Are you dealing with hot or cold liquid? Is the article of clothing dry clean only? These questions will help you figure out where to start.</p>
