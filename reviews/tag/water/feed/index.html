				<description><![CDATA[After testing four top-ranked options, the Brita - BB10 won our pick as the best filtered water bottle for safe-to-drink city water.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter using four top-ranked bottles at home, on the go and in the great outdoors, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H1F6N2F/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; BB10</a> won our pick as the best filtered water bottle for better taste from safe-to-drink city water. If you&#8217;re going out into the wilderness, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C6HAYCS/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Grayl &#8211; Ultralight</a> is a purifying water bottle that removes organisms like bacteria and protozoa, as well as mineral contaminants like heavy metals.</p>
<h2>How we selected</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve tested a lot of water filters over the years, including <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">the best water filter pitchers</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-faucet-water-filter/">faucet filters</a>. Our staff has come to appreciate the taste of chlorine-free drinking water without the added expense of buying bottled water.</p>
<p>We looked for systems in two different classes:</p>
<p>First, we looked at filters that were designed to remove only bad-tasting elements like chlorine from treated, safe-to-drink water. The standards for this type of filter are fairly easy to meet, but they&#8217;re specific. An activated carbon block or column of granules will capture most of the stuff you can smell in city water.</p>
<p>Second, we looked at bottles designed for use in the back country and overseas travel, where the concern is more for biological contamination than taste. We consulted guides from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/backcountry_water_treatment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Center for Disease Control</a> and <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/t-d/pubs/pdf/hi_res/07231304hi.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forest Service</a> to ensure we were checking for the right factors.</p>
<p>We narrowed our choices to bottles that had affordable replacement filters and were easy to purchase. A few other picks, like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075X5R67T/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Katadyn &#8211; BeFree</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078WYNCZ5/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LifeSaver</a>, weren&#8217;t available when we tested and weren&#8217;t competitive with the LifeStraw on pricing despite using similar technologies.</p>
<h2>Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Carbon filters</strong> &#8211; If you want a filter to remove the taste of chlorine and other volatile substances, activated carbon is economical and very effective. It isn&#8217;t effective at removing dissolved minerals, though, and the size of particles carbon passes through will depend on the design. Carbon filters soak up less and less contaminants the more they&#8217;re used, and they can&#8217;t be cleaned.</p>
<p><strong>Ion-exchange filters</strong> &#8211; If you want to remove the dissolved salts and metals in water, ion-exchange resin will grab them. Some new tests also show that this works to capture microbial contaminants. This is one of the technologies used in <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">Zero Water filter pitchers</a> to get rid of all dissolved solids. Like activated carbon, the filter is used up as it cleans water, but you can&#8217;t tell how much it has left unless you count the number of times you fill the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>Particle filters</strong> &#8211; If you&#8217;re mostly worried about avoiding beaver fever while backpacking, a hollow-fiber or ceramic filter can be effective at removing everything from silt to tiny virus and bacteria organisms, depending on the size of the holes. In the extra-dense microbiological filters they require hand-pump pressure or hours-long gravity filtration to make questionable water safe. These filters are fairly easy to clean and continue using for a long time, but they don&#8217;t do much to improve the taste of city water or if you use treatment drops.</p>
<p><strong>Particulate ratings</strong> &#8211; NSF International and other water quality testers rate filters based on the largest compounds they can possibly let through. A smaller class number or absolute filter size will be more effective, but it will also stop working more quickly. Class I is the important class, since this means the filter stops particles larger than 0.5 microns, and that category includes some of the most worrisome organisms in mountain streams.</p>
<p><strong>Effectiveness against biological contaminants</strong> &#8211; Class I particulate ratings — or better still, testing that shows compliance with the NSF Standard 53 or 58 for “cyst reduction / removal” — mean filters can trap protozoan cysts like giardia or cryptosporidium. However, these filters might still let some bacteria (which can be as small as 0.2 microns) through. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/backcountry_water_treatment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC highly recommends</a> using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075XVMZG2/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">chlorine dioxide treatment</a> or just boiling water before you filter it.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re travelling in populated areas, virus-size organisms are a bigger concern and require an even tighter, slower filter that meets <a href="https://www.msrgear.com/blog/water-101-decoding-water-filter-testing-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the strict P248 standard</a> for worst-case water supplies. That kind of filter requires a high-pressure hand pump or a slow gravity-drain mechanism.</p>
<p>Bottles like Grayl and Seychelle claim to be effective at removing viruses with ion-exchange filters, but they don&#8217;t publish the specifications of their tests and they&#8217;re definitely not P248-rated.</p>
<p><strong>Flow rating</strong> &#8211; The more quickly water flows through a filter, the easier it is to use. That&#8217;s almost always a trade-off with effectiveness, though. Also remember that if you use water that&#8217;s cloudy, the particles will plug up your filter more quickly and reduce the flow.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter comparing lab tests from dozens of filter systems, we bought the four top faucet water filters and compared them with filtered water from pitchers, reverse osmosis and bottled water suppliers. The best faucet water filter was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IV0P/?tag=ybdfctflt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; FF100</a>, with its compact size and excellent performance certifications. Brita also adds a multi-pattern spray and push-button filter replacement. Our runner-up is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VZ2LMM/?tag=ybdfctflt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DuPont &#8211; WWFM350</a>, which will go longer between filter changes but isn&#8217;t as compact.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>To find the best water filter for faucets, we started with searches for reviews. The number of comprehensive reviews that compare the best on-faucet water filter systems is surprisingly low, with top hits giving little if any evidence they&#8217;d actually used the products or compared to competing products.</p>
<p>Faucet water filters are a niche category; they’re not as popular as the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">water filter pitchers we&#8217;ve tested</a> but are easier to purchase and install than under-sink filtration systems. The big players from the world of pitchers are selling faucet-mount systems, but there are also hundreds of imitators cashing in.</p>
<p>The price of a mystery-brand filter is usually slightly lower than the faucet-mount water filter systems you&#8217;d recognize, but you&#8217;re giving up a lot of confidence for a few dollars per year. Some of the cheapest filters aren&#8217;t even specifying what kind of filter they use.</p>
<p>To ensure we were testing products that are trustworthy, we only bought filters that had been <a href="#NSF">independently certified by NSF International</a>. These certificates mean that a filter will perform as advertised even well beyond the rated life of the filter, and their laboratory controls are far more comprehensive and strict than we could hope to achieve in our test homes. NSF doesn&#8217;t make recommendations about the quality or suitability of a product, but they do tell you what a filter actually takes out of your drinking water.</p>
<p>The tricky part of choosing a water filter, even with that assurance, is that not every filter is given the same tests. A manufacturer chooses which compounds to test against, and NSF only lists a pass rating. If a certain contaminant was tested and the filter was poor at filtering it, neither the manufacturer nor NSF has to tell you.</p>
<p>We searched the NSF database for faucet water filters that had been tested and listed, and we bought all the most recent models that had been at least tested to remove lead.</p>
<p>We considered countertop units that attach to a faucet with hoses, but after comparing cost of ownership and the reliability and awkwardness (not to mention the increased up-front cost and the awkwardness of the hoses) we decided to stick with filters that mount directly to the faucet spout.</p>
<p>After finding the brands who had paid for comprehensive testing of filter performance, we checked customer reviews to see if there were features that stood out or had reliability concerns.</p>
<p>Sadly, all of the filters we found with trustworthy reviews have reports of failure. Any time you&#8217;re running water through small tubes and channels, mineral build-up is going to cause problems. The restricted flow of the filter only makes that worse. Still, we weighed the reports of filters popping off and splitting apart carefully when weighing the different models available.</p>

[table id=282 /]
<h2 id="what-to-filter">Do I really need a filter?</h2>
<p>This is the hardest question for us to answer. In many ways, the answer for most people with internet access will typically be &#8220;you don&#8217;t need to filter anything, your water is safe.&#8221; But that&#8217;s not exactly the whole picture.</p>
<h3>U.S. water safety</h3>
<p>Water treatment is what makes drinking water safe for most of us. Some people have a private well that they need to monitor themselves, but the vast majority of the United States relies on a local water authority. You can look up who that is and how well they&#8217;re managing your water <a href="https://ofmpub.epa.gov/apex/sfdw/f?p=108:200::::::" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) database</a>. This tracks who supplies water and whether contaminants have been found above allowed levels.</p>
<p>If your local water authority doesn&#8217;t mail it directly to you, you can also read <a href="https://ofmpub.epa.gov/apex/safewater/f?p=136:102::::::" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a consumer confidence report, also tracked by the EPA</a>. This lets you see not just a passing grade but also details about how close household water is to goals set by community health agencies. They&#8217;ll also report on &#8220;secondary&#8221; standards, which cover water-quality factors that aren&#8217;t considered health threats.</p>
<p>If you see a listed contaminant that&#8217;s too close to the limit for comfort, you can check for that contaminant on filter ratings before you buy.</p>
<h3>Chlorine and taste</h3>
<p>The main reason to filter drinking water is that chlorine — the disinfectant used in civic water supplies — doesn&#8217;t taste very good. The amount of chlorine used is regulated and checked by your water authority, but you can make most city water taste better by filtering out chlorine.</p>
<p>When we checked with brand-new and well-used water-pitcher filters, we found that even &#8220;used up&#8221; granular carbon filters are very effective at removing chlorine. This is all covered in NSF standard 42, which is a common certification for consumer water filters.</p>
<h3>What about Lead pipes?</h3>
<p>Water in our tester&#8217;s city is clean, but the local consumer confidence report says that over 90 percent of the homes have some lead in water tested from the tap. That&#8217;s all because of old pipes inside houses, not from the civic water supply. It&#8217;s about one third of the allowable level of lead but well above the public health goal.</p>
<p>This is a similar situation to homes in Flint, Michigan before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flint water crisis</a>, where switching water supplies caused old pipes, formerly safe, to release lead at unsafe levels.</p>
<p>In response to the Flint crisis, lead filtration has become one of the most heavily-advertised features of water filters. All of the filtration systems we recommend are specifically certified to remove lead.</p>
<h2 id="NSF">NSF filter ratings</h2>
<p>NSF International started as a branch of the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan. The name of the agency then was the &#8220;National Sanitation Foundation,&#8221; though they&#8217;re officially just NSF International these days.</p>
<p>NSF works with many food, health and safety agencies worldwide as a private certification agency.  Along with other standard-setters like with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) they establish what&#8217;s safe, then test and certify products ranging from bakeware to medical devices. They&#8217;re the main certifier of water filtration equipment, and they set tests standards based on input from various stakeholders, including manufacturers of water filters.</p>
<p>NSF isn&#8217;t an agency that recommends products, though — they only test and certify. If you see an advertisement claiming NSF testing, that advertisement doesn&#8217;t tell you the complete story of what was or was not successful in the product&#8217;s testing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nsf.org/consumer-resources/water-quality/water-filters-testing-treatment/standards-water-treatment-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There are two standard tests for NSF-certified water filters</a>, and many more that aren&#8217;t commonly requested or advertised:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NSF/ANSI standard 42</strong> certifies that a water filter can &#8220;reduce aesthetic impurities such as chlorine and taste/odor.&#8221; This is not linked to any health claim, and it&#8217;s an easy standard to meet with activated carbon. Basically every water filter more sophisticated than a mesh strainer meets this standard.</li>
<li><strong>NSF/ANSI standard 53</strong> is the other common test, and in this case certifies that a filter can reduce levels of tested contaminants in water from unsafe to safe. Every filter we looked at has some NSF 53 certification, though not all are certified for the same contaminants; the manufacturer chooses what to test for.</li>
<li><strong>NSF/ANSI standard 53 &#8211; VOC</strong> is a subset of the safety test that covers volatile organic compounds (&#8220;VOCs&#8221;). These are compounds that evaporate quickly and require a different testing regimen: typically, VOC performance is tested by filtering water loaded with chloroform through the filter, and NSF infers the results for other contaminants based on past lab work. A longer list, then, doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean anything.</li>
<li><strong>NSF/ANSI standard 401</strong> is another sub-set of standard 53. This test specifically covers 15 contaminants that aren&#8217;t yet regulated by health or water quality agencies. These include pesticides, flame retardants, detergents and pharmaceuticals. Only two of the brands we tested had been certified with these specific tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that not every filter is rated for the same compounds makes comparing results tricky.</p>
<p>For example, it could be that one filter manufacturer has embedded some other filter medium in their activated carbon block so that it will capture metals better; if another manufacturer hasn&#8217;t advertised their filter removing that metal, it could be that the filter failed a test.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it could simply be that the filter manufacturers are counting on the public only looking at a few key contaminants. Testing for lead, for example, is a no-brainer after the highly-publicized Flint water crisis, but few consumers are actively seeking solutions for mercury contamination. Leaving mercury off the test list might be a cost-saving measure, or it could even be that the performance is just slightly poor enough (say, only 85 percent removed instead of 98 percent) that it sticks out on the data sheet and makes the filter look worse than it would otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="water-test-scam">The water test scam</h2>
<p>Hardware stores often provide &#8220;free&#8221; water testing kits, but be careful: the hardware store test kits are specifically designed to get you to buy a reverse osmosis system by emphasizing the mineral content of your water.</p>
<p>Some salesmen will even use deceptive tests to convince you that you have things in your water that aren&#8217;t actually there. See <a href="http://chemistryhall.com/dont-get-tricked-water-purification-scams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this account of a chemist explaining false tests to a salesman</a> who doesn&#8217;t even seem to understand what he&#8217;s actually testing.</p>
<p>Many consumers have been duped into paying for a system at above-market-value, and often on a store credit card with predatory interest policies.</p>
<p>Agencies like the <a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/environment/water/docs/factsheet/beware.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minnesota Department of Health</a> and the <a href="http://myfloridalegal.com/__85256CC5006DFCC3.nsf/0/3D0FD1650FC920C485256CC900698282?Open&amp;Highlight=0,in-home,water,test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida Attorney General</a> have issued statements specifically advising consumers to be cautious about purchasing filters after seeing tests performed by installation companies. Class-action lawsuits are being fought all over the country, and one has even reached <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/17-1471.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Supreme Court</a>.</p>
<p>You can pay an independent laboratory for water testing, but you still need to know what is a safe and reasonable amount of the contaminants they find, and you still have to decide what else you might want to improve.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Installation: </b>Faucet filters thread onto your faucet spout so pressure can force water through the filter. Each system comes with three thread adapters for all the common kitchen faucet aerator fittings, but none will work with a pull-out hand sprayer or other non-threaded spouts. Bathroom faucets won&#8217;t usually work, either.</p>
<p><b>Size and bulk:</b> The systems we found all use approximately the same size of filter cartridge, but some are much bigger than others. A big filter system could get in the way when you&#8217;re trying to wash dishes or fill a stock pot.</p>
<p><b>Flow options:</b> All faucet-mount filters allow you to bypass the filter. You don&#8217;t want to deplete the filter and settle for reduced water pressure when you&#8217;re washing dishes. Some filters automatically switch back to unfiltered water with a spring-return switch, while others offer multiple spray patterns in the unfiltered position.</p>
<p><b>Filter ratings:</b> All of the filters we found use carbon block filters, so they&#8217;re comparable. They&#8217;re not all certified to remove the same contaminants, though. <a href="#NSF">See our section on NSF certification for the details</a>.</p>
<p><b>Vertical or horizontal filter: </b>This is one of the biggest differences between designs. A vertical filter mount gives you a bit more room around your faucet spout, but they can drip a little leftover water from inside the filter. In comparison, horizontal-mount filters won&#8217;t dribble as much after you shut off the flow.</p>
<h2>How carbon filters work</h2>
<p>All of the water filter faucets in this category rely on carbon block filtration. That&#8217;s different from activated carbon granules, like you&#8217;d find in the budget pick from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">water filter pitcher review</a>.</p>
<p>A sheet of carbon sticks to other atoms and most carbon-based (organic) molecules, which also tend to be the worst-tasting. Activated carbon has so many microscopic pores, it has an active surface area of almost a million square feet per ounce.</p>
<p>Carbon block filters use compressed charcoal as a medium, which means the paths through the filter will capture most particles larger than a micron. It takes extra pressure to get water flowing through: Granule-based filters pass water much more easily and can use gravity-feed systems, but they also allow more contaminants to slip past.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, carbon filters are very good for capturing everything in water except dissolved minerals, metals and salts. Carbon filters are even great at filtering chlorine, which is typically the worst-tasting stuff in city water.</p>
<p>So, what about those dissolved minerals? Well, there&#8217;s good news and bad news. If you&#8217;re worried about heavy metals like lead, newer carbon filters work much better than traditional granulated carbon systems like the classic Brita pitcher. All the filters we tested are certified to handle lead, and most are also certified to take out mercury.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re worried about fluoride and other dissolved minerals, you&#8217;ll have to use a more complicated system with another filter type alongside a carbon filter or a full-on reverse-osmosis system or distiller that removes basically everything.</p>
<p>The ion-exchange beads in a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/zerowater/">Zero Water gravity filters</a> (and by many water softener systems) are the most effective way to get rid of the rest of the dissolved minerals in tap water. We started using a Zero Water to eliminate &#8220;white dust&#8221; mineral residue from hard water after testing for our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-humidifier/">humidifier review</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-essential-oil-diffuser/">essential oil diffuser review</a>. It&#8217;s an effective solution that doesn&#8217;t require any expensive equipment installations. The more minerals you&#8217;ve got in your water, though, the more quickly a Zero Water filter will be used up.</p>
<p>If fluoride is the compound you&#8217;re specifically trying to eliminate, an activated alumina filter medium can be used in multi-stage filter systems along with carbon  filters. The alumina requires a much slower flow rate to be effective, though, so this is not a common design, even in under-sink filter systems. Usually the best way to remove fluoride is a full reverse-osmosis system.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/faucetfilter_install.mp4.mov" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Installing and using these filters was, thankfully, very easy. All the kits came with adapters for internal or external threading, but you will need to install it on a faucet with a threaded aerator of some kind. If you have a pull-out hand sprayer or other unique spout, these filters won&#8217;t be able to attach.</p>
<h3>Cost of ownership</h3>
[table id=280 /]
<p>We looked at average prices for filters and compared the cost of filtering a gallon of water every day with each system. We also factored the cost of replacing the system itself every 18 months.</p>
<p>Most people will be able to run these systems for much longer than that, but if you get sediment or calcium building up inside, any of these could start to leak from the pressure forcing water through the carbon block. Also, you can&#8217;t replace the battery for any of the filter replacement lights.</p>
<h3>Taste testing</h3>
<p>We got our family of taste-testers to compare these filters to our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">top-ranked water filter pitchers</a>, the Zero Water and Brita &#8211; Longlast. On the whole, the faucet filters were neck-and-neck with the Brita and just ahead of Zero Water. The average scores in the blind test were very close.</p>
<h3>Dissolved solids and lab tests</h3>
[table id=281 /]
<p>We used a conductivity meter to test for electrolytic dissolved minerals in our water, which includes everything from salt to sulphates. The faucet filters are leaving basically the same amount of dissolved minerals in our (fairly hard) Southern California water as the Brita &#8211; Longlast pitcher does. Even the best water filter for a sink faucet can&#8217;t match <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/#top-pick">Zero Water&#8217;s party trick</a> of removing all dissolved minerals.</p>
<h3>Chlorine</h3>
<p>We wanted to see if any of these filters would show a different result when it comes to taste’s biggest enemy, chlorine. Our chlorine test kit can detect a .01 part-per-million difference in total chlorine.</p>
<p>The tap water we tested had between 0.7 and 1 PPM of chlorine. We found that any water filter we try, no matter how long it had been in use, would remove all detectable traces of chlorine. The faucet filters gave the same great results.</p>
<h3>Size</h3>

<p>As we used these filters over our first week of daily testing, we quickly realized that size was a more important factor than performance for kitchen use. The filters didn&#8217;t prevent our filling a stockpot or washing dishes, but when we rinsed off a baking sheet or did other awkward sink-filling work it was more difficult with the bulky filter in the way.</p>
<p>You can remove and re-attach these filters without tools in most cases, so you could take off a filter if it gets in the way of filling or washing something on occasion, but it became quickly apparent that the smaller filters were easier to live with.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IV0P/?tag=ybdfctflt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; FF-100</a> faucet water filter system squeaks ahead of every other filter system we tried in most respects. Brita has been around the home water filter market longer than anyone, and their experience shows in the refinements they&#8217;ve made to this system.</p>
<p>First and foremost, this is the most compact faucet filter we found. It&#8217;s still an awkward lump hovering over your sink, but the vertical orientation of the filter cylinder gives you a little bit more access than other designs. The fact that the filter output comes from the bottom means some dripping after you turn off the flow as gravity pulls the last few drops out of the filter block, but on the whole, it makes more sense than a horizontal filter.</p>
<p>This is an update of Brita&#8217;s old filter design, the SAFF-100. The plug-in filter cartridges are the same across old and new Brita faucet-mount systems, so performance is identical.</p>
<p>The main difference between the two systems is how the flow selection works: The old system used a wing-nut-shaped twist-knob, while the new system is a paddle that you push back and forth. The size and shape of the paddle is similar, but it&#8217;s slightly easier to push than to twist.</p>
<p>Brita also added a second spray pattern to the non-filtered flow outlet. A spray stream on your faucet, like the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-shower-head/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spray-type shower heads we&#8217;ve reviewed</a>, typically uses less water to do the same washing and may be even better for rinsing if you have low water pressure.</p>
<h3>Filter Performance</h3>
<p>Brita&#8217;s certified filter performance is good. It doesn&#8217;t have the very best numbers in every category, but water-filter performance is tricky to evaluate: How many parts per trillion of atrazine or mercury is a problem if you&#8217;re drinking from a safe water source?</p>
<p>We relied mostly on the NSF tests to evaluate filter performance for this review, because, let&#8217;s face it, we can&#8217;t be more thorough than they are. More to the point, these filters are all basically the same. Carbon-block filters capture very small particles as well as most important chemical compounds that we worry about.</p>
<p>Brita does list certification for VOC removal, which means if you have dissolved solvents and gasses in your water, the Brita is certified to remove most of them. The fact that some filters don&#8217;t list VOC performance isn&#8217;t much of a concern, since it&#8217;s a standard benefit of using a carbon block, but it&#8217;s reassuring that Brita has paid to show what this filter can do.<br />

Brita has all the certificates to show how well this filter works, and the flow switch makes it easy to use at your main kitchen sink. So long as you've got a standard faucet, this is a good choice for on-demand drinking water.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IV0Pybdfctflt-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<h3>Cost vs. convenience</h3>
<p>The twist-open container designs used on the other filter systems aren&#8217;t difficult to open or close, but Brita&#8217;s design is more compact. These plug-in cartridges have a downside, in that they use slightly more plastic and need to be replaced more frequently.</p>
<p>Also, some users report that mineral build-up can make the seals leak and even prevent the filter from attaching securely. Mineral build-up will ruin any pressurized filter system eventually, so we factored an 18 month replacement cycle into our cost calculation.</p>
<p>Brita will pay for shipping to send in the filters so they can recycle them, but you need to collect the filters for years before you&#8217;d have a full shipment of five pounds.</p>
<p>Unlike the gallon-counting LCD screen on the DuPont, Brita just gives you a bare-bones LED indicator to tell you when to change the filter. We weren&#8217;t able to filter the full 100 gallons on ours before press time, but given that the digital readout on the DuPont wasn&#8217;t accurate, it&#8217;s hard to give either system any extra points.</p>

    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/faucetfilter_use.mp4.mov" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Another downside, as you can see in this video clip, is that the filter outlet does take a few seconds to empty after each use.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the difference between the Brita and the long-lasting Culligan system worked out to about $11 per year, $52 vs. $41, when we compared average filter prices and estimated replacing the whole system every 18 months. (In worst-case hard-water conditions these systems start to plug up after that long.) That&#8217;s about the same price you&#8217;d pay using a Brita filter pitcher with a Longlast filter.</p>
<p>No matter which faucet filter you choose you&#8217;re adding an obstacle to your sink, but the Brita gives you the most room. It&#8217;s slightly more expensive in the long run, but the replacement filters are also easy to get.</p>
<p>Adding in the extra utility of a second spray pattern with an easy-to-flip selector, the Brita was somewhat more useful for washing dishes as well. When we had to decide on a system we liked using most, this was a pretty easy pick.</p>

<p>If you want maximum filter life and maximum performance, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VZ2LMM/?tag=ybdfctflt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DuPont &#8211; WWFM350</a> has you covered. The filter included with the FM350 is rated for double the number of gallons that Brita certifies for their filter, though the system costs slightly more overall. In the long run, you could save some money with the DuPont filters.</p>
<p>DuPont also makes this system in a chrome finish, which might go better with your kitchen than Brita&#8217;s white plastic.</p>
<p>Compared to the long list of solvents and organic compounds that Brita has tested their filter against, Dupont lists fewer results overall. They did get their filter certified to remove mercury, however, which is a notable absence on the Brita performance sheet.</p>
<p>There is one quirk about the performance sheet that we found disturbing: The results of the NSF International tests for both DuPont&#8217;s 100-gallon &#8220;extra protection&#8221; filter and the 200-gallon &#8220;ultra protection&#8221; are identical. The ultra protection filter is probably thicker to provide more surface area and last longer. It&#8217;s only a 50-percent price increase for a 100-percent increase in filter life, so it&#8217;s not a rip-off, but the labels imply a bigger difference than there is.</p>

<p>In terms of potential filter performance, let&#8217;s say this again: It would be surprising to see any meaningful difference between these systems we tested. We couldn&#8217;t even pick out anything distinctive about the taste from any of the water samples.</p>
<p>A unique feature of the DuPont is the flow counter: A small LCD screen on the side of the filter holder counts up the number of gallons passing through on the way up to the rated limit of 200. We weren&#8217;t impressed by the accuracy of the counter on the unit we bought: It only showed a few gallons used after the initial &#8220;flush&#8221; indicator went away and we used the filter for a few days of drinking water, making coffee and cooking. When we measured the meter with three gallons of water a week into our test, the digital &#8220;gallons filtered&#8221; display only ticked over after an average of one quart extra was filtered.</p>
<p>The major downfall of the DuPont compared to the Brita was size, though. Even if you don&#8217;t want the extra spray mode the Brita spout provides, the more compact size is a big help. DuPont made their system about 30 percent smaller than the PUR, though, so it&#8217;s not the worst offender.</p>
<p>If the counter had been more accurate or the design had been more compact this could have earned a stronger recommendation, but at the end of the day it&#8217;s just a bulky alternative to the Brita.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VZ2LMM/?tag=ybdfctflt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DuPont &#8211; WWFM350</a> filters twice as many gallons as the Brita for a few dollars more per filter.</li>
<li>This is a more expensive system to buy up-front, so this is a longer-term investment.</li>
<li>The gallon counter is kind of nifty, but it&#8217;s a big, clunky filter compared to the Brita.</li>
<li>Comes in imitation nickel, chrome or white plastic finishes.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want the lowest possible up-front investment, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01E1FMZ5C/?tag=ybdfctflt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Culligan&#8217;s FM-100c</a> offers most of the benefits of the other filters for less than $20. It&#8217;s a mid-sized system, a little bit smaller than the DuPont but not as compact as the Brita.</p>
<p>Culligan&#8217;s FM-R filters are rated to last a full 200 gallons like Dupont&#8217;s, but they&#8217;re not as cheap or easy to find. If you have to pay more than the list price for filters, it might be cheaper to replace the whole filter system than to buy a refill. Culligan is still the least-expensive filter system over time, though, if you ever have to replace the whole unit because of a plugged-up switch or leaking seal.</p>
<p>Culligan&#8217;s system is simple. Rather than a knob or paddle switch, you get a spring-loaded plunger that switches flow between filtered and unfiltered spouts. This plunger returns flow to the unfiltered spout when you shut off the water, which is good for conserving your filter. That said, if you&#8217;re filling multiple drinking glasses or water bottles, it&#8217;s annoying that you need to switch it every time you turn off the tap. You&#8217;ll also have to wiggle it sometimes to get the flow entirely to the filter.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we don&#8217;t have any serious problems with the Culligan system, but it feels like every feature winds up being a compromise rather than a benefit.</p>
<p>Even the performance certificate feels like a cost-cutting exercise, with no VOCs tested and only three of the most worrisome compounds listed. It&#8217;s a safe bet that this filter performs almost the same as the others, but it seems the manufacturer wasn&#8217;t invested in showing that. The Culligan did show the lowest amount of dissolved solids in a conductivity test, but it was less than a 10 percent difference.</p>

<p>PUR is one of the biggest filter names in the North American market, nipping at Brita&#8217;s heels. The <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/PUR-Chrome-Horizontal-Faucet-Mount-System-PFM400H/300173955" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PUR &#8211; Advanced PFM400H</a> uses a top-tier carbon-block filter, but the device is just too bulky to win applause from our testers.</p>
<p>Of all the filters we tested, this was the largest. Any lump of chrome-painted plastic on the end of your faucet is going to get in the way to some degree, and we can&#8217;t say that this one was a particular problem, but you won&#8217;t forget it&#8217;s there.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that PUR hides the size and shape of their filter in the advertising and packaging by only showing it from the side lost them a few points of our esteem.</p>
<p>The flow-diverter switch is the one highlight of this filter: It&#8217;s a big, smooth, easy-to-flip lever. There aren&#8217;t any extra faucet-spray features like Brita has, but it does feel nicer than the other filters in that one regard.</p>
<p>This is the mid-range model from PUR&#8217;s newest lineup, and at about $32, it&#8217;s on the upper end of the range we tested. The filter only lasts for 100 gallons, but they&#8217;re slightly cheaper than the Brita refills. Since the unit itself is so expensive, the real gamble is that the body might plug up with mineral residue and start leaking before you see any benefit from the cheaper filters.</p>
<p>PUR does have a <a href="https://www.target.com/p/pur-ultimate-faucet-filtration-system-with-bluetooth/-/A-50968052" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bluetooth-enabled version of this system</a>, but there are almost certainly better ways to track your water intake than a water filter app. It&#8217;s nice to have a definite number for the life of the filter, but we don&#8217;t have much confidence that the flow meter on PUR&#8217;s system would be more accurate than DuPont&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The PUR &#8211; Advanced model we tested does have one premium feature we were eager to try: The RF9999 &#8220;MineralClear&#8221; filters are supposed to add a small amount of dissolved minerals back into your water after it passes through the carbon block.</p>
<p>We couldn&#8217;t really taste a notable improvement, though the water from the PUR system did have about five percent more dissolved minerals than the average. Note that that&#8217;s in a range of 260 to 290 parts per million of dissolved minerals, fairly hard water that was basically unchanged by the other filters. You don&#8217;t have to worry about a faucet mount system taking away all the benign or beneficial minerals the way you do with reverse osmosis or a Zero Water system.</p>
<p>Pur&#8217;s MineralClear filters are certified to take out more contaminants than the other three filters we tested, with basically the same test certifications as DuPont. This is a good filter, but it&#8217;s not obviously doing more than any other carbon filter to give you clean water.</p>

<p>Faucet mount water filters are easy to install and work well. When we&#8217;re testing for our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/">water bottle review</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-drip-coffee-maker/">coffee maker review</a>, it&#8217;s easy to grow tired of waiting for a pitcher to gravity-filter enough water. Faucet-mounted filters mean on-demand water without giving up any under-sink space for pressure tanks or filter manifolds that come with larger systems.</p>
<p>So long as you have a standard faucet spout with a threaded aerator — and not a pull-out hand-sprayer — any of these filters will install quickly and give you great-tasting water. They all use activated carbon blocks, so the results are similar.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IV0P/?tag=ybdfctflt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; FF-100</a> is a clear winner despite the similar-tasting water. The body is compact and keeps mostly out of the way, and the extra spray option might even make this a handy faucet upgrade for some people. It&#8217;s still less expensive to run this filter than to buy Brita&#8217;s pitcher filters, so as long as you don&#8217;t need your water chilled by the fridge, this is a great option.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent a month using the best insulated tumblers side by side with water bottles and travel mugs.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>There are over 20,000 listings on Amazon for &#8220;insulated tumbler.&#8221; YETI is the undisputed brand king, with a tumbler that&#8217;s now even more popular than their ultra-rugged (and expensive) coolers. As with all things that are mass-produced and insanely popular, the number of competitors (and imitations) has expanded just as quickly as YETI&#8217;s profit numbers.</p>
<p>We read and watched dozens of YETI tumbler reviews and comparisons to narrow the mile-long list down to four of the best insulated tumbler cups. <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-tumbler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wirecutter</a>, as always, provides some in-depth testing, and <a href="https://www.savingfreak.com/best-tumbler-yeti-vs-rtic-vs-orca-vs-ozark-trail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saving Freak</a> compares the costs and benefits of the various copycat brands. GearJunkie, like most sites, only <a href="https://gearjunkie.com/yeti-rambler-tumbler-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passes a verdict on the YETI</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY5Kryq62SQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What&#8217;s Inside</a> tried to do a controlled test, but wound up destroying one of their samples.</p>
<p>In our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/" rel="noopener">water bottle review</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/" rel="noopener">travel mug review</a>, we&#8217;ve seen Klean Kanteen and Hydro Flask go head-to-head competing for a position in our tests. <b>For the first time, Hydro Flask offers something substantially different from Klean Kanteen: a bigger cup that actually matches what everyone else is offering.</b></p>
<p>Between the various well-known brands that are just barely different from YETI, RTIC is budget-friendly and offers a flip-cap lid that at least compares in functionality to the Mag-Slide on the new YETI lids.</p>
<p>CamelBak has an interesting contender in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LA4PUMc/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KickBak</a>, and it fared well in Wirecutter&#8217;s insulation test, but customer reviews of the lid are scathing so we skipped it.</p>
<p><b>We decided to test only the 30-ounce tumblers in this review, since they&#8217;re the most popular and represent a type of drink carrier that&#8217;s really different from a </b><a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/" rel="noopener"><b>16-ounce travel mug</b></a><b>.</b> It also allowed us to compare them directly to our favorite 30-ounce insulated <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/" rel="noopener">water bottle</a> to see what difference that narrower opening makes. We selected representatives from a range of prices to see if insulation quality really changes when you buy a $40 tumbler instead of a $16 tumbler.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-get">Should you get a tumbler, water bottle or travel mug?</h2>
<p>Like <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/#best-insulated-water-bottle" rel="noopener">insulated water bottles</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/" rel="noopener">travel mugs</a>, an insulated tumbler will keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold. The vacuum insulation also stops that slippery condensation from forming on the sides and leaving a puddle on your furniture.</p>
<p>The choice between a travel mug and an insulated tumbler is a tricky one. In most ways, these products serve an identical purpose for most people: They maintain temperature, and they&#8217;re convenient to sip from (no screw-top like an insulated water bottle).</p>
<p>The big difference with a tumbler is the lid. <b>While a travel mug is still designed for easy-access sipping, many tumblers don&#8217;t have any kind of stopper at all to slow down your sipping pleasure.</b> The lids are simple and easy to clean, but they offer far less insulation than good travel mugs. The best travel mugs keep your coffee hotter and your laptop (not to mention pants) safer from spills.</p>
<p>A tumbler is also available in much larger sizes than popular travel mugs. You can buy a thermos or a giant insulated water bottle, of course, but those aren&#8217;t easy to sip from.</p>
<p>So, the ideal setting for an insulated tumbler is on a hot afternoon where you want to keep your drink insulated, but you&#8217;re more worried about convenience more than spills. Drinking something cold poolside on a scorching-hot day is a perfect example. Reading on the patio in the early morning with a cup of coffee is also a case where the tumbler works better than an ordinary cup.</p>

<b>Size:</b> The most popular tumblers hold around 30 ounces, and among the friends and coworkers who use them daily, that was unanimously the preferred size for sipping cold beverages or ice water.</p>
<p><b>Spout stoppers:</b> Flip-up stoppers and slide-over stoppers are the two common approaches to keeping a tumbler closed. Look closely at what you&#8217;re buying, though: Many tumblers are made with a few different lid styles if you look for them.</p>
<p><b>Base diameter:</b> Do you need to keep your tumbler in a car cup holder? Check the size just to be sure, but most cup holders are designed to hold extra-large restaurant-size paper cups, which these tumblers mimic.</p>
<p><b>Painted, coated or brushed finish:</b> Color coordination is a nice benefit of painted or powder-coated tumblers, but they&#8217;ll show signs of wear eventually. Brushed stainless steel looks great even if it gets scratched, and there&#8217;s nothing that will peel off after a few years.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Everyday use tests</h3>
<p>Our tester used these tumblers in place of his usual water bottle and coffee mug for two weeks. At work, around the house, in the car and at the park, they all kept beverages handy. The 30-ounce size was bigger than our testers preferred for a morning cup of coffee, but for keeping hydrated (or keeping a rum and coke chilled) it&#8217;s just about perfect.</p>
<p>The differences between the mugs seemed smaller and smaller as we got used to them. The flip-lid from RTIC doesn&#8217;t flop around as much as most travel mug lids in this style, which was our biggest concern. The slide closures on the YETI and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0769CQYVS/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican &#8211; Traveler</a> were easy to use, though not any more so than the flip lid.</p>
<h3>Cleaning test</h3>
<p>Cleaning these tumblers and lids was easy, even by hand. Compared to popular travel mugs like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZI5XNO/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo &#8211; West Loop</a> with its springs and levers on the inside of the lid, a tumbler lid is dead simple to clean.</p>
<p>What about the dishwasher, though? <a href="https://www.rticcoolers.com/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTIC</a> and <a href="https://www.hydroflask.com/caring-for-your-hydro-flask/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hydro Flask</a> say that you should hand-wash only, while <a href="https://www.yeti.com/en_US/are-yeti-tumblers-dishwasher-safe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YETI</a> specifically claims their tumblers will survive dishwashing. (Pelican doesn&#8217;t comment either way.) Given the number of outright contradictions we&#8217;ve seen over our years researching vacuum-insulated products, we&#8217;re not surprised by either answer. Extra-hot drying cycles will make the metal expand and contract, so there&#8217;s some risk to every mug, but the biggest problems are usually with color coatings and glued-on plastic pieces.</p>
<p>If you want to keep your insulated tumbler looking and working its best, hand-washing is the safe way to go. But it seems clear that one trip through the washer won&#8217;t destroy the insulation if you find a week-old smoothie in the back of your truck.</p>
<h3>Insulation test</h3>
<p>We took our four tumblers and our <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07996C56J/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">top-performing insulated water bottle</a> and filled them all with 28 ounces of hot water. Temperature ranged from 190 to 194 degrees Fahrenheit, which is on the upper end of coffee temperature after brewing.</p>
<p>We then checked on the heat loss for the next six hours, and again at 12 hours. The chart below models the results for easy comparison. (The raw data had a difference of four degrees Fahrenheit in starting temperature. The chart shows an adjusted starting temperature, but the temperature change from one sample to the next is as recorded.)</p>
<div id="visualizer-18187-1042757685" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-18187"></div>
<p>The differences between these tumblers is so small that it would be impossible to tell them apart. The real difference is between the tumblers and the water bottle: because the vacuum-sandwich stainless steel walls provide the most effective insulation, the wide lid of a tumbler is a real liability. Even the fact that the Hydro Flask tumbler has no seal to keep steam in made only a tiny difference in the test.</p>
<p>We also added the results from an old test of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp 16-ounce travel mug</a> to this chart for comparison. <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/#how-we-tested" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The testing conditions were different</a> (starting temperature was lower, and we didn&#8217;t test for as long), but we&#8217;ve normalized the starting point on this graph so the sample intervals line up. It&#8217;s clear that even a small narrow-neck bottle keeps heat better than the tumblers.</p>
<h3>Ice test</h3>
<p>In our research, we saw so many variations of the ice test, we were a little surprised that there wasn&#8217;t some kind of consensus. Instead, it seemed that every test had a slightly different result. The real problem with an ice test is getting around the margin of error: It&#8217;s hard to know if you&#8217;re measuring the temperature of the water or the ice cubes. (Infrared thermometers are also often used, and those <a href="https://blog.thermoworks.com/thermometer/how-to-use-an-infrared-thermometer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only read the surface temperature</a> of the water, not the temperature of the whole bath.) It&#8217;s also tricky to ensure that all your ice is the same temperature going in.</p>
<p>We ultimately decided not to repeat an ice test because the insulation performance is so clearly demonstrated by a hot-water test. If heat coming into the cup is any different than heat escaping, the amount of time it takes for that difference to show is measured in hours. If you really want the best insulation possible to keep ice frozen all day long (or if you want to keep small amounts of liquid nitrogen, or something similar), a sealed narrow-neck bottle is still your best bet.</p>
<h3>Leak test</h3>
<p>In our travel mug tests, we went as far as putting the mugs into a spin dryer to see if they would leak in the most extreme circumstances. By comparison, most tumblers will spill some of your drink when you tip them sideways. We filled each tumbler with water and turned them upside down to see if any of the stoppers actually prevent leaks.</p>

Don't put this in a bag with a laptop, but if you knock it over it's not going to dump your drink.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The RTIC&#8217;s lid is surprisingly secure, given the competition. You can usually hold this cup upside down, or even leave it sitting on a table upside down, and not see more than a few drops. As soon as you shake it or drop it on the floor, though, all bets are off. (The more fluid you have inside, the more explosive the spill will be when the flip-cap pops open.)</p>
<p>Of the two brands that are trying sliders, YETI is fairly successful, while Pelican&#8217;s lid is a hot mess. It&#8217;s not clear exactly what the issue is, since the basics of the mechanism seem the same, but the Pelican lid always dribbled a stream of water when we turned it upside down. The YETI &#8220;Mag Slider&#8221; lid isn&#8217;t as magical as it sounds, but it works fairly well to stop anything more than occasional drips.</p>
<p>Hydro Flask gives you nothing to work with for spill prevention. If you really want the color options and tapered form factor they&#8217;re offering, they do have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07943NMYX/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a straw lid option</a> that might be better at stemming the flow of sticky drinks in case of an accident.</p>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RTIC &#8211; 30-Ounce Insulated Tumbler</a> is the best bargain in this lineup, and it&#8217;s our top pick overall. The stopper actually prevents some spills, and compatible accessories are easy to find. This is an updated version of the RTIC, but the old <a href="https://www.amazon.com/RTIC-30-oz-Tumbler-Pink/dp/B019D9HESO/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">all-metal-no-stopper version</a> is still available.</p>
<p>Without buying and trying out these tumblers, it&#8217;s easy to make assumptions about performance. &#8220;Maybe the steel is thinner,&#8221; you think. &#8220;Maybe the vacuum is actually less of a vacuum.&#8221; Our testing shows, though, that If there&#8217;s anything fancy that other brands are doing to improve theoretical insulation performance, the giant plastic lid is an equalizer that levels the playing field.</p>
<p>In every case we&#8217;ve seen (even among top-class insulating mugs and bottles from Zojirushi, Thermos and Hydro Flask) a big lid means mediocre insulation. Improving the insulation of a tumbler without making the lid area smaller is like adding better insulation to your house while the doorways and windows are sealed with plastic sheets.</p>

The plastic base is a drawback, but the price makes this a real winner. If you're picky enough about durability or insulation that a budget model is a turn-off, you should probably check out a travel mug or thermos anyhow.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>So, what is the difference that brings the price down? The plastic &#8220;foot&#8221; on this new RTIC is less tough than the YETI if you drop it on a hard surface, but the difference in price more than makes up for that.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important consideration when it comes to recommending a bargain-priced tumbler is availability: <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-30-Ounce-Double-Wall-Vacuum-Sealed-Tumbler/171452737" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ozark Trail</a>, <a href="https://www.target.com/p/zak-designs-174-30oz-stainless-steel-tumbler/-/A-52542332" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zak! Designs</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Steel-Tumbler-Insulated-Greens/dp/B01AZB6TQW/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BEAST</a> and a dozen other companies are also producing similar tumblers at low price points, but inventory (and new brands) come and go seasonally. RTIC has been around since the beginning of the fake-YETI game, and availability online is always good. That popularity also means that accessories (like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0779M1CBK/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this handle</a>) will actually be designed to fit this cup.</p>
<p>The main feature that bumped this tumbler to the top of our lineup is the spill-proof lid. If you don&#8217;t want the flip-cap to stick up into your face when you&#8217;re drinking, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019D9HESO/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">older version of the RTIC</a> with no stopper is going to be just as good at insulating your drink. Note that the outer dimensions are slightly different; old-style handles don&#8217;t fit new-style mugs with the plastic foot.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The RTIC &#8211; 30-Ounce Insulated Tumbler is a bargain-priced drink vessel that will keep your beverage just as cold (or hot) as other brands.</li>
<li>This flip-up lid stopper is the only option we found that really prevents leaks, though it&#8217;s still not safe to put in a bag.</li>
<li>RTIC compromises on quality very slightly, with some plastic parts, but the vacuum insulation is all that it needs to be.</li>

If you want something better than a budget-priced tumbler, there&#8217;s no way to beat the original <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YETI &#8211; Rambler</a>. YETI didn&#8217;t technically invent this category of drinkware (similar insulated travel mugs have been around for a very long time), but they created a new market with big 30-ounce tumblers targeted at outdoor enthusiasts who loved their coolers for camping and tailgating.</p>
<p>This is not a Yeti thermos: You can easily beat this kind of insulation with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07996C56J/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">narrow-neck bottle from Klean Kanteen</a>, for about the same price. If you want the easy-filling and easy-sipping convenience of a tumbler, YETI has the same performance drawbacks as the other brands.</p>

The magnetic slider is more convenient than a flip-up stopper, but it doesn't make this cup leakproof. The main reason to pick this tumbler is if you've gotta have that logo.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The one category YETI manages to squeak ahead of some competition is in spill prevention. The Rambler&#8217;s slide cover actually stops most (but not all) leakage and only lets drops escape. In comparison, the Pelican will dribble out a stream. The RTIC is more leak-proof, but the YETI really is ready for those times when your friend fires up the motor on the jet boat and you haven&#8217;t finished your drink.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a YETI for coffee that&#8217;s a little different than the classic 30-Ounce Rambler, there&#8217;s also the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BM72ZXT/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YETI &#8211; 14-Ounce Rambler Mug</a> for about $10 less. The small amount of coffee it holds compared to the large lid surface means it&#8217;s only going to keep your coffee hot for about 45 minutes, but compared to six minutes for an open-top ceramic mug for some people this is exactly what they&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>The other case where this is an obvious pick is if you&#8217;re buying a gift. Nothing says &#8220;I only sorta love you&#8221; like a knock-off version of a trendy product. If you know someone who actually wants a YETI, the price difference is worth it.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The YETI &#8211; Rambler is the product that got everyone buzzing about giant insulated cups, and they&#8217;re still the most recognizable.</li>
<li>The price of this tumbler is high, and it doesn&#8217;t keep your drink any hotter or colder than others.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll get drips if you hold the YETI upside down or drop it on the floor, but this lid is good at keeping your drink inside.</li>
</ul>

In many ways, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0769CQYVS/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican &#8211; Traveler</a> hits the optimal price to performance ratio in this lineup, but that doesn&#8217;t make it the best buy.</p>
<p>Pelican is a company that makes quality flight cases for sensitive equipment, and in many ways they&#8217;re like YETI: a small company who established a niche with a specific product, then started building a brand around it. This tumbler is a bit different than the rest, and if you love the screw-on lid with the bigger spout area it&#8217;s a good buy.</p>
<p>The slide-cover lid isn&#8217;t as good at sealing against leaks as YETI&#8217;s lid, though. It dribbles a small stream if you hold the cup upside down. If you really want to keep your drink in, the flip-up lid on the RTIC (or the old-style <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071KW6MRN/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican Snap Lid</a>, which you can still buy in 2018) is a better choice.</p>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079445ZGP/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hydro Flask &#8211; 32 Ounce Insulated Tumbler</a> is a notable contender from one of the big names in the world of insulated drinkware. Many publications give it a win for the sleek profile and brand reputation.</p>
<p>About the only feature that really stands out, though, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07943NMYX/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the straw lid</a>. If you want your insulated tumbler to look like a Big Gulp, this is the way to go. It&#8217;s a hefty price tag, though: The straw lid was a $13 accessory for a $40 tumbler when we checked. The basic lid that comes with the tumbler is claimed to be designed for good insulation, but without even a stopper to keep heat from circulating in and out it doesn&#8217;t make any difference.</p>
<p>If you or the person you&#8217;re buying for already have a Hydro Flask water bottle, buying a matching tumbler for use around the house is a nice touch. They&#8217;re good looking tumblers, but they don&#8217;t perform any better than the other brands to justify the huge price difference.</p>

If you primarily want an insulated cup to drink coffee from, we think a sealed and better-insulated travel mug is a smarter pick than a tumbler. If you want to carry water around with you, likewise, water bottles are better at making water portable while keeping it colder (or hotter.)</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re just looking for the functionality of the classic SOLO party cup with the benefit of better insulation, the double-wall stainless steel vacuum-insulated tumbler checks all the right boxes.</p>
<p>The brand everyone knows is YETI, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">our best buy pick from RTIC</a> beats that cup in two ways: first, RTIC is selling their cup at less than half the price with no loss in performance. Second, the RTIC has a flip-up spout stopper that actually keeps your drink inside, even if you turn it upside down and shake it.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t like the flip-up lid or if you don&#8217;t like supporting imitation products, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the YETI &#8211; Rambler</a> has an updated lid that&#8217;s pretty good at keeping drinks inside without sticking a flap in your nose.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[The Brita has outstanding filter time and brand recognition, but it's not the best overall water filter pitcher given average filtering and ergonomic design. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>rita water filters are the indisputable market leaders in the pour-through water filter market, with an estimated 70 percent of the overall market. Since 1988, when Brita was licensed in North America, they have dominated the industry. To many, Brita is synonymous with water filters due to decades of successful marketing, low cost and availability. However, as highlighted below, we believe that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0073PZ6O0/?tag=ybdbrita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater &#8211; 10-Cup Pitcher</a> is the best water filter pitcher on the market.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="do-filters-work">Do Brita filters work?</h2>
<p>In short, the answer is yes. Brita filters are <a href="http://info.nsf.org/Certified/DWTU/Listings.asp?Company=06710&amp;Standard=042" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certified by NSF International</a>, including NSF/ANSI Standards 42 and 53. In short, this means that Brita filters are able to remove significant amounts of harmful contaminants from your water, including chlorine and several harmful metals.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HEYJ08S/?tag=ybdbrita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita filters</a> are also able to filter water quickly. In fact, during our testing, we found that the Brita filter was actually the fastest at filtering a cup of water out of all 5 water filter pitchers we tested.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter.png" alt="how long to filter water" width="880" height="590" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-610x409.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-360x241.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-375x251.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-414x278.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-295x198.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-180x121.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-320x215.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Brita filters are also quite inexpensive. While the prices will vary depending on where you are buying (and what the current deals or promotions are), overall Brita filters offer among the lowest cost per cup of water filtered.</p>
<p>The filters for a Brita water pitcher are also easy to find, which makes replacing them notably easier than for some of the less well-known brands.</p>
<h2 id="did-not-likes">What we didn’t like about the Brita pitcher</h2>
<p>While there are certainly things to like about the Brita water filter pitcher, there were several issues we found while testing them.</p>
<p>First (and arguably most importantly), Brita filters simply do not filter as well as other filters on the market, according to certifications like the ones provided by NSF International.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1.png" width="880" height="608" /></p>
<p>ZeroWater filters, for example, are able to reduce significantly more contaminants from the water, while MAVEA filters work better than Brita filters <i>and</i> are able to filter at a more consistent rate for the life of each individual water filter.</p>
<p>We also found the Brita &#8211; 10-Cup Everyday Water Pitcher to be bulky and cumbersome to carry and use. Whether we were carrying the pitcher to or from the sink, or simply pouring water into the glass, it felt like there was a lack of attention to detail when designing the Brita pitcher.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3044398/most-creative-people/can-this-startup-end-britas-water-market-dominance-with-a-more-beautifu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other publications have noted</a>, Brita water filter pitchers are not exactly the type of product you would feature on a magazine cover, or even at a dinner party. While this isn’t the most important consideration when purchasing a water filter pitcher, the fact that there are other products which look better <i>and</i> filter better as well is worth noting.</p>
<h2 id="place-in-market">The Brita water filter’s place in the market</h2>
<p>There is no doubt that the Brita water filter is the undisputed market leader. The combination of low-cost filters and pitchers, nearly three decades in the North American market, and a series of successful marketing and retail placement campaigns have ensured that Brita will be a popular water filter brand for many years to come.</p>
<p>Brita’s competitors are fighting for a comparatively small slice of the market. ZeroWater, in particular, has targeted and focused on the higher end of the market, while still keeping their filters reasonably affordable &#8212; though they are more expensive than Brita filters.</p>
<p>Other brands, like MAVEA, are fighting for some of the same market share as Brita. While MAVEA is fighting against an entrenched incumbent and literally decades of brand recognition, the impressive ergonomics and water filter quality of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002U50QQQ/?tag=ybdbrita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MAVEA</a> brand have allowed them to eke out a small but growing segment of the market.</p>
<p>Time will tell if Brita is able to remain the market leader, or if they will gradually lose market share to competitors like ZeroWater (now the #2 brand in pour-through water filter pitchers) and MAVEA.</p>
<h2 id="how-brita-compares">How do Brita filters compare to others?</h2>
<p>Although it doesn’t tend to market itself as such, Brita is effectively the “discount brand” in the water filter pitcher market. In addition to being among the least expensive, it is simple, reliable, and virtually ubiquitous.</p>
<h3>Brita vs. PUR</h3>
<p>Pur is another popular brand, primarily in the sink filter market. We weren’t particularly impressed with it because filtration time was notably slow, and many of our taste testers found the water to taste “artificial”.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013FQ8QHO/?tag=ybdbrita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PUR 7 Cup Pitcher</a> is similar to the Brita pitcher, in the sense that it isn’t particularly ergonomic or visually appealing.</p>
<p>If you’re choosing between a Brita pour-through water filter pitcher or one by PUR, we would recommend Brita.</p>
<h3>Brita vs. MAVEA</h3>
<p>Both the Brita and MAVEA filters use similar technology. This makes sense, given that the MAVEA brand is the same team that was behind the launch of Brita water filters in North America in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>Despite their similarities and shared history, the minds at MAVEA have clearly evolved their water filters over the years. According to our research and testing, water filtered by MAVEA water filters tastes better, and MAVEA’s water pitcher design is more ergonomic and visually appealing.</p>
<h3>Brita vs. ZeroWater</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1166" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/969a41f9-a6c0-485d-81ad-e80908d2d9d2.jpg" alt="Brita vs ZeroWater" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/969a41f9-a6c0-485d-81ad-e80908d2d9d2.jpg 800w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/969a41f9-a6c0-485d-81ad-e80908d2d9d2-610x406.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/969a41f9-a6c0-485d-81ad-e80908d2d9d2-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/969a41f9-a6c0-485d-81ad-e80908d2d9d2-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/969a41f9-a6c0-485d-81ad-e80908d2d9d2-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/969a41f9-a6c0-485d-81ad-e80908d2d9d2-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/969a41f9-a6c0-485d-81ad-e80908d2d9d2-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/969a41f9-a6c0-485d-81ad-e80908d2d9d2-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/969a41f9-a6c0-485d-81ad-e80908d2d9d2-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Brita and ZeroWater are the two industry leaders in the pour-through water filter pitcher market, with Brita owner the vast majority of that market (around 70%).</p>

<p>That being said, Brita and ZeroWater occupy vastly different segments of the market. While Brita water filters are inexpensive and able to filter water very quickly, ZeroWater filters are more expensive and are able to reduce contaminants in the water to effectively zero.</p>
<p>The bottom line: Brita wins on cost and speed, while ZeroWater wins on water quality and ergonomics.</p>
<h2>Should you buy a Brita water filter pitcher?</h2>
<p>If you want a water filter pitcher that is cheap and ubiquitous, Brita is certainly worthy of consideration. There’s a reason why Brita water filters have been popular for so long.</p>
<p>That being said, we do think that there are better options on the market.</p>
<p>The ZeroWater 10-Cup Pitcher utilizes the more effective ZeroWater filter, is more ergonomic, and includes a spout for easy pouring while leaving the pitcher in the refrigerator.</p>
<p>We also found the MAVEA Elemaris XL 9-Cup Pitcher to be the best product overall, when everything from ergonomics, to filter quality, to cost were taken into consideration.</p>
<p>For a more detailed look into why we feel that both the MAVEA water filter and the ZeroWater filter are better options for you, please take a look at our extensive review of the five <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">best water filter pitchers</a> on the market.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e&#8217;ve been using, cleaning and trying to destroy travel mugs over three years of testing. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a> is the best travel mug for maximum heat retention and easy clean-up. It also proved nearly invulnerable to the drop tests we put it through. If you&#8217;re looking for easy sipping without the risk of spills, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160LEYFY/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo &#8211; Auto-Seal Transit</a> is also a great pick, though it&#8217;s not very easy to clean.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected" class="collapse">How we selected mugs to test</h2>
<p>Our testers have used travel mugs daily for many years and while engaged in activities ranging from truck driving to theatrical stage management, so they had some long-standing demands and expectations. We sorted through countless published professional and consumer reviews and dove into enthusiast discussion boards to find our finalists. We’ve especially kept an eye out for online buzz about flaws and weaknesses, which we’ve tested for and noted. Value is an important consideration for items like this, and we’ve included mugs that ranged in price from $16 to $30 at the time we ordered them.</p>
<p>After our old top pick from Camelbak was discontinued, we started looking for replacements. The Burnout promised to solve all our problems with heat-retention tradeoffs, so we added it to the list. We&#8217;re watching for a new auto-seal design that&#8217;s as easy to clean as the Camelbak, but we haven&#8217;t found it yet.</p>

<h2 id="features-to-look-for" class="collapse">Features to look for</h2>
<p>There are a handful of usability factors that make the difference between your go-to travel mug companion and a dud you’d rather just leave at home. We’ve found the most important factors to be the following:</p>
<p><strong>Leak and spill protection:</strong> You should be able to use a travel mug without fear of spills on your lap or in your backpack.</p>
<p><strong>Ease of opening:</strong> If you want to enjoy a hot beverage while driving, one-handed operation is as much a safety feature as a convenience.</p>
<p><strong>Mess avoidance:</strong> All spouts and lids will collect some liquid while you’re drinking (flip-open lids tend to be the worst in this regard), so in our usability table we’ve rated how safe they are around white silk shirts.</p>
<p><strong>Ease of cleaning:</strong> Nobody wants to use a mug they can’t get clean.</p>
<p><strong>Heat retention:</strong> Hot drinks like your coffee or tea should stay pleasantly hot.</p>
<p><strong>Cup holder/single-brewer compatible:</strong> For those looking for compatibility with a single-cup coffee brewer, we’ve noted which mugs are seven inches or shorter (typical height for a single-cup brewer when the drip tray is removed; your machine may vary), and whether a “shorty” model (usually in 12 oz capacity) is available.</p>
<p><strong>Durability:</strong> Drops happen. A winning travel mug can survive the accidental fall from the top of your car as you absentmindedly back down the driveway on a hectic Monday morning.</p>
<h3>Notes for tea and pour-over brewing</h3>
<p>If you want a built-in loose-leaf-infuser option: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZI5XNO/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VG761C/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stanley</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HYOGTTG/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zojirushi</a> all sell tea-steeping versions of the mugs we tested here (or snap-in accessories) that might help you out, but we’ve been happy with the convenience of drop-in or basket infusers.</p>
<p>Both loose-leaf tea drinkers and pour-over coffee geeks should note mouth-width before they buy: we found the necks of the Klean Kanteen, Thermos Direct Drink and Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 were too small to take any but the narrowest tea infusers; the Hario V60 pour-over coffee brewer just fits the mouth of the Thermos.</p>
<h3>Why are they all stainless steel?</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5461" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors.jpg" alt="stainless steel cup interiors" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Most heat from your mug (once you put a lid on it) is lost through conduction, and the material that conducts the least is nothing at all — hard vacuum. Keeping a vacuum inside the wall of a mug requires a material that’s stiff and strong: steel is stiff, strong, easy to work, and economical. Most of the steel mugs tested specify “18/8 grade” steel or SAE/AISI “304 Stainless”, which contains approximately 18% chromium and 8% nickel. 304 is one of the most widely used alloys in the world (for everything from cookware to the DeLorean to the Gateway Arch) because of its versatility and stain resistance, so there’s a good chance the mugs that don’t specify an alloy are using it or something very similar.</p>
<p>In a strong bath of citric acid, 304 will release slightly more chromium than other alloys do, but for beverage use 304 stainless is as inert as any other stainless alloy, and none of us tasted any unusual metallic flavors in these mugs (even after we left hot orange juice in our top picks for a few hours). If you’re sensitive to trace amounts of nickel or chrome and you drink extra-acidic tea or coffee, consider the Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 (which was nearly our favorite and is “non-stick” lined).</p>
<p>It’s probably worth noting here: all these manufacturers specify that they use BPA-free plastics.</p>
<h3>Non-steel mugs</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5462" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ceramic-mug-solo.jpg" alt="ceramic Ello mug with stainless steel mugs behind" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ceramic-mug-solo.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ceramic-mug-solo-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ceramic-mug-solo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ceramic-mug-solo-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ceramic-mug-solo-300x200.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ceramic-mug-solo-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ceramic-mug-solo-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ceramic-mug-solo-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ceramic-mug-solo-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ceramic-mug-solo-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We included one non-steel mug in our lineup, the Ello &#8211; Mesa double-wall ceramic mug. We looked at other popular ‘reusable to-go cup’ designs, but none of them had spill-proof lids or insulating properties that would make them competitive in this line-up. (Some issues, like reports of a smelly latex rubber lid on one popular brand, or lids that were difficult to snap on, made our choice not to test even easier.)</p>
<p>The Mesa does keep your drink hot three times longer than a conventional open-top single-wall ceramic mug (an hour above 140°F instead of 15 minutes), but the sliding closure on the lid did not prevent spills.</p>
<p>While some manufacturers of the stainless steel mugs say you can put them in the dishwasher, the microwave is territory held securely by mugs like the Mesa: we microwaved water to a piping-hot 186°F and were happy to find that the outside of the mug was only a pleasantly-warm 93°F, unlike some ceramic mugs that get insanely hot on the outside when nuked.</p>
<p>So, if you are simply looking for slightly better insulation in a ceramic tumbler that can go in the microwave and the dishwasher, the Mesa is worth considering; if you want to stop spills and keep your drink hot for a long commute, read on.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested" class="collapse">How we tested</h2>
<p>Well on our way to developing permanent caffeine dependence after our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-french-press/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">French Press</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-single-cup-coffee-maker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Single-Cup Coffee Maker</a> reviews, we indulged another caffeine binge as we filled, drained, cleaned and tried to break 13 travel mugs for multiple weeks.</p>
<h3>Leak test</h3>

<p>The ability to put a travel mug in your bag without fear of making book-and-computer soup separates the best of the travel mugs from the rest. It’s easy to say “this lid locks in the closed position so it won’t leak!” but some locks are easy to defeat accidentally (Contigo West Loop, we’re looking at you). To say without equivocation that the best mugs won’t leak, we put all the mugs in a duffle bag that spent half an hour inside an industrial dryer.</p>
<p>The mugs were filled, dried carefully, weighed, wrapped in a towel and sealed in an individual bag. Then the seals on each mug were double-checked by shaking (all passed) and dropping them before we put them in the dryer. We started the spin-cycle, checked once at ten minutes, then again at the 30-minute mark. All leaks were clearly visible, and we weighed the mugs again after taking them out of their bags to see how much water had leaked out.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HYOGTTG/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48</a>, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a>, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H4LUMUA/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klean Kanteen</a> leaked nothing in the half-hour they were tossed around inside the dryer. The Forge, without any lock or back-up mechanism to keep the seal from opening, only let out a single drop that we could see on its towel-wrap at the ten minute mark, and we didn’t see any more evidence of leaks at the end (nor could we measure the amount of water that had escaped.)</p>
<h3>Spill test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5464" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test.jpg" alt="ceramic Ello in a spill test" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Another important duty of a travel mug is stopping spills. Some of our testers have worked in locations where only spill-proof mugs are allowed, and far too many of us have experienced the tragic consequences of using unworthy mugs in moving vehicles or at desks covered with important documents.</p>
<p>We simulated a desk-spill by filling each mug halfway with a measured amount of water, then tipping it on its side (spout down). After 15 seconds, we picked up the mug and re-checked the amount of water to determine how much water spilled. We wanted to be sure we were simulating a real-world spill: a lid or seal you can manually close might be great for throwing in a bag, but the spills that matter are the ones that happen while the lid/lock isn’t closed. (Note: we tested the Ello &#8211; Mesa both opened and closed. It spilled so much while it was supposed to be “sealed” we included that number on the chart.)</p>
<p>The self-sealing mugs practically cheat on the spill test, and that’s why we like them. Of the mugs that spilled nothing when knocked over, also note that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EPGMZZS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Forge</a> has a lid design which prevents it from rolling off your desk.</p>
<h3>Clean-up test</h3>

<p>Keeping a mug clean is one of those tasks that makes the difference between “buy it for life” and trashing an expensive mug in disgust. Our rating here is based on hand-washing with a sponge, scrubber or bottle-brush, but we’ve also noted if the manufacturer says you can put the whole mug in the dishwasher.</p>
<p>We tested how easy it is to effectively field-clean the mugs with a method similar to systems used by metallurgists looking for cracks in airframes: a (non-toxic, water-based) fluorescent paint was poured into the mugs and then out through the drinking spout. Next, the mugs were filled with soapy water, agitated, drained through the spout, and rinsed in the same way.</p>
<p>While the paint came out in our simple rinse procedure without any obvious dribbles or droplets remaining in most cases (there was a tiny drop left inside the Klean Kanteen’s three-piece seal), we did spot some residue left behind on all the mugs under a UV inspection light.</p>

<p>The Contigo Autoseal system is great for convenient spill-free sipping, but its springs and levers are immersed in your pumpkin-spice foam and nutmeg sprinkles.</p>
<p>The hinged-lid Thermos and Zojirushi mugs are pretty easy to clean, with the Thermos Direct Drink taking an edge here because of a vent design that&#8217;s a hole rather than a tube.</p>
<p><strong>Some notes on dishwasher compatibility</strong></p>
<p>All of the lids for these mugs (with the exception, inexplicably, of the OXO Good Grips) are guaranteed safe for top-rack dishwasher cleaning. Some also guarantee that the body of the mug will be okay on the top rack, but only if it’s an unpainted stainless steel body — a mark against the Auto-Seal Transit’s silicone grip design. Stanley and Bubba are both willing to back up their mugs in dishwasher use despite paint and plastic accessories; the hammertone paint looks OK, but the plastic rings on the Bubba seem destined to trap dishwater over time.</p>
<p>While we wouldn&#8217;t recommend daily dishwashing of these mugs (the extreme heat expands and contracts the steel along the seams that keep the vacuum in, which is why many manufacturers say it voids their warranty). If you want to be able to throw it in the top rack every once in awhile for a deep-cleaning, though, it&#8217;s encouraging to know that a company has your back even if the vacuum fails after ten or twenty years.</p>

<p>We ran two tests to measure how well these mugs retain heat. The first test gives a broad overview of mug performance when starting with water at typical restaurant serving temperature; the second test shows how our favorite mugs performed when starting with a lower temperature.</p>
<p><strong>High-temperature heat retention</strong></p>
<p>In the first test we poured very hot water (it was a lot of pouring, so starting temperature varied, but we’ve normalized the differences to show loss from a 185°F starting temperature) into all the mugs and checked the temperature after an hour. Results are in the main table above.</p>
<p>We found that all of the mugs, even the air-insulated Ello &#8211; Mesa, will keep your Starbucks coffee hot enough to be ‘drinkable’ after sitting around for an hour. Not only that, <strong>two of the mugs we tested kept beverages hot enough to burn you</strong>. We want to point out that this kind of test obscures some basic usability complaints that are frequently made in comments about award-winning mugs: they keep boiling-hot coffee so hot that you may need to take extra steps in order to drink it. Some mug-owners on Reddit suggest ice cubes — no, that’s not a joke, <em>ice cubes</em> — to get your fresh cup of hot coffee or tea down to a drinkable temperature.</p>

<p>The Redditors were absolutely right: when we made tea with freshly-boiled water in either of the top two insulation performers (the Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 or the Thermos Direct Drink Insulated Bottle) we found that it won’t be cool enough for most people to drink (below 155°F) until an hour later, even if you leave the lid off completely.</p>
<p>Mugs like these are great if you want to keep drinks hotter for longer. Just be sure you cool your coffee or tea before adding to the mug, or pour out your beverage to drink until temperatures inside the mug have reached a safe level.</p>
<p>Studies show that the severity of burns start getting significantly worse at temperatures above 175°F, so temperature curves between 200°F and 175°F aren’t showing anything but a danger zone. A study published in the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2002.tb08814.x/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Journal of Food Science</em></a> shows that most people will mix cream/milk (or colder coffee) into their hot coffee to bring it down to around 140°F if they’re going to drink it immediately. Further, the Specialty Coffee Association of America cupping and tasting protocols recommend that evaluation of flavor should not begin until coffee has cooled to between 160 &#8211; 140°F.</p>

<p>With that in mind, our second test used water heated to only 167°F. We filled five mugs: three top-ranked in our first heat test, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EPGMZZS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CamelBak &#8211; Forge</a>, and a heavy, 18 oz-capacity open-top ceramic mug as a control.</p>
<p>After 30 minutes, 50ml of water was decanted from each mug into a 100 ml pyrex beaker every 15 minutes. With a bench thermometer and K-type probe, we took eight samples from each mug, leaving a slightly larger sample at the end. This controls for the way most of us drink away the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water#Heat_capacity_and_heats_of_vaporization_and_fusion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specific heat capacity</a> of the water in our travel mugs if we sip periodically over the course of a commute or while working at a desk.</p>
<p>The best and worst performance in this test still correspond roughly to what we saw the first test we ran, but it does show that even in this less-generous scenario the Forge can keep coffee in the “comfortably hot” zone all the way up to two hours, though it’s 15°F cooler than the Thermos. That’s longer than any of us likes to keep the same mug of coffee around, so we’re more than satisfied. (Any insulated mug is also far, far better than a ceramic open-top mug, which lost the same amount of heat in less than 20 minutes.)</p>
<h3>Drop test</h3>

<p>Other than falling off a desk, the most likely accident a mug will endure is falling off the roof of a car or truck. We subjected the mugs to a battery of drop tests to give a real-world worst-case assessment of what will happen when you forget which pocket your keys are in and set your mug on the car’s roof “just for a second.”</p>
<p>We included a drop onto a padded surface in our leak test earlier, and all of the mugs escaped that without damage (most didn&#8217;t even leak).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5454" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cracked-lids.jpg" alt="cracked lids from the drop test" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cracked-lids.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cracked-lids-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cracked-lids-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cracked-lids-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cracked-lids-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cracked-lids-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cracked-lids-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cracked-lids-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cracked-lids-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cracked-lids-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>In the first part of our (more destructive) drop test, nearly all the mugs also survived falling from desk height onto concrete with only some road rash. The exception is the the Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48, which cracked badly enough that the lock is only barely holding together.</p>
<p>We carried on dropping the mugs from higher and still higher heights, eliminating mugs that were too broken to be usable. The eight-foot drop cracked five of the remaining eleven mugs. After the ten-foot drop, one more (the Thermos Direct Drink) was eliminated. We’ve separated those mugs still working into “indestructibles” which look the same as they did after the first drop, and “juggernauts” which still do their jobs perfectly, but bear cracks or other deformation beyond scuffs or scrapes. The Forge, for example, shows obvious signs of fracture on one arm of the carabiner loop — it doesn’t flex or bend, though, and the seal mechanism functions as before.</p>

<p>Two of the mugs we tested kept heat inside so well, they actually made it difficult to test what we considered “normal” use because we had to dump extra cold half-and-half or ice cubes in so that we could drink from them without suffering burns. Make no mistake, this almost-magical feat is surely appreciated by those who want to drink a hot cup of home-brewed coffee eight hours after they pour it.</p>
<p>We’ve picked the The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a> (sometimes called Direct Drink) bottle as our favourite for that kind of use, since it was slightly easier for us to clean and it didn’t rattle around in our cupholders as much as the skinny Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 did. Bloomberg called this &#8220;the best mug for heat freaks” and we concur with that assessment: this mug stayed 15°F hotter than lesser mugs even when we were pouring the heat away in our 165-minute “sipping test.”</p>

<p>The Thermos performed flawlessly in our leak test, sealing its lid tight and locking with a back-up mechanism. It doesn’t seal itself every time you set it down, the way our top pick does, so you have to either close the top every time you sip or invite spills — but if you do knock it over with the lid open, it won’t spill as much as most of the other mugs we tested.</p>
<p>The Thermos &#8211; Sipp started developing a crack in the eight-foot fall. While that’s not nearly as durable as the CamelBak &#8211; Forge, the Thermos is much tougher than the other best-insulating mug, the Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 (which probably won’t close anymore if you drop it onto concrete). The Thermos is also entirely dishwasher-safe and easy to hand-wash, and has a handy loop on the back of the lid that makes it easy to carry around.</p>
<p>Note: This is one of the more confusingly-named products we researched — it’s sometimes called things like “Sipp Stainless Insulated Drink Bottle” and is nearly identical to the “Commuter Bottle.” Whatever the name, we liked it.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you need your drink to stay hot for an entire day and you don’t want to fill a giant thermos, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a> is a fantastic mini-thermos you can drink from with one hand. It kept</li>
<li>Not as durable as our top pick, but seals up like a vault and will take a drop from desk height without any problems.</li>
<li>Dishwasher safe, but also easy to hand wash</li>

Contigo is now one of the most prolific brands in the travel mug market, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160LEYFY/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Auto-Seal Transit</a> is the best model in their line.</p>
<p>Auto-sealing mugs like the transit are perfect for use at your desk, around fussy librarians or while driving. It&#8217;s basically impossible to spill anything from this mug while you&#8217;re drinking from it, and the spout prevents drips from gathering the way they will in flip-top designs.</p>
<p>Contigo mugs represent what really has become the baseline for travel mug functionality: To beat Contigo at their own game, a mug must be easy to drink from with one hand while still preventing spills, must be easier to clean, stay hot for longer, and take more abuse. The now-discontinued Camelbak &#8211; Forge was the only model that was better overall (still losing in heat retention), while the Thermos &#8211; Sipp has much better heat retention but doesn&#8217;t stop spills.</p>
<p>The Transit survived our ten-foot drop test with only a superficial crack in the easily-removed spout-cover. That cover is an interesting perk; a quick turn covers up the drinking spout to keep dirt out. It&#8217;s a nice perk that doesn&#8217;t get in the way when you don&#8217;t need it.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160LEYFY/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Safe Sipping: Contigo - Transit</h3><p>A great mug from a trusted brand that's highly durable and spill resistant. A great choice if you don't mind sacrificing heat performance and if you're OK with hand-washing.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160LEYFY/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Auto-Seal mechanism is unmatched at stopping knock-down spills, but the Transit gave up a teaspoon worth of liquid in our 30-minute tumble test. That&#8217;s a good result, but not as good as the bank-vault seal on the Thermos &#8211; Sipp. If you want to stash a mug in your bag this is not a bad pick, but we wouldn&#8217;t take it on an all-day trip with a full load of coffee inside a backpack.</p>
<p>In our temperature test, the Transit only lost 34°F of heat in the first hour, while the base-model Contigo &#8211; West Loop lost 40, so the minimal price difference is far less significant than the performance gap. That&#8217;s still a major difference from the Thermos and Zojirushi mugs, which lost less than half as much heat in the same time. The Transit&#8217;s result is in line with other good wide-mouth mugs that you can fit a sponge into, but it&#8217;s not amazing.</p>
<p>One failing of Contigo&#8217;s design is the seal mechanism: it&#8217;s a pain to clean. If you have a dishwasher or only drink clear tea, you&#8217;ll probably never have a problem with this, but you&#8217;ll still want to double-check that nothing gets stuck in the springs and levers inside this lid. The Transit&#8217;s lid is the only part you should put in the dishwasher, but the body isn&#8217;t difficult to hand wash.</p>
<p>On the whole, this is a great mug with a long heritage of good design. The price is right at about $15, and if you ever need to drink your coffee in a place where spills would be a disaster this is an excellent choice.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Contigo &#8211; Auto-Seal Transit is easy to use for one-hand-sipping without leaving you vulnerable to spills.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re looking for an affordable mug that won&#8217;t break quickly, the Transit is very good on both counts.</li>
<li>Clean-up is the only weakness in this design: The springs that seal the spout are immersed in your drink, and can&#8217;t be removed for washing.</li>
<li>For secure carry in a bag the Transit was better than most, but it did leak a teaspoon worth after half an hour in a spin-cycle.</li>

<p>From a startup company founded by rocket scientists, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DJS1LHN/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Burnout termperature regulating travel mug</a> is one of the few new products that&#8217;s trying something different. We bought this mug for our 2019 update.</p>
<p>Burnout pulls the heat out of your drink in the first minute after you pour. This neat trick is accomplished with a layer of wax that&#8217;s inside the mug&#8217;s stainless steel walls. Once the wax melts, it&#8217;ll help keep all of that heat inside the vacuum-insulated chamber, even as you drink your favorite hot beverage away.</p>
<div id="visualizer-19338-195571926" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-19338"></div>
<p>The problem with the heat-sucking material inside the Burnout is that it&#8217;s too good at its job.  If the mug starts at around room temperature, hot coffee (at just below an ideal brewing temperature of 190-200°F) will cool to 140 in fifteen minutes. If you like warm coffee instead of hot coffee, that&#8217;s probably ideal.</p>
<p>You can get a bump in heat if you take the time to boil some extra water and dump that in the Burnout for a few minutes before you add your beverage. (Pre-heating with 110°F tap water does basically nothing.)  Boiling extra water isn&#8217;t such an inconvenience for pour-over, french press and tea drinkers, but it&#8217;s a big hassle if you&#8217;re relying on a coffeemaker like <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-keurig/">our favorite Keurig</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, pre-heating with boiling water also cancels out the safety goal of this mug, since the temperature is still at a scalding 172 after thirty minutes and takes two hours to hit our preferred 155. Yes, you can pre-heat for a shorter time and add milk to fine-tune the temperature, but you can do the same with our top heat-retention pick, the Thermos &#8211; Sipp, by adding an ice cube when you pour your coffee.</p>
<p>Even if a hot-ish 135°F sound perfect to you, the biggest problem with the Burnout is the lid. This design uses an internal stopper that seals a sippy-cup spout (very much like the Contigo Autoseal designs) but with a sliding, locking toggle switch instead of a push-to-drink system. This means you don&#8217;t get automatic sealing when you stop drinking, but it&#8217;s still difficult to clean out all of the springs and levers on the inside. It can also spit out drips when you close it.</p>
<p>Worse still, even when the stopper is in the closed position, it leaks. It&#8217;ll keep dribbles from coming out if you turn it upside down, but as soon as you drop it on the floor or shake it around it&#8217;ll let drips out. The slider switch is fairly easy to use, but it&#8217;s also vulnerable to getting bumped open inside a bag; this mug did poorly in our tumble test.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s the price. If you&#8217;ve been waiting and waiting for a travel mug that would give four-hour warmth without burning your tongue, maybe $100 doesn&#8217;t sound like a lot. Compared to our other mugs, though, that&#8217;s a pretty crazy price.</p>
<p>We love the idea of this mug, but the concept just hasn&#8217;t been executed well enough to justify this price tag. If it were dishwasher safe and had a bomb-proof seal like the Thermos, maybe the price tag and fiddly work required to plan a perfect pre-heat routine would be worth it.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HYOGTTG/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48</a> has received so many accolades from reviewers, it’s hard to imagine a review that excludes it. This mug is the state of the art in vacuum insulation performance from a company with a long history of designing great food and drink containers. That said, the diminutive SA48 was so narrow and tall that it rattled around in our cupholders (and was hardest to clean inside, even with a bottle brush).</p>
<p>We also included the SA48’s sibling, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01077GFV8/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YAE48</a>, which is specifically marketed as a “Travel Mug” and seems designed to address concerns about cup holder size and the height restriction imposed by single-cup coffee machines. The wide mouth means that the YAE48 is easier to get a kitchen sponge into when cleaning, but it sacrifices insulation and leak-proof performance with that giant lid (which actually unscrewed from the body during our spin-cycle bag-leak test).</p>
<p>Neither mug is especially durable; the SA48’s lid shattered on a desk-height drop and the YAE48 wouldn’t stay closed after an eight-foot drop split it across the lock. The warranty on these mugs is also limited to insulation performance for five years, which is disappointing when the lids and locks have this many intricate parts.</p>
<h3>Contigo &#8211; Auto-Seal West Loop</h3>
<p>This is the third version of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZI5XNO/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Auto-Seal West Loop</a> design, now easier to clean than old models, and with a lock button. Sadly, the lock doesn&#8217;t prevent leaks and it&#8217;s still immersing springs in your drink.</p>
<p>The West Loop is a good mug, but the Transit is more durable and holds heat better. The only trade-off is that the Transit sacrifices dishwasher compatibility because of the silicone grip. The West Loop&#8217;s insulation is guaranteed to be safe in the dishwasher, but if you buy a painted model you can count on flaking and peeling of the finish after a few months cleaning it that way.</p>
<h3>Klean Kanteen &#8211; 16 oz. Wide-Mouth</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5470 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo.jpg" alt="Klean Kanteen mug on a white counter" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We included the winner from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/">insulated water bottle review</a>, the Klean Kanteen, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H4LUMUA/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">but in a 16 oz. size</a> to match the other mugs and with the manufacturer’s leak-proof “café cap.” (We did not include the Hydro Flask in our line-up; in our water-bottle test the 32 oz Hydro Flask didn’t insulate as well as a 20 oz Klean Kanteen, and while the flip-cap lid on the Hydro Flask is easier to use with one hand, it has all of the problems of the other drip-flip lids we tested).</p>
<p>The Klean Kanteen is still a drink container we like, but it’s not easy to open and close with one hand (and in fact took a fair bit of effort to open with two hands), and it has more parts to disassemble for cleaning than any of the other mugs.</p>
<h3>Thermos &#8211; Stainless King Travel Mug</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5471 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug.jpg" alt="solo of Thermos King stainless mug" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Thermos is the oldest and best-known name in insulated drink containers in the western world (“thermos” became such a prevalent word that US courts ruled it was legal to use as a generic term for insulated bottles in 1963). We tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DZQT0E2/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Stainless King Travel Mug</a> along with our runner-up, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a>.</p>
<p>The King is available with a handle, which may appeal to those who keep a mug in the cold and pick it up with bare hands, but we found that a trigger-action mug like our top pick was even better since we could carry it and take drinks from it even with gloves on. The twist-action closure on the Stainless King wasn’t really designed to open and close with one hand, and requires disassembly if you want to put it in the dishwasher.</p>
<h3>Stanley &#8211; Classic</h3>
<p>We’ve included this self-sealing mug, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VG761C/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stanley &#8211; Classic</a>, which only comes in their retro-lunchbox-style “hammertone” finish, as the only painted mug guaranteed dishwasher safe; the paint does seem thick and durable, and we haven&#8217;t seen reports of it chipping or peeling the way the Contigo paint does. The functionality is generally good, but it wasn’t even as leak-proof as the Contigo mugs were. The spring on the trigger-button of this mug was also much, much stronger than the other self-sealing designs, which was a big turn-off for some testers (and didn’t keep it from leaking at all). The design also had more parts to keep track of than the other self-sealing mechanisms.</p>
<h3>Bubba &#8211; Hero Elite</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0186EP0JW/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bubba</a> was included because it has the highest price to consumer rating ratio of any of the mugs we found, and the ceramic liner is a unique feature. While on the whole this mug seems a decent value, that liner didn’t prove to be an asset in any way we could find, and the way the lid collects drips and spreads them around is just annoying. The fact that the plastic ring which attaches the lid to the body just popped off in our eight-foot drop test makes us wonder how long it would take for grime and water to start collecting at that joint (even in normal use).</p>
<h3>Timolino &#8211; Icon</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0038XKF60/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Timolino &#8211; Icon</a> won top marks from <em>Cook’s Illustrated</em>, and it performed well in our cleaning and drop tests, but the drip-flip lid is a serious annoyance that was also noted by Amazon reviewers. While it didn’t break, this mug did leak around the seal every time we looked at it funny, so we wouldn’t put it anywhere near a computer bag.</p>
<h3>OXO Good Grips- SSDWTM</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-01/the-best-spill-proof-travel-mug-for-every-professional" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a> found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XF97OTI/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this OXO mug</a> quite difficult to destroy. Dropping it three times from ceiling height before giving up. We like its durability, but the push-button lid is the only one we tested that isn’t dishwasher safe, and it traps a good quantity of fluid in the spout even after it’s closed, which makes it messy to drink from.</p>
<h3>The discontinued champion: CamelBak &#8211; Forge</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5467 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge.jpg" alt="the CamelBak - Forge on a table" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><strong>Ed: the Camelbak &#8211; Forge was discontinued in 2018, and we&#8217;re sad to say that it hasn&#8217;t been replaced with an equivalent design. Our original review is preserved here for posterity.</strong><br />
The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EPGMZZS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CamelBak &#8211; Forge</a> is as smart as it is tough. The mechanism for opening and sealing the spout whenever you pull the “trigger” is simple and effective, and the Forge practically turns itself inside out for you when you need to clean it. (Even replacing the o-ring for the seal would be trivial.)</p>
<p>The Forge keeps your drink hot for a very long time; not as long as some of the mugs we tested, but well within the expected performance of a vacuum-insulated travel mug with a wide-mouth opening. Mugs with narrower openings (like our runner-up pick below) will keep the heat for longer, but that makes them harder to clean and fill.</p>
<p>In our leak test, the Forge did leave evidence that it had let out a single drop when we checked at 10 minutes into the half-hour spin-cycle test; no further leaks were found at the end of the test, and the amount lost didn’t register on our electronic kitchen scale.</p>
<p>The Forge doesn’t have a way to lock out its trigger the way Contigo’s latest designs do, but CamelBak has shaped a loop at the back of the lid that totally protects the trigger from basically anything other than your finger. It’s possible that some object of the right shape could press on it in just the right circumstances, but on the spin-cycle leak test the Forge was far more effective than the other self-sealing mugs (even the ones with locks).</p>
<p>What’s more, the loop is a convenient way to clip the Forge onto a backpack, bike bag, or just to hook a finger through, and it also prevents it from rolling if it’s knocked over. (That means it won’t just stop you from spilling coffee: it’ll also save you from that embarrassing conversation where you have to ask your coworkers if they’ve seen a mug rolling around on the floor.)</p>

<p>CamelBak has catered to the outdoor enthusiast crowd for decades, and has a great reputation for warranty work and customer service. They guarantee this mug for life against defects in the workmanship or materials, which doesn’t strictly cover things like worn rubber o-rings or driving over it with a cement truck, but when we looked for comments on repair services we found that CamelBak is often very generous.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line" class="collapse">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Caffeine keeps us alert, awake, and energized. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160LEYFY/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo &#8211; Transit</a> ensures that it will also go into your mouth, not onto your lap or computer. The easy-to-sip-from self-sealing design make it a clear winner for most uses, though it doesn&#8217;t have the best heat retention.</p>
<p>If you like your drinks at tongue-scalding temperatures, consider the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a>, which keeps boiling water too hot to drink for an hour, even with the lid off. The Thermos is also easier to clean than most mugs. It will spill if you knock it over with the lid flipped up, but when it’s locked you can rest assured it won’t come open in your bag.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After two years of testing seven different pitchers, we've determined that the ZeroWater is the best water filter pitcher. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent more than 60 hours researching and testing seven of the most popular water filter pitchers on the market. We determined the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> ZeroWater &#8211; 6-Cup Pitcher</a> to be the best water filter pitcher on the market. ZeroWater is expensive, but it deionizes the water to remove nearly everything. If you don&#8217;t need that level of purification, the new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU7973W/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; Longlast Filter</a> improves the taste of tap water and works about six times longer than the ZeroWater filter.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-found">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We spent more than 30 hours researching water, and the concerns and preferences that consumers having regarding their drinking water. We read studies on the types of contaminants that need to be filtered out to produce safe drinking water, and how the various water filters on the market work.</p>
<p>We also spoke with representatives and executives from the companies whose water filter pitchers we tested in order to learn more about how the different filters work, and what differentiates them from one another.</p>
<p>Our research also included a deep dive into sources widely considered to be authorities on water safety, such as the <a href="https://www.wqa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Water Quality Association</a> and <a href="http://www.nsf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NSF International</a>.</p>
<p>We read reviews, forums, and Reddit threads to determine which water filters were the most popular. More importantly, we looked to see which filters were certified by NSF International, a third-party organization that provides ratings and certifications for water filters, to remove harmful contaminants from water.</p>
<h3>Updates</h3>
<p>In 2017 our old favorite pitcher and filter, the Mavea &#8211; Elemaris, was discontinued. For our 2019 update, we searched far and wide to find an equivalent replacement, but nothing was better than what we&#8217;d already tried. Brita and ZeroWater are still the standout systems.</p>
<p>We switched our top pick to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater &#8211; 6-Cup Pitcher</a> with some caveats. The extreme level of purification means that ZeroWater filters don&#8217;t last as long as we&#8217;d like, and for people with heavy mineral content in their water, it probably would be cheaper to buy bulk bottled water at the grocery store.</p>
<p>ZeroWater now sells compact filters for an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012CEY1H4/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">On-The-Go cup</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073VWDJS9/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita-compatible pitchers</a>, but the expected life is just five gallons, so we didn&#8217;t even consider testing them. We looked at alternative filter replacements that might be just as good, but they weren&#8217;t actually more cost-effective than buying from ZeroWater. We also looked around for a prefilter setup or bulk refill media and didn&#8217;t find anything simple enough to recommend for most households.</p>
<p>We saw reports of improved performance in Brita&#8217;s new Longlife Filter (now certified to remove lead) and decided to test it alongside our ZeroWater pitcher in a 2019 update.</p>

<h2 id="who-should-buy">Who should buy a water filter pitcher</h2>
<p>The benefit of filtered water is primarily taste. Even the most harmless particles can change the taste of your water, whether you&#8217;re consuming it by itself or in a brewed beverage like our picks for <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-cheap-coffee/" rel="noopener">the best coffee</a>.</p>
<p>If you don’t already have a reverse-osmosis system, or some other type of water filtration system in your home, a water filter pitcher is an easy and convenient way to get clean, great-tasting water. If you live in a city that has notoriously poor tap water, having some type of water filter system is even more important.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know anything about what chemicals and minerals are slipping through your local water treatment system, water providers in the US are required to provide a &#8220;consumer confidence report&#8221; that lists testing results. You can look up a report or contact information for your local agency <a href="https://ofmpub.epa.gov/apex/safewater/f?p=136" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the EPA&#8217;s site here</a>.</p>
<p>Problems with your water might not show up on regional test, though: If you have a source of contamination in your own plumbing, or if you&#8217;re on a well or other private supply, it&#8217;s up to you to get it tested. Many water services or filter installers will test a sample of your water for free, and sometimes you can get mail-in tests for free at hardware stores, but remember that these tests are specifically designed to convince you to buy a treatment system.</p>
<p>All reputable water filter pitchers (including all five that we tested) are certified to remove a specific list of harmful contaminants by <a href="http://www.nsf.org/consumer-resources/water-quality/water-filters-testing-treatment/contaminant-reduction-claims-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NSF International</a>, an independent not-for-profit agency. While each of the water filters we tested have different certifications, all of them significantly reduce harmful contaminants in the water.</p>
<p>Filters also remove treatment additives like chlorine, which often have the most significant impact on water taste. Last but not least, filtered water won&#8217;t build up mineral scale in your <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-drip-coffee-maker/">coffee maker</a> or <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-electric-kettle/">electric kettle.</a></p>
<p>Using water filter pitchers can also be significantly less expensive and less wasteful than installing a reverse-osmosis system in your kitchen. &#8220;R-O&#8221; systems dump a lot of water down the drain, and usually take up valuable storage space under your sink.</p>
<p><b>Please note: None of the water filters we tested is certified to remove biological contamination</b>. If you get a &#8220;boil water advisory&#8221; for your area, you should boil your water for one minute (and let it cool) even if you run it through a top-rated filter system to improve the taste.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>In order to determine the best water filter, we used a combination of quantitative and qualitative tests to compare each of the water filters. The following are the tests we used in our ranking of our water filter finalists:</p>
<h3>Taste test</h3>
<p>One of the first tests we conducted was a blind taste test. To conduct this test, each of our testers were given a cup of water from each of the water pitchers without knowledge of which pitcher each cup of water came from.</p>
<p>For each cup of water, testers were asked to tell us whether they agree or disagree with six positive descriptive words, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pure</li>
<li>Crisp</li>
<li>Refreshing</li>
<li>Tasty</li>
<li>Thirst quenching</li>
</ul>
<p>They were also asked to rate each cup of water using two negative descriptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dirty</li>
<li>Artificial/chemical</li>
</ul>
<p>The MAVEA water filter (now discontinued) stood out by leading in both categories &#8212; with the best average score on positive descriptions and the best (i.e. least negative) on the negative scores.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-919" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings.png" alt="taste test rankings" width="880" height="651" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings-610x451.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings-360x266.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings-375x277.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings-414x306.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings-295x218.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings-180x133.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings-320x237.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>How quickly each water pitcher filters water</h3>
<p>We also tested each filter to determine how long it would take, on average, to filter one cup of water. While one could argue that more time might be necessary for a more thorough filtration, we still thought it was important to consider this metric &#8212; even if it wasn’t the most critical factor.</p>
<p>For this test, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HEYJ08S/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita filter</a> performed best, taking just 40 seconds on average to filter one cup of water. On the other side, the PUR filter took a shockingly long 3 minutes and 40 seconds to filter one cup of water.</p>
<p>After doing some research, we thought the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B013FQ8QHO/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PUR filter</a> we had might be defective. However, after trying filters from two different packages, our results were essentially the same.</p>
<p>Other than the PUR outlier, the slowest water filter was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater filter</a>, which took an average of 1 minute and 50 seconds to filter one cup of water. We spoke with the CEO of ZeroWater, Doug Kallam, and brought this question up. He told us that it’s true that ZeroWater filters take longer than other filters, largely because of the ion-exchange process that ZeroWater filters use to deionize the water.</p>
<p>The MAVEA water filter (discontinued), was right in the middle of the pack, averaging about 1 minute and 5 seconds per cup of water filtered.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter.png" alt="How long to filter" width="880" height="590" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-610x409.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-360x241.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-375x251.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-414x278.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-295x198.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-180x121.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-320x215.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Ergonomics</h3>
<p>While our ergonomic testing was largely qualitative, we made a point of looking for specific ergonomic elements on each water pitcher. Most importantly, we looked to see whether the pitcher was comfortable to hold, even when it was completely full of water.</p>
<p>We also checked to see how stable the pitcher was when placed on various surfaces, including tile, a table, and inside a refrigerator.</p>
<p>Finally, we made note of any additional features each pitcher had. Examples included the pour-through lid on the MAVEA and BWT pitchers and the spout on the ZeroWater pitcher.</p>
<h3>2019 update testing</h3>
<p>For our 2019 update, we pitted the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU7973W/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">new Brita &#8211; Longlast Filter</a> against the ZeroWater in a household of three, using the same methodology of double-blind taste-testing.</p>
<p>For controls, we also included unfiltered tap water, bottled distilled water and water that had been run through used-up filters from Brita and ZeroWater that were well past their useful life. The &#8220;old&#8221; ZeroWater filter allowed between 005 and 007 PPM of TDS through, right on the line for replacement; the &#8220;old&#8221; Brita filter had filtered approximately 50 gallons of water, also just past its expected life of 40 gallons.</p>
<p>When we tallied all the positive and negative taste reports, we found that the results were surprisingly close to results from our earlier test at the office. From this new group of testers, positive scores came in a bit higher overall, with negative scores reserved for tap water and the used-up ZeroWater filter.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note, however, that these testers have been using a Brita system in their home for more than a decade but mostly out of habit. When we asked them how effective they thought their Brita pitcher was before the test, they said &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t seem to be doing anything.&#8221; They were surprised at how easily they could tell the difference between the taste of tap water and a standard Brita filter.</p>
<p>We discovered that the distilled water (which had been sitting on a shelf in its plastic jug for a few months) actually had a worse taste than the tap water, &#8220;almost like an artificial flower taste.&#8221; This is an unusual result, but goes to show that storing distilled water has its own set of problems.</p>
<p>We asked our testers to rank the the taste of the top-scoring filtered water before we told them anything about tallied scores or brands, and they all picked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU7973W/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; Longlast</a> over the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater filter&#8217;s</a> taste, with the Brita standard cartridge coming in a more distant third.</p>

<p>We wanted to see how much difference filter type really makes with taste&#8217;s biggest enemy, chlorine. We called in a Hatch chlorine test kit that can detect a .01 part-per-million difference in total chlorine.</p>
<p>The tap water we tested had between 0.7 and 1 PPM of chlorine. We found that any water filter we tried, no matter how long it had been in use, would remove all detectable traces of chlorine. This lined up pretty well with what we found in taste-tests: The worst offenders for taste are the easiest to remove.</p>
<h3>Brita filters: Standard vs. Longlast</h3>
<p>We wanted to see if the new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU7973W/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; Longlast Filter</a> was more effective at removing the dissolved solids in our water than the older <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004SU18/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Standard &#8211; Filters</a>. The tap water in our testers&#8217; home reads between 250 and 300 parts per million on an electrical conductivity tester (the ubiquitous TDS tester): standard Brita filters don&#8217;t do anything to reduce the TDS count with this particular water source, but the new Longlast filter brings it down to 200.</p>
<p>That 20% change between the Brita filters is enough of an improvement that, with this household&#8217;s water, it won the taste test. After a few weeks of use, though, it seems like whatever mechanism Brita is using to get that boost is depleted and it reads the same as a standard Brita filter.</p>
<h2 id="top-pick">Top Pick: ZeroWater &#8211; 6-Cup Pitcher</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-923 size-large" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ZeroWater-6cup-1.jpg" alt="ZeroWater_TDS03" width="1024" height="683" /><br />
Of all the water filters we tested, none were able to create pure water as effectively as the aptly-named <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater filter</a>.</p>
<p>ZeroWater filters are different from all the other filters we tested. Instead of only using an activated carbon filter, ZeroWater filters actually deionize the water. In other words, the ZeroWater filter removes essentially <i>everything</i> reactive from the water itself &#8212; which is why they advertise the fact that their filters produce a reading of “000” on a “total dissolved solids” (TDS) meter.</p>
<p>In independent laboratory testing, ZeroWater consistently beats every other water filter on the market when comparing the number of dissolved solids left in the water after filtering. This includes everything from dangerous contaminants like lead, to contaminants that impact taste more than anything else &#8212; chlorine, for example.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-924 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1.png" width="880" height="608" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1-610x421.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1-360x249.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1-375x259.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1-414x286.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1-295x204.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1-180x124.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1-320x221.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The upsides of this are apparent, particularly in areas where water quality is questionable or even dangerous. For example, the Flint water crisis of 2014 left residents with drinking water that contained unsafe levels of lead and other contaminants. Water filters such as ZeroWater are able to filter those contaminants out of the water and to produce water that is safe to drink.</p>
<p>ZW gets rid of all dissolved solids. This leaves water tasting complete pure. Interestingly, this isn’t universally regarded as a good thing. That’s because not all dissolved solids are harmful. In fact, some of them, such as magnesium, are beneficial for your health <i>and</i> improve the taste of the water.</p>

The ion-exchange technology won't stay effective for long if you've got a lot of minerals in your water, but it's very consistent and effective while it lasts.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>For a popular example: Naturally carbonated bottles of water, such as Perrier and Pellegrino, contain high levels of dissolved mineral solids, which contribute significantly to their flavor profile.</p>
<p>We spoke with the CEO of ZeroWater, Doug Kallam, and he told us that ZeroWater does in fact remove the “taste profile” of water as a result of the deionization process. The plus side of this is the fact that essentially all heavy metals are removed, at rates notably higher than other filters on the market.</p>
<p>Interesting, during our testing we found that some people did not like the taste of ZeroWater, and some even thought it had a “chemical” taste. This is fascinating, because as we mentioned ZeroWater is scientifically proven to contain the fewest chemicals (if you exclude the chemical H2O). Our theory is that we are all so used to there being dissolved solids in our water (both tap and filtered) that it tastes strange to us when we drink water that is genuinely pure.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17090" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ZeroWater_TDS03-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<h3>Things we liked about the ZeroWater pitcher</h3>
<p>After using the 10-cup ZeroWater pitcher for a few years, we have to admit that it&#8217;s a bit bigger than we like. We tried out the 7-cup pitcher, and it&#8217;s easier to pour from than most 10-cup pitchers. Not only is the filled pitcher lighter, but the spout design is less likely to dribble or splash when you&#8217;re filling a narrow-neck bottle like the winner of our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/">water bottle review</a>. The spigot at the base of the 10-cup pitcher was a neat idea, but in practice it was so slow to drain, and we stopped using it. So, we&#8217;ve switched our recommendation to the 7-cup model.</p>
<p>The filters are large, but don’t require any presoak, which makes replacing the filters much easier than filters which require a presoak process before being used for drinking water.</p>
<p>We also like the fact that the ZeroWater pitcher comes with a TDS meter. Before you ask: Yes, we checked the results against another TDS conductivity meter, and no, ZeroWater isn&#8217;t tricking you with some kind of rigged tester that only works with their own filters.</p>
<p>ZeroWater instructions recommend that the filter be replaced when the meter reads “006”. This is helpful because you don’t have to remember how long it’s been &#8212; or estimate how many gallons you’ve poured &#8212; when replacing a filter. Instead, you can simply check on the TDS meter and replace when the reading hits 006.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://www.zerowater.com/docs/ZeroWaterRecycling.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZeroWater has the best recycling program</a> of all the water filters we tested. <b>ZeroWater will actually pay $5 for each filter that is returned.</b> This means that customers will be much more incentivized to hold onto the filters and send them back, reducing contributions to landfills.</p>
<h3>Things we didn’t like about the ZeroWater pitcher</h3>
<p>ZeroWater filters are the most expensive of the pitchers we tested. While this is offset by occasional email promotions and the recycling rebate, customers will still need to spend more money to filter water with ZeroWater than any other filter &#8212; particularly if they live in a city where tap water has high levels of dissolved solids.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater</a> is an excellent option for those who want the purest water possible. If you want to add back some flavor, a slice of lemon does the trick.</p>
<h3>Updated testing</h3>

The performance of the ZeroWater filters is very consistent, but expensive. We looked around for alternatives that might allow cheaper replacement of the ion exchange resin beads, but on the whole, the filter fits in at an uncomfortable middle ground. It&#8217;s just barely cheap enough to buy these filters that a DIY refill or regeneration of the media just isn&#8217;t going to be worthwhile for most people.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got more than 300 PPM of dissolved solids in your water, though, ZeroWater cartridges might need to be replaced frequently. A reverse-osmosis system that includes an ion-exchange stage is a better buy for filtering more than a gallon per day of mineral-rich water.</p>
<p>On the whole, the suitability of ZeroWater depends entirely on what&#8217;s in your water and how badly you want to filter it. If your water has a low enough mineral content (around 200 PPM) that the filter lasts for a month, you&#8217;ll be very happy with the consistency of the water you get.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater</a> filters use ion exchange technology to remove almost all dissolved solids.</li>
<li>ZeroWater&#8217;s minimal taste came in a close second in our blind preference test.</li>
<li>The compact 6-cup pitcher is easy to pour from, even while it&#8217;s still filtering.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;ve got a lot of minerals to filter out, the ZeroWater filters might be more expensive than bottled water.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="budget-pick"><b>Budget pick: Brita &#8211; 10-Cup Pitcher + Longlast Filter</b></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-926 size-large" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/BRITA_Pour-1024x683.jpg" alt="BRITA_Pour" width="1024" height="683" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HEYJ08S/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita</a> is perhaps the most well-known brand of water filter pitchers, and they are largely responsible for the growth in popularity of filter pitchers since the late 1980s when they first came to the U.S. market. They are the undisputed market leader, with more than two-thirds of the overall water filter pitcher sales.</p>
<p>The standard Brita filter doesn’t remove the number of contaminants that a filter like ZeroWater does. With the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU7973W/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">new Longlast filter, model OB06</a>, Brita is trying to up their game: In the aftermath of the Flint water crisis, it&#8217;s no mistake that &#8220;99% lead reduction&#8221; is front and center in Brita&#8217;s promotional material.</p>
<p>Which filter you choose is definitely going to be a matter of choice for most people. Brita&#8217;s system is sufficient to improve taste, and both the NSF and other independent tests show <a href="https://www.wqa.org/Find-Products/ctl/Detail/mid/1054/cid/BRITA_LP/sid/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it will remove heavy metals</a>. For the vast majority of us, chlorine reduction is going to be the major concern, and safeguarding against accidental exposure to lead, cadmium and mercury is a bonus.</p>
<p>When we checked our water with a chlorine reagent test, though, we were surprised to find out that chlorine reduction was identical between a used-up Brita filter and a new one. Even a fresh Brita filter didn&#8217;t change the taste of mineral-heavy well water when tested it.</p>

If you want the cleanest water, though, it's still not as effective as ZeroWater.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU7973W/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>Brita&#8217;s new Longlast filter is a clear winner for the cost of filtering chlorine and other easily filtered contaminants. The Longlast is also cheap enough that it&#8217;s worth trying a blind taste test yourself if you&#8217;ve already got an older Standard filter on hand.</p>
<p>Sadly, Brita doesn&#8217;t sell any pitchers packaged with a Longlast filter, but the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FXN3E74/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">10-Cup Everyday Pitcher</a> or any other standard Brita pitcher can use the new blue filter.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HEYJ08S/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; Everyday Pitcher</a> removes the worst-tasting substances (like chlorine) from most tap water.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU7973W/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita&#8217;s new Longlast filter</a> adds better performance filtering metals like lead (But you have to buy it separately).</li>
<li>Brita&#8217;s carbon filters don&#8217;t remove mineral solids to the extent ZeroWater does.</li>
<li>This system filters much more water than ZeroWater before the filters stop working, so costs are much lower.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-finalists">Other finalists we tested</h2>
<p>The other three water filter pitchers we tested all performed well. All three were able to filter out significant levels of contaminants according to NSF International, and had solid design and build quality.</p>
<h3>BWT Designer Water Filter Pitcher</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B011N5PM0S/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BWT pitcher</a> has an interesting and innovative design, and the filter itself actually adds magnesium to the water, presumably to improve taste and increase the health benefits of the water. However, some of our taste testers did not like the flavor of the water filtered by the BWT pitcher.</p>
<h3>PUR 7-Cup Ultimate Pitcher</h3>
<p>The water produced by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B013FQ8QHO/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PUR water filter</a> was polarizing among our taste testers. Some loved it, while for others it was their least favorite. After doing some digging, we found that those who had a preference for PUR water either used PUR filters in their home already, or had used them in the past &#8212; which goes to show the importance of familiarity with regards to taste.</p>
<p>From a safety perspective, PUR is on par with the other filters we tested (excluding ZeroWater), however our biggest issue with the filter was how slow it filtered, averaging nearly 4 minutes to filter 1 cup of water after several tests and three different filters.</p>
<p>The feedback we found online was mixed, with some reporting similar stories and others saying the filters needed to be “shaken and mixed.” Ultimately, we think there are simply better options to choose from, with or without slow filtration times.</p>
<h3>MAVEA</h3>
<p>This was one of our top picks, but in 2017 MAVEA stopped distributing its products in North America so we&#8217;ve moved it to our &#8220;other picks&#8221; section, but don&#8217;t want to dismiss its quality or original ranking.</p>
<p>2019 has seen the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002T2MS1Q/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">filters come back in stock</a>, which is great news for those who bought one of these pitchers a few years ago. Despite indications they&#8217;re thinking about <a href="https://www.mavea.com/faq.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">selling in North America again</a>, there&#8217;s still no sign of the pitchers at retail.</p>
<p>The design of the MAVEA stood out as particularly outstanding. The use of rubberized materials &#8212; both on the four feet and the handle &#8212; significantly improve stability when holding the pitcher or placing it on a surface. Overall, holding the MAVEA pitcher is comfortable, balanced, and stable &#8212; whether the pitcher is completely empty or completely full.</p>
<p>Unlike many of the other water filters on the market (including several we tested), the MAVEA filter does not need to be presoaked before use.</p>
<p>MAVEA also claims that the water filter works more consistently than other filters, thanks to its design. While we did not test this ourselves, the general consensus among reviewers and the others we spoke to indicates that MAVEA filters do seem to be more consistent in their filtration lifecycle.</p>
<p>Finally, one sometimes-overlooked feature is MAVEA’s recycle program. Any time you have six or more used MAVEA filters, you can use the company’s contact form to print out postage to ship the filters back to MAVEA for free. MAVEA then recycles 100% of the materials in the filter &#8212; which means you can drink clean water without worrying about contributing to environmental damage.</p>
<p>There was lots to like about the MAVEA pitcher. We hope they can bring a system to market in North America again.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-925" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Water-Filters-Group-1024x683.jpg" alt="Water Filters Group" width="1024" height="683" /></p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you’re looking for water that is as pure as possible, and completely free of <i>all </i>dissolved solids (both beneficial and harmful), the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater filter</a> is a great option, however you will be paying a little more than average for their more thorough filters.</p>
<p>Ultimately, any of the five water filters we tested will remove some contaminants from your tap water, and they easily improve the taste by removing chlorine. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU7973W/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita&#8217;s Longlast filter</a> is by far the most cost effective, filtering three times more water than most of the others and more heavy metals than the basic Brita. You&#8217;ll have to buy a Brita Pitcher to go with it, and we liked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FXN3E74/?tag=ybdwtr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">10-Cup Everyday Pitcher</a>.</p>

<p>With all the different types of water bottles — plastic, metal, glass, insulated or not — it can be confusing to pick the best one for your needs. In addition to our top pick, we’ve identified four runner-up options to give you plenty of choices to pick from, including a collapsible version.</p>
<p>Each bottle material has its own strengths, and knowing the advantages of each will help you find a bottle you&#8217;ll be happiest with. The only type of bottle to keep drinks hot <em>or</em> cold are vacuum insulated bottles. Every other type does not, and these other ones all form condensation on the outside when you put cold water inside. Check out the breakdown below for more differences:</p>
<p><a href="#best-insulated-water-bottle">Vacuum insulated bottles</a> are the best way to keep your water super cold for an entire day, or to keep beverages hot for an impressive five hours. These insulated bottles have two inner chambers, one for the water and then one surrounding that with a vacuum channel. This proves to be a very effective method for insulation, but these weigh more because of it.</p>
<p><a href="#best-glass-water-bottle">Glass water bottles</a> eliminate plastic or metal tastes and chemicals / BPAs. Being able to see how much liquid is left without having to pick up or open the bottle is a nice perk. All were covered in a silicone sleeve for drop protection (no bottles cracked or shattered in our drop tests) but glass and silicone will not insulate your water. Condensation formed on all glass and silicone surfaces even though the silicone sleeves helped improve grip.</p>
<p><a href="#best-stainless-steel-water-bottle">Stainless steel bottles</a> are an effective, low-cost option. They’re non-reactive, BPA free, and lightweight compared to glass or their insulated stainless steel counterparts. You can&#8217;t put hot water in these as directed by the manufacturers (and you&#8217;ll burn your hands). But if you just need something for short amounts of time and don’t care about insulation, it’s tough to beat the value. Some folks prefer glass to avoid the metal smell or taste, but we found no issue with tastes on these bottles at all. We also tested one aluminum bottle, which is a bit lighter but otherwise similar.</p>
<p><a href="#best-plastic-bottle">Plastic water bottles</a> are geared towards sports and workouts. Even if you&#8217;re not using it for those purposes you can still benefit from their sporty design features. Three of the bottles we tested had a flip-top lid that lets you drink using one hand, which we loved. They&#8217;re also lightweight compared to glass and insulated bottles. Every bottle we tested was made of Tritan, a material claiming to be free of BPAs, estrogenic and androgenic activity. We still found these bottles to have the strongest smell though.</p>
<p><a href="#best-collapsible-water-bottle">Collapsible water bottles</a> are perfect if you&#8217;re traveling or hiking and space is very limited. They are incredibly thin and the lightest weight option by a large margin &#8212; collapsible bottles we tested weighed eight times less than insulated bottles, and four times less than our tested plastic bottles. These do have a smell but mostly go away after a few washes.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-chose">How we chose the best bottles to test</h2>
<p>There are a lot of water bottle options out there, so we started by narrowing our list of finalists by only selecting those that fit specific criteria. There are many materials and styles these bottles are made in, so we tested five of the most popular types.</p>
<p>We searched Amazon, Reddit, forums and other water bottle reviews to find the highest quality and most popular brands of water bottles.</p>
<p>A review on Outside Online cited a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GOF6TAU/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SIGG bottle</a> that outperformed anything we’ve heard of in terms of thermoregulation, so we had to add that to the test list as well.</p>
<p>Every bottle we chose fit these criteria:</p>
<p><strong>Water capacity:</strong> It held enough water to quench thirst, but it wasn&#8217;t too big that it would be cumbersome to lug around. Many brands have larger bottles at 32 and even 64 oz capacities.</p>
<p><strong>They&#8217;re well-reviewed:</strong> Other reviews that praised bottles, and bottles on Amazon&#8217;s best-sellers list were slightly favored.</p>
<p><strong>Fewer issues with quality:</strong> Any bottles that have a higher than average history of complaints on build quality, leaking or other functional qualities were omitted.</p>
<p><strong>They&#8217;re not too specialized:</strong> We avoided bottles that were designed for very specific tasks, such as cycling.</p>
<p><strong>They&#8217;re not knockoffs:</strong> Whether it&#8217;s a knockoff or rebrand, many of these are actually the same exact bottle so we didn&#8217;t test duplicates. See more detail below.</p>
<h3>Knock-off and rebranded water bottles</h3>

<p>If you shop for water bottles online or in many retail stores, you&#8217;ll notice many brands with products that look identical. For example, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MIRA-Insulated-Double-Vacuum-Stainless/dp/B00XK4BCZ0/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mira</a> bottle we tested seems to have the same design as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Modern-Vacuum-Insulated-Bottle/dp/B01GKGEZUI/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Simple Modern</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ICONIQ-Stainless-Vacuum-Insulated-Bottle/dp/B01BFX24XG/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ICONIQ</a>, and the popular <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Swell-Womens-Teakwood-Water-Bottle/dp/B00M00OPZ4/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">S&#8217;well</a> to name a few.</p>
<p>The popular Hydro Flask looks to have the same design as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vacuum-Insulated-Mouth-Stainless-Bottle/dp/B0181FY83K/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">321 Strong</a>, Glacier Point, and Fifty Fifty.</p>
<p>Some Redditors explained the source of the many knock-offs of popular water bottle brands out there: most knock offs are just rebrands that come out of the same factory as the originals. So we assumed their performance to be the same and avoided testing any rebranded products.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more that goes into a great water bottle than meets the eye! We put our 22 finalists through an extensive series of tests to see which would come out on top. Those tests included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thermal insulation test</li>
<li>Hot water test</li>
<li>Leak and drop test</li>
<li>Condensation test</li>
<li>Usability test</li>
</ul>
<h3>Thermal insulation test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2835" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures.jpg" alt="testing water bottle temperatures with thermometer" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Since drinking room-temperature water isn&#8217;t something most people prefer, we tested every bottle for its ability to keep water cold. For the bottles that were designed for it, we tested their ability to keep water hot too.</p>
<p>We tested temperatures with an <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-digital-meat-thermometer/">instant-read thermometer</a> so the bottles only needed to be opened for a short amount of time during temperature testing.</p>
<p>Just for good measure, we tested the vacuum insulated bottles as well as the uninsulated bottles with cold water: glass bottles, plastic bottles, collapsible plastic bottles and stainless steel bottles. Starting with cold, 42°F water, we let the bottles duke it out in a temperature controlled room  and measured the temperatures along the way.</p>
<p>The cold water in uninsulated bottles rose a whopping 20°F in the first hour and coasted to room temperature after just five hours.</p>
<p>Insulated bottles, on the other hand, fared much better. It took about 20 hours for all of the bottles to reach near room temperature, which is very impressive! This means you can be sipping on ice-cold water throughout the course of a normal 8 or 10-hour day using an insulated bottle.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2976 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900.png" alt="water bottle cold water test chart" width="900" height="584" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900.png 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-610x396.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-885x574.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-360x234.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-375x243.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-414x269.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-295x191.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-180x117.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-320x208.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
It&#8217;s clear from the poor rank of the 10-ounce Sigg in this test that a big factor in keeping your drink cold is how much water is inside. With cold water (or ice), the more you can keep inside, the better it will stay cold.</p>
<h3>Hot water test</h3>
<p>Four of our five vacuum insulated bottles were suitable for use with hot water. We tested the Klean Kanteen, SIGG, Hydro Flask, and the Mira bottles. We added boiling water to each bottle, and adjusted water levels until each reached 196°F, then checked on them in even intervals.</p>
<p>We removed the lids and tested temperatures with the same instant-read digital thermometer we used on the cold water test. Hot water returned to room temperature much faster than the cold water did, but these bottles performed according to manufacturer promises.</p>

<h3>2018 Updates: 32oz bottle test</h3>
<div id="visualizer-18685-1412384986" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-18685"></div>
In 2018 we tested our new contenders in another heat retention test. This time, we picked a standard size (32 ounces) and tested with an uninsulated stainless steel bottle as a control. Water started at a rolling boil, but by the time we pre-filled and blended the water between the bottles to get a fair comparison the average temperature was 184.</p>
<p>In this test, it was once again the narrowest-neck bottle that took top position. Unlike the narrow mouth on the Mira bottle from our first lineup, Klean Kanteen&#8217;s Classic 1.7-inch opening is wide enough to fit full-size ice cubes, but it still gives an edge in insulation performance. 160 degrees after 12 hours is toasty, even on the edge of piping hot.</p>
<p>The other standout in this test is YETI, with the heavy (and expensive) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072BVN7JB/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rambler Bottle.</a> If you want top insulation with a wide-open mouth, YETI was only four degrees lower than the Klean Kanteen after a full twelve hours, compared to more than 20 degrees difference in the other wide-mouth bottles.</p>
<h3>Leak and drop test</h3>
<p>A bottle that leaks is not much more useful than a lidless cup, so we tested each bottle for leak potential. Thankfully, none of the bottles leaked with normal use and vigorous shaking or twisting, so we decided to do some drop tests to see how they stand up to some abuse.</p>
<p>We filled each bottle to 75% capacity, then dropped it from standing position three feet from the ground on its bottom, then once again on its top, and finally we pushed it off a table about three feet tall.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, all bottles remained leakproof after being dropped. All stainless steel bottles dented to some degree, and the uninsulated steel variety dented the worst, causing them to wobble when placed on a flat surface.</p>
<p>We expected the sport bottles with seemingly fragile flip caps &#8212; like the Embrava, Under Armour and the Thermos &#8212; to break or at least leak after they were dropped, but they did not. During one drop, the Embrava&#8217;s lid actually shifted off the cap threads a bit and took some force to unscrew &#8212; yet it still remained leakproof after being put back on.</p>
<p>While dropping the glass bottles, we were bracing ourselves for shattered glass everywhere with each drop, yet no bottles ever shattered. The silicone sleeves did a good job of absorbing the drop impact.</p>
<h3>Condensation test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2836" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles.jpg" alt="condensation buildup on bottles" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Condensation forms on the outside of cold water bottles because cooler air around the bottles can&#8217;t hold as much moisture as warmer air, causing the moisture to condense. This matters because it will affect grip on the bottle, as well as potential to damage electronics you&#8217;re storing in the same bag as your water bottle if enough moisture is formed.</p>
<p>Every uninsulated bottle had condensation form on the outside of the bottle when there was cold water inside. Even the glass bottles with silicone covers had condensation form on top of the covers.</p>
<p>The amount of moisture was consistent between the bottles, but varied by day, depending on the humidity. If you plan to transport bottles with laptops or other electronics, the safest option is to use a vacuum insulated bottle or room temperature water.</p>
<h3>Usability test</h3>

<p>Each bottle went through usability testing, to see how it stood up to regular use.</p>
<p><strong>Ice:</strong> We wanted to know if it was possible to add ice and how easy it was to add water. We used standard ice cubes from a freezer&#8217;s automatic ice machine. About five of the bottles we tested didn&#8217;t have mouths wide enough for ice or for cleaning with brush. Some could only fit one at a time, while many wider mouth bottles could be filled with multiple cubes at once.</p>
<p><strong>Loops and grip:</strong> We took bottles out on trips over the course of a few weeks to test how easy each was to carry. Loops in the lid made it much easier to hold a bottle at the same time as groceries, bags or keys, whereas bottles without any loops forced you to dedicate a hand to it. Loops and clips make it easy to hang bottles from a backpack too.</p>
<p><strong>Cupholders:</strong> Larger bottles and most collapsible bottles we tested were not made to fit in cupholders. Most fit fine, but some barely made the cut. We tested the bottles in our cars for fit.</p>
<p><strong>Cleaning:</strong> Before the first use and after multiple refills, we washed each bottle by hand with a bottle brushing, hot water and dish soap. This proved fairly easy for most bottles, but a few caused problems with a spout that was too small, or just because the bottle was too long.</p>

<p>After testing a variety of sizes over the last three years, the best insulated bottle is from Klean Kanteen, either the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Klean-Kanteen-Insulated-Stainless-20-Ounce/dp/B004PXWG4G/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">20-ounce wide mouth</a> if you need a compact bottle or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SA2XNWW/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">32 ounce classic</a> if you want to keep beverages cold or hot all day long.</p>
<h3>A smaller insulated bottle</h3>
<p>The wide mouth of the 20-ounce made it easy to fill with ice and to drink out of, and its slim design made it easy to fit in cupholders and bottle compartments in most backpacks. The wider mouth is a slight compromise in insulation, but for a smaller bottle you might not notice the difference since you&#8217;ll be refilling long before your ice is gone.</p>

<p>The big loop lid makes it easy to carry with a few fingers or loop onto bags with a carabiner. If you don&#8217;t care for this feature, wide mouth Klean Kanteen bottles can also take the totally leakproof <a href="http://www.kleankanteen.com/products/cafe-cap?variant=19736711878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cafe Cap 2.0</a> twist-open lid. We tested this design in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/#how-we-tested" rel="noopener">travel mug review</a>. We liked it better than cheap flip-up lids, though it&#8217;s not as good as other mugs for one-hand sipping and has a lot of parts to clean.</p>
<p>This bottle fared well in our drop tests with minimal damage to both the bottom and the lid. In the insulation tests it ranked 2nd for cold water, and 3rd for hot water. One downside of any steel bottle is that the mouth gets hot to the touch after letting it bake in the car on a hot day.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SA2XNWW?th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klean Kanteen-Classic 32-ounce</a> is a great water bottle for storing and sipping ice-cold water without as many refills. The opening is about half an inch narrower than the wide mouth on Klean Kanteen&#8217;s mug-size bottles, which means it&#8217;s a little more tricky to pack with ice, but still much easier than the wine-bottle shaped MIRA and S&#8217;WELL bottles.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re filling with ice water or some other beverage, this insulation will keep it cold (or hot) for longer than any wide-mouth bottle. Klean Kanteen also sells this same bottle design with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Klean-Kanteen-Insulated-Stainless-Growler/dp/B00X6ZNOAO" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">with a clamp-down growler lid</a> for filling up at your favorite micro-brewery. (The Growler model also works with the standard lid.)</p>

<h3>Hydro Flask vs. Klean Kanteen</h3>
<p>The 32 oz. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K5ZRUZ8/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hydro Flask</a> is a strong runner-up. Hydro Flask ranked 3rd in our cold water test and 4th in the original hot water test, but they&#8217;re a very close competitor for our top pick. The loop on the cap makes it easy to pick up with one finger if your hands are full carrying other things and the grip on the cap makes it easy to open and close the lid.</p>
<p>We interviewed loyalists for each brand, and they all have glowing accounts of how great the bottles are. They also rave about how easy it was to get a replacement cap or sometimes even a free replacement bottle after a dramatic accident.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between Klean Kanteen and Hydro Flask is in the availability of different neck shapes. Hydro Flask uses wide-mouth openings for sizes from 18 to 64 ounces, with the narrower &#8220;standard&#8221; mouth is only available in 18, 21 and 14 ounce bottles. Klean Kanteen has almost the opposite selection, with their &#8220;classic&#8221; narrow-mouth design available in sizes from 12 up to 64 ounces, with wide-mouth options in 12, 16 and 20 ounces.</p>
<p>Since the narrower mouth is better at insulating while still making ice fairly easy to add, and the 32 ounce Klean Kanteen is more affordable, we think Klean Kanteen has the edge overall. If you&#8217;re carrying a bottle packed with ice for sipping cold water on a hot day, the temperature difference is going to be less important and you should feel free to buy whichever bottle has the cap and styling you prefer.</p>
<p>Both of these brands also makes a spectrum of durable powder-coat colors that should satisfy anyone, but the availability of your favorite color might change from month to month. If you can&#8217;t find the color you like in stock, it&#8217;s probably worth checking the other brand.</p>

The 25 oz. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H9F72H1/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mira bottle</a> performed best in the cold water test. It likely gets a bump in performance due to its relatively small cap design &#8212; the main area where there isn&#8217;t vacuum insulation and where external temps would seep in.</p>
<p>The smaller opening of this bottle also comes with a downside though &#8212; it&#8217;s slightly awkward to drink out of since it&#8217;s sized perfectly to hit your nose with each sip. In the hot water test, it was not a surprise that the Mira ranked second. The 25 oz. bottle we tested was a bit on the larger side for cupholders, so if you opt for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0764P6DR2/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mira&#8217;s 17 oz. bottle</a> it would be a nicer fit.</p>

We also liked its latch mechanism, but unfortunately it's intended only for cold beverages (not hot liquids).</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E6O7CAC/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>As another great option geared for sports, we liked the 24 oz. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E6O7CAC/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Under Armour bottle</a>. It ranked fourth in our cold water test, but is by no means a poor performer given its other perks. This bottle features a spring-loaded flip cap and silicone grip makes it easy for one-handed operation while running or driving. It even has a latch to ensure the bottle stays locked during transport in your backpack or gym bag. One downside is the manufacturer says this bottle can&#8217;t be used with hot water, likely because of the plastic components in the lid.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GOF6TAU/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SIGG Thermo</a> performed best of the small bottles in our first hot water test, sadly, it&#8217;s becoming difficult to track down. Specifically designed for tea drinkers, the SIGG has a built in metal filter, if you won&#8217;t ever use that feature you can remove it for hot water or coffee. You have to separate the lid by unscrewing it which is not as simple as it should be, but it is an option. We looked at the larger versions in Sigg&#8217;s Classic series, but most owners agree they&#8217;re better as a thermos (using the cup that slides over the base of the bottle) than as a bottle to drink from.</p>

<p>Our top pick for glass bottles was the Takeya Classic 22 ounce. We loved the large cap threads around the top of the bottle, which makes it easy to open and close the cap without missing the threads.</p>
<p>This bold and simple design of the cap helps prevent it from damage when dropped too. In our drop tests there was minimal cap damage, and the silicone sleeve surprisingly prevented the bottle from shattering. The sleeve design on this bottle makes it easy to see the remaining water levels too.</p>

<p>Just like the other glass bottles we tested, there&#8217;s no insulation, but there&#8217;s also no lead or chemicals and it&#8217;s completely dishwasher safe. However, this bottle&#8217;s perfectly sized for easy holding and drinking, and the silicone grip makes it even more secure if you&#8217;re using it for sports.</p>

The silicone sleeve isn't just for looks — it also helped the Ello survive our impact tests.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BUUW476/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>We ranked the 20 oz. Ello bottle in a close second place, largely due to its simplicity. It gets the job done without features that are prone to issues. Like the Takeya, it has large threads in the cap for easy opening and closing of the lid. Its large loop on the cap lets you carry the bottle with multiple fingers, distributing the weight for comfortable carrying for longer periods of time.</p>
<p>This cap design also helped spread the impact nicely in our drop test that left no noticeable damage on the bottle. Like the other glass options, we have lots of options in silicone sleeve design and color too.</p>
<p>The little drinking spout on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B9DJWTM/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Life Factory</a> bottle might be convenient to some, but there was no other hole to let air in as you drink from it, so you basically have to waterfall from the little spout to take a sip. Although this bottle didn&#8217;t leak in our tests, the mini spout cap is very prone to popping off so you don&#8217;t want to throw this into a bag that you can&#8217;t keep an eye on.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007L6953Y/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CamelBak&#8217;</a> storable straw doesn&#8217;t have issues with potential leaks because it is easily folded back when not in use. The uncentered design of the cap loop can affect the outcome of a drop depending on how it happens to be dropped, but in our testing it fared well. The CamelBak is a well-designed bottle overall that&#8217;s easy to use, but the straw makes it pretty difficult to ensure a proper cleaning, putting it further down on our list.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard for the short <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PV9Y72W/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bKr bottle</a> to go unnoticed &#8212; it looks very well designed! This one&#8217;s basically famous for being used by celebrities and being covered in magazines. When we bought it, the price was $35; this is an astounding 2-3x the cost of the other glass options. The slanted cap made screwing the cap on particularly difficult, and the small spout makes it impossible to fit any ice or a bottle brush. The bKr bottle is definitely a design-centric purchase if you&#8217;re willing to put up with its issues and price tag.</p>

<p>The Klean Kanteen was an easy #1 pick out of the three finalists. The mouth was much bigger, easier to fill with ice and water and more pleasant to drink from. It also had a cap with bigger threads to more easily open and close the bottle.</p>
<p>Its lid was the best of the steel bottles we tested, but a bit squeaky sounding and not as smooth in opening and closing as the insulated or glass bottles. For those who want options, this brand has many cap options you can buy separately, like a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0083F0TQ4/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">sport cap</a> or a sippy cap.</p>

<p>You also can&#8217;t really appreciate the importance of the bottle&#8217;s mouth size until you&#8217;re trying to aim it under your fridge&#8217;s water dispenser. Klean Kanteen sells a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F3JJDBA/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">version of this bottle with a mouth that&#8217;s even wider</a>, but the classic is noticeably wider than the other two bottles we tested. It&#8217;s easy to sip from, but still easy for adding ice, too. All three stainless steel bottles are very basic products and similar in concept, but the Klean Kanteen is built with better materials and feels like a more polished product, making it our clear winner in this category.</p>

<p>The bottom of all of these bottles were dented in our drop test, which caused a few to wobble on the table. However, all remained leakproof afterwards. None of these were made to insulate liquids, and all had condensation running down the outside. These are a good cheap route to go if you just need to keep water cold for shorts amount of time.</p>
<p>The aluminum <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006PTIVTW/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SIGG</a> bottle is lightweight, but it has a tiny cap and threads. This made for a slightly clumsy opening and closing, and was the only bottle in this category that couldn&#8217;t fit ice in the mouth unless it was crushed. The aluminum dented slightly on the bottom in our drop test but still sat perfectly flat on a table. Even though it can&#8217;t fit ice, this bottle felt a little more polished than the Cheeki bottle.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BYGAAUE/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cheeki</a> was the largest stainless steel bottle we tested, perhaps contributing to the amount it was dented in our drop test. This bottle was noticeably uneven and even wobbled on the table after this test. Its mouth was large enough to fit ice cubes in, but the usage of the flip top lid is a bit awkward because of its small size and poor design. In terms of quality of materials, this bottle was easily the worst when you examine the cap material, design, and loop material.</p>

<p>We loved the Thermos &#8211; Intak, ranking it our top plastic water bottle. The flip top lid and single-handed use were pretty big factors that helped set this model apart. It&#8217;s tough to beat that convenience.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This bottle&#8217;s the only one that has a textured design built into the bottle to help improve grip &#8212; great for when you&#8217;re using this for sports since this bottle builds up condensation with cold water inside. </span></p>

<p>Although all of the plastic bottles we used had markings to measure liquids on the side, the Thermos has a unique ring built into the cap ranging from 1-5 so you can track how many times you&#8217;ve refilled or used the bottle throughout the day.</p>

This plastic water bottle option also features a one-piece tether that keeps the lid and cap attached to the bottle.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015DJC71C/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>We loved the look of the plastic CamelBak bottle and it proved to be very durable and leakproof. The spout has a cap that locks into the lid, which is a bit difficult to snap in each time, but it works to keep it out of the way. This bottle features a loop that keeps the lid attached to the bottle when you remove the lid for refilling too, something not present on the Embrava or Contigo or Thermos.</p>
<p>Although the the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B011LC85PM/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Embrava</a> and the Contigo also had single-handed operation, the Embrava was slightly on the small side, with six ounces less capacity than the top ranking Thermos. Embrava&#8217;s next size up is a whopping 32 ounce bottle, which is a bit on the large side. However, we appreciated the spout&#8217;s added air vent in the cap for easier drinking. The flip cap was surprisingly strong in our drop test too. If you prefer a slightly smaller bottle than the Thermos and can get past Embrava&#8217;s design aesthetics, this was a close runner up.</p>
<p>Both the CamelBak and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NCDE8Y/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Nalgene</a> had large threads for an easy opening lid and a wide mouth for cleaning and adding ice. However, the Nalgene had pretty bad plastic smell, even after a few washes. It looks like many other owners of this bottle had this issue too, although many reported no smells. Perhaps they vary by bottle or manufacturing batch, but this factor, combined with a very cheap looking lid, pushed this bottle further down our list.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A74ZU18/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo Autoseal</a> has a unique button you hold on the back to open the drinking spout. This bottle was leakproof when the button isn&#8217;t held, but it&#8217;s far too easy for that button to be pressed when thrown into a bag. Having to put your mouth on the bottle proved to be a little weird, and almost like a toddler&#8217;s sippy cup, but it has an air valve so you can drink without having to waterfall.</p>
<p>These bottles are not for hot beverages. If you&#8217;re looking for a hot beverage bottle take a look at our vacuum insulated stainless steel pick above. All five bottles we tested were made of the copolyester, Tritan, which is a trademark of Eastman Chemical Company. This material is popular because it&#8217;s impact resistant, free of BPAs, as well as estrogenic and androgenic activity. However,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> every bottle we tested, including the collapsible plastic bottles, were made from BPA-free plastic.</span></p>
<h2 id="best-collapsible-water-bottle">Best collapsible: Vapur &#8211; Element</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3083 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-collapsible-water-bottle.jpg" alt="best collapsible water bottle (Vapur Element)" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-collapsible-water-bottle.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-collapsible-water-bottle-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-collapsible-water-bottle-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-collapsible-water-bottle-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-collapsible-water-bottle-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-collapsible-water-bottle-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-collapsible-water-bottle-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-collapsible-water-bottle-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-collapsible-water-bottle-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Our top pick was the Vapur &#8211; Element bottle. This bottle has a flip-top cap for easy access, but it also closes securely with an audible click and will not pop off accidentally in your bag. The Vapur and the Tap were the only two we tested with mouths wide enough for ice cubes and for a brush to fit inside for thorough cleaning.</p>

It's durable and made with quality materials. We also like its vibrant color options.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007UU6JI0/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>This was a 0.7L model, and you can get the most of that capacity by first blowing up the bag to expand it before adding water. Materials and construction on this bottle are excellent and should last for many years of use. In addition, it&#8217;s light weight and easily folded, which makes it great for taking on runs, hikes, or stowing away into luggage or carryons when traveling.</p>
<h3>The other collapsible water bottles we tested</h3>

<p>Our second pick for collapsible bottles was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B575B96/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Tap</a>, which was sold in a pack of two. Like the Vapur, it has high quality construction and has a wide mouth for ice cubes and for cleaning with a bottle brush. Cleaning is much harder without a wide mouth since it wouldn&#8217;t clean well in a dishwasher. This bottle has a carabiner for convenience, but is only pushed to second place because lack of a convenient spout when compared to the Vapur.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012H5QDYW/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aquabod</a> is a unique bottle since you can roll it up, secure it, then stash in your gym bag or backpack until you&#8217;re ready to use it. It&#8217;s also the only collapsible one we tested made of silicone. The bottle has a neat spout designed to limit how much water comes out, but both the cap and the carabiner felt cheap compared to the others.</p>
<p>Although all these bottles have some flop to them when you drink, the Aquabod was extra floppy since there&#8217;s less structure to it, forcing you to use two hands to drink most of the time. The flop also makes it difficult (but not impossible) to put this bottle into a backpack&#8217;s bottle pocket, making clipping with the carabiner the way to go.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t need a carabiner, you might appreciate the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0076ZSR3Y/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Platypu</a>&#8216; more utilitarian design, and slim center for easier handling. Its mouth was too small for ice or a cleaning brush, so you might have to boil it or do lots of manual shaking to get it clean. The only reason to go with a Platypus is to utilize the push-pull cap option they have. For us, we would rather just go with the Tap bottle with a carabiner and wider mouth.</p>
<p>All bottles had a slight smell &#8212; plastic or otherwise, before the first wash. You might have to wash it a few times or soak it in vinegar and water to get rid of most of the smell and taste. If you&#8217;re very sensitive to smells, you may want to consider another bottle material altogether.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">The bottom line</h2>
<p>What better way to stay hydrated throughout the day and your workouts than by bringing along a bottle? There are so many <em>types</em> of water bottles and seemingly endless varieties within those that it helps to narrow down your search first.</p>
<p>We found it best to start your search by thinking about what you&#8217;ll be using the bottle for most.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ll be stowing a bottle in a bag which may contain electronics or other moisture-sensitive items you want to keep away from condensation, a vacuum insulated bottle is the best option for you. Specifically our top pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004PXWG4G/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klean Kanteen</a>. This is the only type of bottle suitable for hot beverages. This bottle is also our overall top pick too, because of its wide mouth design and easy usability and maintenance. This brand also has some well-loved lid options to fit your needs like the new <a href="http://www.kleankanteen.com/collections/accessories/products/cafe-cap?variant=19736711878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cafe Cap 2.0</a>, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0093IKZGY/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Flip D-Ring</a> lid.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re on the move or prefer something lighter, something made of plastic might be the best fit for you. For extreme portability at the cost of some utility, our top pick for collapsible bottles was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007UU6JI0/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vapur Element</a>. If you&#8217;re just hitting the gym or just want something lightweight and convenient to use at your desk, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002VJX4C4/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos Intak</a>.</p>
<p>Although all the plastic bottles we tested were BPA-free, some still had an odd smell. If you&#8217;re particularly sensitive to that kind of thing and don&#8217;t care about insulation, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EAIW5MY/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klean Kanteen &#8211; Classic stainless steel bottle</a> is a good option for you, thanks to its wider-than-normal mouth and easy-to-use loop cap.</p>
<p>And if you don&#8217;t mind a little weight and like the clear look and vibrant designs that come with glass bottles, then we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003DTLNY2/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Takeya Classic</a>. Glass is totally safe for the dishwasher, and is void of any smells or concerns about chemicals and tastes we have with the other bottles. Even if you&#8217;re a bit of a klutz, our tests showed these all are capable of surviving a few drops.</p>

<p><em>(Editor’s note: We revisited this review of electric kettles and learned that our top pick, the Hamilton Beach &#8211; 40996 has been discontinued and replaced with a newer model, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758BZKQN/?tag=ybdktl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 41020</a>. We decided to test the new model along with two new Proctor Silex kettles. The Hamilton Beach &#8211; 41020 performed just as well as its predecessor, and we now select it as our top pick.)</em></p>
<h2>How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We spent 55 hours researching and testing electric kettles. This testing included one month of daily use for each of our six finalists in order to determine which one really is the best pick for typical, day-to-day use.</p>
<p>We read through more than 80 articles, forum and Reddit threads, and expert opinions from coffee and tea enthusiasts to determine which brands were most respected and offered the most value. While there wasn’t an overwhelming consensus, we were able to find that certain brands and products seem to have the most consistently-positive feedback.</p>
<p>Since there are literally thousands of electric kettles on the market, our first step was to narrow down the field. During our research, we found that there are a few features that consistently ranked as the most important to users, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>No harmful materials</li>
<li>Easy to clean</li>
<li>No potential rust issues</li>
<li>Automatic shutoff</li>
<li>Sufficient water capacity (at least 1 liter)</li>
<li>Ability to quickly heat water</li>
<li>A safe and comfortable handle</li>
<li>A large and easily accessible opening for water</li>
</ul>
<p>These metrics made it possible for us to significantly narrow the field. From there, we researched dozens of brand names and models to determine which were most likely to perform the best during our in-house testing.</p>
<p>While there are electric kettles available in the $100+ range, we found that there was little to no difference in the features they offered. Often, the differences were cosmetic or there was a premium paid for a brand name.</p>
<p>During our testing, all of the kettles consistently heated up water to the boiling point in minutes. However the new Hamilton Beach &#8211; 41020 and the T-fal could also be programmed to lower settings, which is important for brewing different teas and French press coffee.</p>
<p>Once our finalists were selected, we ran them through a number of metrics-driven tests which helped us determine which were the best at the sole function — heating water quickly and safely. We also took into account factors such as the ergonomics of each kettle and extra features offered by each product, along with several other factors to ultimately select our best pick.</p>
<h2 id="compare">Compare the best electric kettles</h2>
[table id=319 /]
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Build quality</h3>
<p>When looking for an electric kettle, the first thing you should consider is the build quality of the kettle itself. While these gadgets are fairly simple from a technical standpoint, it does incorporate several elements that, if unreliable, will render the kettle essentially useless.</p>
<p>For example, an unreliable heating element will cause the kettle to heat to unpredictable temperatures if it heats at all. Similarly, if the interior of a kettle is prone to lime build-up or “scaling,&#8221; the effectiveness of the kettle can be negatively impacted.</p>
<h3>Heating efficiency</h3>
<p>When choosing an electric kettle you should consider how efficient the kettle is in heating water.  One of our tests was measuring  “degrees per minute,&#8221; which presented a clear picture of each finalist&#8217;s heating capability.</p>
<h3>Ergonomics</h3>
<p>The ideal kettle will be easy to pick up, carry and pour. This is particularly important, given that the kettle will be holding boiling-hot water. Ergonomics are difficult to quantify numerically; however, for a kettle to be ergonomic, it should be easy to hold in one hand. Ideally the handle would be made from a heat resistant material that protects your hand from the hot kettle.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4033 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-handle.jpg" alt="vonshef handle closeup" width="750" height="497" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-handle.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-handle-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-handle-360x239.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-handle-375x249.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-handle-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-handle-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-handle-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-handle-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Minimum and maximum water capacity</h3>
<p>The maximum water capacity will determine the number of hot drinks that an electric water kettle can make at one time. In general, the larger the maximum water capacity, the more versatile the kettle.</p>
<p>However, one metric that is considered less often is the <i>minimum</i> water capacity the kettle can support. With some of the higher-capacity kettles, as much as 1 liter of water at minimum is needed to safely run the kettle.</p>
<h3>Programmable temperature</h3>
<p>Programmable water temperature isn’t a necessary feature for everyone. However, if you want to heat water to the optimal temperature for certain types of tea, then a kettle with temperature settings that can be programmed is your best option. As we discussed in <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-tea-maker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our review of the best tea maker</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black and herbal teas should be brewed at the full 212° F boil.</li>
<li>Oolong teas are best steeped in water ranging between 180° and 190°.</li>
<li>Both white and green teas should be steeped in water no hotter than 185° (or as low as 170°) to maintain their flavors and prevent bitterness.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4034 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hamilton-beach-temp-lcd.jpg" alt="close-up of hamilton beach temperature readout" width="750" height="497" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hamilton-beach-temp-lcd.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hamilton-beach-temp-lcd-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hamilton-beach-temp-lcd-360x239.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hamilton-beach-temp-lcd-375x249.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hamilton-beach-temp-lcd-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hamilton-beach-temp-lcd-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hamilton-beach-temp-lcd-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hamilton-beach-temp-lcd-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Temperature readout</h3>
<p>While a temperature readout is an essential feature on an electric kettle, it is nice to  glance at a  readout and see how close the water is from being fully heated.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>The first thing we looked at was the general build quality — which kettles were built to last? During our research, we found that many of the complaints about electric kettles online was that they were prone to rusting, chipping or otherwise deteriorating with regular use. We tested all of our finalists over the course of a month to ensure that they did not show any early signs of deterioration.</p>
<p>Since the rapid heating of water is one of the primary draws of an electric water kettle, we also took the speed at which each kettle could heat water as a major factor in ranking each finalist. To do this, we measured how long it took each kettle to heat 1 liter of room temperature water to 212°.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4035 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kettle-data-comparison-chart.png" alt="kettle data comparison chart" width="880" height="380" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kettle-data-comparison-chart.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kettle-data-comparison-chart-610x263.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kettle-data-comparison-chart-360x155.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kettle-data-comparison-chart-375x162.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kettle-data-comparison-chart-414x179.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kettle-data-comparison-chart-295x127.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kettle-data-comparison-chart-180x78.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kettle-data-comparison-chart-320x138.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We also tested temperature accuracy. For the non-programmable kettles, this simply meant measuring how close to 212° the kettles got before shutting off. For the programmable kettles, we tested each of the settings to see how close to the stated temperature the water actually was.</p>
<p>We strongly considered the ergonomics of the kettle. Since both the kettle itself and the liquid inside are boiling hot (or close to it), it’s important that the kettle be comfortable in your hand, both when moving it around and also when pouring.</p>
<p>Some of the kettles we tested have a feature which keeps the water at a specific temperature for as long as one hour. The advantage of this is that you don’t have to keep reheating water each time you refill your cup.</p>
<p>It’s imperative that kettles turn off automatically if and when all of the water inside has been dispensed or boiled off. We tested each kettle for a reliable “auto-off” feature.</p>
<p>Finally, we tested for early signs of scaling and rust over the course of our one month testing period and then over the next six months checked periodically for any signs of deterioration.</p>
<h3>Preventing rust and scaling in your kettle</h3>
<p>During our research, we found that one of the best ways to prevent rust and scaling issues is to perform basic maintenance. This can be as simple as emptying out unused water, and for some kettles, an equal combination of white vinegar and water can be boiled in the kettle.</p>
<h2 id="electric-or-stovetop">Electric or stovetop?</h2>
<p>While there’s nothing inherently wrong with using a stovetop kettle, there are several advantages to using an electric kettle that are worth considering — particularly if you’ve never owned one before.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4037 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stovetop-vs-electric-kettle.jpg" alt="side by side: stovetop kettle vs. electric" width="750" height="547" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stovetop-vs-electric-kettle.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stovetop-vs-electric-kettle-610x445.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stovetop-vs-electric-kettle-360x263.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stovetop-vs-electric-kettle-375x274.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stovetop-vs-electric-kettle-414x302.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stovetop-vs-electric-kettle-295x215.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stovetop-vs-electric-kettle-180x131.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stovetop-vs-electric-kettle-320x233.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>First off, electric kettles can be used in more places since they don’t require a stovetop to heat water. This is particularly valuable in situations such as a college dorm room or for a traveler staying in a hotel, but it’s useful even in a full-sized kitchen as well.</p>
<p>Electric kettles also heat up water faster than a stovetop kettle, and several models we tested could maintain the heated water temperature for up to one hour. Another advantage is that most electric kettles automatically shut off when the water level is too low or boiled off.</p>
<h2 id="best">Best overall: Hamilton Beach &#8211; 41020</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758BZKQN/?tag=ybdktl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 41020</a> is the upgraded model of our former top pick, the Hamilton Beach &#8211; 40996, and with its precise temperature controls and more user-friendly features than the prior model, the 41020 easily wins our top pick.</p>
<p>The new Hamilton Beach kettle has been completely redesigned. The older model sat on a programmable base, which we previously found somewhat tricky to learn to use. The new model still sits on a base, but i’s programming has all been integrated into the kettle’s handle. Setting a heating function is now simple: you push a preset button, and then press start.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach has five programs for different types of teas and a separate program for heating water to 200° for a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-french-press/">French press coffee maker</a>.</p>
<p>The programs’ heating times range from 2 minutes 45 seconds (160° to 4 minutes 26 seconds (full boil). When the water hits the desired temperature, the kettle beeps six times to alert you it’s ready. We tested each program with an instant-read thermometer, and the programmed temperature was hit every time. As with the older model, the 41020 has a helpful “keep warm” function, which keeps the water hot at the desired temperature for 30 minutes.</p>

<p>The kettle is made of an attractive brushed stainless steel, which does get very hot. However, its large handle is curved enough away from the kettle so your fingers won’t ever get burned. An “open” button on the handle automatically opens the lid, and a nice touch is the silicone “close” button that prevents your touching the hot lid. Other features we like are the automatic shut-off when water gets too low and its mesh filter that easily slides in and out of the kettle’s spout.</p>
<p>The only thing we didn’t like about it is that the clear window that shows water level is directly behind the handle and hard to see. The window is illuminated with blue light when the kettle is plugged in, but we would prefer if the window was positioned on the side of the kettle, so we wouldn’t need the light to discern the water level.</p>
<p>This kettle is about $10 more than the older model, but with its smart redesign and easy-to-use programming, it’s superior to all of the less-expensive kettles we previously tested.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Hamilton Beach &#8211; 41020 is an updated model that’s been completely redesigned with easy-to-use features.</li>
<li>The kettle’s settings have been integrated into the large, curved handle, which can be programmed by simply pushing one or two buttons.</li>
<li>Its 6 preset temperatures for different types of tea and French press coffee are spot-on accurate.</li>
<li>It’s slightly more expensive than other kettles, but it’s superior to all of the electric kettles we tested.</li>

<p>If you would prefer something other than a stainless steel kettle and don&#8217;t mind a 1-liter maximum capacity, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0086UJQN8/?tag=ybdktl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">T-fal &#8211; BF6138</a> is our runner-up.</p>
<p>The T-fal has a slightly-quirky design tailored for college students and young adults, however, the black and green color scheme can also work in most kitchens, while the functionality of the kettle makes it an option worth considering. It’s short stature and small footprint make it ideal for situations where space is limited.</p>
<p>The T-fal offered the fastest heating of all the finalists we tested. It took the kettle just under four minutes to heat one liter of water from 67.5° to 211.5°, for a rate of 36.46°  per minute. It has three different heat settings: a low of 160°, a mid-range of 190° and a high of 212°.</p>
<p>The T-fal makes it nearly impossible to accidentally burn your hand while using it. The sturdy handle makes pouring easy and controllable, while the outside of the kettle remains fairly cool to the touch.</p>
<p>Many plastic electric kettles had a heating element that was inside the water reservoir itself. This means that the heating element is directly exposed to the water, ultimately leading to lime buildups or other residues. Conversely, the T-fal has a heating element that is located entirely separate from the water. The inner bottom of the kettle is metallic, which allows for safe and efficient transfer of heat.</p>

<p>The biggest issue we had with the T-fal kettle was that it doesn&#8217;t have auto-on and auto-off options. Once the water is fully heated, the kettle turns off and doesn&#8217;t keep the heated water hot. While it&#8217;s not a deal breaker, we would have preferred if the T-fal had specific temperatures for each of its three settings.</p>
<p>Finally, the 1-liter maximum capacity is somewhat limiting, especially if you’re trying to serve multiple people at the same time. However, if you&#8217;re just heating up water for one or two people, the T-fal works just fine.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Because of its compact size, the T-fal &#8211; BF6138 is a great budget option for small kitchens or college dorm rooms.</li>
<li>It has three temperature settings that heat up faster than all of the kettles we tested.</li>
<li>Although the T-fall doesn&#8217;t have as many functions as more expensive kettles, its smart ergonomic design prevents burns and makes pouring easy.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00023XCWS/?tag=ybdktl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Proctor Silex &#8211; K2070Y</a> is very similar to the discontinued Sunbeam that we reviewed, and we tested it to see how it compared. The Proctor Silex &#8211; K2070Y is a 1-liter-capacity plastic kettle that feels very lightweight and not well put together. Its wobbly plastic lid is connected to the kettle with two small screws, and the mesh filter fits into the spout by two plastic tabs, which could easily snap off.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the kettle has a wavy blue window on one side that clearly shows the water level. The kettle brought room-temperature water to a roiling boil in 6 minutes, although it took another 16 seconds for the kettle to automatically shut off. The Proctor Silex &#8211; K2070Y is very inexpensive, and if you don’t mind its cheap construction, it will certainly boil water, but we can’t predict for how long.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074T6GX6R/?tag=ybdktl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Proctor Silex &#8211; 41007</a> is the company’s most recent model. It’s a plastic 1.7-liter kettle that sits on top of a plastic base. Like the K2070Y, it has a side window to show water level, but because it’s uncolored, you can’t really see how much water you’ve poured in unless you look closely. When it’s heating, the kettle gets very hot, but its handle is curved enough so you won’t get burned when pouring.</p>
<p>The 41007 has a chrome-colored plastic dial for changing the four settings programmed for green, white, oolong and black teas. The dial doesn’t click into place, but rather slides between settings, so you need to be careful that you’ve turned it precisely to the desired setting or the temperature won’t be accurate.</p>
<p>It took from 3 to 5 minutes for the water to heat to the programmed temperatures ranging between 160 °F to 210 °F. If you’re unsure what temperature water should be heated for a particular type of tea, you’ll need to find that information elsewhere, because it’s neither on the kettle nor in the instruction manual.</p>
<p>Overall, the Proctor Silex &#8211; 41007 is a decent kettle, and it’s half the price of our top pick. But if you are a tea lover and want accurate temperatures, the Hamilton Beach &#8211; 41020 will better meet your needs.</p>

<p>The Hamilton Beach &#8211; 40996 had been our previous overall top pick, but it&#8217;s been discontinued and replaced by 41020.  The classy Hamilton Beach &#8211; 40996 is primarily made from stainless steel, with solid black plastic on the base, handle and opening for water. The inside of the kettle is solid stainless steel as well and the heating element is located entirely on the base pad.</p>
<p>Although the base is made of plastic, it does function well, although programming its five temperature settings does take a bit of a learning curve. Follow the instructions manual carefully, and before long you&#8217;ll get the hang of it.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach kettle heated one liter of water from 67.3° to 212.2° in 4 minutes and 2 seconds, for a rate of 35.93 degrees per minute. By comparison, the T-fal heated one liter of water from 67.5° to 211.5° in 3 minutes and 57 seconds, for a rate of 36.46 degrees per minute.</p>
<p>While the T-fal kettle is slightly faster, it’s important to also consider that it&#8217;s limited to heating no more than one liter at a time. The Hamilton Beach kettle can heat nearly twice as much.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach has an automatic shut-off function.  Once the water hits the programmed temperature, a one-hour timer starts counting down on the base display. Like the other programmable kettles, it shuts off when the water level is below its internal sensor or one hour later, whichever is first.</p>
<p>One notable issue that we took into account was consumers complain that the Hamilton Beach breaks down in six-months&#8217; time. We used the Hamilton Beach for nine months after our initial testing, and we had none of the mechanical issues that were previously reported.</p>
<h3>VonShef &#8211; 13/140 (discontinued)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4039 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef.jpg" alt="VonShef kettle on a table" width="750" height="497" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-360x239.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-375x249.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><em>(Editor’s note: In 2019 we learned that VonShef &#8212; a U.K. company &#8212; has updated the model we reviewed. However, although it’s available for purchase on the VonShef website, it’s not yet sold on Amazon.)</em></p>
<p>The VonShef &#8211; 13/140 kettle came the closest of the remaining four electric kettles to be listed as one of our picks. It is a good-looking kettle that heats water comparable to the rest of our finalists. That, in conjunction with its glass siding and blue lighting, makes it a classy addition to any kitchen. However, because of its high price point, we can&#8217;t recommend it over the Hamilton Beach.</p>
<h3>Sunbeam &#8211; SEK17 (discontinued)</h3>
<p><em>(Editor’s note: Since our review, the Sunbeam &#8211; SEK17 was discontinued, and Newell Brands, the company that owns Sunbeam, is no longer making electric kettles under the Sunbeam brand name.)</em></p>
<p>The Sunbeam &#8211; SEK17 kettle simply boils to 212°, and if you&#8217;re willing to regularly clean the exposed heating element with white vinegar and water, we found it to be a reliable option for the budget-conscious.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Ultimately we found that for less than $50, you can get an electric kettle that does more than just boil water. If you&#8217;re a tea or coffee lover, our new top pick the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758BZKQN/?tag=ybdktl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 41020</a> is an upgraded and attractive stainless-steel kettle that will work with any kitchen decor. Its six  precise temperature settings have been integrated into the kettle&#8217;s handle and  can be easily programmed at the touch of a button.</p>
<p>Our runner-up, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0086UJQN8/?tag=ybdktl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">T-fal &#8211; BF6138</a>, has three temperature settings and can only hold one liter. However if you&#8217;ve got a small kitchen or you&#8217;re a college student in a dorm or traveler in a hotel room, the T-fal is great space-saving electric kettle.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We tested both of these popular water filters against each other, and the rest of the market, in order to come away with a recommendation for a filter pitcher you should use in your home. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>oth Brita and ZeroWater filters make tap water safe to drink. However, we wanted to know which was the best option for consumers. After more than 50 hours of research and testing, including four months comparing Brita and ZeroWater pitchers side-by-side, we&#8217;ve determined that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater &#8211; 6-Cup Pitcher</a> is the better choice of the two and stands out as the best water filter pitcher on the market.</p>
<p>In order to determine the best water filter pitcher on the market, we tested five of the leading water filter pitchers, and compared them against one another.</p>
<p>This review will focus on the differences between the Brita water filter and the ZeroWater filter. But check out our full <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/" rel="noopener">best water filter review</a> if you&#8217;re curious about the competiton.</p>

<p>In order to compare the Brita and ZeroWater filter pitchers, we noted differences in water filter quality, ergonomics, water filter speed, and a taste test. We also used our general impressions of the products during everyday use over the course of two years of in-home testing.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="water-filter-quality">Water filter quality</h2>
<p>When buying a water filter pitcher, the first and most important metric is how effective the filter actually is at removing harmful substances. Both Brita and ZeroWater have received certifications from <a href="http://www.nsf.org/newsroom/statement-regarding-flint-water-system-lead-issue-and-to-certification-nsf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NSF International</a>, which ensures that both are able to remove lead and other specific harmful materials from municipal tap water.</p>
<p>However, both NSF International and other reports have determined that the ZeroWater filter is significantly better than other filters on the market — Brita included — when it comes to removing virtually <em>all</em> harmful contaminants from tap water.</p>
<p>This is because ZeroWater utilizes a 5-stage filter which includes a large amount of ion-exchange resin, a technology commonly used in reverse-osmosis systems. The ZeroWater filter attracts metal ions in the water, which effectively eliminates all inorganic dissolved solids like metals. This is why ZeroWater (accurately) reports that their water has zero “dissolved” solids — a point they prove by including a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002C0A7ZY/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TDS tester</a> with their pitchers.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-923 size-large" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ZeroWater_TDS03-1024x683.jpg" alt="ZeroWater TDS Reading 000" width="1024" height="683" /></p>
<p>The Brita filter, on the other hand, utilizes an industry standard two-stage activated carbon filtration system. It’s worth noting that this filter has been an industry ever since Brita popularized the water filter when the brand first started selling in North America in 1988. There are actually some ion-exchange beads in a Brita filter, too, but not nearly on the same scale.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when it comes to a straight comparison of which water filter works best, it is largely undisputed that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001CUQ1C8/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater filters</a> are the best in the industry.</p>
<h2 id="ergonomics">Ergonomics of each water filter pitcher</h2>
<p>The ergonomic of a water filter pitcher are important as well. A water pitcher should be easy to hold and easy to pour. In addition, the pre-filtered water reservoir should be large enough to fill at least half of the pitcher.</p>
<p>Both the Brita and ZeroWater pitcher reservoirs were able to fill at least half of the pitcher itself, so we looked at the remaining ergonomic factors to differentiate between the two.</p>
<p>We found the Brita pitcher to be somewhat awkward to hold and pour. The weight doesn’t feel particularly balanced, particularly in conjunction with the handle itself. Overall, the Brita pitcher feels like a simple, utilitarian product without much emphasis placed on aesthetic or ergonomic elements.</p>
<p>While we don’t expect the ZeroWater pitcher to be winning any awards for artistic inspiration, we did find the ZeroWater pitcher to be a more ergonomic experience overall. In addition to being easier to hold and to pour, the handle felt more comfortable in our hands.</p>
<p>The first ZeroWater pitcher we tried was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0073PZ6O0/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater &#8211; 10-Cup Pitcher.</a> This design has a spout on the bottom of the pitcher, which is a great idea for those who don&#8217;t want to lift a heavy pitcher all the time, but the flow rate is so slow that one test family said they totally ignored it after a week.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re after a pitcher that&#8217;s more convenient, we like that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater – 6-Cup Pitcher</a> fits more easily in a refrigerator and isn&#8217;t so heavy when full. You&#8217;ll definitely have to refill it every time you use it, though.</p>
<h2 id="water-filter-speed">Water filter speed</h2>
<p>The next metric we measured was the amount of time each water filter took, on average, to filter one cup of water. While water quality and ergonomics are certainly more important considerations, we still found that the ability to filter water reasonably quickly was valuable, particularly for anyone having guests over.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter.png" alt="how long to filter water" width="880" height="590" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-610x409.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-360x241.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-375x251.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-414x278.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-295x198.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-180x121.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-320x215.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>This is one area in which the Brita water filter really stood out. We found the Brita water filter did its job significantly faster than the rest of our finalists, averaging just 40 seconds per cup of water filtered.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HEYJ08S/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brita-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brita-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brita-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brita-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brita-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brita-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brita-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brita-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brita.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Low-Priced and Fast: Brita</h3><p>The Brita water filter leads the industry, with around 70% of the pour-through water filter market. It is inexpensive and filters water quicker than all of the water filter pitchers we tested.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HEYJ08S/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Our ZeroWater filter, on the other hand, was on the other end of the spectrum with an average of one minute and 50 seconds per cup of water filtered — second only to the incredibly slow PUR water filter, which averaged an astonishing three minutes and 50 seconds per cup of water filtered.</p>
<h2 id="taste-test">Water filter taste test</h2>
<p>Comparing the taste of two different water filters is difficult, largely because it is simply so subjective. Nevertheless, we did set up a taste test, and found that Brita beat ZeroWater overall.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-919" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings.png" alt="water filter pitcher taste test" width="880" height="651" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings-610x451.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings-360x266.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings-375x277.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings-414x306.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings-295x218.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings-180x133.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taste-test-rankings-320x237.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The first score was based on positive taste attributes (clean, pure, refreshing, etc.), with a maximum of 30 points possible. Brita earned a positive score of 21.125, while ZeroWater received a score of 20.8125.</p>
<p>The second score was based on negative taste attributes (dirty, artificial), with a maximum score of 10 (lower is better). Brita earned a negative score of 3.75, while ZeroWater received a score of 3.875.</p>
<p>Ultimately, while Brita did beat ZeroWater in both categories, the differences in each score were fairly minor.</p>
<h3>2019 update testing</h3>
<p>For our 2019 update, we pitted the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU7973W/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">new Brita &#8211; Longlast Filter</a> against the ZeroWater in a household of three, using the same methodology of double-blind taste-testing.</p>
<p>For controls, we also included unfiltered tap water, bottled distilled water and water that had been run through used-up filters from Brita and ZeroWater that were well past their useful life. The &#8220;old&#8221; ZeroWater filter allowed between 005 and 007 PPM of TDS through, right on the line for replacement; the &#8220;old&#8221; Brita filter had filtered approximately 50 gallons of water, also just past its expected life of 40 gallons.</p>
<p><strong>When we tallied all the positive and negative taste reports, we found that the results were surprisingly close to results from our earlier test at the office.</strong> From this new group of testers, positive scores came in a bit higher overall, with negative scores reserved for tap water and the used-up ZeroWater filter.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note, however, that these testers have been using a Brita system in their home for more than a decade, but mostly out of habit. When we asked them how effective they thought their Brita pitcher was before the test, they said &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t seem to be doing anything.&#8221; <strong>They were surprised at how easily they could tell the difference between the taste of tap water and a standard Brita filter.</strong></p>
<p>We discovered that the distilled water (which had been sitting on a shelf in its plastic jug for a few months) actually had a worse taste than the tap water, &#8220;almost like an artificial flower or perfume taste.&#8221; This is an unusual result, but goes to show that storing distilled water has its own set of problems.</p>
<p>We asked our testers to rank the the taste of the top-scoring filtered water before we told them anything about tallied scores or brands, and they all picked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU7973W/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; Longlast</a> over the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater filter&#8217;s</a> taste, with the Brita standard cartridge coming in a more distant third.</p>

<p>We wanted to see how much difference filter type really makes with taste&#8217;s biggest enemy, chlorine. We called in a chlorine test kit that can detect a .01 part-per-million difference in total chlorine.</p>
<p>The tap water we tested had between 0.7 and 1 PPM of chlorine. <strong>We found that any water filter we tried, no matter how long it had been in use, would remove all detectable traces of chlorine.</strong> This lined up pretty well with what we found in taste-tests: the worst offenders for taste are the easiest to remove.</p>
<h3>Filter life</h3>
<p>This is the trickiest factor to rate. These filters all rely on capturing particles or attracting ions to an activated medium, and that means they have a limited life. Unlike a ceramic or mesh filter that simply clogs up and doesn&#8217;t pass water anymore when it&#8217;s dirty, these activated filters will just become less and less effective over time as the contaminants build up and the water just flows past. If you let them go long enough, things can even start growing inside these filters.</p>
<p>Brita rates their standard filter for 40 gallons, and the new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU7973W/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Longlast Filter</a> at 120. That&#8217;s compared to an average of 15 gallons for a ZeroWater filter before it becomes ineffective.</p>
<p>Those &#8220;average&#8221; numbers are assuming a lot, though. If you&#8217;ve got more than 400 PPM of dissolved solids in your water, ZeroWater cartridges might need replacement after just ten gallons. A reverse-osmosis system is a better buy for filtering more than a gallon per day of something like mineral-rich well water.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Brita filter is doing comparatively little to filter minerals, so it lasts longer. We watched the readings from a new Longlast filter for a few weeks, and after about ten gallons the 20% improvement it showed over a standard Brita filter disappeared. You might get better-tasting water for 120 gallons, but after a month we doubt the filter is actually doing much more than removing chlorine.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to be diligent about replacing filters, the ZeroWater system is better at letting you know what&#8217;s going on. You can check periodically with the included tester and see when the total dissolved solids climbs up from zero to 0.006, and replace the filter before it stops working altogether. When the filter media is saturated with metal ions, it actually starts to release some back into the water, and you&#8217;ll immediately notice a sour or fishy taste. In comparison, you never really know how effective a Brita filter is.</p>
<h2 id="which-is-best">Which water filter is best?</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-928" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ZeroWater_Pour01_CC-1024x683.jpg" alt="ZeroWater filter pitcher pour" width="1024" height="683" /></p>
<p>Both the ZeroWater and Brita water filter pitchers each have compelling arguments in their favor. Both are certified by NSF International to remove harmful materials, such as lead and other metals, from the water.</p>
<p>Both Brita and ZeroWater also offer a recycling program, which helps prevent unnecessary materials from ending up in a landfill. However, it’s worth noting that ZeroWater offers a credit of $5 per filter shipped back to them toward new filters, whereas Brita only offers free shipping.</p>
<p>With everything considered, we found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater &#8211; 6-Cup Pitcher</a> to be the better choice overall. The ZeroWater pitcher simply utilizes better filtration technology, and is overall easier to use.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HEYJ08S/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; 10-Cup Pitcher</a> uses less expensive — and less effective — water filters. It is also able to filter water more quickly. If you’re looking for a simple, inexpensive water purifying solution, the Brita filter is a worthwhile product to consider.</p>
<p>If you want to make your economical-but-effective pitcher even better, the new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU7973W/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; Longlast Filter</a> is more effective at removing dissolved minerals like lead, and lasts for three times longer than a standard Brita filter.</p>
<p>So, if you want the best water you can get, without spending thousands of dollars on a reverse-osmosis system, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009DAU1NE/?tag=ybdzvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater</a> is the way to go.</p>
