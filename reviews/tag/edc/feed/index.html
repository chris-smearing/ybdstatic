								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter our four testers used six backpacks for two months, we&#8217;ve determined that  <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-north-face-mainframe-laptop-backpack-dark-gray-heather-zinc-gray/5968000.p?skuId=5968000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The North Face &#8211; Mainframe</a> is the best laptop backpack for less than $150.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>Backpacks for carrying laptops are everywhere, and there are tens of thousands of designs to pick from. The essential features are pretty obvious: A laptop backpack has to carry your laptop and other daily essentials in a comfortable and secure way, but should also give you easy access when you need your most frequently-used items.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re gear enthusiasts at Your Best Digs, with a team that&#8217;s mostly made up of remote contributors. We all have bags we love, and most of us have owned bags we loathed.</p>
<p>After writing down a list of features that we consider absolutely essential, we started our research by collecting data about what influences the preferences of backpack buyers. We polled the gear nerds in the office and the digital nomads on our remote teams about the qualities they consider essential to a perfect laptop bag.</p>
<p>Access to a laptop and the accessories that come with it were (predictably) top of the list, but the other priorities were split. When we broke down our results into groups of people with different budgets, the preferences were more consistent.</p>
<p><strong>It was pretty clear that the more you spend, the more important the aesthetic of a backpack becomes.</strong> Those willing to spend big bucks on a backpack also prioritized waterproofing.</p>
<p>Of our survey-takers who didn&#8217;t want to spend as much money on a backpack, the biggest priority was functionality. Features like sunglasses pockets and bags that don&#8217;t fall over started filtering to the top in this group.</p>
<p>Our lead researcher for this review has owned a Tom Binh bag for a decade, and he spent some time searching the Tom Binh official forums for opinions about what makes a particular bag best for certain scenarios. (People on the Tom Binh forums like to talk about bags a lot.)</p>
<p>We considered all the recommendations from websites that actually tested for specific qualities, like Outdoor Gear Lab, as well as sites that focused on summarizing the strengths of different bags, like PackHacker, TheBrokeBackpacker and Wirecutter.</p>
<p>We took the priorities from our research and started searching retailers for high-quality backpacks with essential features and good design. We also checked out budget-friendly bags with high review counts and good overall scores from people who had purchased them.</p>
<p>We scoured subreddits like r/bifl, r/onebag and r/digitalnomad for recommendations from people who aren&#8217;t paid to review bags, and we also spent a long time watching YouTube reviews, mostly from the travel-focused &#8220;one bag&#8221; minimalism crowd.</p>
<p>We also spent some time away from computer screens and looked at bags in person at local retailers like REI and Best Buy. We&#8217;re happy we did, because we would have missed all our top picks if we had only looked at Amazon.</p>
<p>After we put together a list of 30 top-rated backpacks that fit our criteria, we had to cull the herd to a short list that really hit our core priorities. <strong>We found six bags with all the essential features plus some key perks that made them stand out.</strong></p>
<p>We decided to test bags that were mostly in the $50–$100 price range. We did test one $130 bag, however, to see if our testers noticed the difference high-end materials can make.</p>
<p>We skipped the really cheap bags we researched after reading too many accounts of bad zippers, bad stitching and uncomfortable straps. If you just want something cheap that will carry a laptop, you can use nearly any backpack and even get decent protection with a padded sleeve.</p>
<h3>What about premium bags?</h3>
<p>We like a lot of bags in the $200-and-up price range that we didn&#8217;t test. From the nine premium bags we researched in-depth, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EH3CM4C" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Incase &#8211; Icon</a>, the <a href="https://blackember.com/pages/waterproof-urban-backpacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Ember &#8211; Citadel</a>, the <a href="https://www.tombihn.com/collections/laptop-bags/products/synapse-25?variant=7593508110399" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Binh &#8211; Synapse</a> and the <a href="https://www.goruck.com/rucksacks/compare-rucksacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoRuck &#8211; GR1</a> came the closest to making the grade.</p>
<p>When we talked to our friends and coworkers about expensive bags, they all had very different ideas about what they wanted. Some people want a leather briefcase that will make a good impression at business meetings, while others want a pack with adjustable suspension for comfortable all-day trail use.</p>
<p>We decided not to try picking just one or two of these &#8220;ultimate upgrade&#8221; bags to test, but we hope that the testing we did with less expensive bags can help you find out about the features that make a great bag.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22474" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/lineup-1.jpg" alt="Lineup of backpacks" width="2075" height="1069" /><br />
[table id=256 /]
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Internal capacity:</b> Typically listed in liters, this is a measurement of how much space a pack has to hold bulky items. A 20-liter backpack is just big enough for a laptop and a few books, 25 liters gives you room to stash a sweater, and a 35-liter bag can usually replace a carry-on suitcase for weekend trips.</p>
<p><b>Fall protection: </b>There are three ways a good backpack can keep your computer safe from falls. First, the laptop pouch can be sewn so that its bottom is higher than the bottom of the bag. Second, the pocket can include foam padding to absorb shock and pressure. Finally, a pouch that holds your laptop tightly means there&#8217;s less room for it to knock around inside when your bag is bumped.</p>
<p><b>Fabric weight:</b> Fabrics are graded by weight in &#8220;deniers,&#8221; and 1000-denier nylon yarn is the extra-rugged stuff woven into the canvas-like materials used for suitcases and outdoor gear. The 500-denier yarn most bag manufacturers use is still resistant to abrasion and rips, but it&#8217;s significantly lighter and more supple. As saving weight becomes even more important, manufacturers are more likely to use thin 200-denier fabric in a &#8220;ripstop&#8221; weave that won&#8217;t fall apart if you get a hole.</p>

<p><b>Fabric type:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Nylon</b> is the gold standard for a tough, light-weight polymer that resists wear, heat and stains. The main downside to nylon is that it absorbs water, which makes it more difficult to dye and can lead to soggy-feeling fabric if you&#8217;re caught in the rain.</li>
<li><b>Polyester</b> is sometimes substituted to allow colors or textures that aren&#8217;t possible with nylon. It&#8217;s not as tough as nylon, but it&#8217;s very slightly more heat resistant and the fabric itself won&#8217;t get soggy.</li>
<li><b>Dyneema, Spectra and Kevlar</b> are extra-tough filaments (like fishing line) that are sometimes woven into the ripstop pattern of lightweight nylon to make it stronger.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Waterproof treatments: </b>Most fabric used in bags is given at least a quick spray with a durable water repellent (&#8220;DWR&#8221;) treatment. This coating will keep water in droplets and help it roll off your bag instead of soaking in. If your bag is sitting in the water or puddles form on the top of the bag, you need a fabric with a heavier waterproof backing and sealed seams to keep your gear dry.</p>
<p><b>Specialized pockets:</b> We looked specifically for bags that had some way to carry a water bottle or travel mug in an easy-to-reach place while you&#8217;re wearing it. Glasses don&#8217;t demand as much specific space, but a convenient pocket that will protect them from scratches is a nice bonus.</p>

<p><b>TSA checkpoint-friendly features:</b> Since 2008, the Transportation Safety Agency has had <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/releases/2008/08/15/checkpoint-friendly-laptop-bag-procedures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a specific set of rules</a> that allows you to keep your laptop inside some kinds of bags while clearing security checkpoints. Bags that meet these guidelines have a fold-out laptop sleeve or pouch that gives an unobstructed view of the laptop to the X-ray machine. The advantage is that you don&#8217;t need to pull your laptop out and put it in a bin, but sometimes these bags are actually less convenient for everyday laptop use.</p>
<p><b>Anti-theft features:</b> The most common and functional security feature we saw is a set of rings on some bags&#8217; zippers that lets you lock them together with a small padlock. Other features like embedded cut-proof steel mesh tend to add a lot of bulk and weight, so we discounted bags that included them.</p>
<p><b>Sternum and waist straps:</b> Even the best shoulder straps can only do so much for keeping a heavy load balanced and in place. A connecting strap across your chest or an extra strap around your waist will keep a backpack from slipping, shifting and flopping, which is especially important if you&#8217;re on a bike or running to catch a bus.</p>
<p><b>Ventilated back panels: </b>All of the backpacks we tested feature some kind of sweat-wicking material or ventilation-friendly sculpting to keep your back cool and comfortable on long, hot days.</p>

<p><strong>We gave our six top bags to four testers, each with their own personal taste and set of needs.</strong> Two of our digital nomads are remote-working editors for Your Best Digs, and they rely on an Ogio backpack and a Tom Binh messenger bag, respectively.</p>
<p>One tester is a regional account manager who carries his laptop in a Timbuk2 backpack to different cities every week, and he gave us some perspective on the suitability of bags for air travel and on-the-road organization.</p>
<p>Our last tester is a biomechanical engineering PhD candidate who carries her laptop all over the University of California Irvine campus every day. She normally uses a North Face &#8211; Recon backpack, and she&#8217;s an avid hiker, so she provided some insight into the way laptop-focused bags compare to trail gear.</p>
<p>Our testers took these bags on planes, trains and motorcycles. We carried laptops ranging from 12-inch ultralights to full-size 15-inch models. We loaded each bag with our everyday complement of things like chargers, headphones, books, water bottles and lunches.</p>
<h3>Fit for different laptop sizes</h3>
[table id=257 /]
<p>While the average laptop is thinner and lighter than anything we could imagine a few decades ago, those of us with big desktop-replacement machines need their bags to be just as supportive and protective as ever.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as simple as saying that a bigger backpack will be better for more people, though. Our testers with slim or compact laptops felt much happier when using bags that kept their computers from flopping around.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ESKY9FU/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Swissgear &#8211; 1900</a> has, technically speaking, the biggest laptop pocket. That pocket is really a full-size section of the backpack, though, and it only has a velcro strap to keep a laptop from flopping around. If you keep your laptop in a neoprene sleeve and value the checkpoint-friendly design that might be totally fine, but most of us worried about how much our machines clunked around in the Swissgear bag.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F118789%2Frei-co-op-ruckpack-18-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REI &#8211; Ruckpack</a> had the opposite problem: While this slim and utilitarian bag will technically hold a 15-inch MacBook Pro, such a wide laptop will push out on the Ruckpack&#8217;s side pockets and make the bag much less usable than it should be.</p>
<h3>Comfort and stability</h3>
<p>After carrying laptops, lunches and other day-to-day loads for four weeks, our lead tester tried wearing each pack with 20 lbs of weight inside for ten minutes at a time while working at his desk and walking around the block. By the time he circled back to his first pack for a second try, it was clear which designs were actually comfortable under a bigger load.</p>
<p>The trail-born pedigree of The North Face &#8211; Mainframe and Mystery Ranch &#8211; Rip Ruck made them easy choices for comfort. The surprise was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H7WPYJ/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Targus &#8211; Work + Play</a> pack, which was still surprisingly comfortable with a full load.</p>
<h3>Waterproofing</h3>

    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/waterproof.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Our team is fortunate enough to live in a climate without much unexpected rain, so none of our testers had to use these bags in a real downpour.</p>
<p>But we did test for waterproofing anyhow. We put a paper towel into each of the pockets and compartments of the six bags and then thoroughly drenched them with the soaker head from our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-garden-hose-nozzle/">garden hose nozzle review</a>. Next, we blew the remaining water off the bags with a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-leaf-blower/">leaf blower</a> to simulate the worst conditions for waterproofing, like cycling in the rain.</p>
<p><strong>All of the bags have some kind of water repellent coating to help shed water.</strong> If you just get caught in a quick downpour while you&#8217;re walking to your car, you probably won&#8217;t have to worry about any of these bags letting water in.</p>
<p>Under a sustained downpour, though, most bags will let you down. Only <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-north-face-mainframe-laptop-backpack-dark-gray-heather-zinc-gray/5968000.p?skuId=5968000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The North Face &#8211; Mainframe</a> was able to keep any water from seeping in, undoubtedly because it features a flap that covers the main zipper and backing trim behind the other zips.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F129538%2Fmystery-ranch-rip-ruck-sack-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mystery Ranch &#8211; Rip Ruck</a> is a close second in this category, with its beefy water-resistant YKK Aquaguard zipper that has a polyurethane coating to minimize leaks. We still saw some drips seep through under the full blast of our test downpour, but the fabric on the Rip Ruck absorbed less water overall and dried out more quickly than the Mainframe.</p>

<p>Our testers all preferred the look, feel and features of <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-north-face-mainframe-laptop-backpack-dark-gray-heather-zinc-gray/5968000.p?skuId=5968000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The North Face &#8211; Mainframe</a> mid-size laptop backpack. With 24 liters of storage capacity but only one main compartment, this bag strikes a great compromise between carrying enough gear and keeping a sleek, minimalist profile.</p>
<p>The North Face is a top manufacturer of sporting goods, with a devoted following among those who use their gear on the trail and those who just want to look like they do. The Mainframe is based on many of the best features of the big <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LFE73T0/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">30-liter Surge travel pack</a>, cut down to the size of smaller daypacks like the Recon and Jester. The Mainframe has only one main compartment and a clean, no-nonsense set of accessory pockets.</p>

<p>Despite being a bag designed for sale at Best Buy exclusively, The North Face didn&#8217;t cut any corners with the build quality. The Mainframe uses heavy YKK coil zips with cast metal pulls all over. The fabric used is mostly 210-denier ripstop Cordura nylon, with a heavier Oxford-weave polyester-nylon bottom panel to help with long-term wear.</p>
<p><strong>This was easily the most-loved style among our testers, too.</strong> The outside zips, loops and straps are just enough to indicate a serious piece of gear without making you look like you got lost on your way to a campsite. Best Buy only buys this in gray, but the fabric has a nice texture and pattern that goes with basically everything.</p>

The style, comfort and versatility made this a winner with each of our testers.</p><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-north-face-mainframe-laptop-backpack-dark-gray-heather-zinc-gray/5968000.p?skuId=5968000" target="_blank"><button>See Price at BestBuy.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The waterproofing on the Mainframe, as mentioned above, is excellent. Water won&#8217;t get in through the flap-covered zippers, even after a thorough soak and a blast of wind. It&#8217;s not a dry bag, though: The Nylon fabric will soak up water if you leave it sitting in the bottom of a kayak. If you do get caught in a downpour, make sure to empty the bag, and let the fabric dry out.</p>
<h3>Not as good for 17-inch laptops</h3>
<p>While the Mainframe is technically just big enough to hold the old 17-inch 2011 MacBook Pro (which is 10.51 inches wide and just under an inch thick), it&#8217;s not going to help you with a massive gaming laptop. For example, the new 17-inch chassis from Clevo (customized and re-packaged by specialty brands like Sager and Falcon Northwest) fills up 11.6 inches in pocket width and more than 1.6 inches in thickness.</p>
<p>The Mainframe doesn&#8217;t make any allowance for thickness in the cut of the pouch; the pocket panel is cut about a half-inch wider than the back panel of the pack so it puffs out, and the stiff padding materials will bend around a laptop to allow a thicker laptop to fit. Even an old 14&#8243; Thinkpad is a tight fit when you slide it in.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a good thing on the whole; modern laptops tend to err on the side of slimness. When we were carrying a Surface and a MacBook Air, they practically disappeared in the bigger laptop pockets and moved around a lot when we walked with them, but the Mainframe keeps slim laptops snug.</p>
<p>In addition to the main laptop compartment, the Mainframe also has a padded tablet pocket, at 8 by 11 inches it&#8217;ll hold a mid-size tablet like the 10.5-inch iPad Pro or Surface Go.</p>
<h3>Useful organization for essentials</h3>
<p>The big, vertical zippered pockets on the Mainframe are a great compromise between a second full-size compartment and a smaller set of handy outside pockets. <strong>These pockets are just right for easy access with the bag slung over one shoulder and pulled in front of your chest.</strong></p>
<p>A fleece-lined glasses pocket is great for fragile and scratch-prone items, but it&#8217;s big enough to nestle a full-size pair of folding headphones.</p>
<p>For hydration on the go, the side water-bottle pockets are also basically perfect. They&#8217;re stretchy elastic mesh, so they don&#8217;t look baggy when empty, and they can secure anything from a compact 12-ounce water bottle to a 32-ounce insulated monster like <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-water-bottle/">our beloved Klean Kanteen</a>. The side compression straps also make these bottle pockets great for lugging a compact tripod.</p>
<p>One thing this bag doesn&#8217;t do well is keep your lunch separated from your books. With only the one main compartment and a slim profile, stuff gets squished together when you start walking with this pack on.</p>
<p>Of all the bags we tested, the Mainframe was the model everyone loved most. It&#8217;s a great backpack for small to mid-size laptops up to 15 inches, and organization features are ideal for keeping accessories handy during a day at work or the library. It can&#8217;t carry enough clothes for a weekend trip, but for bombing around town it won&#8217;t slow you down.</p>

If the Mainframe is still too big for your minimalist setup, the <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F118789%2Frei-co-op-ruckpack-18-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18-liter Ruckpack from REI</a> impressed all of our testers with its thoughtful design that gets the maximum possible utility out of a tiny bag.</p>
<p>Let’s get the drawbacks out of the way: The Ruckpack is not very waterproof, and the thin ripstop nylon doesn&#8217;t inspire as much confidence as the heavier fabric on other bags. The zippers on the Ruckpack are also the smallest in this lineup of packs.</p>
<p>If you fill up the laptop pouch completely with a 15-inch laptop (or even a clunky older 14-inch) you&#8217;ll lose most of the functionality of the side organizer pocket and the water bottle pocket. This bag really only shines if you&#8217;re carrying a laptop that’s 13 inches or smaller.</p>
<p>REI sells a 28-liter version of this back that&#8217;s an inch wider and should be better for carrying a full-size laptop, but it&#8217;s not any less expensive than the higher-quality North Face bag.</p>
<p><strong>The real selling point of the Ruckpack is the organization features.</strong> One zippered side pocket can hold pens, a wireless mouse, every day carry tools and pocket-sized notebooks. There&#8217;s even a dedicated glasses pocket tucked inside. Access to essentials couldn&#8217;t get much better than this.</p>

<p>This is a top-loading bag, and it&#8217;s small. If you only need to carry a small laptop and stuff a sweater and a paperback in the main compartment, the design is fantastic. Even loading up headphones, spare chargers and notepads, we were impressed at how well it carries.</p>
<p>If you want to get your laptop in and out of a backpack as quickly as possible, the zip-around shape of this top flap isn&#8217;t ideal. You basically need two hands to open and close this backpack easily.</p>

All of the things that make this ideal for the trail also make it excellent at carrying your laptop and essential accessories. If you need to carry a 15-inch or bigger laptop, though, this will be too small. </p><a href="hthttp://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F118789%2Frei-co-op-ruckpack-18-pack" target="_blank"><button>See Price at REI.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The shoulder straps on the Ruckpack are fully featured, with an adjustable-height sternum strap and a waist belt you can tuck away or remove altogether. The padding on these straps is good for the amount of gear you could reasonably pack inside.</p>
<p>If you find yourself carrying jugs of water or bags of flour, you&#8217;ll definitely want to use the extra straps to take as much weight off your shoulders as you can.</p>
<p>For a slim and budget-priced bag, we were impressed to find a full-size water-bottle pocket that&#8217;s not just floppy netting. The cinch strap does a good job of adjusting for different bottles, and the cinch strap can make this side pouch a good spot for long and bulky items as well. There are even elastic loops and hidden ladder straps if you want to attach pouches or trekking poles.</p>
<p>The only problems we had with the Ruckpack are excused because of the compact size or the price constraints. For a budget-priced bag carrying a compact laptop, the design sensibility on offer here is top-tier.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H7WPYJ/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Targus &#8211; Work + Play Fitness</a> is our pick for the best 17-inch laptop backpack. With ample space for a large laptop, but not so many random pockets that you&#8217;ll lose your wallet and keys, this is a big bag that&#8217;s also smart.</p>
<p>Our testers didn&#8217;t rate this bag highest for any one factor, but when we went back and compared bags for how they looked and how well they helped us carry stuff, a few of us gave Targus major bonus points.</p>
<p>This Targus laptop bag carries well. It&#8217;s a bag that feels smaller than it really is, and that&#8217;s almost always a sign of great bag design. The straps are comfortable, and there&#8217;s a sternum strap to keep it from slipping off your shoulders on a long trek or bike ride.</p>
<p><strong>The perfect application for this bag is for anyone who hits the gym mid-day or on the way to work.</strong> For those people, the shoe compartment, laundry bag and toiletry organizer are excellent features that set this bag apart.</p>
<p>Note that the shoe compartment at the bottom of this bag is vented, which makes it better for the stated application but hurts the water resistance of the bag.</p>
<p>There is a small coat-hanger style hook that peeks out of the top of this backpack and attaches to a strap that runs all the way down to the bottom seam. For accessing toiletries and the laundry bag in a locker room, that&#8217;s a really great feature. In some offices, it might also work, but we can&#8217;t see it being useful in a coffee shop.</p>
<p>One downside to a full-zip main compartment design like this is that you might accidentally open the bag farther than you intend. If you just want to get your laptop out and wind up dropping books on the floor, that&#8217;s annoying.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear if this laptop pocket qualifies as TSA-checkpoint friendly. If you have anything in the laundry bag ,and you don&#8217;t separate the velcro-attached shaving kit, it certainly wouldn&#8217;t be. But with the right load-out and an understanding TSA crew, you might be able to keep your laptop in the pouch going through security.</p>

It's not as stylish or rugged as some backpacks, but the features are well-designed.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H7WPYJ/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p><strong>Even if you don&#8217;t use all of the features as they were designed, the pouches and pockets are great for keeping your giant laptop and accessories in order.</strong></p>
<p>Compared to the Swissgear and other full-size backpacks we tested or researched Targus hit a good balance of size and function. Some large bags have too many pockets and pouches, and that makes it hard to remember where you stashed seldom-used accessories.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a giant backpack that will replace your suitcase, but it is a great bag to carry large laptops and bulky items in a sensible way. Many people could probably get away with using this as a weekend carry-on.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve got a giant laptop, there are two ways to carry it in a backpack. You can find a bag like the Targus with a built-in sleeve or pouch that will cradle your big-boned device and keep it from moving around, or you can forget about trying to find the perfect bag and just throw it in a full-size compartment.</p>
<p>Targus made this bag with a pouch that&#8217;s 11-inches wide and an inch thick when empty, which makes it big enough to hold most modern 17-inch desktop replacements. It&#8217;s far more secure than the giant flip-out compartment SwissGear uses, though some bigger laptops won&#8217;t fit.</p>
<p>The pocket features a flap that completely encloses the laptop, which mostly gets in the way when you want to quickly insert or remove your machine. Most bags just use a simple strap for this kind of extra security. Fortunately, you can tuck the flap inside the pocket and mostly forget it&#8217;s there.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re carrying a tablet with your giant laptop, there&#8217;s also a padded tablet pocket in the second compartment.</p>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>The quality of materials on the Targus bag is less impressive overall than on the Swissgear or Dakine packs, but comparable to the REI. The mesh padding on the back is ample, but a few of our testers raised concerns about how it will hold up over time.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of recognizable zipper brand names or over-sized coils, the zippers on this bag were actually some of the smoothest-zipping we found. Dakine gets points for using YKK zippers on a backpack that costs less than $60, but Targus seems to have found a supplier that gives even better bang for the buck.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re tired of stretched-out water bottle pockets and broken zippers, and if you take one look at the latest trendy fake rucksacks and shake your head, <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F129538%2Fmystery-ranch-rip-ruck-sack-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mystery Ranch offers the Rip Ruck</a>.</p>
<p>For laptops up to 15 inches, this backpack includes a great carry pouch with elastic bands at the side to keep the fit snug. It&#8217;ll take thicker models than the Mainframe, since the main restriction here is the width of the pack rather than the size of the pouch. There&#8217;s a tablet pouch integrated into the laptop pouch, and there are also document sorters in the laptop compartment which are great for large books, notepads and magazines.</p>
<p>The laptop compartment in this backpack is nearly perfect. It&#8217;s the rest of the bag that was polarizing.</p>
<h3>Materials and comfort</h3>
<p>This is a bag made from 500-denier Cordura nylon, which is an industry standard for rugged durability. It&#8217;s coated on the inside for good water resistance, and this worked very well to keep this bag from feeling soggy after a good dousing.</p>
<p>Mystery Ranch has built their brand around beefy YKK Aquaguard coil zips in surprisingly versatile configurations, and these are very good at keeping out water without relying on flaps. <strong>This is the fastest bag to get gear in and out of, and it only let in droplets of water in our simulated downpour.</strong></p>
<p>Padding on the shoulder straps of the Mystery Ranch makes the bag cushy above all else. The thick padding has enough contouring and a functional adjustable-height sternum strap. There is no waist belt.</p>
<p>The fit and stability of this pack when it&#8217;s weighed down mostly feels like a half-baked version of the fully-adjustable suspension system that Mystery Ranch uses on bigger bags. That said, if competition for this bag is supposed to be the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G4ZYFXI/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kanken</a> or other classic leather-and-canvas rucksack designs with skinny or un-padded straps, the Rip Ruck is pure joy.</p>
<p>One of our testers was quick to note that he was very disappointed that the so-called &#8220;black&#8221; Cordura nylon was an inky-green and didn&#8217;t match the black straps and zippers. The other styles available make that contrast look less accidental, but this is not a bag for people who are picky about aesthetics.</p>
<h3>Too many zippers</h3>
<p>Mystery Ranch is probably best known for the three-zip design they use on hiking and hunting backpacks, and the Rip Ruck gives you a sample of that utility. The zip on the biggest compartment opens and closes on each side independently, but not up and down for duffel-style packing like other Mystery Ranch bags.</p>
<p>We love the design philosophy of Mystery Ranch, and we love the convenience of opening the one part of a pack you need access to. Most Mystery Ranch bags don&#8217;t offer a quick and easy way to get a laptop out of the suspended pouch, though.</p>
<p>The Rip Ruck is one of the company&#8217;s few designs to separate the main compartment from the laptop pouch (which can also hold a hydration bladder). They&#8217;ve also included two outside pockets, which are a good size for water bottles or other accessories.</p>
<p>The let-down of the Rip Ruck is in all its fasteners. The comment we heard most from testers was &#8220;too many zippers.&#8221; We think it&#8217;s important for a laptop bag to have easily accessible pockets so you don&#8217;t need to dump out your backpack just to find a charging cable or wireless mouse, but the dual-zip-plus-buckle design makes these pockets almost less convenient than an inside pouch.</p>
<p>The dual zippers on the outside pouch pockets help keep a water bottle or travel mug more secure than we expected, but a side-mount elastic water bottle pouch would have been far better.</p>

For others, it's kind of a silly design with too many buckles and not enough pen loops.</p><a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F129538%2Fmystery-ranch-rip-ruck-sack-pack" target="_blank"><button>See Price at REI.com</button></a></div></div>
<h3>Who is this bag for?</h3>
<p>If you need a bag for hiking, Mystery Ranch has some <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F144968%2Fmystery-ranch-scree-32-pack-mens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-suspension designs like the Scree</a> that help you keep your load stable and comfortable while still allowing quick and easy access with the three-way zip. The Rip Ruck is close to that kind of utility, but the straps aren&#8217;t part of an adjustable suspension system. <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F146676%2Fmystery-ranch-urban-assault-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Urban Assault</a> is a much better daypack for hiking, but there&#8217;s an extra zipper and a giant flap between you and easy access to your laptop.</p>
<p>If you want a quality, rugged daypack that also has a laptop pocket, this isn&#8217;t even the best of both worlds. It&#8217;s a compromise, and it leans heavily on using buckles for fashion&#8217;s sake to justify itself. There&#8217;s nothing you can&#8217;t do with this backpack compared to the others we tested, but we expected better organization features.</p>
<p><strong>So, if you want a bag like a classic alpine rucksacks with updated materials, comfy shoulder straps and room for a thick 15-inch laptop, this is a pretty great backpack.</strong> The Rip Ruck is much easier to use than one with a traditional design and leather cinch-straps.</p>
<p>The rest of the materials and construction quality make this a good value if you like the look and attitude. This is one of those buy-it-for-life bags that you can use for decades without seeing any obvious signs of wear.</p>

<li>The styling of this bag leans heavily on extra buckles, like a classic canvas rucksack.</li>
<li>Cordura nylon and YKK Aquaguard zips are just a few indicators of build quality.</li>
<li>Not many organization features are included, but the few that are work very well.</li>

<p>Dakine is a company with established credibility in the surf-and-skate scene, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SV9PRBO/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dakine &#8211; Campus 33 liter</a> is their entry-level backpack. As the name implies, this is a student-targeted bag, but it has some features that could make it a good value for anyone toting around a laptop.</p>
<p>Dakine uses good materials in this bag, and it&#8217;s offered in a wide array of patterns. For build quality, Dakine uses the good stuff, like real YKK-branded coil zips. They&#8217;re not the smoothest zippers we tested, so the low price is a reflection of cheaper materials.</p>
<p>Waterproofing on this bag is almost non-existent. Your stuff won&#8217;t get soaked in a brief shower, but this bag let in the most water of all we tested.</p>
<p>Note that Dakine makes the Campus line in a variety of fabrics, so if you love the style but want more waterproofing you can get this bag in the &#8220;squall&#8221; color with waterproof Cordura fabric. The big zips are still going to be the primary source of leaks, though.</p>
<p>The waxed nylon bottom panel used for the &#8220;tamarindo&#8221; colorway we tested is a nice touch, with just the right amount of creasing and patina from daily use.</p>
<p>When it comes right down to it, this is a basic backpack with a giant laptop pouch. It&#8217;s definitely the least comfortable backpack if you intend to fill the big main compartment with books or anything else heavy.</p>
<p>If simple and low-cost are what you want, browse the colorways on offer and see if there&#8217;s a style you like. <strong>Our testers were most dissatisfied with the minimal laptop support provided by the gigantic pouch.</strong> It&#8217;s suspended and padded, but smaller laptops just flop around. The most interesting thing about the bag is probably the smallest outside pocket, which is insulated for carrying a small lunch.</p>
<h3>SwissGear &#8211; Scansmart 1900</h3>

<p>SwissGear laptop backpacks are some of the best-selling laptop and school bags of all time, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ESKY9FU/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SwissGear &#8211; ScanSmart 1900</a> is one of the most reviewed laptop bags on Amazon. It&#8217;s a giant backpack with some travel-oriented features that might make it good carry-on luggage.</p>
<p>The association between SwissGear and Swiss Army knives is hard-earned, and the brand represents affordable utilitarian bags. The 1900 is really missing a clear purpose behind its design features, though; like a pocket knife with a corkscrew, we&#8217;re not really sure what this is best used for.</p>
<p>The biggest failing of the SwissGear is the laptop compartment. It&#8217;s TSA-approved checkpoint friendly, which means you can unzip the laptop compartment from the rest of the bag and fold it onto the x-ray machine belt without waiting for someone to restock the trays you would need to put your laptop into otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>The Scansmart feature works, but after using these features a few times, our testers agree that it&#8217;s almost quicker to pull the laptop out of a well-designed bag.</strong></p>
<p>The real drawback of Scansmart is that your laptop is mostly bumping around in its giant pouch with only foam padding around the edges to protect it. If your laptop is smaller than a 13-inch model, you&#8217;d probably wind up putting it in an inside compartment.</p>
<p>The SwissGear laptop bag does have a lot of pockets, though. If you&#8217;re diligent about always putting your stuff in the same place so you don&#8217;t lose it, this is a bag that can organize your laptop-toting life.</p>
<p>For the rest of us, the sheer number of pockets is just a liability: This bag will help you lose your keys, your wallet, your passport and your boarding pass on the same layover.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After surveying our friends and coworkers, we came to the conclusion that a laptop backpack doesn&#8217;t have to be overly complicated, but it should help keep your laptop secure and your accessories organized.</p>
<p>In testing, the bag that accomplished that task best for laptops up to 15 inches was <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-north-face-mainframe-laptop-backpack-dark-gray-heather-zinc-gray/5968000.p?skuId=5968000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The North Face &#8211; Mainframe</a>. This bag strikes a balance between elegant and nerdy and offers just enough room to keep track of the stuff most of us need. It&#8217;s not a cheap laptop backpack, but The North Face uses top-grade materials for durability, waterproofing and comfort.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After weeks writing with the most popular pens on the market, we've determined that the Pilot - G2 is the best. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e tested 15 pens, ranging in price from just under $1 to just over $25, and found that the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058NN4C0/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Pilot &#8211; G2</a> is overall one of the best pens on the market. The G2 is America’s top-selling gel pen. Our testers loved this pen for its smooth ink flow, professional look and quick-dry ink. As runners-up, we think the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IE87/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">uni-ball &#8211; Onyx</a> is the best rollerball and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004U9TEEA/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paper Mate &#8211; InkJoy</a> is the best ballpoint.</p>

<h2 id="how">How we selected pens to test</h2>
<p>If you’ve searched online for pens, you know that there are hundreds and hundreds from which to choose. So, we narrowed down our prospects by focusing only on gel, ballpoint and rollerball pens. These are the pens most commonly used in people’s everyday lives, rather than fountain or calligraphy pens.</p>
<p>We only tested pens that were rated well among online retailers, and for the most part, we selected pens that cost well under $5. (The one exception is the Cross rollerball pen, which was mentioned frequently enough in forums that we had to give it a test.)</p>
<p>We consulted forums like /r/pens/ to find out what inexpensive pens the aficionados were recommending. We browsed through the <a href="https://www.penaddict.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pen Addict’s</a> blog for inspiration and consulted The Wirecutter’s pen review, too.</p>
<p>Finally, we chose to focus primarily on .7 mm pens, which create medium-sized lines and are a good writing choice for a lot of people. However, we also tested some smaller and larger pens for those who want range.</p>
<p>It should be noted that while some of our testers used the pens to freehand draw or doodle, we did not test pens that were created explicitly for drawing purposes. (That’s another review for another time!)</p>

<h3>Ballpoint pens</h3>

<p>Ballpoint pens are arguably the most popular for everyday use, and for good reason. Their ink writes smoothly and dries quickly. Their refills also last longer than other types of ink. However, the oil-based ballpoint ink can occasionally get messy and blobby at the tip, making it less-than-ideal for longform writing and journaling. Conventional ballpoint pens come in three sizes: fine (making lines .8 mm wide and thinner), medium (1.0 mm to 1.2 mm) and bold (1.4 mm and wider).</p>
<h3>Gel pens</h3>

<p>Many of us remember the thick-lined, metallic and opaque pens of our childhood, often with whimsical product names like “moonlight” and “stardust.” These type of pens get a bad rap from adults, who can see them as impractical. One of our designer-testers even specified that they’ll test “anything but gel pens, please!”</p>
<p>But while there <i>are </i>a number of youthful-looking gel pens on the market (like the Gelly Roll we tested), there are also plenty of quality, businesslike pens that you may not know use gel ink. Gel ink is simply pigment in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_pen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">water-based gel</a>. If you’re looking for strong colors and sharp, featherless lines, then a gel pen is probably a great choice for you.</p>
<p>That being said, if you’re left-handed, you should <a href="https://www.penchalet.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-pen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stay away from gel</a>. It doesn’t dry as quickly as its ballpoint and rollerball counterparts.</p>
<p>Conventional gel pens come in three sizes: micro (making lines .5 mm wide and thinner), medium (.7 mm) and bold (1.0 mm).</p>
<h3>Rollerball pens</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11083" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Rollerball pens use a dark, saturated, fast-flowing liquid ink. They create finer lines than a conventional ballpoint pen, and unlike gel pens, the ink dries quickly enough for left-handers. Because of the free-flowing ink, rollerball pens require less pressure, making them more comfortable to write with.</p>
<p>However, a rollerball’s intense ink can sometimes bleed through paper if you’re not careful, and the pen can leak if it’s left uncapped or taken to high altitudes. Conventional rollerball pens come in three sizes: micro (.5 mm), fine (.7 mm) and bold (.8 mm and wider).</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>A pen can seem like a deceptively simple product, but there’s a lot that goes into making one great. Ask any pen aficionado and they can wax poetic about nibs and ink flow for hours. However, for the purposes of the everyday pen user, there are only a few things you need to keep in mind:</p>
<p><b>Ink flow:</b> You want a pen that creates a clean, consistent line. It shouldn’t skip, bleed through the paper, or feather out into more tiny lines. Similarly, the ink should come out easily, requiring you to put very little pressure on the pen.</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SiegePenGIF.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p><b>Comfort and aesthetics:</b> The pen should look nice sitting out on your desk, but more importantly it should be designed to hold comfortably. Look for lighter pens. They will be easier on your hand than heavy ones. And don’t be fooled by pens with soft grips included on them; they’re not necessarily any more comfortable.</p>
<p>You can make your pen even more comfortable to hold by using it correctly. This may seem like an elementary skill, but many of us are doing it wrong (or have forgotten proper form in the age of the keyboard). Remember to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press down only as much as you need to get a smooth line</li>
<li>Use good posture to prevent writing fatigue</li>
<li>Write from your arms and shoulders, rather than your fingertips</li>
<li>Use quality paper; we tested our pens on classic Moleskine notebooks</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Line width:</b> Most pens are marketed with a millimeter measurement somewhere on the package. This measurement refers to the width of the line your pen will create. Many people enjoy writing with a .7 mm pen, which is a medium width. If you like to write with smaller letters, you can get pens in .5 mm, and some brands make them even finer than that.</p>
<p>If you like to make big, bold strokes, you can pick something with a 1.0 mm width or greater. Some consumers find that they like a certain brand and model of pen, but only in a certain size. So if you think a pen is a good fit for you, but you don’t quite love how it writes, try sizing up or down.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We started by rounding up a group of designers at our <a href="https://www.siegemedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content marketing agency</a> in San Diego, and gave them each a few pens and a Moleskine notebook to call their own. In the weeks leading up to our formal focus group testing, they were encouraged to use the pens daily, whether it be for journaling, making grocery lists, signing cards or sketching out plans for the next photoshoot.</p>
<p>Then, we asked them to join us in a focus group, where they wrote assigned sentences (using every letter of the alphabet). Then, they had “free time” to use the pen however they pleased. After this process was complete, they filled out a survey about the experience using each pen.</p>
<p>The survey asked questions including (but not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>How much pressure did you have to exert on the pen to write?</li>
<li>Was it comfortable to use this pen? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Does the pen ink smear if you touch it soon after writing?</li>
<li>What has been your overall experience using this pen?</li>
</ul>
<p>After the focus group, we tested our worst offender and best pens on cheaper notebook and scratch paper, to see how they’d act. We found the results to be just about what we expected; lesser-quality pens wrote even more poorly on cheap paper, and good quality pens wrote about the same, save for a slightly less-smooth flow.</p>
<h2 id="top-pick">The best overall: Pilot &#8211; G2</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11081" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9796-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1354" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9796-2.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9796-2-610x413.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9796-2-768x520.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9796-2-885x599.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9796-2-1500x1016.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9796-2-295x200.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9796-2-1000x677.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9796-2-360x244.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9796-2-375x254.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9796-2-414x280.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9796-2-320x217.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Like a popular celebrity, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058NN4C0/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pilot- G2</a> inspires polarized opinions. People seem to either <i>love</i> or <i>hate</i> the G2 — and we have our suspicions that some hate it just because it’s so well-loved!</p>
<p>When we started our testing, we didn’t know which side of the fence we stood on for the great G2 debate. (Though we always lean toward skepticism.) After testing, though, it was clear that the G2 was the best pen overall, and by default the best gel pen. Our testers loved the writing experience with this one: a smooth flow of ink with no skipping, no feathering and no bleeding. The ink dried quickly as they wrote, meaning it’s a good pen for left handers. They also noted that the G2 had a pleasing haptic feedback when you clicked it, and that it looks professional enough to use in a meeting.</p>

Its smooth gel ink flow makes your writing look more clean and elegant. Plus, the ink dries quickly.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058NN4C0/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The G2 is retractable, meaning you can carry it around in your pocket without being jabbed. It’s also refillable, but according to Pilot, you won’t have to refill it often. They say that their pen is “proven to last longer than the average of competitive gel ink brands.”</p>
<p>It’s available in four sizes (.38 mm, .5 mm, .7 mm and 1.0 mm) and comes with a comfort grip. (Though, many pen enthusiasts will tell you that these included rubber grips don’t necessarily add to the comfort.)</p>
<p>One thing to beware of with the G2 in finer sizes: its thin point allows you to create beautifully thin and close-together characters, but won’t mask any shakiness in your hands. So if you don’t have a steady grip (or tend to go hard on the caffeine), you may want to choose a different pen — or opt for a bolder point. If you do choose the G2 in a fine point, it should set you back less than a $1.50 per pen.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a pen of the rollerball variety, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IE87/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">uni-ball &#8211; Onyx</a>. Sleek, black and professional looking, our testers gave the Onyx high marks for its lightweight and fine tip. It doesn’t bleed or feather or skip when you’re writing with it, and it creates a nice uniform line.</p>
<p>The Onyx does require slightly more pressure to write with (and has a lighter-pigmented ink) than our top pick, but for the more heavy-handed writers, this may be a welcome feature.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IE87/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/uni-ball-onyx-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/uni-ball-onyx-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/uni-ball-onyx-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/uni-ball-onyx-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/uni-ball-onyx-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/uni-ball-onyx-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/uni-ball-onyx-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/uni-ball-onyx-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/uni-ball-onyx.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best rollerball: uni-ball - Onyx</h3><p>We like this simple and light rollerball pen.

<p>What prevented the Onyx from being our No. 1 pick? It can smudge if you touch it too quickly after writing, which makes it non-ideal for left-handed writers. One tester also remarked that “this pen was [their] favorite … but [they] could tell it was an overall cheaper model.” We don’t consider this a fatal flaw though; at less than 50 cents a pen, it <i>is</i> a cheaper model.</p>
<p>Those who aim to be more eco-friendly will like that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IE87/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Onyx</a> is made from 80 percent post-consumer recycled electronics — a fact uni-ball is proud of, as evidenced by the “eco” logo on each pen. uni-ball says that their Onyx ink also protects against “water, fading and fraud.” However, we didn’t test for this.</p>

<p>Ballpoint is the most popular type of pen, so it’s surprising that our top pick is a somewhat less popular brand. Sure, Paper Mate products are ubiquitous in the office supply world, but their pens have notably fewer reviews on Amazon — and are hardly discussed by pen enthusiasts. In the interest of diversity, we tested a few Paper Mate’s anyway, and we’re glad we did. Our testers loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004U9TEEA/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InkJoy Ballpoint</a>.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004U9TEEA/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/papermate-inkjoy-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/papermate-inkjoy-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/papermate-inkjoy-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/papermate-inkjoy-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/papermate-inkjoy-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/papermate-inkjoy-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/papermate-inkjoy-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/papermate-inkjoy-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/papermate-inkjoy.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best ballpoint: Paper Mate - InkJoy Ballpoint</h3><p>The name says it all! The InkJoy truly is a pleasure to write with.

<p>They found that the pen didn’t bleed or feather, and it didn’t smudge either. They thought the pen’s grip was solid and comfortable, which led to nice, uniform lines. The one minor discrepancy with the Paper Mate was that each new pen requires a bit of “warming up” the first time around before it stops skipping and starts writing smoothly. At most retailers, the InkJoy will cost you well under a dollar per pen.</p>

<p><b>Pentel &#8211; Energel-X (gel): </b>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005EE4UG2/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pentel &#8211; Energel</a> is another pen that most people either love or hate. We fell somewhere on the <i>like</i> end of that spectrum. On the plus side, it has a nice grip, requires little pressure to write with and doesn’t bleed. It creates a uniform lines and the ink flows smoothly. However, the Pentel does have a tendency to feather, and it can smear if you touch it right after writing. For these reasons, one tester claimed that it made them “write messier than [they] already do.” So, buy this one at your own risk — if you have nice handwriting and prefer a dark, saturated ink, it may still be a great pen for you. The Energel-X will likely cost you over $2, making it a little bit more of an investment than your typical office supply pen.</p>
<p><b>Zebra &#8211; F-701 (ballpoint): </b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002L6RB80/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zebra</a> is an esteemed name in the world of writing utensils, and after testing their F-701, we can see why. Aesthetically, it stands out from the other pens with its sleek, all-metal body. Our testers said it felt sturdy, and they liked the textured grip. It met all the basic requirements of a good pen: no skipping, bleeding or feathering and a smooth and uniform ink flow. It also doesn’t smudge when you touch it. Our testers’ primary complaint is that the ink is relatively light in color — something you may not expect from a pen that costs over $5. <b> </b></p>
<p><b>uni-ball &#8211; Jetstream Premier (ballpoint): </b>A crowd favorite, uni-ball makes a slew of good quality pens, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001PV13JK/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jetstream Premier</a> (about $7) is one of them. Testers especially appreciated some design features of this pen, namely the softened click action and large grip. The only flaws we found were that its ink doesn’t dry very quickly, and it requires a moderate amount of pressure to write.</p>
<p><b>Uni &#8211; Jetstream (ballpoint): </b>We also liked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001BYNGGO/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Uni &#8211; Jetstream</a>: a pen with a bit of cult following. Different in design from the Premier with its thick gel grip, testers were a fan of its smudge free ink and comfortable hold. One tester noted that though it writes well, they wish the “grip was a little less squishy.” They felt like they “lost a little control with how thick it is.” One of the most expensive pens on our list, the Uni will cost you over $10 at most retailers.</p>
<p><b>Pilot &#8211; Precise V5 (ballpoint): </b>Pilot, the makers of our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058NN4C0/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">best pen overall,</a> also did a good job with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00347A8C6/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">V5</a>. Our testers loved the way this pen writes, and appreciated its uniform and even ink flow. It didn’t bleed or feather, and it required only a small amount of pressure to write. Our only gripe with the V5? It doesn’t have much of a grip, which can make it hard to hold.</p>

However, we found it very uncomfortable to write with. It also skipped more than the other pens we tested.</p>
<p><b>Cross &#8211; Beverly (gel): </b>Cross is known for making higher-end pens that can cost as much as $10,000 (like their discontinued AT0086-107G). We tested one that costs significantly less than that; their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012ENWGI4/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Beverley</a> pen rings in at about $30. <b> </b>Even though the Beverley is on the (very) low end of the cost spectrum for Cross, it’s still significantly more expensive than the other pens we tested. So, we expected excellent results. To our dismay, the Beverly was uncomfortable to write with, tended to feather, bleed and smudge and had a confusing design that made the cap seem like it was on backwards.</p>
<p><b>uni-ball &#8211; 207 Retractable (gel): </b>uni-ball may be popular among writers everywhere, but they missed the mark on their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FDR47E/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">207 gel pen</a>. Our testers found that uni-ball’s gel formula feathered and didn’t create very uniform lines.</p>
<p><b>Paper Mate &#8211; InkJoy (gel): </b>Though Paper Mate’s ballpoint version of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B019QBOG4Y/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InkJoy</a> was the best in our tests, we weren’t as impressed by the gel version. We found that it feathered, bled and tended to smudge.</p>
<p><b>Bic &#8211; Round Stic Xtra Life (ballpoint): </b>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00347A8NK/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bic</a> felt like a standard, uninspired office pen. It was uncomfortable to hold, required a decent amount of pressure to write with, and the ink often felt dry and uneven.</p>
<p><b>uni-ball &#8211; Vision &amp;</b> <b>Vision Elite (rollerball): </b>Both uni-ball’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IE8J/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vision</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002S5383G/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vision Elite</a> feathered, bled and smudged. The Vision also failed to deliver a smooth flow or a uniform line.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>A good pen can make the everyday tasks, from taking notes in a meeting to making a grocery list, a little bit more pleasant. And the good news is, they don’t have to cost you a fortune. All of our top pens cost under $5, and some of them cost under $1.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>To find the best mechanical pencil, we scoured forums like r/mechanicalpencil and blogs like <a href="https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2008/12/15/review-uni-ball-kuru-toga-mechanical-pencil.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pen Addict</a> (Brad and his friends also love pencils) and <a href="https://bleistift.blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bleistift</a> to get an idea of the pencils the obsessives like best. We also consulted Wirecutter’s and <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/08/pencils/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wired’s</a> reviews of mechanical pencils. Then, we took to Amazon to find the most popular and highly-rated pencils loved by consumers.</p>
<p>We mostly chose pencils sized 0.5 mm to 0.7 mm, but we also tested some larger sizes for those who like range. We know that different people are looking for different levels of quality (and “keepability”) in a mechanical pencil, so we also tested a range of price points, from around 15 cents to 25 dollars per pencil. We tested brands known for their mechanical pencils (like Pentel) and the big two technical drawing brands, as well as some traditionally cheaper brands like Paper Mate.</p>

<h2 id="why-use">Why use them?</h2>
<p>A good mechanical pencil can create smooth, consistent lines (without the need for sharpening). It’s convenient for travel, and is guaranteed not to stain your pocket with ink. There are plenty of studies that show that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handwriting engages your brain</a> better than typing, and some would argue that the more tactile experience of graphite on paper connects you even more to your writing.</p>
<p>A mechanical pencil is refillable and looks more professional than a traditional pencil. Best (and most obvious) of all, its lead is erasable. So you can leave the correction fluid in the drawer. Tradition dictates that pencils should be used for rough sketches, arithmetic, and any other time that you might need to erase or change the marks you&#8217;ve made.</p>
<p>A high-quality mechanical pencil will almost always cost you less than a high-quality pen. And lest style be a concern, rest assured that there are plenty of attractive (and even pen-like) mechanical pencils on the market these days.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Lead size and grade: </b>Most people will like a 0.5mm or 0.7mm width pencil (the width refers to the size of the lead and the line it creates), but there are smaller and larger widths available if you prefer. Lead can also vary in hardness, which changes the shade and the strength of the tip. If you’re a heavy-handed writer or don&#8217;t want smudging, you may want to go with a lighter and harder lead; mechanical pencils often use different grades than regular pencils so they can make the leads stronger so interpreting the grades is tricky.</p>
<p><b>Cost: </b>Mechanical pencil costs can vary dramatically. But just like we learned testing pens, the most expensive isn’t always the best. You should be able to find a mechanical pencil you love for just a few dollars or less.</p>
<p><b>Grip: </b>A pencil grip won’t necessarily make your pencil more comfortable to use, and some people actually find them cumbersome. But if you want a pencil with a big, squishy grip, we know the perfect one for you. Surprisingly, our testers found the grips on some of the higher-end mechanical pencils more uncomfortable — perhaps because they’re designed to keep your grasp firmly in place, but not cushion your hand.</p>
<p><b>Lead advancement: </b>The classic mechanical pencil model requires you to click the top to advance the lead. Some newer models have a side-click mechanism instead. Others still have a twist advance. What’s best for you comes down to preference, though the idea behind a side advance pencil is that it’s quicker and disrupts your writing flow less.</p>

    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Siengepencils.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p><b>Retractable vs. capped: </b>Standard mechanical pencils are retractable, but if you want to look more polished in the boardroom, Pentel makes a capped version.</p>
<p><b>Lead cushioning: </b>Some mechanical pencils use a lead cushion or guard that reinforces the lead against rougher writing styles. If you’re aggressive with your writing utensils, you may want to consider it.</p>
<p><b>Materials and aesthetics: </b>Just like other writing utensils, there are an array of colors and styles of mechanical pencils available. You can get ones that resemble a pen or a conventional woodcase pencil, or you can get something bright and colorful. As a general rule, don’t assume that the quality of the pencil’s “look” is equal to how well it writes.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We recruited the same group of illustrators, hand lettering artists, bullet journalers and designers that we used for our best pen testing to test mechanical pencils. We gave them several weeks to use the pencils throughout their everyday lives, jotting down work notes, writing grocery lists and sketching designs. For quick notes and sketches like this, our testers found that almost all of the mechanical pencils were acceptable. The one exception? The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008LXM47K/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pilot &#8211; Eno</a> pencils, which came with lead that broke immediately upon use.</p>
<p>Then, we conducted a focus group in which our testers used each pencil to write assigned sentences (that used every letter of the alphabet) and doodle their own whimsical creations. After that, each tester gave detailed feedback on the experience of using each pencil. From there, we did a qualitative analysis to determine which mechanical pencil was the best.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, our testers had much stronger opinions about each pencil after being forced to write for minutes on end with each one. Also unsurprising, most feedback had to do with comfort rather than how the pencil actually wrote.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">The best overall: Pentel &#8211; Quicker Clicker</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11027" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_8612.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_8612.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_8612-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_8612-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_8612-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_8612-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_8612-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_8612-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_8612-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_8612-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_8612-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_8612-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>By a narrow margin, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017DBEIG/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pentel &#8211; Quicker Clicker</a> (0.5mm) took first place in our tests for best mechanical pencil for writing. We liked its slick design and its smooth feel, and at just a few dollars, it’s high quality for a low price. Refilling it was easy, and so was advancing the lead.</p>
<p>Pentel is a Japanese-held company that has been innovating in the stationery industry since the mid-forties. They’ve come up with a lot of “firsts,” including the Quicker Clicker mechanism — Pentel says it’s the “original side-advance mechanical pencil.” It comes standard with Pentel lead and eraser, a strong metal clip and a transparent barrel so you can see the status of your lead. You can purchase it in a myriad of colors, and we especially like the classy look of the sky blue.</p>
<p>There are many a loyal Quicker Clicker devotee out there. Unfortunately, many who have been using it for years don’t like the new and “improved” model with the rubber grip. Our testers weren’t bothered by the grip, but some didn’t like the side advance as much as a “traditional” mechanical pencil that requires you to click the top.</p>

With smooth lead and a slick aesthetic, the Pentel - Quicker Clicker is both a joy to write with and attractive enough to leave out on your desk.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017DBEIG/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p><b>Though the </b><b>Quicker Clicker</b><b> has fine lead, it didn’t break when we were writing — even when used by a heavy-handed writer.</b> It also required very little pressure to write with, which will save you from hand cramps if you’ll be writing for a while. The Quicker Clicker, which our testers described as “smooth and reliable,” comes in three line widths: 0.5mm, 0.7mm and 0.9mm. You can get its lead in the traditional graphite (No. 2 grade), or in shades of violet and blue.</p>
<p>The eraser on the Quicker Clicker is high quality, as far as attached mechanical pencil erasers go. In our testing and regular use, we didn’t notice a lot of residue or “smearing” left from erasing mistakes. One thing to be aware of: Some Amazon users complain that the eraser refills for the Quicker Clicker are hard to find in brick-and-mortar stores. That being said, they’re readily available online.</p>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0026ICM1E/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Uni-ball Kuru Toga</a> (0.5mm) was a standout in our tests. Uni-ball is one of the most highly regarded brands in the stationery world, and the Kuru Toga is one of the most frequently discussed (and recommended) mechanical pencils by the aficionados. We can see why. The lead is high-quality and doesn’t break when you write with it. It’s got a hardy plastic body and clear grip, and feels balanced in your hand.</p>

<p>Uni-ball was founded in Tokyo, so it’s no wonder that its name is Japanese. The Kuru Toga was <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/kuru-toga-a-comprehensive-guide/pt/706" target="_blank" rel="noopener">named</a> with a Japanese portmanteau of “rotating” and “to become sharp.” This aptly describes the pencil’s rotating lead mechanism which keeps lead, you guessed it, consistently sharp.<b> For this reason, we think it’s one of the best mechanical pencils for writing longform.</b></p>
<p>Like with a traditional mechanical pencil, you click the top of the Kuru Toga to advance the lead, and from there it flows nice and smoothly. So why isn’t the Kuru Toga our first-choice pick? Changing the lead is a little more difficult than usual, due to the very small opening the pencil provides to insert the lead.</p>
<p>Even so, the Kuru Toga beats every other pick in terms of quality and smoothness of writing. And in those respects, it’s also right on par with the Quicker Clicker.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for something that feels good to write with, but doesn’t cause a panic if you lose it, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001T6QCJC/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paper Mate &#8211; 34666PP Clearpoint</a>. At less than $1.50 per pencil, it delivers quality and value all wrapped up in an erasable package.</p>

For less than two bucks, you get something that feels good to write with.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001T6QCJC/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>Our testers found this pencil comfortable and easy to use. <b>One tester even went so far as to say that it was his favorite to write with — even more so than the expensive pencils. </b>The only concern with the Paper Mate? The eraser doesn’t erase very well. But with the ubiquitous and cheap auxiliary erasers available on Amazon, we don’t consider this too big a problem. In fact, you could purchase one of these mechanical pencils and a separate eraser for less than the cost of some of the other pencils on our list.</p>
<p>Like our top pick, the Paper Mate requires you to click the side of the pencil to advance it. It’s got a clear barrel so you can see the status of your lead, and it has a textured grip that some users will like. It’s worth noting that this one also comes in a colored pencil version with an array of rainbow leads available.</p>

<p><b>Zebra &#8211; M701:</b> Zebra is a big name in writing utensils, and we’re generally impressed with their products. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003G4SSLK/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M701</a> is not an exception. It’s got the weighted, smooth feel of a high-quality pencil and it encourages neat handwriting. Plus, while the grip isn’t smooth, it also doesn’t dig into your hand. The Zebra lost points because it felt especially heavy, which can tire your hand out over time. Still, some writers may prefer a weightier pencil. At over five dollars, it’s more expensive than most of our pencil picks, but we also think it’s one of the best quality mechanical pencils out there.</p>
<p><b>Pentel &#8211; Sharp Kerry: </b>There’s no doubt that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017DBEIG/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Quicker Clicker</a> is the best Pentel mechanical pencil, but the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006SW6YO/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Sharp Kerry</a> is probably the classiest. It looks exactly like a capped pen until you remove the cap and see its point. Some testers found it a bit slippery and hard to hold on to. Nonetheless, it can’t be beat for its sophisticated look, and when all is said and done, it writes well.</p>
<p><b>rOtring &#8211; 600 Series: </b>This is a classic design that has an avid following among designers; we’ll call the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001A1POWC/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">rOtring</a> a luxury mechanical pencil. At more than 25 dollars, it’s certainly an investment. As we would hope, it performed well on almost all accounts: smooth, break-free lead and controlled writing included. If you want a pencil that doesn&#8217;t get in the way when you&#8217;re using a stencil or ruler, this is a great pick. The only thing we didn’t like was the tiny hole you’re forced to fit the lead through when you refill it. It’s a minor complaint, but for a pencil this expensive, we expect near perfection. The rOtring comes pretty close.</p>
<p><b>Uni &#8211; Kuru Toga Roulette: </b>Similar to our runner up, but with an upgraded metal body and knurled grip. Our testers found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004OHNTVC/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Uni &#8211; Kuru Toga Roulette</a> to be “light and efficient” and an overall joy to use. There’s not much to pick on with this pencil — we love its performance. This is a good thing, since one will cost you about ten dollars. If we had to pick something to dislike, we’d say the eraser on this pencil is a little small.</p>
<p><b>Pentel &#8211; GraphGear 1000 Automatic Drafting: </b>Our testers found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GAU2RU/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GraphGear 1000</a> to be delightfully “futuristic,” and they also liked that the top clicks into place like a pen when you advance the lead. It’s nicely weighted (not too heavy or too light) and writes well and smoothly. The only downsides? Some testers found the lead filling process a little cumbersome and the lead itself a little weak.</p>
<p><b>Staedtler &#8211; Silver Series: </b>A pencil with the name “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002BNHMC8/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silver Series</a>” (and a price point of over ten dollars) invites some big expectations, and for the most part the Staetdler didn’t disappoint. It&#8217;s available with an extra-sharp 0.3mm size and writes precisely and smoothly. Like the rOtring, this is a technical pencil well-known among architects, planners, and designers. Our testers’ biggest complaint with this pencil was the grip; most found it somewhat uncomfortable. If you’re not writing longform content though, this pencil might still be for you.</p>
<p><strong>Paper Mate &#8211; 1.3mm Mechanical Pencils</strong> Paper Mate markets these as an alternative to the traditional woodcase pencils, and they do look like a fat and colorful version of the original. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CRGP8B6/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1.3mm</a> are targeted toward young children who are just learning to write — the larger width of these utensils makes them easier for little hands to control. However, there were plenty of user comments from full-grown adults who love these pencils and the thick lines they create. Are they right for you? It comes down to taste. Most of our testers found them very comfortable to write with.</p>
<h3>Pencils we don&#8217;t recommend</h3>
<p><b>BIC &#8211; Xtra Sparkle: </b>With a name like “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007L1VLO/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xtra Sparkle</a>,” we didn’t expect this BIC to deliver high-octane pencil performance. Still, with nearly 2,000 Amazon reviews, we had to give it a go. Unsurprisingly, it was sub-par in almost every way. When asked to describe it in two words, one tester said “meh” and “whatever.” For quality, we give this one a 50 percent. For jazzing up your kid’s pencil box? A solid 100.</p>
<p><b>Pilot &#8211; Color Eno: </b>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008LXM47K/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Color Eno</a> are the only “colored pencils” we tested, again due to their high number of reviews. Their primary tester, a designer, actually loved their hues. However, he found that the lead broke easily and that the pencils were overall “not super reliable.”</p>
<p><b>Pentel &#8211; Sharp Automatic:</b> The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000SBSAYE/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sharp Automatic</a> is another pencil that probably lands somewhere in the “meh” and “whatever” zone. It doesn’t stand out for much except its uncomfortable grip and the distinctive way it makes you feel not-in-control of your own writing.</p>
<p><b>Pentel &#8211; Twist Erase: </b>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00822DZLY/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Twist Erase</a> has a cool name, but the lead is too light, thick and dull. Our testers found that you have to press harder than is comfortable to use it. Another complaint: It doesn’t allow for very good control of your writing.</p>
<p><b>Pentel &#8211; GraphGear 500: </b>We loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GAU2RU/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GraphGear 1000</a>, but its little brother didn&#8217;t make the same impression. We found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006HXQXA/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">500</a> to be dull and fragile, with lead that breaks too easily and a lead changing process that’s too time-consuming. This one isn’t worth paying over five dollars for.</p>
<p><b>Alvin &#8211; Draft-Matic: </b>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VTP62U/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alvin,</a> another “luxury” pencil at over ten dollars for one, disappointed us. It’s sleek and cool looking, but it’s uncomfortable to hold, it’s too hard to change the lead and it made our writing uneven and scratchy.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>We tend to treat mechanical pencils like they’re disposable, but really, a good one should last you a long time. For one you’ll want to keep around, we recommend the all-around impressive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017DBEIG/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pentel &#8211; Quicker Clicker</a>. If for some reason you can’t get your hands on that one, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0026ICM1E/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Uni-ball &#8211; Kuru Toga</a> is also a good bet. And if you do want one you can treat like a disposable, then choose the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001T6QCJC/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paper Mate &#8211; 34666PP Clearpoint</a>. It’s great quality for a very low price.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e consulted style professionals, scoured through hundreds of money clips, and then group tested 20 of the top-rated clips over the course of two weeks. We found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001RMO3NK/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Storus &#8211; Smart Clip</a> is the best money clip. If you’re in the market for a card holder and money clip hybrid, we found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EBNOQNO/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Viosi</a> is the best wallet style clip.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>When it comes to choosing the a money clip, there are two primary factors: fashion and function. We aimed to choose clips that had both. We also know that money clips aren’t complicated. At their simplest, they’re just a bent piece of metal. But even so, there are some distinctions you can make about which are higher quality and will serve you better over time.</p>
<p>So, we combed through Amazon reviews to find clips that users loved for their function and efficiency. Then, we consulted trendy sites like HiConsumption and The Coolist to find clips that fashion-forward folks would want to own. Since these sites focus on curation rather than testing, we were sure to thoroughly test every money clip on this list.</p>
<p>In our research, we found that while many people were looking for traditional money clips, many others were also looking for money clip wallets. Money clip wallets are simply cardholders with money clips attached. Most lack the traditional “pocket,” for cash, which many reviewers note cuts down on bulkiness. Still others liked money bands, which, while not truly a “clip,” performed a similar purpose of holding cash and cards together without the bulk of a wallet.</p>
<p>We decided to test all three of these “clip” types for our review, dividing them into the categories of money clips, money clip wallets, and banded money clips.</p>

<h2 id="who-should-use">Should you be using a money clip?</h2>
<p>The answer to this question depends largely on your habit and preferences. If you’re of the minimalist persuasion (or think that you could be), then a money clip is a natural choice. It forces you to cut back to the bare essentials. As one of our money clip testers put it:</p>
<p>“It was difficult to pare down my wallet to my ID, two credit cards and cash, but it finally accomplished something that I&#8217;ve been wanting to do for a while — get my big fat wallet out of my back pocket.”</p>
<p>If you’re dedicated to carrying several forms of ID, your coffee shop rewards card and a picture of your sweetheart everywhere you go, a money clip may not be right for you.</p>

<p>It’s also worth considering that a money clip, not unlike cuff links or a tie bar, can be an accessory for a special occasion. We spoke with men’s fashion and style blogger, Adam York of <a href="https://youraverageguystyle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Your Average Guy</a> who noted that “when the situation demands it&#8230;unleashing a bundle of crisp bank notes tightly clasped together within a stainless steel money clip will always have a timeless appeal.”</p>
<p>Still undecided? Let’s take a look at some pros and cons of carrying a money clip:</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most clips are sleek and unobtrusive, so they won’t ruin the look of an outfit. The <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/02/14/mans-wallet-giveaway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Art of Manliness</a> points out that “often underrated, [money] clips are even slimmer than wallets and can be eye catching if you find a good one.”</li>
<li>Most clips will fit in your front pocket, eliminating the need to sit on your wallet.</li>
<li>Money clips force you to stop carrying unnecessary items (like old gift cards) everywhere.</li>
<li>From a style perspective, money clips have a classic, vintage appeal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most clips cannot hold as many items as a conventional wallet.</li>
<li>Some are so lightweight that users say they wouldn’t know if the clip fell out of their pocket.</li>
<li>Some may consider money clips to be an “outdated” accessory.</li>
<li>Poor-quality or too-tight clips could potentially scratch your credit cards.</li>
</ul>
<p>One last note; there’s no doubt that in the modern age, many of us no longer carry paper money. In fact, according to the Washington Post half of Americans carry less than $20 in cash each day, and 9 percent of Americans carry none. Happily, many clips are just as effective at holding only a few plastic cards. (We’re looking at you, Adamant.)</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use">How to use a money clip</h2>
<p><a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/folding-gif.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-7977 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/folding-gif.gif" alt="" width="900" height="506" /></a></p>
<p>If you’ve decided that a money clip is a good option for you, you may be wondering how to use one. Don’t roll your eyes; we know the obvious answer is “you clip your money together!”</p>
<p>However, there actually is <a href="http://www.mademan.com/mm/how-use-money-clip.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some strategy</a> to using one effectively. First, if you have paper money, you should fold it in half. Fold smaller bills on the outside to discourage people from stealing your money. Keep in mind that if you only carry large bills, you’ll likely end up with more change. Once folded, place the money into the clip, folded side first. Then, slide your credit cards in on top of the cash.</p>
<p>If you are using a magnetic money clip, you may want to avoid using it to carry credit cards. There is some concern that doing so will mess with the chip reader on your card. However, reviewers of the magnetic money clips that we tested didn’t find any issue with this.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Type of clip:</strong> There are a few different types of clips from which you can choose. If you’re planning to carry primarily cash, choose a money clip or band. If you have several cards to carry as well, you may want to consider a money clip wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> At the end of the day, all money clips essentially do the same thing: clip your money. So the biggest difference between any money clip is how it looks. There are clips available in everything from carbon fiber to leather to sterling silver, so do some browsing (and set a budget) before you decide. Also consider the weight and width of the clip, since you’ll likely be carrying it most places you go.</p>
<p><strong>Quality:</strong> Does your money clip spring back into place after you open it? Does it seem like it will break if it’s a little overstuffed? Does it have sharp edges that’ll damage your phone screen? Or does it have a cheap finish that’ll show scratches from its scuffle with your keychain? Keep this in mind when selecting one.</p>
<p><strong>Capacity:</strong> Some of the more poorly designed clips that we tested could barely open wide enough to fit one bill. Others could probably hold a paycheck’s worth of cash, no problem.</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Based on our assessment of user reviews, there wasn’t a whole lot of quality difference between the cheaper and more expensive money clips. Some reviews claimed that the $20 clips (like the Storus) lasted them a decade, while more expensive ones looked worn-down after a year. So again, this really comes down to aesthetics. If you want something in solid aluminum or something gold plated, prepare to pay a lot more.</p>
<p><strong>RFID blocking:</strong> Many of the money clip wallets that we tested came with RFID blocking technology, which is supposed to stop thieves from stealing your credit card data. Does your wallet actually need this feature? It’s <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/07/04/535518514/there-are-plenty-of-rfid-blocking-products-but-do-you-need-them" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debatable</a>. You can also achieve the same RFID-blocking effect with a piece of aluminum foil.</p>

<p>For a product as simple and straightforward as a money clip, we figured the best way to test it was to get it into the hands of every-day users. So, we rounded up ten co-workers (both men and women) and gave them a few simple rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ditch your wallet and carry all of your cash and cards in a money clip (or money clip wallet, or banded money clip) for one week.</li>
<li>Use it everywhere you go, as you would a normal wallet.</li>
<li>No cheating with an auxiliary coin purse, money pouch or card carrier.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our testers did as they were told. Because of the clips’ slim profiles, many of our testers were forced to ditch the old gift cards, outdated IDs and crumpled receipts they’d been carrying. Many saw this as an unforeseen benefit of switching to a clip.</p>
<p>After our testers finished out their week, we asked them a series of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was your money clip convenient to use?</li>
<li>Did your money and cards stay securely in the clip?</li>
<li>How easy was it to both add and remove cash and cards to and from your clip?</li>
<li>How did you carry your clip? (Front pocket? Back pocket? Purse?)</li>
<li>Would you continue to use your money clip after testing?</li>
</ul>
<p>After our testers answered these questions, they repeated the process again with a second money clip (or wallet or band).</p>
<p>Once we had our answers, we did a qualitative analysis to decide which clips were worth testing further. We eliminated the clips that testers found egregiously difficult to use or otherwise problematic.</p>
<h3>Quality check</h3>
<p>Once we had only tester-approved clips remaining, we examined their quality. Did the clips have sharp edges that were likely to scratch a phone screen? Did they feel like they would snap when bent past their natural angles? Did they spring back into place each time they were opened? We noted our observations, then used all of this information to determine the top clip in each category.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Storus &#8211; Smart Clip</h2>

<p>Storus, a division of Mosaic brands Inc, makes innovative and unusual “personal storage solutions” that you don’t see on your average trip to the department store (think dual-sided money clips and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FBE0ILQ/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">jelly wallets</a>.) We ordered their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001RMO3NK/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smart Clip</a>, which costs between about $20 and $40 depending on the finish you choose. But regardless of the color, it’s secure enough to hold money and cards tightly, while still retaining enough room for a good deal of cash and cards.</p>
<p>The dual sided holders, an anomaly in the money clip world, mean that you can keep cash on one side and cards on the other. The Storus’ durable metal material also stood up well to getting knocked around by keys and purse contents.</p>

It's also the only dual-sided clip on our list that lets you clip money on one side and cards on the other.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001RMO3NK/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Upon receiving all of the money clips that we ordered, the Storus immediately stood out for its unique design. Its curved edges, wave-like aesthetic and double-sided clips make it a stand-out in a sea of rectangular clips. We ordered it in the gold color and found that the finish didn’t look chintzy or scratch easily. Reviewers on Amazon also noted that the finish did not wear down after extended use. Plus, our tester shared that this clip even garnered a few compliments when they pulled it out to pay.</p>
<p>The only downside of this clip is that it holds five cards maximum on one side, with our tester noting that (in their experience) it could handle no more than four. Keep in mind though that this clip does have two sides, so you could technically store cards on both. The final verdict from our tester? They’d “definitely continue using it.”</p>

<p>One of the most common responses to our money clip testing was “who carries cash anymore?”</p>
<p>It’s true, there’s no doubt that we are in the digital age, and many of us rely almost exclusively on credit cards for our transactions. If that’s the case for you, you may want to skip the Storus’ dual carrying capacity and head straight for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E3XVNUQ/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adamant</a> instead.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E3XVNUQ/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/adamant-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/adamant-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/adamant-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/adamant-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/adamant-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/adamant-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/adamant-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/adamant-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/adamant.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Minimalist Pick: Adamant</h3><p>If you said goodbye to cold hard cash a long time ago, the Adamant is the card-holding clip of your dreams.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E3XVNUQ/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>With its cost coming in at just under twenty bucks, this clip’s design is evocative of a bygone era. Its black finish and metallic stripes feel like a vintage car. However, its functionality takes a cue from the modern minimalist movement. The Adamant is best for carrying ID, debit, a couple of credit cards and nothing else; and it holds onto them with an iron grip. Yet despite its tight hold, our tester noted that it was “arguably the quickest and easiest card experience” he’d ever had when it was time to grab a card to pay.</p>
<p>The only downside? According to our tester, this clip’s tight clasp isn’t all that convenient for inserting and taking out flimsy dollar bills.</p>

<p>With nearly 2,000 Amazon reviews, a 4.7-star rating and a sub-20 dollar price point, we knew we had to give the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EBNOQNO/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Viosi</a> a try. Luckily, this money clip wallet didn’t disappoint, earning rave reviews from our focus group.</p>
<p>This genuine leather wallet is simple in appearance, with an ID window, several large slots and a magnetised clip on the outside. Our tester noted that it was convenient to use, with the outside clip making it easy to grab cash. Despite relying on a single magnet, this clip gave us no concerns about security. It held on to money firmly until it was time to be removed.</p>

It carries cash conveniently without sacrificing card space.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EBNOQNO/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The three card slots and two larger slots in the Viosi also mean that you don’t have to totally convert to minimalism to carry this wallet. There’s plenty of room in it for cards and receipts.</p>
<p>Looking for something even more budget friendly? The folks at Kinzd say their goal is to offer “slim wallets at extremely affordable pricing,” and they seem to be doing just that.</p>
<p>Depending on the color in which you purchase it, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B071P82NK8/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kinzd</a> money clip wallet can cost as low as $13 (at time of publish). That’s a great value for a wallet that earned a cumulative 4.5 stars from nearly 1,400 reviewers on Amazon.</p>
<p>This wallet was a favorite among our testers, so much so that others requested to try it even after testing was complete. Our tester noted that everything stayed put in this wallet, and its slim profile made it easy to tote around. Plus, the attached clip held cash safely in place.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B071P82NK8/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kinzd-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kinzd-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kinzd-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kinzd-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kinzd-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kinzd-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kinzd-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kinzd-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kinzd.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Budget Wallet: Kinzd</h3><p>The Kinzd is a bargain at just 20 dollars or less for a slim-profile wallet with a strong attached clip.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B071P82NK8/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Kinzd wallet is also durable, surviving a skirmish with some books and workout shoes at the bottom of our tester’s bag.</p>
<p>The only downside? The magnetized feature on this wallet clip has a tendency to adhere to other items, like keychains. Though, this may not be a downside if you’re looking to pull all of the essentials out of your bag at once!</p>

<p>If you’re looking for an alternative way to store your money that’s not a traditional wallet and not quite a money clip, consider the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZBADOTS/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prägres</a> wood front wallet. Costing about $14 at time of publication, this contraption is hard to confine to any one money-carrier category.</p>
<p>Our tester was pretty skeptical about this wallet, yet by the end of the week they were asking if they could keep it permanently. They loved the Prägres’ light weight and slim design, which allowed them to carry it in their front pocket. They also traveled with this wallet and found that whipping it out at the airport to retrieve their ID was easy.</p>
<p>The people at Prägres pride themselves on “wallets that make a statement,” and this one will certainly garner some attention. It has a hard, wooden construction that acts as a sort of frame for your credit cards. A band wraps around the entire frame to keep money and cards in place. On the back side of the wallet, you can slide your paper money under the band. A fun add? The wallet comes with three different colored bands to swap out as desired.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, it kept our tester’s credit cards secure, yet allowed for easy removal when it was time to use them. And just in case you plan to do any cannonballs into the nearest pool, the reviews also state that this wallet will float.</p>
<p><i>Editor&#8217;s Note</i>: The wooden version of this wallet is currently sold out, but Prägres makes a convenient and sleek <a href="https://www.pragresproducts.com/collections/all/products/carbon-clip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carbon fiber alternative</a> that comes with a built-in bottle opener.</p>
<p>Looking for an even lower-priced banded alternative? The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AU50H0S/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xband</a> is our budget pick. Costing under $10, the Xband is minimalist in both price and composition. Simple in design, it has two nylon strips in the shape of, you guessed it, an “X,” that hold your money in place. Reviewers loved the simple functionality of this money carrier, and so did our tester. They noted that it was “super convenient,” and they liked that it stayed securely in their back pocket.</p>

<p>More high praise for this simple band? The Xband was easy to put cards and cash in and made it relatively easy to take cards and cash out. Its description claims that you only need to remove one strap to remove your cash, while the other strap keeps the rest of your contents secure.</p>
<p>The only complaint? Much like traditional money clips, the Xband makes it hard to pull just one bill or card out. It’s easier to remove everything, shuffle through it and then clip or band it all back together.</p>

<p><strong>Royce &#8211; Leather Magnetic money clip</strong>: While the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004NZVH5K/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Royce</a> clip didn’t make our top picks, it’s still a quality choice for under $20. Its simple leather construction makes it classy and gender-neutral in appearance. Plus, our reviewer liked that it was “small enough to fit in a women&#8217;s pocket, but not too small to misplace.” The biggest downfall of this clip? Our tester didn’t feel the the magnet was strong enough to hold more than a couple of cards.</p>
<p><strong>Serman Brands &#8211; Real Carbon Fiber money clip</strong>: The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016XBCLW4/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Serman</a> clip feels well-constructed and extremely lightweight in your pocket or bag. It has RFID-blocking technology, and doesn’t scratch easily. What didn’t our tester like about this clip? It’s looser grip meant the clips’ contents got knocked-around easily, and it’s also not the most visually-attractive option on the market.</p>

<p><strong>idclipz &#8211; Slim Carbon Fiber money clip wallet</strong>: Though the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G2CSSNU/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">idclipz</a> wallet clip didn’t make it into our top picks, our tester had rave reviews for it. They loved that it was slim enough to carry in their front pocket, and that the the magnetized clip was strong enough to feel secure. The only downside? A common complaint among our money clip testers: it’s hard to pull one bill out of the clip without everything else coming with it. For another magnetized choice, try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EBNOQNO/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Viosi</a>.</p>
<p><strong>MUTBAK &#8211; Bunker</strong>: Our tester loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJUVIPA/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MUTBAK</a> for its slim profile and secure clip. It’s also one of the trendier-looking wallet clips on our list, with a worn-in leather look. The only major drawback to the MUTBAK is its overly-deep credit card pockets, which make it hard to retrieve your plastic quickly. Still, if you need a slimmer wallet for a quick vacation, the MUTBAK would be a good choice.</p>
<h3>Clips we don’t recommend</h3>

<p><strong>CL Carbonlife &#8211; Carbon Fiber Money Clip</strong>: Though reviewers on Amazon loved the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018HYPYBU/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CL Carbonlife</a>, our tester found that the material was too rigid and made getting money out a difficult experience. In our experience, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001RMPQ5O/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Storus</a> is a better pick for your money.</p>
<p><strong>Sharkk &#8211; Stainless Steel Clip</strong>: We think our tester put it best: “the good news about this clip is that the metal is incredibly sturdy and will NOT release your plastic cards. The bad news is that it will NOT release your plastic cards.” They found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AIY3N02/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sharkk</a> was too stiff, would not budge, and even scratched their credit cards when they tried to yank them out. For a similar design that won’t damage your plastic, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E3XVNUQ/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adamant</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NapaWalli &#8211; Front Pocket Clip Wallet</strong>: The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073J9W8RP/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NapaWalli</a> has great aesthetic appeal, and our testers liked its small, slim size. However, its downfall was its pockets. Our testers found them so stiff that getting cards out “was a chore.” We recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EBNOQNO/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Viosi</a> instead.</p>
<h3>Some more luxurious picks</h3>
<p>Like any accessory, appearance matters. So we decided to share some top-shelf picks that have serious visual appeal. We didn’t test these clips, but they get high style points from an aesthetic perspective. We like the Craighill &#8211; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073GHYYG9/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Square</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073HG1HX6/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wave</a> money clips for their unique shapes, and the <a href="https://www.ahalife.com/product/149000041939/brass-money-clip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maxx and Unicorn</a> &#8211; brass clip for its geometric appeal. And we also have our eyes on these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0091DMRNK/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">aluminum</a> money clips.</p>

<p>There’s no doubt that minimalism is having a moment, and a money clip ensures that decluttering begins in your pocket (or purse). It should be an item that you buy once and don’t have to think about again for a long time. It should be simple, functional and of course stylish. For the our top pick, we think the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001RMO3NK/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Storus &#8211; Smart Clip</a> achieves all of those goals. If you’re looking for the best wallet style clip, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EBNOQNO/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Viosi</a> &#8211; front pocket money clip gives you great value at a low price, and for the best banded money clip, the <a href="https://www.pragresproducts.com/collections/all/products/carbon-clip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prägres</a> has our vote.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent 30 hours testing six of the best key finders on the market. After extensive testing and real-world day-to-day use, we determined that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L3VEC08/?tag=ybdkey-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Tile &#8211; Mate</a> is the overall best key finder. Tile stood out in large part thanks to its reliable Bluetooth connectivity, highly audible alert, and its crowdsourced network that significantly increases the chances of finding lost keys, even when you’re out of range. We also found the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PBWS52W/?tag=ybdkey-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> KeyRingerXL</a> to be an impressive option.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-chose">How we chose finalists to test</h2>
<p>We’ve all lost keys more times than we’d like to admit, so we wanted to find a solution for ourselves as much as for our readers! The first step in this process was to figure out which brands were the most well-regarded.</p>
<p>The most obvious brand is, of course, Tile. Tile revolutionized the key finder market when they released their first RFID hardware in 2014, and have sold more than four million units in just a couple of years.</p>
<p>We also found several positive reviews of the XY3 key finder. However, it’s worth noting that there was also a significant number of negative reviews for this particular product. We wanted to test it for ourselves to see who was right.</p>
<p>Finally, we saw a few very passionate advocates for the KeyRingerXL. While this product didn’t have a particularly modern website, and doesn’t have an accompanying app (it can’t since it&#8217;s sound-based), there were enough positive mentions for us to give it a try.</p>
<p>We also looked at Amazon reviews, as well as general roundup articles on key finders. We used that data, along with our own analysis of what features a key finder should have, to come up with our list of six finalists.</p>

<h2 id="think-about">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>Most people don’t think about buying a key finder unless they’ve have one too many panicked occurrences of their keys getting lost. This means that you probably already have a pretty good sense of what you want your key finder to do, based on the types of situations you’ll most likely be needing it.</p>
<h3>Choosing a technology</h3>
<p>We think that choosing a key finder technology is critical to ultimately making the right purchasing decision.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways that key finders do what they do. Among our six finalists, there were three technologies being utilized: Bluetooth/RFID, radio frequencies, and audible receivers.</p>
<p>While there are disadvantages and advantages to each, we think the Bluetooth key finders offer the best solution overall. While there are certainly benefits and reasons to choose the other options, in general we strongly recommend you start your search with one of the Bluetooth key finders and only move to radio or audible key finders if there is a specific reason for doing so.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth key finder: </strong>All of the key finders we tested with accompanying smartphone apps used Bluetooth technology to operate. These included the Tile, VSF, and XY3 key finders. Bluetooth is advantageous because the connection between the key finder and smartphone is reciprocal. In other words, the smartphone can be used to find the key finder, and the key finder can also be used to find your smartphone.</p>
<p>The downside, of course, is that you’re dependent on having a smartphone on you to find your keys. That means you won’t be able to use your key finder if you don’t also have your phone on you (or if the battery is dead).</p>
<p><strong>Radio frequency key finder: </strong>Radio frequency key finders use older and simpler technology to get the job done. Instead of communicating via Bluetooth, key finders come with an associated transmitter. The transmitter has one or more buttons on it which, when pressed, emit a radio signal that activates the key finder.</p>
<p>The most notable advantage of radio frequency key finders is the fact that they aren’t dependent on a smartphone, an app, Internet connectivity, or any other third-party element to function. Radio key finders are also very simple and straightforward to use — essentially just “click and ring”.</p>
<p>There are a few downsides to this technology that were quickly apparent during our testing. First of course is the lack of functionality when compared to the apps that come with all three Bluetooth key finders. However, if you’re not interested in those features, this isn’t really a problem.</p>
<p>There is also the problem that arises when the transmitter — which is about as small and easy to lose as the key finder — itself becomes lost. In this instance, you’re right back to square one, except with an extra step added in. Ideally, the transmitter would stay in one place all the time, but that does severely limit the functionality of the key finder, or at least where you’ll have access to it when you need it.</p>
<p>Similarly, if the key finder is out of range of the transmitter, there isn’t any great way to find it. You won’t be able to see where it was last tracked (as you can with the smartphone apps), and you won’t have the benefit of a crowdsourced recovery feature.</p>
<p><strong>Audible key finder: </strong>The last key finder technology we tested seems to be rare in the key finder market, and was only found on one of our finalists: The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PBWS52W/?tag=ybdkey-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KeyRingerXL</a>. Audible key finders are unique in the sense that each unit in the pair function as both transmitter and receiver. That’s because the audible key finders work by emitting a loud and unique “chirp”. When the other key finder hears that chirp, it begins emitting its own chirp — no radio frequencies or Bluetooth syncing required.</p>
<p>We were impressed by the substantial range of this technology, and in fact the KeyRingerXL had by far the greatest maximum range among our finalists. The key finders were also capable of being paired with more than one other device, and the KeyRinger website offers both the ability to customize and program the key finders, as well as find the key finders even if both are lost somewhere nearby.</p>
<p>The obvious disadvantage of this technology is the same as the radio frequency technology — without a corresponding smartphone app, there is no way to find the key finder if it’s out of range, and no way to leverage other users (like you can with the Tile) as a crowdsourced (and anonymous) “lost and found” network.</p>
<h3>Other considerations</h3>
<p>Based on what we saw during testing, choosing which key finder technology to use is the most important consideration, largely because each technology has a direct and significant impact on the other considerations. That being said, there are a few specific considerations that are worth thinking about when choosing a key finder.</p>
<p><strong>Geofencing capabilities: </strong>A key finder with geofencing has the capability of alerting you (on your smartphone, tablet, or Apple Watch) when you are moving out of range of the key finder (and your keys). It is a preventative way of reducing the chance you leave your keys somewhere without realizing it. If this is a feature you’re looking for, you’ll be limited to the VSF and XY3 key finders — our top pick, the Tile, does not yet have this capability.</p>
<p><strong>Locating something other than keys: </strong>While the products are called “key finders” the reality is they can be used for a number of other uses as well. Some people have been known to keep a Tile in their car in order to make the car easier to find in a parking lot or when street parking in an urban downtown area. Key finders can also fit inside purses and backpacks, gym bags, or anything else you don’t want to lose.</p>
<p><strong>Replaceable batteries: </strong>Another consideration you’ll want to think about is whether you want a key finder with replaceable batteries or one that needs to be replaced when the battery dies. Replaceable batteries extend the lifespan of a key finder, but key finders like the Tile don’t offer replaceable batteries.</p>
<p>Instead, Tile provides discounted rates (about half the cost of a new Tile) for sending in your old tile. If having the ability to replace batteries is important to you, you’ll probably want to look at our other top picks, the KeyRingerXL and the VSF key finder, instead of our top pick, the Tile.</p>
<p><strong>Extended range: </strong>During our testing, we noticed a substantial difference between the range of our finalists. On the high end was the KeyRingerXL, which was able to reliably activate from a distance of 338 feet — longer than the length of a football field!</p>
<p>On the other end were the radio frequency key finders, the Click ‘n Dig and the Esky, which had reliable ranges of 52 and 39 feet respectively.</p>
<p>The Bluetooth key finders performed better than the radio options, but still weren’t able to match the KeyRingerXL for range. Both the Tile and the VSF key finder smartphone apps were able to pick up a signal (i.e., they knew the key finder was “nearby”) as far away as 260 feet. However, it wasn’t until the Tile was at 130 feet, and the VSF was at 121 feet, that they were able to active their respective ringers.</p>
<p>The XY3 was an underwhelming product, with a significantly-lower signal range of just 104 feet, and a 91-foot max range for activation of the key finger.</p>

<p>As we mentioned, there are a number of benefits associated with the Bluetooth-based key finders. Perhaps the most significant is the ability to “pair” key finders with your smartphone — enabling a number of additional features that simply cannot be done with the radio frequency and audible options.</p>
<p>One of the distinguishing benefits is the two-way nature of key finders with smartphone apps. Effectively, this means that the key finder also acts as a phone finder. For anyone who frequently loses their phone in a couch cushion or somewhere else similar, this added feature can significantly increase the value of using a “key finder”.</p>
<p>Key finders with a smartphone app also have a significantly wider range. Unlike the radio frequency or audible options, smartphone apps can tell users the last known position of the key finder — even if that position is no longer in range.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4664" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tile-map-pixelated.jpg" alt="Tile last known location" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tile-map-pixelated.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tile-map-pixelated-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tile-map-pixelated-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tile-map-pixelated-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tile-map-pixelated-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tile-map-pixelated-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tile-map-pixelated-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tile-map-pixelated-180x119.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tile-map-pixelated-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>In addition, the Tile smartphone app allows users to put their key finder in “lost mode”. When in this mode, the Tile will automatically and anonymously connect to any other Tile-enabled smartphone, and send a location update to the owner of the Tile. This crowdsourced “lost and found” makes the Tile much more effective and is one of the main reasons it is our top key finder.</p>

<p>We ran each of our finalists through an extensive series of tests designed to measure how they would perform in real-life situations.</p>
<p>More specifically, we were interested to find out how loud each of the finalists were from various distances. We tested each key finder at six feet, 20 feet, and around the corner into the next room (a distance of 30 feet). To make these measurements, we used a sound decibel meter.</p>
<p><a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/key-finder_noise-reliability.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4665 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/key-finder_noise-reliability.png" alt="key finder noise and reliability" width="880" height="766" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/key-finder_noise-reliability.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/key-finder_noise-reliability-610x531.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/key-finder_noise-reliability-360x313.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/key-finder_noise-reliability-375x326.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/key-finder_noise-reliability-414x360.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/key-finder_noise-reliability-295x257.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/key-finder_noise-reliability-180x157.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/key-finder_noise-reliability-320x279.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></a></p>
<p>We also tested the reliability of each key finder by activating them 20 times each from the same distances. While the RF finalists lost significant reliability when out of direct “line of sight”, both the Bluetooth finalists and the audible finalist, the KeyRingerXL, had 100% reliability from a distance of 30 feet with two walls in the way.</p>
<p>We then measured the maximum range of each key finder. For the Bluetooth options, we separated the range into “signal acquisition” and “key finder activation”. This was necessary because the smartphone apps were able to detect the Bluetooth key finder significantly sooner than they were able to deliver an activation signal.</p>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly, by far the best range came from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PBWS52W/?tag=ybdkey-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KeyRingerXL</a>. We were able to reliably activate the key finder from as far away as 338 feet — nearly 100 feet farther than signal acquisition on the Tile and VSF and more than 200 feet farther than any other key finder activation.</p>
<p>Our testing also included some standard considerations, such as weight, battery type and replicability, quality of smartphone apps (when applicable), and general ease of use.</p>
<p>While we initially expected the smartphone apps to be a significant factor, all three of the apps worked very well. Ultimately, because the smartphone apps were of such a high caliber, they played only a minor role in determining the best Bluetooth key finder.</p>
<p>Finally, we looked at any standout, or unique, features that set any of the finalists apart. The most notable example of this is Tile’s crowdsourced lost and found. Due to the fact that Tile has sold more than six million units, this feature dramatically improves the expected “find rate” for lost items, and quickly put the Tile in contention for the top spot.</p>
<h2 id="the-best">Best overall: Tile &#8211; Mate</h2>

<p>Anyone who has used a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L3VEC08/?tag=ybdkey-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tile &#8211; Mate</a> before probably isn’t surprised that it beat the rest of our finalists to become our top pick. The Tile is widely regarded as the leader in the key finder category, and our testing indicates that the reputation is well-deserved.</p>
<p>In terms of build quality, the Tile is clearly a well-manufactured product. The hard plastic is designed to handle spills, falls, and the general abuse that any product that spends time in pockets and purses will inevitably face.</p>
<p>The Tile is also tied as the lightest key finder we tested, weighing in at just 0.25 ounces. The light weight of the Tile meant that multiple drops from five feet in the air cause no notable damage, with the Tile simply bouncing harmlessly on the ground.</p>
<h3>How the Tile performed in our tests</h3>

<p>The Tile had perfect reliability from all real-world distances, was louder than almost all the other key finders (second only to the exceptionally-loud KeyRingerXL), and had a polished and user-friendly smartphone app compatible with both Android and iOS operating systems.</p>
<p>The pairing process with our iPhone was painless as well. After creating a Tile account and logging in, there is a simple step-by-step process that helps first-time users add the Tile to their account, give it a name, and test that it is in fact paired with the phone. As far as Bluetooth pairing processes go, this is certainly one of the easier ones.</p>

<p>The Bluetooth connection is robust and reliable. Using our iPhone 6, we were able to acquire a signal while outdoors from a range of 260 feet away, and could activate the ringer from a distance of 130 feet. This was the best range of all the finalists, with the notable exception of the KeyRinger XL, which had a maximum activation range of 338 feet.</p>
<p>The Tile was also able to produce an impressive amount of sound from such a small, light package. From six feet away, our decibel meter read 61 decibels (dB), dropping to a still quite audible 49 dB from a distance of 20 feet away. This means that you should be able to hear the Tile when it rings from 20 feet away, even in an indoor urban environment.</p>
<p>Overall, the Tile performed marginally better than our other top finalists — specifically, the KeyRingerXL and the VSF Key Finder. However, what really brought Tile over the top was the “Community Find” feature. Unlike all of the other finalists we tested, the Tile has a special “lost mode” which automatically alerts you with an updated location when anyone with Tile app installed and active on their phone passes near your Tile.</p>

<p>The Community Find feature is completely anonymous — neither you nor the individual who was in range of your Tile will be identified to one another. However, you will get an updated location, and the user who “found” your Tile will receive a notification that they helped someone out.</p>
<p>The Community Find feature, which works alongside Tile’s millions of users, dramatically improves the likelihood of finding even the most hopelessly lost keys.</p>
<h3>What we didn’t like about the Tile</h3>
<p>Overall, there’s no question that Tile is the best option from among our finalists. However, there were a few aspects of the Tile that we weren’t in love with.</p>
<p>The most significant thing was also one that was unique to the Tile. Unlike all the other key finders we tested, the Tile’s battery is not removable. This means that once the battery dies (usually after about 12 to 18 months of use), the Tile is dead and must be replaced.</p>
<p>Tile does this because they want users to send them their old Tiles, which they then replace with a brand new one at a significant discount (usually about 50% off). Tile claims this is to improve the user experience, and ensure that users always have the latest hardware available.</p>
<p>While some might find the planned obsolescence of their key finder a bit irritating, the company does make the process as easy as possible. The program, called reTile, allows users to replace their Tiles starting at the 11-month point. In addition to an automatic alert in the Tile app when it’s getting close to the replacement point, they also will send the new Tile along with a postage paid return envelope for the old Tile.</p>
<p>One other downside of the reTile program is that users can only get discounted Tiles once per year — which means anyone who purchases Tiles at different points in the year will likely miss out on some of the discount.</p>
<p>Tile claims that their battery and reTile program exist to simplify the process. While that may be true, it can be an inconvenience, or source of irritation, for those who don’t want to abide by the rules and restrictions of the program.</p>
<p>The other issue we had with the Tile is that there is (as of yet) no geofencing feature. Unlike both of the other Bluetooth key finders we tested, (the VSF and XY3), the Tile does not have a notification to alert users when they are exiting a predetermined radius from their key finder.</p>
<p>For those who are specifically looking for this feature, Tile might not be the best choice. However, we expect Tile to add this feature at some point in the not too distant feature — particularly if enough people ask for it.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, the Tile is without question the best key finder currently available — and they are making consistent improvements to their hardware and software over time as well.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L3VEC08/?tag=ybdkey-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tile</a> is the undisputed, and well-deserved, industry leader for key finders.</li>
<li>The Tile app is streamlined and easy to use for anyone familiar with a smartphone.</li>
<li>The crowdsourced and anonymous “lost and found” feature distinguishes the Tile and makes it the clear winner in a strong overall field of contenders.</li>

<p>If you don’t want, or don’t need, a key finder with an associated app, we have determined that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PBWS52W/?tag=ybdkey-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KeyRingerXL</a> is the best option available to you. In addition to being simple to set up and surprisingly customizable, the KeyRingerXL has an impressive range (the farthest of all our finalists) and a piercingly loud ring. When the KeyRingerXL goes off in your home, there’s no doubt you’ll be able to hear it.</p>
<h3>What we liked about the KeyRingerXL</h3>
<p>The KeyRingerXL is perfect for anyone who wants to make absolutely sure that they are able to find their keys — no matter where they happen to be in the house. This is largely thanks to the KeyRingerXL’s decibel level.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4667 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/key-finder_noise-levels.png" alt="" width="880" height="736" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/key-finder_noise-levels.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/key-finder_noise-levels-610x510.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/key-finder_noise-levels-360x301.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/key-finder_noise-levels-375x314.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/key-finder_noise-levels-414x346.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/key-finder_noise-levels-295x247.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/key-finder_noise-levels-180x151.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/key-finder_noise-levels-320x268.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>At a range of six feet, our noise meter recorded an astounding 85 dB — which is about as loud as a vacuum cleaner or a diesel truck going 40 mph from 50 feet away, and all coming from a 0.6 ounce battery-powered device.</p>
<p>Setup for this product is simple and straightforward. Right out of the box, the pair of key finders are paired to one another — this also means that you can use the key finder on your keys to find the other paired device when you misplace it. In addition, the devices are highly (and surprisingly) customizable, using a “programming” setting in conjunction with the Key Ringer website.</p>
<p>This means that the KeyRingerXL has all the simplicity of an &#8220;app-less&#8221; key finder, but still has the flexibility and customization normally limited to app-based options (by using the website).</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L3VEC08/?tag=ybdkey-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/keyringerxl-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/keyringerxl-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/keyringerxl-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/keyringerxl-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/keyringerxl-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/keyringerxl-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/keyringerxl-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/keyringerxl-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/keyringerxl.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best App-Free Option: KeyRingerXL</h3><p>This durable key finder is the loudest option we tested, and works without the use of a smartphone app.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L3VEC08/?tag=ybdkey-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The website itself allows users to pair their KeyRingerXLs into as many combinations as they could possibly need. By subtly changing the tone of the ring, key finders can be set to one of 2,000 different channels. This means you can have as many key ringer pairs/sets as you need, all of which can work either together or on their own unique channels.</p>
<p>In addition, the website allows users to ping their key finder using their computer, laptop, tablet, or phone speakers — in other words, even if you lose all of your key finders, you’ll still be able to ping them.</p>
<p>While the loud volume of the KeyRingerXL can be useful, it can actually be too loud for some situations — for example if young children might put the ringer up to their ear, potentially causing damage. However, the <a href="http://keyringer.com/set-volume.htm">Key Ringer website</a> allows users to change the volume to one of five different settings: Extra Quiet, Quiet, Medium, Loud, or Extra Loud.</p>
<p>In addition to the customizable volume, the KeyRingerXL also has a flashing light, which makes it easier to find when hiding under a bed or a couch. The key finders are also very durable, showing no scratches when dropped on asphalt several times in a row.</p>
<h3>What we didn’t like</h3>
<p>Overall, the KeyRingerXL is an excellent product. However, if you’re looking for a smartphone app to work with your key finder, then the KeyRingerXL isn’t for you. For many, the biggest issue will be the inability to find the device when it is not within the maximum range (unlike key finders with smartphone apps that show the “last known” location).</p>
<p>The customization on the website, while certainly useful, can be a little challenging to figure out for some. However, they responded in under 24 hours to our queries, so any challenges you might face with the website should be resolved reasonably quickly.</p>
<p>On its default setting, the KeyRingerXL really is too loud for most situations. During our noise testing, we put on ear protection in order to reduce the piercing sound. Just remember to lower the sound setting via the website when you first get your key finders.</p>
<p>Finally, the KeyRingerXL is the most expensive product we tested. However, we think the value is certainly there, especially since the KeyRingerXL doesn’t need to be replaced every year like the Tile. On the Key Finder website, they claim that a battery should last at least 18 months, which reduces the inconvenience of replacement compared to the Tile.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PBWS52W/?tag=ybdkey-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KeyRingerXL</a> is a well-made product for anyone who wants a key finder without an associated smartphone app.</li>
<li>They KeyRingerXL is surprisingly customizable, with five noise settings and 2000 pairing channels to choose from.</li>
<li>While the range is the longest from among our finalists (338+ feet), the KeyRingerXL cannot be found when out of range. For those who want the “last known” location of their key finder, the Tile is a better pick.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071415VVJ/?tag=ybdkey-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vibez Smart Finder</a> (VSF) is our runner-up pick, and is worthy of an honorable mention for a few reasons. The VSF is similar to the Tile in many ways, but had a few standout features we thought were worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest difference is the fact that the VSF has replaceable batteries. This could either be a good or a bad thing depending on your perspective, but we think it’s beneficial that an alternative exists for those who prefer it.</p>
<p>The VSF smartphone app also has a built-in feature that allows users to take photographs by clicking on the VSF device. Users can open the VSF app on their smartphone, set up a photograph, then get everyone in the shot without relying on using the “selfie” angle. While not everyone will care about this feature, those that do should strongly consider the VSF as an alternative.</p>

<p>The biggest downside to the VSF is that it simply does not have the user adoption that the Tile key finder has. This also means that VSF isn’t able to offer a crowdsourced lost and found feature like the Tile. That particular feature dramatically increases the value of a key finder, as well as the likelihood that lost keys will in fact will be found. That reason alone is enough to put the Tile ahead of the VSF.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071415VVJ/?tag=ybdkey-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">VSF</a> key finder is similar to the Tile key finder, with a solid app and build quality.</li>
<li>The VSF can be used to take photos from a distance using the associated app.</li>
<li>There is no crowdsourced lost and found feature, which is a key differentiator between the VSF and the Tile.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-others">Other finalists we tested</h2>
<p>We often find that our “other finalists” are solid choices that only lose when compared to our top picks. That isn’t the case with our key finder finalists. While the three remaining key finders are adequate products, they pale in comparison to our top picks. For the same money, you can get a much better product by choosing one of our three recommended key finders.</p>
<h3>XY3 &#8211; Find It</h3>
<p>There are two positive features that stood out when we tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H747URW/?tag=ybdkey-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">XY3</a>: The durable design and the geofencing feature. The small XY3 looks like it’s something from the future, and also looks like it could be run over by a truck and still function (we didn’t test this theory, however). It also offers a geofencing feature, which alerts the user via smartphone notification when the XY3 is no longer in range. This feature can be useful for those who might forget their keys when leaving their home or the office.</p>
<p>However, despite these positive attributes, the XY3 underperformed our top picks across the board. For the money, you can do better.</p>
<h3>Click &#8216;n Dig</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009JJJ7S4/?tag=ybdkey-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Click &#8216;n Dig</a> is a decent product, especially for those who want a no-nonsense key finder. There’s no app or website for the Click &#8216;n Dig, simply a paired radio frequency transmitter and receiver.</p>
<p>Other than the fact that the Click &#8216;n Dig doesn’t offer anything unique or noteworthy, the reliability was a deal breaker for us. At a range of 30 feet (in the next room) it only worked 50% of the time. Even worse, the reliability from six feet away was only 90%. Needless to say, we wouldn’t trust the Click &#8216;n Dig to help us find our keys.</p>
<h3>Esky &#8211; Wireless</h3>
<p>Like the Click &#8216;n Dig, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011NT1ODS/?tag=ybdkey-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Esky Wireless</a> key finder had nothing unique or noteworthy to offer. On top of that, the noise level was lower than all our other finalists (except the XY3), and the reliability was even worse than the Click &#8216;n Dig. At a range of just six feet, the Esky Wireless only worked 85% of the time — completely unacceptable in our opinion.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Key finders are an interesting product, since they’re the type of thing people often buy after they need it. Losing your keys one too many times prompts people to look for solutions, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L3VEC08/?tag=ybdkey-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tile</a> has well earned its place as the industry leader.</p>
<p>In addition to having perfect reliability and a streamlined smartphone app, the Tile leverages its market position by offering a “lost mode”. This mode utilizes every Tile user’s smartphone anonymously so that the Tile can be located by the owner. This feature dramatically improves the usefulness of the Tile, and makes it an easy choice for best key finder overall.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PBWS52W/?tag=ybdkey-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KeyRingerXL</a> is a strong alternative for those who don’t want (or don’t need) a smartphone app. It is easy to use, durable, and has the greatest range of all the key finders we tested.</p>
<p>Ultimately, both the Tile and the KeyRingerXL are great options. You should make your choice based on the specific set of features you think will be most valuable to you.</p>
