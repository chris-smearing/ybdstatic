								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent over 30 hours researching, talking to kitchen design experts, testing with more than 150 trash bags and cleaning out 11 of the best trash cans out there. We crammed in all kinds of food scraps and bulky containers, and we found the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TXXPJBU/?tag=ybdtrsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> simplehuman &#8211; CW2024</a> to be the best kitchen trash can overall. It has a liner rim that makes it easy to change trash bags, an antimicrobial coating and a compartment in the back for extra bags. Our runner-up is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H6CJ7HQ/?tag=ybdtrsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HomeZone &#8211; VA41311A</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>In order to narrow down our field of prospects, we called our local Home Depot and spoke with Candice, who has been working at their Kitchen Design Center for over five years. She told us that their “customers usually look for something that keeps [the trash bag] covered and doesn’t require hands to open the top.&#8221; As such, the &#8220;step ones and automatic lids” are preferred.</p>
<p>Another key aspect she shared with us was a mechanism to help hold the bag in place, because nobody likes when the trash bag slips into the can. These mechanisms include clips on the sides, rubber bands in the back or on the sides and, our personal favorite, liner rims (like on the simplehuman &#8211; CW2024). Finally, she let us in on the most popular brands: simplehuman and Rubbermaid.</p>
<p>Once we established some of the main criteria for what makes a great kitchen trash can, we then looked to Reddit. The BuyItForLife and Frugal subreddits were very helpful in giving us a general idea of some of the best brands out there for homeware and other specifics to look for. We then looked through some of the options on Recycling.com as well as the respected review site WireCutter.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we found five stainless steel step trash cans, three motion-sensor ones and three affordable plastic options as our top 11 kitchen trash cans.</p>
<h2 id="the-best">Compare the best kitchen trash cans</h2>
[table id=80 /]
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Foot pedal:</strong> This is the trash can everyone knows. You step on the pedal at the bottom and the lid opens, voila. Even though this is the most common type of trash can, the types of pedals can vary. For example, some have a metal pedal that runs the entire width of the trash can, like the simplehuman &#8211; CW2024, while others have pedals less than six inches wide.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic lid:</strong> One of the main selling points touted by manufacturers of automatic lids is hygiene. Though step trash cans don’t require you to get your hands dirty, the automatic-lid advocates claim that their method is still better, because germs on your shoes from a step trash can can get spread throughout your home.</p>
<p>Hygiene aside, it simply comes down to preference. Something to keep in mind is that bigger pets can trip the sensors on the trash cans and open them as they walk by. You can always turn the trash can off before you leave the house, though.</p>
<p><strong>Swinging lid and one-touch lid:</strong> Most of us have spent at least a few minutes playing with the swinging lid on a trash can when we were kids (or adults). These require little effort to open, but due to their construction have a smaller opening in which to deposit trash. The one-touch lid, like the one on this Hefty &#8211; PRO-0189, is a spring-loaded lever you press to make the lid open. Then, the lid stays open until manually closed. It works well, but you’ll need a hand to open it before you throw away your trash.</p>
<p><strong>Shape and capacity:</strong> Some cans have different foot pedal placements, either on the skinny or wider side, which greatly affects placement in the room. Also their capacities range from 10 gallons to 13 gallons, the latter of which is the most common bag size on the market. Depending on the size of your family or number of roommates, you will be able to decide if 10 gallons is enough for your everyday needs or not. According to National Geographic, an average American throws away about three pounds of trash at home every day.</p>
<p>It depends on how much you throw away, but an easy rule of thumb to keep in mind is 10-for-two, or 10 gallons for two people. Any home with more than two people will likely require a bigger trash can. It should be noted that even though the capacity of a given can may be 10 gallons, the amount of space the trash can takes up can be similar to that of a 13-gallon trash can.</p>
<p><strong>Trash bags:</strong> In our testing, we learned a bit about the different types of trash bags. We found that it is better to buy bags that are too big rather than too small. So, 13-gallon trash bags work well with 10-gallon trash cans (and 13-gallon trash cans, of course). These Glad &#8211; 13 Gallon trash bags worked in every test with every trash can and are very affordable at just over 10 cents per trash bag.</p>
<p><strong>Body material:</strong> There are two basics materials that make up most kitchen trash cans: metal and plastic, or a combination of the two. Of course, the metals are going to differ from trash can to trash can so the important thing to look for is the outside coating. Take the best overall simplehuman &#8211; CW2024, for instance. It has a thin, silver antimicrobial coating that makes it fingerprint-proof and one of the easiest trash cans to clean.</p>
<p><strong>Stay-open lid:</strong> This function comes in handy when you need to throw away a lot of things in a row, like when you’re cooking or cleaning, for instance. Some have a little pin you can push like the simplehuman &#8211; CW1950 and others allow you just to lift the lid up like the Homezone -VA41311A. All of the motion-sensor trash cans have this function, which requires only the push of a button.</p>
<p><strong>Deodorizer and air freshener:</strong> Nobody likes the smell of trash, so having a special compartment for deodorizers like charcoal bags or air fresheners is a great perk. You can always get scented bags, but they don&#8217;t always work as intended — sometimes their scent isn&#8217;t strong enough to cover the smell, and other times the scent is too strong and overpowers the space. If you have a keen sense of smell or just really dislike even a hint of smelly trash, then the Tramontina &#8211; 81200/540 may be for you; it comes with two air fresheners that last 60 days.</p>
<p><strong>Internal liner:</strong> The internal liner is the removable plastic portion that comes with the trash can, which makes it a easy to switch bags and clean. These are almost always constructed of a plastic material, and if they get dirty you can take them outside and spray them down with a hose. While not a crucial addition to a trash can, it’s a nice bonus to have.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Everyday use</h3>
<p>While it&#8217;s important to get a breakdown of all the product features, much of what makes a trash can great is how it works as a whole. So we used each model for a few days at a time to get a feel for them before the “lab” testing. We used the trash cans while cooking meals and hosting people for dinner. We even got our guests&#8217; thoughts — and they loved the simplehuman &#8211; CW2024 too. We also did some much-needed home cleaning, which allowed for some quality time with our new trash cans!</p>
<p>During the house cleaning, it became apparent that a good stay-open lid feature is essential. Naturally, we played a bit of trashketball too. Both of our top choices (simplehuman &#8211; CW2024 and HomeZone &#8211; VA41311A) were great for this because they have wide mouths and are very sturdy on their own. The Rubbermaid &#8211; 1843029, however, is a bit light and can more easily be knocked over until there is some trash in there to weigh it down. That being said, it has the biggest mouth we tested.</p>
<p>The automatic trash cans (especially the Ninestars &#8211; DZT-50-9) made for an enjoyable cooking process as we slid the excess food right off the cutting board into the trash can without having to step on a pedal. Multi-tasking with a knife is not the best idea, which is another reason the stay-open lid was deemed so important.</p>
<p>To recap, there are really two key features to watch for: A wide opening (the wider the better) and a stay-open lid. Together these make for an effortless cooking and cleaning process.</p>
<h3>Ease of replacing trash bags</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13783" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ease-of-use.png" alt="ease of use chart" width="1800" height="2124" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ease-of-use.png 1800w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ease-of-use-610x720.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ease-of-use-768x906.png 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ease-of-use-885x1044.png 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ease-of-use-1500x1770.png 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ease-of-use-295x348.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ease-of-use-1000x1180.png 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ease-of-use-360x425.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ease-of-use-375x443.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ease-of-use-414x489.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ease-of-use-320x378.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ease-of-use-885x1044@2x.png 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Ahh, the holy grail of trash can functionality. If there is one thing that can make or break a trash can, it is how easy it is to remove and replace a bag. Although the mechanisms for replacing trash bags don’t differ too drastically, there were definitely some trash cans that were harder to change the bags for than others.</p>
<p>In an effort to remain scientific, we timed out how long it took to change the bag on each trash can three times and averaged out the time. We used this to arrive at an overall rating for the ease of removal and replacing of trash bags in each can.</p>
<h3>Trash bag grip</h3>
<p>This is also an important feature in a trash can; if it can’t hold your bag then what’s the point? We tested trash bag grip in a systematic, yet possibly unorthodox way. We started with multiple different types of trash bags (Glad &#8211; 13 Gallon, Kirkland &#8211; 10 Gallon, simplehuman &#8211; Code M and the other custom bags which are linked with their matching trash can). We then proceeded to “throw away” a bunch of rice, dumbbells and pillows to determine how well each trash can grabbed each trash bag.</p>
<p>The first test we conducted went like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install bag</li>
<li>Put in full-size pillow</li>
<li>Put in 10 lb of rice</li>
<li>Put in another full-size pillow</li>
<li>Put in another 10 lb of rice</li>
</ul>
<p>The second test went like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put in 10 lb bag of rice</li>
<li>And another</li>
<li>And another</li>
<li>And another</li>
<li>And another (that’s 50 lb total)</li>
</ul>

<p>For both of the tests, we marked at which point the bag ripped or slipped through, if it did. This allowed us to see how well each trash can could be stuffed and how much weight it could hold onto before slipping. (Note: the bags can all hold that much weight, so if the bag ripped it was due to the uneven disbursement of pressure around the rim of the trash can. For example, this odd shape on the simplehuman &#8211; CW1897 rim led to some tearing.)</p>
<h3>Trash can opening</h3>
<p>We first looked at the dimensions of each opening, or mouth, because that determines what you can fit into your trash can and what you cannot. The area of the mouth, as well as the shape, were taken into consideration when evaluating their effectiveness. For example, the BestOffice &#8211; TC-50R automatic trash can doesn’t allow you to put certain things in it, like pizza boxes, because it has a small square opening.</p>
<p>Next, we tested how easy it was to open the lids. None of the trash cans we tested are hard to open. And many of the top trash cans we tested have guarantees that the step-pedals will work for 150,000 steps or five to 10 years. Some of the more affordable options, however, shouldn’t be expected to last as long as their swanky counterparts. Obviously the upscale simplehuman models are going to give you a more long-term solution than the affordable Hefty &#8211; PRO-0189.</p>
<p>Do you keep your trash can pushed up against a wall? We wanted to ensure that any cans with wide-arching lids wouldn’t damage the walls (and paint) that they came in contact with. So we put each can up against the wall and tested the angle of the lids.</p>
<p>Luckily, only the Rubbermaid &#8211; 1843029 and Tramontina &#8211; 81200/540 hit the wall when opened. However, this only happened when we opened them as hard as possible, so simply placing your can an inch away from the wall stops this from occurring. Keep this in mind if you opt for one of those cans.</p>
<h3>Ease of cleaning</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13791" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaning-tests.jpg" alt="spraying and wiping down a trash can" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaning-tests.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaning-tests-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaning-tests-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaning-tests-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaning-tests-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaning-tests-1500x1001.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaning-tests-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaning-tests-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaning-tests-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaning-tests-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaning-tests-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaning-tests-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Where there’s trash, there’s bound to be a mess (especially if you have kids). So we took 10 everyday substances and put them on each trash can (both on the lid and side) and left them for 10 days. We then cleaned them with a sponge and water to see if that did the trick. We added soap if there were remnants or marks left. We evaluated both the ease of getting rid of the food as well as the stains they left behind, if any.</p>
<p>Substances included: hummus, cream cheese, BBQ sauce, ketchup, mustard, jelly, olive oil, red wine, orange juice and coffee.</p>

<p>We thought it was a good idea to include this section because not all trash cans are created equal. We looked at anything extra each trash can had including stay-open features, a deodorizing component and a place for extra bags. You can see the value we ascribed them in the chart above.</p>

<p>The best kitchen trash can overall is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TXXPJBU/?tag=ybdtrsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">simplehuman &#8211; CW2024</a>. This beautifully constructed metal trash can has the widest step pedal, plus it has a 10-year and 150-thousand-step warranty. Also, it is the only one we tested with an antimicrobial (and fingerprint-proof) coating, which makes it easy to keep clean.</p>
<p>It is the newer model of the simplehuman &#8211; CW1950 trash can and its upgrades are noticeable. For starters, it now has a metal lid, holds 11.9 gallons (up from 10) and uses a liner rim instead of a bucket-style liner.</p>
<p>The liner rim makes it nearly effortless to swap out an old bag and put in a new one, which is why it scored the highest out of any trash can in our tests. The liner rim also helps maintain the can’s minimal aesthetic since it flips down over the trash bag and covers it completely. This also helps keep the bag down and provides a firm hold. The simplehuman &#8211; CW2024 also has a wide, embedded and ergonomic handle in the back, in case you need to move the trash can from one place to another.</p>

All the features work flawlessly, and it even keeps spare bags handy.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TXXPJBU/?tag=ybdtrsh-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Yet another variation that sets this simplehuman apart is the compartment below the handle for extra bags. It also has a great stay-open lid mechanism that allows you to keep it open indefinitely; just push up the liner rim with your hands until it locks. There are custom fit trash bags available for this trash can that cost about three times as much as generic because they are thicker, but they aren’t vital. The trash can is so well-constructed that generic bags do just fine.</p>
<p>With its patented lid shox technology, the lid closes so slowly and quietly you won’t even notice it doing so. Most other luxury trash cans (we tested five, which are about $85 and up) have this silent feature, except the Tramontina &#8211; 81200/540, which makes a bit of a sound as the metal &#8220;clings&#8221; shut. Due to this slow closing, you also have plenty of time to throw something away if you don’t want to lift up the liner rim to keep it open.</p>
<p>There is no trash can liner in this can, but we found that this actually makes it very easy to use. You can swap bags out quickly and don’t have an extra part to clean. Another thing to keep in mind is the size of the opening, or mouth of the can. At 125 square inches, this is the third-biggest opening of the trash cans we tested, which is a plus.</p>
<p>Something we loved about this trash can is how absurdly easy it is to clean. A wet sponge took off all of the food and drink we put on it without a problem. No marks or blotches, not a stain in sight. Just shining silver (yes, we’re big fans of the antimicrobial &#8220;nano-silver&#8221; coating).</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The simplehuman &#8211; CW2024 has the best anti-fingerprint technology, making it easy to clean, and uses a silver antimicrobial coating to keep it clean and looking new.</li>
<li>The liner rim allows you to change out bags in a snap and keeps the bag hidden at all times, which further enhances its look.</li>
<li>This is the only trash can we tested that has a separate compartment for extra trash bags that can be taken out from the inside of the can. It also has optional custom fit bags, which are stronger, cleaner-looking and fit to perfection.</li>
<li>In order to keep the lid open indefinitely, all you have to do is pull up the liner rim!</li>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H6CJ7HQ/?tag=ybdtrsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HomeZone &#8211; VA41311A</a> took us by surprise a bit because of simplehuman’s reputation as the top trash can brand, but its stay-open lid function, bag-secure band and cleanability made it our second choice. It also has non-fingerprint technology, making it easy to clean. As far as size of openings go, the HomeZone is the same as the simplehuman above (125 square inches), which is bigger than the standard size for a kitchen trash can.</p>
<p>Both the lid and body of this can are metal and the step pedal is a hybrid of stainless steel and plastic. The HomeZone is one of the taller trash cans we tested, coming in at a height of 27 inches. Instead of a wide and short shape, it protrudes outwardly, going front to back like the simplehuman &#8211; CW1897. In order to keep the lid open indefinitely, all you do is step on the pedal so it opens, let is start to close and then lift up the lid. Simple.</p>

It retains bags very well and the stay-open lid system is perfect.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H6CJ7HQ/?tag=ybdtrsh-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The trash can liner is an imperfect rectangle: it has two curved indentations along the sides, which makes it easy to grab hold of and change the bag. However, the irregular shape made the 10-gallon trash bags rip a bit easier because the lid is less uniform, which leads to uneven pressure on the bag.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, though, you wouldn’t use 10-gallon bags in a 12-gallon trash can; it was just for testing purposes. There are also two plastic clips on the front and back of the liner, which keep the bag in place. There is also a bag-secure band (the rubber material that helps hold the trash bag).</p>
<p>Because the trash bag goes around the trash can liner, you can’t see the bag from the outside, which helps maintain the clean aesthetic. The HomeZone &#8211; VA41311A is a very sturdy trash can, so you don’t have to worry about your pets or kids knocking it over. Something worth mentioning, though, is that it came with a dent upon arrival. It was a small dent on the body, which came out pretty much all the way when we carefully used a hammer from the inside. And from the reviews we read, the return process is easy as pie.</p>
<p>The non-fingerprint stainless-steel is incredible. You can grab the trash can at its base (if for some reason you don’t want to use the handle on the back) and no marks are left. This also aids in the cleaning process. None of the 10 food items we used to try to stain it made a mark. In fact, they all came out with just water and a sponge after 10 days of sitting.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The HomeZone &#8211; VA41311A works flawlessly in every respect and has the features you want in a good trash can, like a stay-open lid and non-fingerprint stainless steel.</li>
<li>This is a sturdy trash can that can take a beating and come out alive, and it also keeps the trash bags hidden to keep your kitchen looking clean and tidy.</li>
<li>As far as bag-holding technology goes, this is one of the best due to its plastic clipping areas and the rubber bag-secure band on the trash can liner.</li>

<p>Although this was a close competition, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0031M9HJ4/?tag=ybdtrsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ninestars &#8211; DZT-50-9</a> won as the best motion-sensor trash can because of its bag holding ability and its fingerprint-resistant type 430 stainless steel. With a 10-inch reach and 130-degree angle infrared sensor, the Ninestars easily and reliably detects your hand when you need to throw away a piece of garbage.</p>
<p>Contrary to what the description on Amazon says, the trash can uses three &#8220;C&#8221; batteries (not four &#8220;D&#8221; batteries). Due to its energy-saving technology, it boasts a 20 percent longer battery life than its competitors (so, about a year). The Ninestars uses a top that can be removed without hassle and keeps the trash bag secure.</p>

<p>One of the biggest reasons to use a motion-sensor trash can is to avoid cross-contamination when cooking. Of course, you don’t have to use your hands to open the step pedal trash cans. And if you want to keep the lid open indefinitely you’ll need to touch the trash can, regardless of the type of can.</p>
<p>And if you don’t want to or can’t use your hands, the lid stays entirely open for three seconds after you move your hand away, which allows you plenty of time to get trash into the garbage. The Ninestars &#8211; DZT-50-9 has a solid design and a decently sized mouth (80 square inches) when compared to other motion-sensor models.</p>
<p>The stainless steel makes it a breeze to clean and, like the other top picks, all of the food and drink came off both the plastic lid and metal body with just a sponge and water. So if you happen to spill some on the trash can before your hand gets in range of the motion sensor, not to worry! It will clean right up.</p>
<p>It is a bit harder to change bags with this can because you need somewhere to put the big lid. That said, once the lid is out of the equation, changing bags couldn’t be easier. Even though this is a metal-plastic hybrid, it is pretty light (eight pounds) and top-heavy, which leaves it susceptible to knocks by children and animals.</p>
<p>There is a trash can rim liner that helps keep the bag in place, and although it’s just a thin piece of plastic, it does the trick well. The rim liner works in tandem with the heavier lid to keep the trash bags set in place, which is an upside to the heavier top.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Ninestars &#8211; DZT-50-9 uses type 430 stainless steel, which keeps fingerprints off the trash can and makes it simple to clean and keep that way!</li>
<li>The 10-inch and 130-degree angle infrared sensor aids in the throwing away process and keeps the contaminants inside the trash can and away from you.</li>
<li>As bag-holding technology is crucial to a good trash can, this is the best of the three motion-sensor trash cans we tested due to its rim liner and heavy lid.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MZSHX6Y/?tag=ybdtrsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; 1843029</a> scored fourth overall and is right around $20. Usually, the price can at least help you gauge how functional something will be, but this one took us by surprise. Its bag-holding technology is so simple and makes changing bags seemingly effortless. It was one of the only cans to score perfectly on the bag-changing test (along with our number one pick, the simplehuman &#8211; CW2024). Rubbermaid&#8217;s clip-in liner technology holds bags securely without tearing them or slowing you down on trash day.</p>

This Rubbermaid trash can also has the biggest opening we tested.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MZSHX6Y/?tag=ybdtrsh-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Rubbermaid has a monster mouth with an area of 186 square inches. That’s over 30 percent larger than the next largest (simplehuman 97 @ 140). So if you’re someone who likes to play trashketball, we definitely suggest using the Rubbermaid as your hoop. You don’t even need to use your hands to keep this open because it opens all the way and stays there.</p>
<p>All of the plastic trash cans received perfect scores on our cleaning tests and took even less effort to clean than the stainless steel non-fingerprint trash cans. All of the stains came out with just water and the rough side of a sponge (again, even after 10 days of sitting there).</p>
<p>One of the only downsides we found is that the Rubbermaid is light and more prone to being knocked over if it is empty. The lid can also open past 90 degrees, so we suggest keeping this an inch or two away from the wall. On a positive note, the pedal is a nice shiny metal that is tucked in at the bottom, which makes it a very uniform shape and something you won’t potentially trip over.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Rubbermaid &#8211; 1843029 has the biggest opening out of any trash can we tested and placed fourth overall, even though it is only around 20 bucks!</li>
<li>Not only is the black plastic just a few sponge wipes away from being clean, but the bag-changing technology is one of the best we found — in fact, it&#8217;s as good as the simplehuman trash can we rated best overall.</li>
<li>The clip-in liner technology, along with the stay-open lid technology, allows you to change a bag almost as quickly as you can throw something away.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tramontina &#8211; 81200/540</h3>
<p>Finishing third overall, it feels unfair that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0741N1N7Y/?tag=ybdtrsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tramontina &#8211; 81200/540</a> couldn’t make one of the top spots because it gives you nearly everything you could ask for in a kitchen trash can. Although it is missing the stay-open lid and opens up a bit aggressively, it is under $100 and scored incredibly well on all of our tests.</p>
<p>After all, this is the only trash can we tested that comes with two freshener cartridges, which last up to 60 days. Since we used unscented trash bags throughout our testing, we definitely noticed when the Tramontina was being tested due to these fresh sky scent cartridges.</p>
<p>The Tramontina is yet another non-fingerprint stainless steel trash can that was incredibly simple to clean and performed perfectly in our cleaning test (only sponge and water required and not a mark left!).<br />
This can is what comes to mind when you think of a standard metal trash can: nothing fancy in the body or pedal, it just looks good and functions properly. However, it can open a bit quicker if you intentionally (or unintentionally) step hard on the pedal, so we suggest keeping it at least an inch away from the wall.</p>
<p>It comes with a trash can liner that you can lift partially up and rest on a piece of plastic that’s protruding from the bottom of the can, which is perfect for when you’re changing bags. We all know that person who doesn’t replace the trash bag after taking out the trash. So now they have no excuse!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, one of the key functions in a kitchen trash can is the stay-open lid, and the Tramontina doesn’t have it. As a silver lining, however, the lid takes about seven seconds to close (the longest out of any we tested), giving you enough time to throw away most trash before it shuts.</p>
<h3>simplehuman &#8211; CW1897</h3>
<p>Just like it sounds, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008673164/?tag=ybdtrsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">simplehuman &#8211; CW1897 &#8220;Butterfly&#8221;</a> has a split lid that resembles wings, designed not to be held back by countertops or anything that may restrict it from above. You can feel its sturdiness just by looking at it. It’s big and professional looking. The simplehuman butterfly has a giant mouth (140 square inches) and is shaped like the runner up (HomeZone) in that it’s a front-to-back kind of trash can.</p>
<p>There are thick plastic rims that go all the way around the top and bottom, which give it an attractive overall look. Plus, it uses an all-steel pedal promising over 150,000 steps like the best overall trash can (the simplehuman) and a 10-year warranty. That is pretty tough to beat.</p>
<p>The simplehuman CW1897 has a trash can liner that sits on two indentations in the front and back to allow for easy grabbing. It also has a common sense stay-open system as well as a spot for you to rest the liner while you change the bag, which makes it a painless process. Again, like the other fingerprint-resistant metals, this stainless steel is in fact stainless. All it requires is a bit of water and a sponge and happy cleaning!</p>
<p>As with all simplehuman trash cans, this one comes with 10 custom fit bags and they fit perfectly. There is a little “bag tuck” in the liner that can either be used to keep an excess bag taught or, as we found out, you can keep an extra bag in there for next time.</p>
<h3>simplehuman &#8211; CW1950</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0016L679A/?tag=ybdtrsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">simplehuman &#8211; CW1950</a> comes with a five-year warranty, which is fantastic (even when compared to the 10-year warranty that the best overall simplehuman &#8211; CW2024 has). Aside from that, though, this model has several drawbacks, including a trash can liner, a slightly smaller volume of 10 gallons, a plastic lid and the absence of non-fingerprint coating.</p>
<p>Now, these aren’t huge differences, but if we’re aiming for perfection this trashcan leaves much to be desired. For example, more than half of the food and drink left marks after cleaning with a water and sponge. They are not eyesores by any means, but if you’re a perfectionist we’d suggest choosing one of the cans with a fingerprint-resistant coating.</p>
<p>Not to worry, though, there are still custom fit trash bags, a place to rest the liner when changing bags and some indentations underneath the trash can liner to make lifting it up effortless. It also has a large mouth for throwing away bigger pieces of garbage and super simple(human) stay-open lid technology.</p>
<h3>iTouchless &#8211; DZT13/IT13CB</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EJVYTS/?tag=ybdtrsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iTouchless &#8211; DZT13/IT13CB</a> is one of the smallest trash cans we tested, which is impressive because it holds 13 gallons (so it has less “wasted space”). As we said earlier, it was a heated race to the top between this motion-sensor trash can and the Ninestars because they both performed well.</p>
<p><strong>However, the “stainless steel finish” wasn’t so stainless.</strong> Several streaks were left from the food and drink we put on the body of the trash can. On a positive note though, the fingerprint-proof technology works just fine and it claims to be antimicrobial as well.</p>
<p>This was only one of two trash cans that came with some form of deodorizer. The iTouchless uses an activated carbon odor filter to naturally get rid of odors and it works for up to three months. It’s more of a lack of smell than a good one, but that’s better than the smell of trash. Like the other motion-sensor trash cans, it requires four &#8220;D&#8221; batteries to operate, though you can buy an AC adapter if you want as well.<br />
Though it is nothing to scoff at, the infrared technology is not quite as good as that of the Ninestars; it only registers from about six inches away, instead of 10. Nonetheless, the technology works and it has buttons to keep the lid open indefinitely as well. Another little issue is the size of the mouth, which is only 76 square inches, making it quite difficult to put larger items inside. All in all, it does the job, but if you throw away bigger items regularly we’d point you in a different direction.</p>
<h3>Hefty &#8211; PRO-0189</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00STUAQCK/?tag=ybdtrsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hefty &#8211; PRO-0189</a> is the only one-touch opening trash can we tested. This is a feature we were ambivalent about to start but, in the end, the lid stays open until you close it, making it effortless to throw away multiple things. It is fully plastic and all black. And, like its plastic competitors, it is painless to clean. You can even hose the whole thing down outside if need be.</p>
<p>It doesn’t get much more straightforward than the Hefty Touch-Lid. Just press down and the lid opens up. It is a standard trash can that works well for around $20. And at the end of the day, if you want an affordable option you can’t go wrong with this purchase. The lid stays on well and has a locking mechanism in the front, but it is still easy to take off when you need to replace the trash bag.</p>
<h3>BestOffice &#8211; TC-50R</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018LNFQWE/?tag=ybdtrsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BestOffice &#8211; TC-50R</a> looks like a shorter version of the Ninestars model, but with subtle button variations on the lid. Because of the lower center of gravity, it has better balance and is harder to knock over. It has the widest mouth out of all the motion-sensor trash cans we tested at 89 square inches.</p>
<p>Similar to the iTouchless &#8211; DZT13/IT13CB, the stainless steel of the BestOffice is not exactly stainless. The food and drink we tested with left pretty noticeable streaks on the can&#8217;s body from the food and drink — the worst out of any trash can, in fact. So if you&#8217;re focused on aesthetic, this may not be the best trash can. But other than that, the bag switching and bag holding performance was optimal.</p>
<h3>United Solutions &#8211; WB0236</h3>
<p>Another kind that we tested is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OF7IVX2/?tag=ybdtrsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">United Solutions &#8211; WB0236</a> swinging lid trash can. This is the old school trash can that we all love to play with for whatever reason. And, though there is nothing complicated about throwing something away in this type of trash can, it can get dirty more easily as the garbage has to touch the lid on its way in, or you have to use your hand to push it down.</p>
<p>On top of that, the United Solutions swinging lid has the smallest opening by far, only allowing 47 square inches of space for trash. If you are not too worried about bigger trash then it’s no big deal, but for most uses this is impractical. This is only a 10.25-gallon trash can, so it is better suited for a smaller household or even as a spare trash can. And even though it may get the dirtiest, it is still incredibly easy to clean as the food stuff will come right off (and it can always be hosed down, too).</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>There are several features that constitute a good trash can, like the bag holding technology, easy trash bag switching and a nice clean aesthetic that doesn’t take much to maintain. The simplehuman &#8211; CW2024 has all of those traits and provides you with a compartment in the back to hold easy-to-grab bags. It is the easiest to change bags with this trash can and it has a great stay-open lid with a liner that helps hold the bag in place and hides it from plain view.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We took down over 1000 soda cans to determine our selection of the best can crusher: the Easy Pull Auto Dispenser. The Easy Pull is quick, inexpensive, risk-free and easy to use.  ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter spending over 40 hours and crushing over 1,000 soda cans we determined that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000I2PONS/?tag=ybdcrush-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Easy Pull</a>&#8216;s auto-dispensing can crusher is the best can crusher. The Easy Pull proved to be quick, simple to use and very affordable. Additionally, its design for crushing cans virtually eliminates the risk of cutting your fingers on a ragged edge. Although it doesn’t crush cans as quickly as our top pick, our runner-up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000BYDL0/?tag=ybdcrush-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Basic Industries International &#8211; Multi Crush</a> offers the ability to load up six cans at a time.</p>

<h2 id="why-trust">Why trust us?</h2>
<p>While conducting our research on can crushers, we found that there was a notable lack of high-quality articles and reviews on this particular product category. Of the few sources we could find, the majority lacked detail, and many were written by people who hadn’t actually tested the can crushers themselves.</p>
<p>In addition to reading through many of the articles, reviews, forum threads and subreddits we could find on the subject, we conducted testing on six can crushers that we determined were the best on the market.</p>
<p>Before we could begin testing, we needed to source around 1,000 uncrushed cans. To find all of those cans, we used a couple different methods: The first was to buy lots of soda for our office, which we drank over the course of about a month.</p>
<p>The other method was to go to recycling centers and ask people if they would be willing to sell their uncrushed soda cans to us. While we did get more than a few sideways glances, ultimately we were able to get the cans we needed.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-found">How we selected finalists to test</h2>

<p>In order to narrow down our list of can crushers to test, we first searched for expert articles written on the subject. Unfortunately, there wasn’t much of this content to be found, so we turned to recycling forums and subreddits, such as r/recycling and r/frugal, to find out which products seemed to be the most popular.</p>
<p>When researching can crushers, we were able to determine that there are several key characteristics that most people want in a can crusher. These characteristics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ease of use</li>
<li>Reliability</li>
<li>Crushing the can as small as possible</li>
<li>Overall ergonomics</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we had our list narrowed down to the following six, we put each of them through a series of tests designed to measure each against one another and determine a winner.</p>
<h2 id="the-best">Compare the best can crushers</h2>
[table id=20 /]
<h2 id="who-should-buy">Who should buy a can crusher?</h2>
<p>Anyone who buys aluminum cans of soda, beer or other beverages can benefit from a can crusher. This is particularly the case for anyone who wants to recycle those aluminum cans instead of throwing them away, which, given the immense recyclability of aluminum cans, should be just about everyone.</p>
<p>Can crushers significantly reduce the amount of space an aluminum can takes up in your recycling bin. Based on our testing, can crushers can reduce the amount of space aluminum cans take up by 45 percent to 75 percent.</p>
<p>Put another way, can crushers can reduce a can from about 23.3 cubic inches to an average of either 10.398 cubic inches (for the Easy Pull) or an average of 5.66 cubic inches (for the Basic Industries Multi Crush). This means you can store more than double the number of cans in the same amount of space.</p>
<p>Buying a can crusher is great for those who care about the environment as well, particularly since you’ll need to take fewer trips to the recycling center — saving you time <i>and </i>fuel.</p>
<p>Even if you’re just putting the crushed cans into a curbside recycling bin, recycling trucks will have space for more cans (and other recyclables), making them more efficient and compounding the environmental benefits of recycling.</p>
<p>However, you don’t have to be an environmentalist to benefit from a can crusher. The simple fact that aluminum cans will take up less space is reason enough to consider a can crusher for your home or office.</p>
<h2 id="why-recycle">Why recycling cans is important</h2>
<p>There’s a good reason why so much emphasis is put onto the recycling of aluminum cans — namely, the lifespan of recycled aluminum is essentially “endless”. In other words, there is no limit to the number of times an aluminum can is able to be recycled, and the energy and capital equipment required to recycle is significantly lower than it is for the production of new aluminum.</p>
<p>In fact, according to the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=16211#tabs_SpotPriceSlider-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Energy Information Administration</a>, recycled aluminum requires about 90 percent less energy and capital equipment than newly-process aluminum. This efficiency explains why about 75 percent of the 800 million metric tons of aluminum produced since the late 19th century are still in use today.</p>
<p>Today, around 35 percent of global demand for aluminum is supplied from recycled material. However, by increasing the number of people who make a point of recycling their aluminum cans, this number can grow much higher in the foreseeable future.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-look-for">Features to consider</h2>
<p>If you’re interested in buying a can crusher, there are a few characteristics that you should prioritize:</p>
<p>First off, you’ll want to make sure that the can crusher is made from materials that will last for many years, and that the crusher has a build quality that will ensure its reliability for the duration of its lifespan.</p>
<p>It’s also important that the can crusher is easy to use. This means that operation is straightforward, and also that the mechanics of the crusher are designed to make it easy for everyone — including children and the elderly — to use the device. Remember, if the can crusher is hard to use, it probably won’t be used at all.</p>
<p>Another important, but often overlooked, consideration is <i>how much</i> the can crusher actually reduces the volume of the can itself. Ultimately, the purpose of a can crusher is to compact cans so that more can be stored in less space. This particular metric can be hard to measure, which is why we calculated the volume of cans after being crushed during our testing.</p>
<h3 id="difference">Is there really a difference between can crushers?</h3>
<p>Believe it or not, there is actually a lot that goes into making an effective can crusher, and the best products on the market are notable improvements on their competition. Even amongst our six finalists, our best picks were significantly easier to use, and able to crush considerably more cans per minute.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>

<p>After receiving our can crushers, the first step in assessing them was to inspect their build quality. Specifically, we were interested to see how durable the materials were, and how smooth the “crushing” action was when there was nothing in the crusher itself. We also looked at the hand grip on each can crusher — particularly its usefulness in extended can crushing sessions.</p>
<p>Next, we mounted each of the can crushers to a plank of wood to see if any were particularly easy or difficult to set up. Fortunately, all six finalists were simple and straightforward, which means that we were able to judge each of the finalists based on metrics outside of the initial setup.</p>
<p>Once we had the can crushers ready to use, we compared them using a few metrics, which included:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><b>Dimension of crushed cans:</b></b> The length, width, and height each can takes up after being crushed.</li>
<li><b>Volume of crushed cans: </b>The number of cubic inches each can takes up after being crushed.</li>
<li><b>Average number of cans crushed per minute: </b>After 10 one-minute trials, the average number of cans that were crushed each minute.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also made note of the largest can that would comfortably fit inside each can crusher and whether the cans were manually or automatically removed after being crushed.</p>

<p>When we first analyzed our finalists, we did not expect the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000I2PONS/?tag=ybdcrush-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dial Industries &#8211; Easy Pull</a> can crusher to top the list. At first glance, we weren’t particularly impressed with the appearance of the product itself — more specifically, the plastic didn’t strike us as particularly sturdy. However, after mounting and testing the Easy Pull can crusher, we were blown away by its ergonomic and innovative design.</p>
<p>The Easy Pull makes it incredibly easy to crush cans. The handle operation is smooth, and the automatic removal of the crushed cans into a container (or the optional collection bin available with the Easy Pull) places this can crusher far ahead of the other finalists when comparing average cans crushed per minute.</p>
<p>More specifically, we averaged 19 cans per minute with the Easy Pull — an impressive 58-percent faster than second place, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000BYDL0/?tag=ybdcrush-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Basic Industries International Multi Crush</a> (with 12 cans per minute).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-410" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/average-cans-per-minute.png" alt="average cans per minute" width="880" height="579" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/average-cans-per-minute.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/average-cans-per-minute-610x401.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/average-cans-per-minute-180x118@2x.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/average-cans-per-minute-375x247.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/average-cans-per-minute-414x272.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/average-cans-per-minute-295x194.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/average-cans-per-minute-180x118.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/average-cans-per-minute-320x211.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/average-cans-per-minute-295x194@2x.png 590w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>In actual use, the design of the Easy Pull can crusher stood out as well. The automatic disposal of the crushed can into the bin below made operation significantly easier and faster. More importantly, since we didn&#8217;t need to touch the crushed can, the risk for cutting a finger on one of the can&#8217;s jagged edges was virtually eliminated.</p>
<p>Along with the automatic dispensing of each crushed can, the Easy Pull has a rotating grip. This is particularly useful for quickly crushing cans without straining the palm of your hand and was a significant contribution to the 19-can average.</p>

<p>Overall, the Easy Pull Auto Dispensing can crusher provides excellent value at a sub-$30 price point (however you do need to add between $10 to $20 if you want the fitted collection bin as well). It&#8217;s fast, surprisingly sturdy and shouldn’t rust even if left in the garage or backyard.</p>
<h3>Things we didn’t like about the Easy Pull</h3>
<p>While there’s plenty to like about the Easy Pull can crusher, there were a couple of minor yet undesirable details we noticed during testing.</p>
<p>The first (and most important for some) is the fact that the Easy Pull can <i>only</i> crush cans in the 12-ounce size or smaller. Fortunately, the vast majority of cans are the standard 12-ounce size, but if you’re looking for a can crusher that handles cans up to 32 ounces, you’ll want to look at the MasterCrush can crusher instead.</p>
<p>The other metric we weren’t thrilled about was the size of the crushed cans. During testing, we averaged a crushed size of 2.75 by 2.75 by 1.375 inches, or 10.398 cubic inches. While this is certainly sufficient, it is notably larger than the 5.66 cubic inches of our #2 best pick, the Basic Industries International &#8211; Multi Crush.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the overall value offered by the Easy Pull places it firmly at the top of our finalists.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Dial Industries &#8211; Easy Pull can crusher is our top pick largely thanks to its ergonomic and innovative design.</li>
<li>Crushed cans automatically fall into the bin below, reducing the risk of dangerous cuts.</li>
<li>The Easy Pull is limited to 12 oz aluminum cans.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-multi-can-crusher">Best for multi-can: Basic Industries &#8211; Multi Crush</h2>
<p>The other can crusher that stood out to us was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000BYDL0/?tag=ybdcrush-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Basic Industries &#8211; Multi Crush</a>. Unlike most other wall-mounted can crushers, the handle of the Multi Crush leverages a large 180° arc to make cans particularly easy to crush.</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/multi-crush.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The design is functional as well. Since the Multi Crush can hold as many as six pre-crushed cans at a time, the large arc of the handle make crushing six cans in succession easy for anyone — including children and the elderly.</p>
<p>This design contributed to the rate of cans we could crush per minute, which averaged 12 cans during our testing. Interestingly, we tested the Multi Crush starting from a “fully loaded” position (with six cans loaded before starting the timer) and a “one at a time” process yielded the same rate of crushed cans per minute.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000BYDL0/?tag=ybdcrush-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/basic-industries.png" data-srcset="" width="130" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Runner-up: Multi Crush</h3><p>Easy to use, it can crush cans smaller than any of other finalists and its large storage area holds six pre-crushed cans.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000BYDL0/?tag=ybdcrush-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>While this is slower than the 19 per minute of our top pick, the Easy Pull can crusher, it is still faster than every other can crusher we tested, and suggests that a Multi Crush with six cans loaded into it can be fully crushed in about half a minute.</p>
<p>The Multi Crush really stood out to us with its ability to crush cans smaller than any of other finalists we tested. In our measurements, we calculated the average size of a 12-ounce crushed can to be 2.875 by 2.25 by 0.875 inches, for a volume of 5.66 cubic inches — almost <i>half</i> of the Easy Pull and slightly smaller than our Honorable Mention, the MasterCrush.</p>

<p>One element that surprised us on this otherwise-impressive can crusher was the lack of grip on the handle. When we first set up the Multi Crush, we were concerned that the lack of a grip would cause problems from an ergonomic perspective.</p>
<p>However, when we were actually using the can crusher, we found that the handle worked perfectly fine, and didn’t prevent us from crushing 12 cans per minute into the smallest volume of all the finalists that we tested.</p>
<h3>What we didn’t like about the Multi Crush</h3>
<p>While there is plenty to like about the Multi Crush, there were a few problems with it as well.</p>
<p>The first problem we noticed was that the paint chipped off fairly easily. Just during our testing period alone, we noticed that several areas were already losing some of the white paint, particularly in the areas that moved while we were crushing cans.</p>
<p>While chipping paint is primarily a problem of aesthetics, there is reason for concern for those who have pets or young children who might accidentally eat paint from the floor. Keep this in mind before choosing this particular can crusher.</p>
<p>Another potential downside is the fact that the Multi Crush is only designed to work with the standard 12-ounce cans. While we were able to squeeze a 16-ounce can into the Multi Crush, it <i>is not</i> designed for that purpose.</p>
<p>One minor problem we had during testing was that cans would occasionally slip out of the sides. This was only really a problem when the can crusher was empty, and even then it only happened a couple of times.</p>
<p>Overall, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000BYDL0/?tag=ybdcrush-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Basic Industries &#8211; Multi Crush</a> is a worthwhile investment if you’re looking to crush lots of cans into as small a size as possible. It is easy to use, the six-can storage capability is convenient, and you can quickly crush lots of 12-ounce aluminum cans.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Basic Industries &#8211; Multi Crush is easy to use and functional — holding up to 6 cans at a time.</li>
<li>The Multi Crush was able to crush cans smaller than all others we tested — averaging just 5.66 cubic inches.</li>
<li>The Multi Crush is limited to 12-ounce aluminum cans.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-32oz-can-crusher">Best for 32-ounce cans: MasterCrush &#8211; Can Crusher</h2>
<p>If you are looking to crush 32-ounce aluminum cans, this is the can crusher for you. This is one of the most popular can crushers on the Internet, which is evident if you happen to check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FO75OPU/?tag=ybdcrush-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon reviews</a> or recycling forum threads where can crushers are discussed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FO75OPU/?tag=ybdcrush-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The MasterCrush</a> is a well-built piece of equipment, in large part due to its powder-coated steel framework. Based on our testing, the MasterCrush shows essentially zero wear and tear, and we expect that it should easily last for years under typical conditions in a residential — and perhaps even commercial — setting.</p>
<p>The MasterCrush is also the only can crusher we tested which can crush aluminum cans up to 32 ounces. While many potential buyers of a can crusher won’t actually need to crush cans of this size, for those who do expect to have 32-ounce cans, we think the MasterCrush is the best option on the market.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FO75OPU/?tag=ybdcrush-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mastercrush-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mastercrush-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mastercrush-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mastercrush-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mastercrush-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mastercrush-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mastercrush-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mastercrush-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mastercrush.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best for 32-Ounce Cans: MasterCrush</h3><p>Priced a bit higher than our other top picks, the MasterCrush compresses cans up to 32 ounces. It's built tough for long-term durability.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FO75OPU/?tag=ybdcrush-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The MasterCrush also lived up to its name, crushing 12-ounce cans to an average of 2.75 by 2.75 by 0.75 inches, for a total volume of 5.67 cubic inches — just slightly larger than the Basic Industries Multi Crush (5.66 square inches).</p>
<p>Despite the positive attributes just described, we were somewhat disappointed with the operation of the MasterCrush. While mounting the can crusher was simple enough, we found that actually operating the MasterCrush wasn’t as smooth or ergonomic as we had hoped. One metric that illustrated this was that we were only able to average eight crushed cans per minute.</p>
<p>The other consideration is price — the MasterCrush is about $20 more than both of our top picks, with a price hovering around the $50 level.</p>
<p>That said, despite the flaws in the MasterCrush, if you are looking for a can crusher that can reliably crush cans as big as 32 ounces, the MasterCrush is a worthwhile investment.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The MasterCrush is the only can crusher we tested that can handle 32-ounce aluminum cans.</li>
<li>The powder-coated steel framework will help this can crusher last for years of regular use.</li>
<li>The ergonomics of this can crusher, while sufficient, were not nearly as strong as our top two picks, the Easy Pull and the Multi Crush.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pacific Precision Metals &#8211; The Crusher</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000Q6ST3S/?tag=ybdcrush-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Crusher by Pacific Precision Metals</a> is a sturdy can crusher with a comfortable rubber grip. During our testing, this can crusher was able to crush cans to an average of 8.859 cubic inches at a rate of 10 cans per minute.</p>
<p>The most distinguishing feature of The Crusher is the fact that it is the only can crusher we tested, other than the MasterCrush, that is rated to crush 16-ounce cans. If you are looking for a can crusher that can handle 16-ounce cans, and want something sturdier and less expensive than the Multi Crush, The Crusher is worth consideration.</p>
<h3>Kitchen Craft Can Crusher and Can Pactor</h3>
<p>We tested both the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000YJF3XQ/?tag=ybdcrush-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kitchen Craft Can Crusher</a> and the <a href="https://www.commercialzone.com/Product-Series/green-zone/Canpactor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Can Pactor</a>, because we found several sources during our research that spoke highly of them. However, during our testing we found both underwhelming and difficult to use. Unless you have a specific reason for buying one, we strongly recommend steering clear and sticking with one of our other finalists.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>

<p>For most people, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000I2PONS/?tag=ybdcrush-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Easy Pull Auto Dispensing</a> can crusher is the best option on the market. It is easy to use, affordable, durable and prevents hazardous cuts from crushed cans by automatically dispensing the can into a bin below.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000BYDL0/?tag=ybdcrush-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Multi Crush</a> offers many of these same benefits with an even better ratio of crushed to uncrushed size. However, this does come at the cost of somewhat lower build quality.</p>
<p>For those who need to crush larger cans (up to 32 ounces), the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FO75OPU/?tag=ybdcrush-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MasterCrush</a> is a worthwhile option; however, you pay for the larger capacity in build quality and ease of use.</p>
<p>Remember, essentially <i>all</i> of the aluminum used in aluminum cans is fully recyclable. Any products that make it easier for existing aluminum to be recycled will help reduce our dependence on producing newly processed aluminum, which is both costly and (in many cases) unnecessary.</p>
<p>Ultimately, any of these can crushers will make it easier to recycle your aluminum cans, and make it easier for you to save money and help conserve Earth’s natural resources.</p>
