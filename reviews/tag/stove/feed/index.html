<p><em>(Editor’s note: In 2019 we learned that our top pick, the NuWave &#8211; PIC2, had been discontinued. In fact, NuWave has discontinued all induction cooktops, except for one model, which is only available on NuWave’s website. Also, Fagor America was shut down by its parent company in Spain, and so all Fagor products, including the induction cooktop we reviewed, have been discontinued. In October 2019, we tested three new induction cooktops to see how they compared with those we previously reviewed.)</em></p>
<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We began our research by reading Amazon-consumer and chef reviews to learn what both professionals and non-professionals are looking for in an induction cooktop. The most popular cooktops were under $200, and so we focused on those that were below this price point.</p>
<p>After narrowing our selection a bit, we dove into the science of  induction heating to help us determine the best single-burner induction cooktop. Finally, we headed to the kitchen and put these cooktops to work.</p>
<p>We tested their speed, cool-down times, temperature precision and, most importantly, how each one cooked.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-induction">What is induction cooking technology?</h2>
<p>In the 1860s, Scottish physicist James Maxwell articulated four mathematical formulas called Maxwell’s Equations, one of which applies to induction cooking: Where there is a changing flow of electricity, there is also a magnetic field.</p>
<p>Induction cooking uses this scientific formula to create a high-frequency magnetic field between the cooktop and the pot or pan placed upon the surface. The iron in the pan activates and completes the circulating electric current, which then generates heat.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that, although the induction cooktop will not heat until the proper pan is placed on top, the induction cooktop will then get searingly hot, and it should be handled with the same safety measures as you would with a gas or electric stovetop.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-cooktops">Induction cooktops vs. electric vs. gas</h2>
<p>When comparing the various cooktops, gas is often preferred by professional cooks because it gives more control over heating. Electric coil is the slowest and takes time to increase or lower heat. Induction provides an instant reaction when the electromagnetic connection is made between the cooktop and pot, which can be adjusted in seconds.</p>
<p>Energy efficiency is dependent upon a number of factors. It is estimated by the Department of Energy that 60% of a gas flame’s energy is wasted unless the kitchen is well ventilated, as the heat will raise the temperature of the air in the kitchen. A newer study by the DOE also finds that an electric-coil cooktop could be more energy efficient than induction if the pot that is used covers the entire diameter of the coil.</p>
<p>However, if you use the proper type of cookware, then induction is the most direct and thus efficient way to transfer heat from the cooktop to the pot.</p>
<h2 id="induction-compatible">What is induction-compatible cookware?</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/magnet-test-animation.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Induction friendly cookware is cookware with iron or a high level of stainless steel. You can easily test this by seeing if a magnet will attach to the bottom of the pot or pan. Our top two picks on our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-nonstick-cookware/">review of nonstick cookware sets</a> also happen to be induction-compatible.</p>
<p>Iron and stainless steel are ferromagnetic, which means they have an unbalanced set of electrons and can be influenced by magnetic fields (the induction cooktop).</p>
<p>The magnetic field of the cooktop penetrates the iron in the pan and a circulating electric current is established between the cooktop and pan, which activates the pan to heat. Cast iron is perhaps the easiest to identify as a sure winner when it comes to compatibility.</p>
<p>Stainless steel on its own has iron present, but it is manufactured with a wide range of other ingredients in varying amounts, including nickel, aluminum, chromium and carbon, which are not conducive to induction cooktops. You need to confirm with the manufacturer as to whether the stainless steel cookware (like All Clad, for example) is, in fact, induction-friendly.</p>

<p><strong>Volts/Watts:</strong> The most common analogy that describes the functional difference between volts and watts in electricity is to think of water flowing through a pipe. In this scenario the water pressure is the voltage and the watts are the power the water could provide. The voltage for some induction cooktops are more than a typical household socket can handle, but all of the ones we tested are 120 volts.</p>
<p><strong>Temperature mode (range and increments):</strong> The broader the temperature range, the more capacity for keeping food warm on the low end and achieving a restaurant-quality sear on the high end. During our testing, we learned that options for temperature increments were the most important for cooking accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Power mode:</strong> The power mode often includes choices for “simmer,” “boil” or heat levels.</p>
<p><strong>Safety features:</strong> Look for options for pause/cancel and child lock. Many induction cooktops also have auto shut-off if the internal temperature of the cooktop itself overheats. In our previous testing, the induction cooktops took 31 to 60 minutes to cool down. However, for this 2019 update, the three new cooktops we tested all cooled down in under 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Our first test was a simple one: How long did it take for each cooktop to boil water?</p>
<p>The testing for this article was originally conducted in high altitude (7,000 feet), which affected the boiling point, decreasing it from 210 °F to 199 °F. For this 2019 update, we conducted the tests at sea level.</p>
<p>We used the same induction-friendly pot for all tests. We heated 1 quart of room-temperature water at the highest level and timed how long it took to come to boil. We started a second timer and kept the water boiling 5 minutes before turning the cooktop off. We then timed how long it took for the cooktop to cool completely.</p>
<p>When put to the test, the Secura &#8211; 9100MC came to a rapid boil the fastest at 4 minutes, 7 seconds. All of the cooktops were within a minute of each other except for the Fagor (now discontinued), which took 7 minutes, 2 seconds to come to boil. In our 2019 testing, the Duxtop &#8211; 9600LS beat all previous finalists by more than 30 seconds.</p>
<h3>Temperature control</h3>

<p>We tested how accurate each cooktop was by melting 2 tablespoons of butter at the lowest setting. The discontinued NuWave &#8211; PIC2 and the Max Burton performed the best, because their lowest setting is at 100°F, which gently melted the butter and prevented it from browning too fast and burning.  The NuWave, Max Burton and Fagor could be adjusted in 10-degree increments, which gave us the most control.</p>
<p>In 2019 we had similar results. The Duxtop &#8211; 9600LS also has a low setting of 100 °F, and although it has 20-degree increments, we had sufficient control to keep the butter from burning. The IsiLER and Rosewill, however, had the same low settings (140°F) and increment control (40-degrees) as the previous models we tested, and the butter melted too quickly and burned.</p>
<h3>Heating evenness</h3>
<p>We tested how well heat was distributed by  cooking pancakes in a cast iron skillet. After the first batch, we adjusted temperature and power settings, and overall, each cooktop turned out golden-brown pancakes. The NuWave&#8217;s precise programming gave us more control, and its pancakes were the best. In our October 2019 testing, however, only the Duxtop cooked the pancakes evenly. Even at their lowest setting, the IsiLER and Rosewill burned the pancakes.</p>
<h2 id="best-cooktop">Best overall: Duxtop &#8211; 9600LS</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FLR0ET8/?tag=ybdpic-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Duxtop &#8211; 9600LS</a> is the company’s most recently released induction cooktop. Duxtop was bought by Secura, and consequently, some Duxtop products are also branded as Secura. Adding to the confusion, Secura has its own separate line of induction cooktops, which are almost identical to Duxtop cooktops.</p>
<p>The 9600LS is a powerful 1800-watt cooktop that can be programmed for 100 ℉ &#8211; 460 ℉. Like other induction cooktops we tested, wattage can also be programmed, but during our testing, we found it easier to just use temperature.</p>
<p>The 9600LS’s menu gives you options to increase or decrease power and temperature in small increments, which gave us control when melting butter. The other induction cooktops that we tested for this 2019 update were too hot, even at their lowest setting, which caused the butter to burn. But since the 9600LS’s lowest temperature is set at 100 ℉, the butter slowly melted, and when we increased the temperature by 20 degrees, the butter kept warm without burning.</p>
<p>The ability to precisely control temperature was a big bonus in our pancake test. When the pan got too hot, we could immediately decrease the temperature incrementally so the pancakes wouldn’t burn. Temperature could not be as easily adjusted with the other two new cooktops we tested, and it seemed impossible to not cook pancakes that weren’t burned.</p>

<p>As with all induction cooktops, you’ll need the right cookware, and if you’re not using an induction-friendly pot or pan, the 9600LS will flash a warning on its bright LED panel and lock the programming menu. One of the 9600LS’s programs is for boiling water, and it brought a pot of water to a roiling boil in 3.5 minutes, which was 30 seconds faster than all of the other cooktops we previously tested.</p>
<p>Another improvement in the newer models that was particularly striking is that whereas all of the older models took 31 to 60 minutes to be cool enough to touch when they were turned off, all of the newer models we tested cooled down in under 10 minutes. The 9600LS was cool (and safe) to touch after only 8 minutes.</p>
<p>The Duxtop 9600LS is substantially more expensive, but it did outperform the other cooktops, simply by giving us more control in temperature and power. For now &#8212; until Secura upgrades Duxtop again &#8212; the Duxtop 9600LS is one of the best top-of-the-line cooktops.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Duxtop 9600LS is a powerful 1800-watt induction cooktop with precise temperature and wattage controls.</li>
<li>The 9600LS heats up faster and cools down faster than older models.</li>
<li>The Duxtop’s default temperature is a low 100 ℉, adjusted in 20-degree increments, which helps prevent burning of food.</li>

<p>We were impressed with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GMCAM2G/?tag=ybdpic-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secura &#8211; 9100MC</a>’s functionality and power modes. It has a good temperature range (140-460°F), boiling water faster any of the cooktops and cooling down in 39 minutes. The display-panel design is simple and straightforward with 10 power levels and a 120-minute maximum cooking timer.</p>

<p>The Secura &#8211; 9100MC melted butter with ease, made perfectly golden pancakes and had a straightforward and intuitive control panel. While this cooktop doesn’t have the extensive programming capabilities or 10-degree temperature increments that the NuWave has, we can’t help but feel that many cooks might not need those extra bells and whistles to have a great cooking experience.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Secura &#8211; 9100MC has a wide temperature range for greater versatility in cooking.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s very user-friendly with a straightforward display panel and 10 power modes for accurate temperature control.</li>

<h3>NuWave &#8211; PIC2 (discontinued)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6586 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nuwave-pic2-solo.jpg" alt="NuWave PIC2 burner" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nuwave-pic2-solo.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nuwave-pic2-solo-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nuwave-pic2-solo-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nuwave-pic2-solo-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nuwave-pic2-solo-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nuwave-pic2-solo-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nuwave-pic2-solo-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nuwave-pic2-solo-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nuwave-pic2-solo-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nuwave-pic2-solo-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><em>(Editor&#8217;s note: The Nuwave &#8211; PIC2 had been our top pick, but we learned in 2019 that it was discontinued and is no longer available.)</em></p>
<p>Of the six induction cooktops we originally tested, the NuWave &#8211; PIC2 cooked away the competition by its sheer capabilities. Even though the dimensions are similar to the other cooktops we tested, it felt more compact and less intrusive on our kitchen counter. With such robust capabilities, we were pleasantly surprised with how intuitive the display was. It didn’t take us more than a minute to figure out what buttons did what and how to get cooking.</p>
<p>With the broadest temperature range of all, 100-575 °F, a maximum programmable cooking timer of 99 hours and sixty minutes, (the next closest was the Fagor and Waring Pro at 180 minutes), a programmable memory, the least amount of watts (the most energy savings), the lightest weight, 10 °F temperature increment controls, six power modes, a sleek design and a reasonable price.</p>
<p>We also appreciated The NuWave&#8217;s safety features.  The extra large vents in the back allow heat to escape more rapidly, keeping the cooktop cooler. Another plus is that the cooktop will automatically shut off if its internal temperature hits 230 °F. The NuWave also gives you the ability to program different heat levels at different times; for example, searing a steak and then simmering a pan sauce.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FDXPTNP/?tag=ybdpic-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">IsiLER</a> 1800-watt induction cooktop doesn’t have the Duxtop’s sleek curves, but it resembles most other new models and has the same functions. It has eight power levels, ranging from 100 watts to 1800 watts that can be selected in 200-watt increments. If you’re new to using an induction cooktop, then you’ll want to know what wattage level should be used for searing or slow cooking, but IsiLER provides no instructions other than the bare minimum. (There’s nothing on their website either.)</p>
<p>As with the Duxtop, we found it much easier to use the temperature function instead. The IsiLER doesn’t have as precise controls, however, only allowing you to increase or decrease temperature in 40-degree increments. Its lowest temperature setting is 140 ℉, but it was on the hotter side, since butter melted and began to burn in seconds. The IsiLER was also too hot &#8212; again, even at its lowest setting &#8212; for pancakes, which burned around the edges before they were ready to be flipped.</p>
<p>IsiLER is new to the induction-cooktop business, and they’re aggressively marketing their product with deep discounts. It’s certainly tempting to pick up an induction cooktop at half the price of the Duxtop, but the IsiLER just isn’t on the same level.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UNOSLYU/?tag=ybdpic-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rosewill &#8211; RHAI-15001</a> appears on a lot of “best of” lists and is highly rated by consumers on Amazon. It has a few features other induction cooktops don’t have. First, you don’t need to toggle back and forth between temperature and wattage when programming. A panel above the LED-display menu indicates temperature per wattage at the same time; for example, 300 ℉ equals 1000 watts.</p>
<p>The Rosewill also has helpful pictograms for its five programs: warm milk, soup, stir fry, fry and hot-pot. Soup and stir fry are both set at 400 ℉, while the other three settings have variable temperatures. The warm milk (represented by a baby-bottle pictogram) function is set at the Rosewill’s lowest temperature, 150 ℉. This default setting, which cannot be adjusted, burned butter in seconds and would likely scald milk. Overall, like the IsiLER, the Rosewill is calibrated too hot.</p>
<p>A stainless-steel pot with a tempered glass lid is included. The pot was designed specifically for the dimensions of the Rosewill. However, not only did it heat unevenly &#8212; pancakes either burned or were raw in the middle &#8212; but the bottom of the pot burned in spots, indicating a low-grade stainless steel.</p>
<h3>Fagor &#8211; 670041900 (discontinued)</h3>
<p>The Fagor &#8211; 670041900 is a sleek black cooktop with a smooth touchpad that feels luxurious. In addition to a fairly wide temperature range of 140-465 °F, the cooktop also has eight quick- launch buttons: warm, simmer, boil, rapid boil, saute, brown, sear and stir-fry.</p>
<p>When we put the Fagor to the boil test, we used the “Rapid Boil” quick-launch button, and the results were less than rapid compared to the other cooktops we tested. It took the Fagor 7 minutes, 2 seconds to boil, but the Fagor was the clear winner of the cool-down test, cooling in 31 minutes.</p>
<h3>Duxtop &#8211; 8300ST</h3>
<p>The Duxtop &#8211; 8300ST, recently updated to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075DX4VH9/?tag=ybdpic-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Duxtop &#8211; 8310ST</a>, also has a sleek design and is simple to use, with ten temperature settings ranging from 140-460 °F and 10 power modes. Its  temperature increments are between 30 and 40 degrees, so if you’re looking for accuracy this isn&#8217;t the cooktop for you.</p>
<h3>Max Burton &#8211; 6400</h3>
<p>The Max Burton &#8211; 6400 was updated to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GHWHBCF/?tag=ybdpic-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">6450</a>, and although its physical appearance has changed, its controls are the same. While we liked the bright blue backlighting on the display of the Max Burton &#8211; 6400, this was the only unit we tested that we needed to consult the instruction manual.  It has a temperature range of 100-450 °F, with 10-degree increments, but it lacks power-mode buttons, having only &#8220;simmer&#8221; and &#8220;boil.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Waring &#8211; ICT200</h3>
<p>Although its display was clear and user-friendly, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007MPJ92Q/?tag=ybdpic-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Waring &#8211; ICT200</a>&#8216;s physical design feels a bit cheap compared to the sleek touch pads on the other cooktops we tested. The Waring doesn’t have a temperature mode, so it was trial and error during testing to make sure nothing would burn. It&#8217;s very affordable, but it really is just a basic cooktop with minimal controls.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>In October 2019, we tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FLR0ET8/?tag=ybdpic-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Duxtop &#8211; 9600LS</a>, and it proved to be superior to our previous top pick. Secura &#8212; the company that manufactures Duxtop products &#8212; has given this new model more precise temperature and power controls that gives you superb accuracy in cooking.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GMCAM2G/?tag=ybdpic-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secura &#8211; 9100MC</a> still remains our runner-up with its low-wattage energy savings, robust temperature range and programming ability. Compared with the new induction cooktops we tested for this update, it still remains one of the best.</p>

<p>Before diving into this project, we check out some reputable food and home publications. Articles and reviews from <em>Bon Appetit</em>, <em>Good Housekeeping</em>, and <em>Cooks Illustrated</em> provided a great foundation. Posts from the Environmental Working Group and forums on WebMD also helped us begin to understand some of the concerns regarding particular nonstick surfaces.</p>
<p>Then, we crowdsourced to discover common complaints, experiences and expectations. From the 20-something progressing from cooking a late-night grilled-cheese sandwich to the proudest home chef, everyone has something to say about why they either love or hate their current cookware.</p>
<p>From our research, we found that the following characteristics and standards define what people are looking for in nonstick pans:</p>
<ul>
<li>Release: Do food items easily slide off the cooking surface without the use of oils?</li>
<li>Heating: Does the surface heat evenly, avoiding cool spots and unevenly cooked food?</li>
<li>Durability: Is the cookware likely to hold up to years of use?</li>
<li>Cleaning: Are the pots and pans easily washed and cared for?</li>
<li>Variety: Does the whole set cover all my cooking needs?</li>
<li>Aesthetics: Will the cookware look great in my kitchen?</li>
<li>Versatility: Can the items go in the oven? Can metallic utensils be used on the pans?</li>
<li>Safety: Are the materials used in the nonstick coating safe for my family and the environment?</li>
</ul>

<p>In the late 1930s, while working on a new alternative refrigerant at the DuPont company, Dr. Roy Plunkett stumbled on a combination of molecules that created a very slick, slippery surface. Dupont trademarked the compound Teflon, and for the next 30 years sold it for various military and industrial uses.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until the 1960s that we started to see Teflon and other similar chemicals being used in the construction of cookware. By bonding these chemicals to the cooking surface of pots and pans, they become incredibly resistant to sticky foods, making both cooking and cleaning easier and more enjoyable.</p>
<p>These coatings are almost universally made of fluoropolymers — large molecules in which fluorine atoms insulate carbon atoms. Fluorine is the key to producing a slippery surface because it&#8217;s highly resistant to reacting with other chemicals and it has a low coefficient of friction.</p>
<p>Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a type of fluoropolymer most often used in cookware. Teflon, which is often misused as a generic descriptor of nonstick cookware, is the brand name for that very specific PTFE compound discovered by DuPont. Only one of our six finalists, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ERZEYK0?tag=ybdnons-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gotham Steel</a>, uses a coating that is not PTFE-based.</p>
<p>In the past, the process of manufacturing PTFE required the use of Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA). This practice has been nearly eliminated by major producers because PFOA is now understood to be a toxic pollutant linked to cancer. Other materials that used to be popular in cookware construction, like lead and cadmium, have also been largely phased out.</p>
<h3>Safety concerns</h3>
<p>Having spent several weeks immersed in the subject, we are well aware of the concern of possible health effects of using PTFE-based nonstick surfaces for food preparation. As a product-testing and recommendation company, we don’t want to focus on this aspect of the products, but we do believe that sharing the following information will help consumers.</p>
<p>The main concern with using nonstick cookware is the release of toxic gasses that may result from overheating pots and pans. At temperatures above 500 °F, the molecular compounds that comprise nonstick coating begin to break down. Once these atomic bonds are disrupted, potentially dangerous particles can be released into the air.</p>
<p>Polymer-fume fever is the name given to temporary flu-like symptoms including chills and headaches caused by exposure to airborne PTFEs. While these compounds begin to breakdown at 500 °F, significant and rapid decomposition will occur at 660 °F. According to the Environmental Working Group, Teflon in particular releases at least six toxic gasses — two of which are considered carcinogenic.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand that while there is legitimate cause for precaution, there is also widespread agreement among scientists and doctors that, when used correctly, nonstick cookware is entirely safe.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the primary concern with nonstick cookware is overheating. Because it’s essential to prevent your pots and pans from exceeding 500 °F, you should only cook on low to medium heat. Even at medium heat it&#8217;s important to be mindful of how long the pan is in contact with the burner.</p>
<p>An empty pan will collect heat very quickly so if you must preheat a nonstick pan, use a coating of fat or oil, which will collect the heat instead of the pan itself. Heavier pans will generally take longer to heat up; therefore, choosing heavier cookware will allow you to safely cook a wider variety of foods. You should also turn on exhaust fans to improve ventilation in case dangerous toxins become airborne.</p>
<p>While many nonstick cookware sets are advertised as being oven-safe, you want to be extremely careful putting your cookware in the oven for long periods of time. You should also never use aerosol cooking sprays, as over time, a buildup of residue (from the soy lecithin in the spray) will make the nonstick surface ineffective.</p>
<p>Avoid chipping or otherwise damaging the pan. Even minor damage to the surface can harm the integrity of molecular bonds, causing the release of dangerous compounds. To keep your nonstick cookware scratch-free, avoid using abrasive cleaners like steel wool.</p>
<h3>When to use nonstick cookware</h3>
<p>Nonstick cookware is great for preparing many dishes, but it should not be the only option in your kitchen. Obviously, anything that requires high heat or prolonged exposure to heat should not be cooked using nonstick cookware. Steaks and burgers — really anything requiring a sear — should only be cooked in stainless steel or cast iron. Not only are those surfaces safer, but they also help produce a bit of that crustiness you&#8217;re looking for when cooking most meats.</p>
<p>Sautéed vegetables and sauces are also difficult to execute in nonstick cookware, because the surface is actually too slick. When preparing these dishes you&#8217;re aiming to get a lot of flavor from a thin layer of fat, juices, spices and oils — known as fond — that collects both on the bottom of the pan and on the food. The nature of nonstick cookware prevents the accumulation of this layer and leaves food tasting a bit more bland.</p>
<p>Particularly acidic foods, like tomatoes and lemon juice, can cause discoloration and damage to surfaces that are reactive, like nonstick coatings. These foods may also pick up a metallic taste.</p>
<p>Eggs, pancakes and hot sandwiches are all perfect for nonstick pans. However, if you’re making breakfast for the whole family, continue to lower the heat during your cooking session to maintain a pan temperature below 500 °F. You may be surprised by how quickly a nonstick skillet can reach that temperature.</p>
<p>Fish is another food that cooks well in nonstick cookware. It cooks quickly, and the skin, which often sticks to other cooking surfaces, is easily removed from a nonstick surface.</p>

<p><strong>Pieces:</strong> The sets we tested are all marketed as 10 to 12 pieces, which include a variety of pots, pans, lids, steamer baskets, spatulas and spoons. The sets are unique in their size, geometry, combination of offerings and versatility.</p>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> How much a particular pan weighs determines how fast it preheats, what you cook in it and how quickly it approaches a potentially dangerous 500 °F. While lighter cookware may be easier to use, clean, and store, heavier cookware is likely to last longer and perform better.</p>
<p><strong>Materials:</strong> Beyond a nonstick coating, the cookware we tested utilizes a variety of materials, including aluminum, steel, ceramic and titanium. The different materials impact heating evenness, durability and user experience.</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> While it&#8217;s unlikely you will own one set of cookware for the rest of your life, most pots and pans will be seen and used in your kitchen for years. It&#8217;s important to like the way they look and feel as well as how they’re stored in your kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>Value:</strong> Like all of the products we test, we want to make sure that our readers are getting the value they’re looking for. You should be confident that the price you pay will give you a product and cooking experience you feel is worthy of the product’s cost.</p>

<h3>Release</h3>
<p>We wanted to put our finalists through a series of real-life situations to test how easily different foods could slide off the cooking surface. All tests were conducted without using oil or any additional fat.</p>

<p>We started with eggs. First we fried an egg in the smaller skillet of each set; then we scrambled an egg in the same pan. The fried eggs were extremely easy to remove from each of the six pans. However, we found that when scrambling eggs, those pans with a textured surface often collected food particles in the grooves and dimples. The grooved skillets required a fair amount of effort to clean up.</p>
<p>We also put our finalists through a pancake test. Pancakes can be tricky: Even with lots of butter on the cooking surface, they often stick. We cooked a single pancake in the center of the largest pan in each set to see how easily the pancakes released. We discovered this was a useful measure of consistency as well. Some pans produced a golden-colored pancake that was uniformly cooked throughout while others cooked unevenly, often leaving us with a pancake that was darker in the middle.</p>
<p>Next, we cooked a half cup of oats in the smallest pot included in each set. We discovered that while the bottoms of each pot were all incredibly slippery, oatmeal stuck to the sides of some pots more than others. We also found that the rivets connecting each handle to the side of the pot were not always as flush on the inside wall of the pot. This led to pieces of food getting lodged in the tiny edges, making the pots more difficult to clean.</p>

<p>Finally, we prepared skin-on salmon filets in the largest skillet in each of the top six sets. Here, we noticed some significant distinction in the performance of the nonstick surface.</p>
<h3>Heating</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5259 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cookware-temp-1.jpg" alt="cookware temperature data chart" width="900" height="625" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cookware-temp-1.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cookware-temp-1-610x424.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cookware-temp-1-768x533.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cookware-temp-1-430x300.jpg 430w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cookware-temp-1-300x208.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cookware-temp-1-295x205.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cookware-temp-1-885x615.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cookware-temp-1-360x250.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cookware-temp-1-375x260.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cookware-temp-1-414x288.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cookware-temp-1-320x222.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>In terms of the heated surface of the pan, we measured two main metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>How fast does the pan take to reach 500 °F?</li>
<li>Is the heat evenly distributed over the entire surface?</li>
</ul>
<p>We set our gas stovetop to medium and used a digital infrared thermometer to monitor the rising temperature. After three minutes, we took readings from three different locations on the largest pan in each set (middle, left edge and right edge). We then calculated the difference between the highest and lowest temperature to determine the variance. The lower the variance, the more consistent the heat and the more evenly cooked the food.</p>
<p>We were particularly interested in how long it took each piece to reach the 500 °F mark, at which point the chemical bonds that create the nonstick coating become vulnerable to breaking down and emitting harmful particles.</p>
<p>Because a hot handle can be a surprise that may cause spilling or dropping, we also compared the heat accumulated in the handles. We placed a pan from each set over medium heat for five minutes and then took temperature readings of each handle. Some proved to be uncomfortably hot after just this short period of heat exposure.</p>
<h3>Durability</h3>

<p>You should expect to own a set of nonstick cookware for at least several years. While many of the products advertise much longer limited warranties, the coating — which ensures your food items don’t stick to the cooking surface — will deteriorate with normal use over time.</p>
<p>Our pots and pans were used pretty heavily in our test kitchen — but only for a few weeks. In order to simulate several years of use and to measure how resilient the products are, we scrubbed one piece from each set vigorously for 30 seconds with a textured scouring pad or synthetic steel wool.</p>
<p>After we scrubbed the smaller pan in each set, we then repeated our fried egg test directly over the impacted surface. Where before there was little distinction between all the products, allowing the egg to easily slide from the surface, now clear differences emerged.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that nonstick cookware should not be cleaned with a scouring pad or other abrasive cleaners, and our testing goes against the recommendations of the manufacturers. But we also believe the results indicate how likely each cook set might survive repeated cleanings.</p>
<h3>User Experience</h3>
<p>Finally, we took notes on what it was like to use each product. Some were easier to clean than others, and we think some styles are more impressive in their usability.</p>
<p>Others simply feel better constructed. Silicone and rubber handles feel better in your hand than exposed metal. Some sets include extra cookware or accessories you probably already own while others offer pieces that may be more versatile. Our testing resulted in a well-rounded evaluation of each product.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-overall">Best overall: Circulon &#8211; Symmetry</h2>

<p>Our favorite set of nonstick cookware is the 11-piece Symmetry collection from Circulon, which includes seven pots and pans and four lids. These sharp-looking Circulon pots and pans proved incredibly resistant to the stickiest food while also providing the most consistent temperature across the cooking surface.</p>
<p>The Circulon Symmetry cookware is significantly heavier than most of the other sets we tested. The extra weight leads to pots and pans that heat slowly and evenly. In our test to see how long it took for a skillet to reach the 500 °F mark, where nonstick chemicals start to break down and become a health risk, the Circulon was the only one to last more than 10 minutes.</p>
<p>By absorbing heat slower, the pots and pans are much more versatile. They can be used to cook a larger variety of dishes without the nonstick surface deteriorating.</p>

This Circulon cookware set has a substantial, heavy feel that will last through years of use in the kitchen.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005GYUNQG/?tag=ybdnons-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Symmetry cookware also outperformed all the others we tested in terms of temperature consistency across the surface. Often, food will cook at a different pace because the temperature of the pan varies at different spots of the cooking surface. But the cooking surface of the Circulon line maintains a remarkably even temperature.</p>
<p>After three minutes over medium heat, the difference between the hottest and coolest spots on the Circulon skillet was just 22 °F. No other skillet came close.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to understand that all the cookware we tested provided a reliably stick-free cooking experience. Eggs, pancakes, oatmeal and fish all slid off the cooking surfaces effortlessly. And while the Circulon pan performed better than some others in our salmon filet test, the real distinction came after we scrubbed the pans with a scouring pad to simulate heavy use.</p>
<p>After just 30 seconds of vigorous scrubbing, most pans lost at least some of their nonstick ability, but the Circulon was seemingly unfazed by our attempt to inflict wear and tear on the nonstick surface. Advertised as safe for use with metal utensils, we don’t foresee any scratching issues from lots of use.</p>
<p>The heavier construction of these pots and pans simply make them feel high quality. The rubber-coated handles are comfortable and stay cool when exposed to heat. The pans are safe to put in both the dishwasher and the oven (up to 400 °F), increasing the versatility and convenience of the set.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Symmetry collection from Circulon offers slow, even heating ensures consistent cooking temperature and safety from the release of harmful toxins.</li>
<li>The nonstick surface performs exceptionally well with a variety of foods, even after significant wear and tear.</li>
<li>The pots and pans feel good, look great, and are easy to wash.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-runner-up">Runner-up: Analon &#8211; Advanced</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5211 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/anolon-stackability-1.jpg" alt="stacked set of Anolon cookware" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/anolon-stackability-1.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/anolon-stackability-1-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/anolon-stackability-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/anolon-stackability-1-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/anolon-stackability-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/anolon-stackability-1-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/anolon-stackability-1-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/anolon-stackability-1-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/anolon-stackability-1-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/anolon-stackability-1-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The Anolon &#8211; Advanced line of cookware is a great option for even the trickiest, stickiest tasks in the kitchen. The skillets and saucepans in this collection performed well in all our tests and provided a high-quality cooking experience.  In <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-nonstick-pan/">our review of nonstick pans</a>, we upgraded the Anolon &#8211; Advanced to our top pick.</p>
<p>In fact, it was a very close competition between the Anolon and Circulon, as both were hard to distinguish in “nonstickablility” and user experience. In the end, the Anolon trailed the Circulon set in both heating variance and time to reach 500 °F, leading it to become our runner up.</p>
<p>Each piece of the Anolon is constructed with three layers of nonstick coating. The manufacturer claims this process ensures superb performance over a long period of time, and we believe that to be true. The Anolon saute pan was unaffected by our scouring pad abuse test. The fried egg slid off the surface just as effortlessly as it had the first time, prior to scrubbing.</p>

<p>The triple-layer construction also provides a smooth cooking surface. Several other products rely on ridges or dimples to reduce abrasion that inevitably occurs over time. While these textured surfaces are optimal for many foods, some items, like scrambled eggs, can get lodged and burned inside the tiny crevices.</p>
<p>Like the Circulon Symmetry, the Anolon Advanced set is distinctly heavier than the others, which means it heats slower and more evenly. We also appreciated the smooth, slick surface and the high walls of the Anolon pots and pans. The shape of each piece encourages larger portions, easier stirring, and safer use.</p>
<p>Neither the Circulon nor the Anolon fool you by counting cheap plastic spatulas or spoons as cookware pieces. Within its 12 pieces of cookware, the Anolon Advanced series includes seven pot and pans and five lids — more than any other set.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>

<p>Cookware should be with you for a long time. You may use it daily, and we believe our recommendations are worthy of the price. That being said, for those wanting to spend a bit less, there are still great options.</p>
<p>The 12-piece signature series from T-fal is our choice for the best value set (under $100) of nonstick cookware. We like a lot of things about this collection of pots and pans — the nonstick performance in particular. Throughout our testing, food of all different kinds released easily from the T-fal cooking surface.</p>
<p>All of the pans in the T-fal Signature set feature a red logo heat indicator at the center of the pan. When the pan has absorbed the optimal level of heat, the logo’s blank spots fill in red, alerting you that the pan is ready. We found this unique feature useful because it takes the guesswork out of when to start cooking.</p>

<p>Another thing we liked, particularly when making pancakes, was the inclusion of a flat griddle. The T-fal is the only set we tested that offers a griddle, which makes preparing certain foods easier with increased cooking surface and easier access.</p>
<p>The T-fal set succeeded in separating itself from the other value cookware we tested in resilience and durability. Other pans we tested showed significant performance deterioration after scrubbing with the scouring pad, but the T-fal continued to allow food to slide off the surface easily.</p>
<p>The T-fal skillet reached 500 °F in just four minutes — longer than a few others we tested but not the best. We also discovered these pans to be pretty inconsistent in terms of the way they absorb heat. The difference from one side of the pan to the other was 78 degrees after three minutes on medium heat. It’s important to keep this in mind, particularly when preparing fish in T-fal cookware.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The heat indicator and griddle are two unique features in the T-fal Signature cookware set.</li>
<li>The skillets and saucepans held up to use and scrubbing better than the competition in the value category.</li>
<li>At just $55-67, depending on color, the T-fal Signature cookware set is a bargain.</li>
</ul>

<p>The cookware sets sold by Rachael Ray, Gotham Steel, and Faberware all provide a reliably stick-free cooking experience. There is little to no resistance when removing food from these pots and pans, and they all clean up quickly and easily.</p>
<h3>Gotham Steel</h3>
<p>The skillet from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ERZEYK0?tag=ybdnons-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gotham Steel</a>, made with titanium and ceramic, has a slick surface that performed the best in our test of salmon filets.This was the toughest challenge for our other finalists. Many of the filets left skin and fatty residue that stuck to the pan. The Gotham Steel repelled any oily build up, and the salmon was easily removed with one pass of a plastic spatula.</p>
<p>We also like the vegetable steamer insert for the largest pot, included in the Gotham set. No other collection offered a steamer, and it could be more useful for some consumers than a plastic spatula or slotted spoon.</p>
<p>Our concerns with the Gotham Steel include its quick accumulation of heat and lower long-term durability than other cookware. The Gotham Steel was the fastest to reach 500 °F at just three minutes and 43 seconds. It also demonstrated the highest variance; there was a difference of 86 degrees across the cooking surface, from one side of the pan to the other. A pan that gets too hot, too fast and has such an inconsistent temperature makes preparing some dishes difficult.</p>
<p>The Gotham Steel also has an exposed metallic handle. The other products in our top six use rubber, plastic or silicone to insulate the handle from heat and protect your hand. Without this barrier, we found the handle to get uncomfortably hot rather quickly, requiring use of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-oven-mitts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oven mitts</a>.</p>
<h3>Faberware Millenium</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0042H7KUK?tag=ybdnons-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Farberware Millennium</a> set may be our favorite set aesthetically. The dark cherry red porcelain is sharp and sophisticated and would look great in any kitchen. In our tests, the Farberware products were quick to reach that dangerous 500-degree level, but the cooking surface was uniformly heated, showing a low variance of just 41 °F.</p>
<p>In the end, what disappointed us about the Farberware was the nonstick technology reliant on dimples in the form of tiny indentations across the cooking surface, similar to the texture of a golf ball. The textured pans are marketed to help minimize abrasion, avoid scratching and prolong their effectiveness. However, we observed some food &#8212; for example, scrambled eggs and salmon fat &#8212; getting stuck in these crevices.</p>
<p>During the cooking process, this bit of food debris would continue to cook and burn into the surface, because it was not being picked up and flipped or stirred with the rest of the meal. This made cleaning the Farberware pots and pans a bit more difficult than the other products we tested.</p>
<h3>Rachel Ray Cucina</h3>
<p>In the value category, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JYHNNYK?tag=ybdnons-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rachael Ray Cucina</a> set was our second favorite line of cookware. Of the sets available for less than $100, the pots and pans from Rachael Ray were the slowest to reach 500 °F and showed the least variance — a difference of just 35 degrees, second only to our overall favorite from Circulon.</p>
<p>In fact, the Rachael Ray 12-piece set performed well in all our testing. It was strong against the scouring pad and slick enough to deal with salmon and scrambled eggs. The silicone-wrapped stainless steel handles feel great and the pans are safe in the oven, up to 400 degrees. While the Rachael Ray set is a viable value option, we just happened to like some of the features included in the T-fal collection a bit more.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Whichever cookware set you choose, remember how you use it is just as important. We recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005GYUNQG?tag=ybdnons-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Circulon Symmetry</a> as the best collection of nonstick cookware. The heavier components create pots and pans that heat safely, slowly, and evenly to make great food without a mess.</p>
<p>We also highly recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UD6Y3EU?tag=ybdnons-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon Advanced 12-piece set</a>. We found the unique geometry of these pans, with their high walls, to provide an effortless cooking experience.</p>
<p>If you want the best product with the lowest financial investment, you may want to opt for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001167VIQ?tag=ybdnons-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">T-fal Signature set</a>, which includes heat indicators and a griddle perfect for pancakes.</p>

<p><em>(Editor’s note: We revisited this review of electric kettles and learned that our top pick, the Hamilton Beach &#8211; 40996 has been discontinued and replaced with a newer model, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758BZKQN/?tag=ybdktl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 41020</a>. We decided to test the new model along with two new Proctor Silex kettles. The Hamilton Beach &#8211; 41020 performed just as well as its predecessor, and we now select it as our top pick.)</em></p>
<h2>How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We spent 55 hours researching and testing electric kettles. This testing included one month of daily use for each of our six finalists in order to determine which one really is the best pick for typical, day-to-day use.</p>
<p>We read through more than 80 articles, forum and Reddit threads, and expert opinions from coffee and tea enthusiasts to determine which brands were most respected and offered the most value. While there wasn’t an overwhelming consensus, we were able to find that certain brands and products seem to have the most consistently-positive feedback.</p>
<p>Since there are literally thousands of electric kettles on the market, our first step was to narrow down the field. During our research, we found that there are a few features that consistently ranked as the most important to users, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>No harmful materials</li>
<li>Easy to clean</li>
<li>No potential rust issues</li>
<li>Automatic shutoff</li>
<li>Sufficient water capacity (at least 1 liter)</li>
<li>Ability to quickly heat water</li>
<li>A safe and comfortable handle</li>
<li>A large and easily accessible opening for water</li>
</ul>
<p>These metrics made it possible for us to significantly narrow the field. From there, we researched dozens of brand names and models to determine which were most likely to perform the best during our in-house testing.</p>
<p>While there are electric kettles available in the $100+ range, we found that there was little to no difference in the features they offered. Often, the differences were cosmetic or there was a premium paid for a brand name.</p>
<p>During our testing, all of the kettles consistently heated up water to the boiling point in minutes. However the new Hamilton Beach &#8211; 41020 and the T-fal could also be programmed to lower settings, which is important for brewing different teas and French press coffee.</p>
<p>Once our finalists were selected, we ran them through a number of metrics-driven tests which helped us determine which were the best at the sole function — heating water quickly and safely. We also took into account factors such as the ergonomics of each kettle and extra features offered by each product, along with several other factors to ultimately select our best pick.</p>
<h2 id="compare">Compare the best electric kettles</h2>
[table id=319 /]
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Build quality</h3>
<p>When looking for an electric kettle, the first thing you should consider is the build quality of the kettle itself. While these gadgets are fairly simple from a technical standpoint, it does incorporate several elements that, if unreliable, will render the kettle essentially useless.</p>
<p>For example, an unreliable heating element will cause the kettle to heat to unpredictable temperatures if it heats at all. Similarly, if the interior of a kettle is prone to lime build-up or “scaling,&#8221; the effectiveness of the kettle can be negatively impacted.</p>
<h3>Heating efficiency</h3>
<p>When choosing an electric kettle you should consider how efficient the kettle is in heating water.  One of our tests was measuring  “degrees per minute,&#8221; which presented a clear picture of each finalist&#8217;s heating capability.</p>
<h3>Ergonomics</h3>
<p>The ideal kettle will be easy to pick up, carry and pour. This is particularly important, given that the kettle will be holding boiling-hot water. Ergonomics are difficult to quantify numerically; however, for a kettle to be ergonomic, it should be easy to hold in one hand. Ideally the handle would be made from a heat resistant material that protects your hand from the hot kettle.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4033 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-handle.jpg" alt="vonshef handle closeup" width="750" height="497" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-handle.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-handle-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-handle-360x239.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-handle-375x249.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-handle-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-handle-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-handle-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-handle-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Minimum and maximum water capacity</h3>
<p>The maximum water capacity will determine the number of hot drinks that an electric water kettle can make at one time. In general, the larger the maximum water capacity, the more versatile the kettle.</p>
<p>However, one metric that is considered less often is the <i>minimum</i> water capacity the kettle can support. With some of the higher-capacity kettles, as much as 1 liter of water at minimum is needed to safely run the kettle.</p>
<h3>Programmable temperature</h3>
<p>Programmable water temperature isn’t a necessary feature for everyone. However, if you want to heat water to the optimal temperature for certain types of tea, then a kettle with temperature settings that can be programmed is your best option. As we discussed in <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-tea-maker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our review of the best tea maker</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black and herbal teas should be brewed at the full 212° F boil.</li>
<li>Oolong teas are best steeped in water ranging between 180° and 190°.</li>

<h3>Temperature readout</h3>
<p>While a temperature readout is an essential feature on an electric kettle, it is nice to  glance at a  readout and see how close the water is from being fully heated.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>The first thing we looked at was the general build quality — which kettles were built to last? During our research, we found that many of the complaints about electric kettles online was that they were prone to rusting, chipping or otherwise deteriorating with regular use. We tested all of our finalists over the course of a month to ensure that they did not show any early signs of deterioration.</p>
<p>Since the rapid heating of water is one of the primary draws of an electric water kettle, we also took the speed at which each kettle could heat water as a major factor in ranking each finalist. To do this, we measured how long it took each kettle to heat 1 liter of room temperature water to 212°.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4035 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kettle-data-comparison-chart.png" alt="kettle data comparison chart" width="880" height="380" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kettle-data-comparison-chart.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kettle-data-comparison-chart-610x263.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kettle-data-comparison-chart-360x155.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kettle-data-comparison-chart-375x162.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kettle-data-comparison-chart-414x179.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kettle-data-comparison-chart-295x127.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kettle-data-comparison-chart-180x78.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kettle-data-comparison-chart-320x138.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We also tested temperature accuracy. For the non-programmable kettles, this simply meant measuring how close to 212° the kettles got before shutting off. For the programmable kettles, we tested each of the settings to see how close to the stated temperature the water actually was.</p>
<p>We strongly considered the ergonomics of the kettle. Since both the kettle itself and the liquid inside are boiling hot (or close to it), it’s important that the kettle be comfortable in your hand, both when moving it around and also when pouring.</p>
<p>Some of the kettles we tested have a feature which keeps the water at a specific temperature for as long as one hour. The advantage of this is that you don’t have to keep reheating water each time you refill your cup.</p>
<p>It’s imperative that kettles turn off automatically if and when all of the water inside has been dispensed or boiled off. We tested each kettle for a reliable “auto-off” feature.</p>
<p>Finally, we tested for early signs of scaling and rust over the course of our one month testing period and then over the next six months checked periodically for any signs of deterioration.</p>
<h3>Preventing rust and scaling in your kettle</h3>
<p>During our research, we found that one of the best ways to prevent rust and scaling issues is to perform basic maintenance. This can be as simple as emptying out unused water, and for some kettles, an equal combination of white vinegar and water can be boiled in the kettle.</p>
<h2 id="electric-or-stovetop">Electric or stovetop?</h2>
<p>While there’s nothing inherently wrong with using a stovetop kettle, there are several advantages to using an electric kettle that are worth considering — particularly if you’ve never owned one before.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4037 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stovetop-vs-electric-kettle.jpg" alt="side by side: stovetop kettle vs. electric" width="750" height="547" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stovetop-vs-electric-kettle.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stovetop-vs-electric-kettle-610x445.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stovetop-vs-electric-kettle-360x263.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stovetop-vs-electric-kettle-375x274.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stovetop-vs-electric-kettle-414x302.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stovetop-vs-electric-kettle-295x215.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stovetop-vs-electric-kettle-180x131.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stovetop-vs-electric-kettle-320x233.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>First off, electric kettles can be used in more places since they don’t require a stovetop to heat water. This is particularly valuable in situations such as a college dorm room or for a traveler staying in a hotel, but it’s useful even in a full-sized kitchen as well.</p>
<p>Electric kettles also heat up water faster than a stovetop kettle, and several models we tested could maintain the heated water temperature for up to one hour. Another advantage is that most electric kettles automatically shut off when the water level is too low or boiled off.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758BZKQN/?tag=ybdktl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 41020</a> is the upgraded model of our former top pick, the Hamilton Beach &#8211; 40996, and with its precise temperature controls and more user-friendly features than the prior model, the 41020 easily wins our top pick.</p>
<p>The new Hamilton Beach kettle has been completely redesigned. The older model sat on a programmable base, which we previously found somewhat tricky to learn to use. The new model still sits on a base, but i’s programming has all been integrated into the kettle’s handle. Setting a heating function is now simple: you push a preset button, and then press start.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach has five programs for different types of teas and a separate program for heating water to 200° for a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-french-press/">French press coffee maker</a>.</p>
<p>The programs’ heating times range from 2 minutes 45 seconds (160° to 4 minutes 26 seconds (full boil). When the water hits the desired temperature, the kettle beeps six times to alert you it’s ready. We tested each program with an instant-read thermometer, and the programmed temperature was hit every time. As with the older model, the 41020 has a helpful “keep warm” function, which keeps the water hot at the desired temperature for 30 minutes.</p>

<p>The kettle is made of an attractive brushed stainless steel, which does get very hot. However, its large handle is curved enough away from the kettle so your fingers won’t ever get burned. An “open” button on the handle automatically opens the lid, and a nice touch is the silicone “close” button that prevents your touching the hot lid. Other features we like are the automatic shut-off when water gets too low and its mesh filter that easily slides in and out of the kettle’s spout.</p>
<p>The only thing we didn’t like about it is that the clear window that shows water level is directly behind the handle and hard to see. The window is illuminated with blue light when the kettle is plugged in, but we would prefer if the window was positioned on the side of the kettle, so we wouldn’t need the light to discern the water level.</p>
<p>This kettle is about $10 more than the older model, but with its smart redesign and easy-to-use programming, it’s superior to all of the less-expensive kettles we previously tested.</p>

<p>If you would prefer something other than a stainless steel kettle and don&#8217;t mind a 1-liter maximum capacity, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0086UJQN8/?tag=ybdktl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">T-fal &#8211; BF6138</a> is our runner-up.</p>
<p>The T-fal has a slightly-quirky design tailored for college students and young adults, however, the black and green color scheme can also work in most kitchens, while the functionality of the kettle makes it an option worth considering. It’s short stature and small footprint make it ideal for situations where space is limited.</p>
<p>The T-fal offered the fastest heating of all the finalists we tested. It took the kettle just under four minutes to heat one liter of water from 67.5° to 211.5°, for a rate of 36.46°  per minute. It has three different heat settings: a low of 160°, a mid-range of 190° and a high of 212°.</p>
<p>The T-fal makes it nearly impossible to accidentally burn your hand while using it. The sturdy handle makes pouring easy and controllable, while the outside of the kettle remains fairly cool to the touch.</p>
<p>Many plastic electric kettles had a heating element that was inside the water reservoir itself. This means that the heating element is directly exposed to the water, ultimately leading to lime buildups or other residues. Conversely, the T-fal has a heating element that is located entirely separate from the water. The inner bottom of the kettle is metallic, which allows for safe and efficient transfer of heat.</p>

<p>The biggest issue we had with the T-fal kettle was that it doesn&#8217;t have auto-on and auto-off options. Once the water is fully heated, the kettle turns off and doesn&#8217;t keep the heated water hot. While it&#8217;s not a deal breaker, we would have preferred if the T-fal had specific temperatures for each of its three settings.</p>
<p>Finally, the 1-liter maximum capacity is somewhat limiting, especially if you’re trying to serve multiple people at the same time. However, if you&#8217;re just heating up water for one or two people, the T-fal works just fine.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Because of its compact size, the T-fal &#8211; BF6138 is a great budget option for small kitchens or college dorm rooms.</li>
<li>It has three temperature settings that heat up faster than all of the kettles we tested.</li>
<li>Although the T-fall doesn&#8217;t have as many functions as more expensive kettles, its smart ergonomic design prevents burns and makes pouring easy.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00023XCWS/?tag=ybdktl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Proctor Silex &#8211; K2070Y</a> is very similar to the discontinued Sunbeam that we reviewed, and we tested it to see how it compared. The Proctor Silex &#8211; K2070Y is a 1-liter-capacity plastic kettle that feels very lightweight and not well put together. Its wobbly plastic lid is connected to the kettle with two small screws, and the mesh filter fits into the spout by two plastic tabs, which could easily snap off.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the kettle has a wavy blue window on one side that clearly shows the water level. The kettle brought room-temperature water to a roiling boil in 6 minutes, although it took another 16 seconds for the kettle to automatically shut off. The Proctor Silex &#8211; K2070Y is very inexpensive, and if you don’t mind its cheap construction, it will certainly boil water, but we can’t predict for how long.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25198" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-proctor-silex-solo.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1335" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-proctor-silex-solo-1000x668@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-proctor-silex-solo-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-proctor-silex-solo-768x513.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-proctor-silex-solo-885x591.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-proctor-silex-solo-180x120@2x.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-proctor-silex-solo-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-proctor-silex-solo-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-proctor-silex-solo-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-proctor-silex-solo-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-proctor-silex-solo-1000x668.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-proctor-silex-solo-320x214.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-proctor-silex-solo-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-proctor-silex-solo-885x591@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-proctor-silex-solo-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-proctor-silex-solo-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-proctor-silex-solo-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-proctor-silex-solo-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-proctor-silex-solo-320x214@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074T6GX6R/?tag=ybdktl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Proctor Silex &#8211; 41007</a> is the company’s most recent model. It’s a plastic 1.7-liter kettle that sits on top of a plastic base. Like the K2070Y, it has a side window to show water level, but because it’s uncolored, you can’t really see how much water you’ve poured in unless you look closely. When it’s heating, the kettle gets very hot, but its handle is curved enough so you won’t get burned when pouring.</p>
<p>The 41007 has a chrome-colored plastic dial for changing the four settings programmed for green, white, oolong and black teas. The dial doesn’t click into place, but rather slides between settings, so you need to be careful that you’ve turned it precisely to the desired setting or the temperature won’t be accurate.</p>
<p>It took from 3 to 5 minutes for the water to heat to the programmed temperatures ranging between 160 °F to 210 °F. If you’re unsure what temperature water should be heated for a particular type of tea, you’ll need to find that information elsewhere, because it’s neither on the kettle nor in the instruction manual.</p>
<p>Overall, the Proctor Silex &#8211; 41007 is a decent kettle, and it’s half the price of our top pick. But if you are a tea lover and want accurate temperatures, the Hamilton Beach &#8211; 41020 will better meet your needs.</p>
<h3>Ovente &#8211; KS88S</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RZXJOU2/?tag=ybdktl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4040 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ovente.jpg" alt="Ovente kettle on a table" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ovente.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ovente-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ovente-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ovente-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ovente-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ovente-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ovente-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ovente-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RZXJOU2/?tag=ybdktl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ovente &#8211; KS88S</a> is another good choice for brewing different types of tea.  It holds 1.7 liters of water and can be programmed with five temperature settings for up to two hours. However, we found its handle to be a bit small and awkward to use, and the water pours from the spout erratically.</p>
<h3>Aroma &#8211; AWK-115S</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4041 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Aroma-kettle.jpg" alt="Aroma kettle on a table" width="750" height="497" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Aroma-kettle.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Aroma-kettle-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Aroma-kettle-360x239.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Aroma-kettle-375x249.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Aroma-kettle-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Aroma-kettle-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Aroma-kettle-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Aroma-kettle-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KDVTJI/?tag=ybdktl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aroma &#8211; AWK-115S</a> is another basic kettle, which doesn’t have any programming settings. If you prefer an aluminum look over the VonShef’s glass sides, it is a viable option. However, for the money, you’re better off spending a few dollars less for the T-fal.</p>
<h3>Hamilton Beach &#8211; 40996 (discontinued)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-310 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hamilton-kettle-with-tea-cups.jpg" alt="hamilton-kettle-with-tea-cups" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hamilton-kettle-with-tea-cups.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hamilton-kettle-with-tea-cups-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hamilton-kettle-with-tea-cups-180x120@2x.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hamilton-kettle-with-tea-cups-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hamilton-kettle-with-tea-cups-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hamilton-kettle-with-tea-cups-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hamilton-kettle-with-tea-cups-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hamilton-kettle-with-tea-cups-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hamilton-kettle-with-tea-cups-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hamilton-kettle-with-tea-cups-295x197@2x.jpg 590w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach &#8211; 40996 had been our previous overall top pick, but it&#8217;s been discontinued and replaced by 41020.  The classy Hamilton Beach &#8211; 40996 is primarily made from stainless steel, with solid black plastic on the base, handle and opening for water. The inside of the kettle is solid stainless steel as well and the heating element is located entirely on the base pad.</p>
<p>Although the base is made of plastic, it does function well, although programming its five temperature settings does take a bit of a learning curve. Follow the instructions manual carefully, and before long you&#8217;ll get the hang of it.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach kettle heated one liter of water from 67.3° to 212.2° in 4 minutes and 2 seconds, for a rate of 35.93 degrees per minute. By comparison, the T-fal heated one liter of water from 67.5° to 211.5° in 3 minutes and 57 seconds, for a rate of 36.46 degrees per minute.</p>
<p>While the T-fal kettle is slightly faster, it’s important to also consider that it&#8217;s limited to heating no more than one liter at a time. The Hamilton Beach kettle can heat nearly twice as much.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach has an automatic shut-off function.  Once the water hits the programmed temperature, a one-hour timer starts counting down on the base display. Like the other programmable kettles, it shuts off when the water level is below its internal sensor or one hour later, whichever is first.</p>
<p>One notable issue that we took into account was consumers complain that the Hamilton Beach breaks down in six-months&#8217; time. We used the Hamilton Beach for nine months after our initial testing, and we had none of the mechanical issues that were previously reported.</p>
<h3>VonShef &#8211; 13/140 (discontinued)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4039 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef.jpg" alt="VonShef kettle on a table" width="750" height="497" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-360x239.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-375x249.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vonshef-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><em>(Editor’s note: In 2019 we learned that VonShef &#8212; a U.K. company &#8212; has updated the model we reviewed. However, although it’s available for purchase on the VonShef website, it’s not yet sold on Amazon.)</em></p>
<p>The VonShef &#8211; 13/140 kettle came the closest of the remaining four electric kettles to be listed as one of our picks. It is a good-looking kettle that heats water comparable to the rest of our finalists. That, in conjunction with its glass siding and blue lighting, makes it a classy addition to any kitchen. However, because of its high price point, we can&#8217;t recommend it over the Hamilton Beach.</p>
<h3>Sunbeam &#8211; SEK17 (discontinued)</h3>
<p><em>(Editor’s note: Since our review, the Sunbeam &#8211; SEK17 was discontinued, and Newell Brands, the company that owns Sunbeam, is no longer making electric kettles under the Sunbeam brand name.)</em></p>
<p>The Sunbeam &#8211; SEK17 kettle simply boils to 212°, and if you&#8217;re willing to regularly clean the exposed heating element with white vinegar and water, we found it to be a reliable option for the budget-conscious.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Ultimately we found that for less than $50, you can get an electric kettle that does more than just boil water. If you&#8217;re a tea or coffee lover, our new top pick the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758BZKQN/?tag=ybdktl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 41020</a> is an upgraded and attractive stainless-steel kettle that will work with any kitchen decor. Its six  precise temperature settings have been integrated into the kettle&#8217;s handle and  can be easily programmed at the touch of a button.</p>
<p>Our runner-up, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0086UJQN8/?tag=ybdktl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">T-fal &#8211; BF6138</a>, has three temperature settings and can only hold one liter. However if you&#8217;ve got a small kitchen or you&#8217;re a college student in a dorm or traveler in a hotel room, the T-fal is great space-saving electric kettle.</p>
