<p>Copper cookware is arguably the type of cookware most cherished by professional chefs and skilled home cooks.</p>
<p>Julia Child firmly believed that every serious-minded cook should own at least one copper pot or pan. She discovered the benefits of cooking with copper during her years in France, where she purchased the thirty copper pots and pans now on display at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C. Julia cooked with those beloved pots for 45 years on all of her television programs, because <a href="https://www.copper.org/consumers/arts/2010/may/Julia_Child_Copper_P.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">copper allows for the precision that French cookery requires</a>.</p>
<p>Centuries before Julia filmed her first episode of The French Chef, the ancient Romans discovered that copper heats faster and more evenly than other metals, because of copper’s heat and electrical conductivity, which is second only to silver. Copper also cools very quickly, so once the copper pan is removed from the heat source, its temperature rapidly drops, which helps prevent a delicate sauce from overcooking or separating.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Copper is highly reactive: </b>A reactive metal like copper conducts heat very efficiently, but it also reacts with acidic foods. Tomatoes, vinegar and lemon can absorb not only a metallic flavoring but the metal itself.</p>
<p><b>Copper pots and pans are lined with nonreactive metal: </b>Copper cookware has been traditionally lined with nonreactive tin, which is not affected by acidic foods. With extended use over many years, tin does darken and wear away, so a tin-lined copper pan needs to be eventually re-tinned, or copper will leach into food, which our bodies can’t process and eliminate.</p>
<p>In recent years, copper pots and pans have been lined with stainless steel. Stainless steel, of course, is a hard, durable metal, but it lacks tin’s conductivity. Stainless liners are often coated with a nonstick material like PTFE (Teflon is the name brand), which, as we discussed in our reviews of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-nonstick-pan/">nonstick pans</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-nonstick-cookware/">nonstick cookware</a>, can be hazardous if the pan gets too hot.</p>
<p>Tin, on the other hand, is naturally nonstick and has low toxicity. For copper cookware, it&#8217;s the preferred metal for lining.</p>
<p><b>Copper cookware can’t be used for all cooking methods: </b>Tin has a melting point of 450° F, so a tin-lined copper pan should <i>never</i> be used for high-heat searing. For steaks, burgers and other foods you want browned, use a cast-iron pan instead. Copper is best for low-heat cooking, such as sauces, seafood, omelettes and other egg dishes.</p>
<p><b>Copper pots are expensive: </b>A copper saucepan from such well-known manufacturers as Mauviel and Falk runs about $450, and an entire cookware set can be as high as $2,000.</p>
<p>However, vintage pieces are available online. We purchased an authentic omelette pan, made in France, on Ebay for $40. Though vintage copper cookware will probably need polishing and retinning, it is much more affordable than buying copper cookware brand new.</p>

<p>Copper-core cookware is made primarily from more common metals, with a four- or five-layer base composed of a thin layer of copper sandwiched between layers of aluminum and/or stainless steel. The copper-core cookware that is made primarily of stainless steel is approximately triple the price of aluminum cookware.</p>
<p>The copper layer improves stainless steel’s heat conductivity and distribution, and the stainless steel makes the cookware more durable. Copper-core cookware also withstands higher temperatures and, because of the stainless-steel base, can be used on induction cooktops.</p>
<p>Copper-core cookware that is composed primarily of aluminum is considerably less expensive and usually has a non-stick surface.</p>
<h3>Copper-infused ceramic-coated</h3>
<p>This type of inexpensive, nonstick cookware is very popular, thanks to aggressive infomercials by two rival companies, Red Copper and Copper Chef. Their cookware is made of lightweight aluminum and is coated with a ceramic that they claim is infused with copper and can handle higher temperatures than 100% copper cookware.</p>
<p>Both companies market their cookware as all-purpose pans for searing, broiling, braising and frying: cooking methods that should never be used with copper.</p>

<p>We decided to see how well a copper-core pan, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002QB9TPS/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper</a>, and a copper-infused ceramic-coated pan, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BDU01TU/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Copper Chef</a>, fared against the real thing, a vintage tin-lined copper pan that we purchased on eBay.</p>
<p>The oval copper pan, generally used for cooking omelettes and fish, was manufactured in France, and although we don’t know when, it was obviously a much-used pan in someone’s kitchen. Its tin lining was scratched and had darkened to a gray patina, and the copper was spotted and tarnished.</p>
<p>Using a home remedy of Kosher salt, vinegar and flour, we rubbed the mixture onto the copper, and its years of neglect magically wiped off. Though our pan didn’t look quite new again, it was still a pretty pan that helped us understand why people would pay a small fortune for new copper cookware.</p>
<p>We conducted several simple but illustrative cooking tests. We used no oil or butter, and everything was cooked at medium heat.</p>
<p><b>Fried eggs: </b>We cracked whole eggs into the center and far edge of each pan and noted whether the center egg cooked faster than the side egg, or whether they both cooked at the same time. We also tested the pan’s nonstick capability by turning the eggs over and then scrambling the yolk and uncooked white.</p>
<p><b>Pancakes: </b>We used a <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21014/good-old-fashioned-pancakes/" target="_blank" rel="&quot;noopener">basic recipe for pancakes</a> and poured a pancake into the center and two pancakes on either side of the pan. Similar to the egg test, we were looking for evenly cooked pancakes. When we flipped the pancakes, we noted how the pancakes had browned and if they slid out of the pan without effort.</p>
<p><b>Hamburger: </b>We pan-fried a ⅓-pound, ¾-inch-thick hamburger made of 93% lean grass-fed organic beef. Each burger was fried for five minutes on each side. We were looking for an evenly browned and crisp exterior with a medium-rare interior.</p>

<p>The Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper was an admirable competitor, but our traditional 100% copper pan was the winner. As mentioned earlier, copper pans are famous for heat conductivity, and our vintage copper didn’t disappoint. The copper heated up quicker than the Anolon and Copper Chef, and after a couple of burnt pancakes, we turned down the heat source to medium-low, since it clearly didn’t need to be as high as the other two pans did.</p>
<p>Across the board, results were perfect, although the copper did require precision in controlling the heat level. Since this particular pan is intended for cooking omelettes, we poured in a couple of beaten eggs and were amazed by how rapidly it cooked and how easily the omelette could be folded and rolled. We don’t know how old our copper pan is, but it’s remarkable that its tin lining’s held up so well.</p>
<p>By the time we got to the hamburger, the pan was very hot, so we removed it from the cooktop and adjusted the heat. Our copper pan is oval, so its edges hang over the cooktop’s round heating element. We thought that the edges of the pan would be less hot; but we were wrong. We leaned the burger against the curved sides of the pan, and the burger cooked as well as it did in the center of the pan.</p>
<p>Clean-up was simple: once the pan cooled, we washed it with warm soapy water, and food residue came off with no scrubbing needed (harsh scrubbing erodes the tin lining). Copper can spot easily from water droplets, so all copper cookware must be towel-dried, and it should <i>never</i> be put into the dishwasher.</p>
<p>Copper pot and pans aren&#8217;t for everyone or for every type of food. You need to continually adjust the heat level to prevent food from overcooking or burning. But with trial and error and some basic culinary skills, you’ll soon learn to cook with copper cookware and turn out meals like a professional — and dare we say, like the French Chef herself.</p>

It requires precision and skill by the home chef, but food will cook quickly and evenly. It's very expensive cookware, and Mauviel M'heritage is one of the best.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JSHJ9P2/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Tin-lined copper cookware is hard to find brand new, but one of the best makers of copper ware is Mauviel M’heritage: it&#8217;s 90% copper with stainless-steel lining. If you want to take the financial plunge, you can purchase <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KI0FG9W/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">an entire set</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JSHJ9P2/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">individual pieces</a> on Amazon.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>100% copper has superb heat conductivity, so it heats up fast, and heat distribution, so food cooks evenly on all surfaces of the pan.</li>
<li>Traditional copper pans are lined with tin, which is naturally nonstick and holds up for many years. New copper cookware is lined with stainless steel, which isn’t nonstick and doesn’t conduct heat as well as tin.</li>
<li>Copper is very expensive, and if you can’t afford to buy it new, you can find vintage copper pans online for much less and restore them.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002QB9TPS/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper</a> cookware is for people who don’t want to invest in the real thing nor deal with copper’s fussy upkeep. The cookware has only a super-thin layer (0.6 millimeters) of copper sandwiched between anodized aluminum layers, but the skillets we tested did perform very similarly to our authentic copper pan.</p>
<p>The Anolon has some heft to it, thanks to the magnetic stainless steel base, which also makes the pans induction-friendly. The 10-inch skillet weighs in at almost 3 pounds, and the 8.5-inch skillet is lighter at 1 pound. The 10-inch skillet isn’t really suited to flipping flapjacks and omelettes, unless you’ve got wrist strength.</p>
<p>That quibble aside, the pans gave great results. The copper layer worked in conjunction with the aluminum layers to evenly distribute heat over the entire surface of the pan. The stainless-steel base prevented the pan from heating up as rapidly as the vintage copper, but once the pan was hot, it was easier to regulate its heat level.</p>
<p>Pancake batter poured in the center and sides of the pan cooked evenly at the same time, and when we turned the pancakes, they were golden brown with crispy ridges. Fried eggs stuck a little, but when we flipped and scrambled the yolks and uncooked whites, they released easily. The hamburger also browned evenly, and similar to the copper pan, when we pressed the burger to the sides of the pan, it continued to sizzle.</p>

The Nouvelle Copper gave us great results and is a fraction of the cost.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002QB9TPS/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>In our review of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-nonstick-pan/">the best nonstick pan</a>, we chose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001B1CJME/?tag=ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon &#8211; Advanced</a> as the best because it was 100% nonstick during our tests. The Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper is coated with Autograph 2 &#8212; Dupont&#8217;s high-end nonstick coating &#8212;  but the manufacturer improved the pan’s overall design by recessing the handle-rivet heads on the inside, so they’re flat and also nonstick. The rivets in other nonstick pans are raised, and food particles get wedged between them, which we found annoying to remove.</p>
<p>Cleanup was a cinch; however, the attractive copper band on the pan’s base (a quarter-inch ring where the copper layer is exposed) needs to be routinely cleaned and polished, or it will stain and tarnish.</p>
<p>On the negative side, even with meticulous care, nonstick coating loses its effectiveness after two or three years of regular use, and the pans will need to be replaced. So, there’s no reason to spend a lot on any nonstick pan. The Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper 10-inch and 8.5-inch skillets are sold as a set for only $46, which we think is a great price for an alternative to copper cookware.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>The well-priced Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper is made of a copper layer sandwiched between durable anodized aluminum with a stainless-steel base, so it can be used on any cooktop, including induction.</li>
<li>The pans we tested heated slower than the copper pan we tested, but once hot, heat was evenly distributed across the surface and sides of the pans.</li>
<li>The Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper has a high-end nonstick coating, which, unlike copper cookware, eventually loses its effectiveness, and the pans will need to be replaced.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BDU01TU/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Copper Chef &#8211; KC15057-02000</a> copper-infused ceramic-coated pans are advertised as the only pans you’ll ever need for any cooking method. Don’t you believe it. There are hundreds of photos posted by dissatisfied consumers depicting their Copper Chef pans with burnt-on food that won’t wash off and pans blackened from high heat.</p>
<p>Copper Chef’s pans are made of very lightweight aluminum, and their interiors and exteriors are sprayed with a ceramic coating that purportedly contains copper. It’s impossible to find online how much copper infuses this coating, but our best guess is it’s negligible. According to advertising, the copper-infused coating will increase the pan’s conductivity as well as make it nonstick.</p>
<p>Testing proved otherwise. The pans have a thick aluminum disk on the bottom, which is supposed to distribute heat over the entire surface of the pan. It doesn’t. The bottom of the pan certainly gets hot, but no heat radiates past the circumference of the disk, leaving the sides of the pan cool. The hamburger cooked in the direct center of the pan, but when we moved it to any side, it steamed but didn’t brown.</p>
<p>The pan also has a convex surface that creates a gutter along the sides into which any liquid flows. Consequently, egg whites dribbled into the gutter, creating egg tendrils, and pancake batter pooled, producing oblong and  unevenly cooked pancakes.</p>
<p>A major problem with marketing a pan as all-purpose is that high heat destroys nonstick coating, which should never be used for broiling meat or frying French fries. Copper Chef claims that their cookware can withstand temperatures up to 850°F. Since most ovens can only be set to 550°F, this marketing ploy is ridiculous. It comes as no surprise that so many consumers are enraged when food soon clings to their destroyed Copper Chef pan.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Copper Chef pans are pretty cheap, so if you want to try it out, buy a single pan instead of a set.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>In our matchup between an authentic 100% copper pan, a copper-core pan and a copper-infused ceramic-coated pan, it was a tie between the real copper and the copper-core Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper.</p>
<p>Copper is justifiably famous for its heat conductivity and distribution, and in our testing, the 100% copper pan cooked everything beautifully and quickly, even at medium-low heat. Cooking with copper, though, does take some getting used to, and copper cookware requires periodic maintenance to keep it shiny and the metal lining nonstick. It&#8217;s also extremely expensive, but it’s easy to find affordable vintage copper pieces, like we did, online.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002QB9TPS/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper</a> gave us similar results as the vintage copper pan. It didn’t heat up as fast, but when hot, heat was distributed over the surface and sides of the pan, and food was evenly cooked. The Anolon&#8217;s high-end nonstick coating was, for the most part, nonstick. Cleanup was easier with the Anolon, and for two skillets at $46, it’s well priced.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Nonstick pans are incredibly popular, but their composition and nonstick coating are controversial. Since nonstick pans are made of hardened aluminum and painted with several layers of nonstick coating, we read opinions and reviews that argued for and against using nonstick cookware.</p>
<p>To no one’s surprise, the majority of pro-nonstick websites we consulted are dedicated to cooking, such as Epicurious, Bon Appetit, The Food Network and Cook’s Illustrated. Their reviews of nonstick pans avoid entirely the health issues that are possibly linked to aluminum pans and nonstick coatings. In fact, they focus instead on the health benefits of using nonstick pans, because you don’t need to add oils and fats except as a flavoring.</p>
<p>Research into whether using nonstick pans is linked to health issues is ongoing. We did learn, however, of certain precautions you should take, which we followed during our testing.</p>
<p>We moved on to subreddits /r/cooking and /r/askculinary for opinions about the best nonstick pans and compared them to hundreds of Amazon reviews. We then culled together a list of the nonstick pans that were considered the best by experts and consumers alike. We had already reviewed <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-nonstick-cookware/">the best nonstick cookware</a>, so we turned our attention to 10-inch skillets, which most chefs agree are the right size and weight for cooking several eggs or pancakes at one time.</p>
<p>Because there are a variety of heating elements in today’s kitchens, we narrowed our selection to nonstick pans that are designed for use on gas, electric and induction cooktops. Not all of the nonstick pans we wanted to test are sold individually, so we also decided to test nonstick-pan sets that included a 10-inch skillet along with a smaller or larger pan.</p>
<p>Even properly cared for, nonstick coating doesn&#8217;t hold up longer than two years. There&#8217;s really no reason to spend a lot on a nonstick pan if you&#8217;re going to have to replace it. So we selected nonstick pans that were $40 or less.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs a nonstick pan?</h2>
<p>Nonstick pans have been in use since the 1950s, and if you’re a cook, it’s a pretty safe bet that you’ve cooked with one or two in your lifetime. If you’ve been using a nonstick pan for a while, it’s also quite likely that it looks like it’s been through a war; it’s scratched, peeling, warped, banged up and you need to slather it up with butter to keep food from sticking.</p>
<p>We’ve been using nonstick pans for many years, and we’ve been cooking everything, at all levels of heat, in them. Little did we know that a nonstick pan was not designed for cooking all kinds of food. How often have you preheated a nonstick pan on high and seared a ribeye or salmon steak? If you’re like us, countless times, and that’s a surefire way of diminishing the lifespan of a nonstick fry pan.</p>
<p>You’re actually quite limited as to what you can cook in a nonstick pan. Steaks, sautes, stir fries — anything that needs high heat — should be cooked in a cast-iron skillet or stainless-steel saute pan. With both of these pans you want stuff to stick, because those browned bits (also called <i>fond </i>) can be whisked into a flavorful gravy or sauce.</p>
<p>Most nonstick pans are made from hardened aluminum, which has excellent heat conductivity, so they need less heat to cook food. Nonstick pans are thus ideal for delicate food that cooks quickly, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fried eggs</li>
<li>Scrambled eggs</li>
<li>Omelettes</li>
<li>Pancakes or crepes</li>
<li>Delicate fish filets, such as sole or flounder</li>
</ul>
<p>Every home cook should have at least one nonstick pan in the kitchen cabinet for this type of gentle, rapid cooking. If you’re looking to switch out your old pots and pans for new ones, our review of the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-nonstick-cookware/">best nonstick cookware</a> includes saucepans, stock pots and saute pans.</p>
<h2 id="what-is">What is nonstick coating?</h2>
<p>Traditionally, nonstick coatings are made from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), otherwise known as the famous (and infamous) brand name Teflon. It’s a paint that’s sprayed on the pan usually in three coats. The pan is then heat-cured to make sure the coating stays intact.</p>
<p>Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was a chemical commonly used for spraying the PTFE coats evenly. Although PFOA was initially deemed safe for home cooks using the pan, it did have harmful effects on the health of people working near or at the facility where the pan was manufactured and the PFOA applied.</p>
<p>In 2006, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency linked perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) to a number of health issues, including cancer, and urged manufacturers to cease using PFOA by 2015. Since 2013, most companies have complied. All of the nonstick pans we tested were PFOA-free.</p>
<h3>Is nonstick coating safe?</h3>
<p>As we discussed in detail in our review of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-nonstick-cookware/#what-is-it">nonstick cookware</a> about safety concerns, nonstick coatings can be harmful if the pan is improperly used. If an empty nonstick pan is left on an open flame long enough and heats to 662 ºF or higher, the PTFE begins to disintegrate. In those conditions, fine particles and noxious gasses are released and, if inhaled, can cause severe internal issues.</p>
<p>This off-gassing is particularly harmful — if not fatal — to birds, so many manufacturers now label packaging with a warning about using a nonstick pan in the vicinity of pet birds or parrots.</p>
<p>Nonstick coatings are generally considered safe if you follow these precautions:</p>
<p><b>Don’t preheat an empty pan:</b> Most nonstick pans are made of heavy aluminum, which can hit the 662ºF danger point in a few minutes. Always have food or liquid in the pan, and keep it moving as it cooks.</p>
<p><b>Cook at medium or medium-low heat: </b>Nonstick pans are designed to distribute heat evenly, so you don’t need to crank up the heat past medium for food to cook.</p>
<p><b>Ventilate your kitchen: </b>Whether you use your stove’s ventilator or simply open a window, keep the air flowing while you cook. You could also run an air purifier, like the one <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-air-purifier/">we recommend in our best air purifier review</a>, in your kitchen.</p>
<h2>How to take care of a nonstick pan</h2>
<p>Many complaints on Amazon about nonstick pans are that the nonstick coating scratches and flakes and stops working so that everything cooked sticks. People are also confused by the term “lifetime warranty” and try to return the pan a year after they purchased it.</p>
<p>Lifetime warranty is a vague term used by manufacturers to sell their product. It doesn&#8217;t mean that a nonstick pan will last the lifetime of the owner, nor does it refer to the pan&#8217;s lifetime, since that&#8217;s impossible to calculate.</p>
<p>A nonstick pan may hold up for 10 or 15 years, but the nonstick coating itself won&#8217;t last more than two years. There are a few best practices, however, you can follow that will help the nonstick coating last as long as possible.</p>
<p><b>Never use metal utensils with your nonstick cookware: </b>Although several manufacturers claim their nonstick pan is scratch-proof, take it with a grain of salt. Only use wood or silicone utensils.</p>
<p><b>Don’t shock the pan in water: </b>Any heavy-duty pan will warp from rapid change in temperature. After you’re done cooking, let the pan cool down before washing it.</p>
<p><b>Clean your pan with a scratch-proof pad or sponge: </b>Nonstick coatings are sensitive to steel wool, scouring pads and abrasive powder. Instead, use a nonscratch sponge like the one we recommend in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-kitchen-cleaning-sponge/#the-best-scratch">review of the best kitchen cleaning sponges</a>.</p>
<p><b>Wash and dry the pan by hand: </b>Ignore the manufacturer’s claim that its nonstick pan is “dishwasher-safe.” Abrasive detergent powder and heat will damage the pan’s nonstick coating in no time. All of the nonstick pans we tested were easily wiped clean with a paper towel or damp sponge. Dry the pan by hand to keep rust from forming.</p>
<p><b>Never use an aerosol cooking spray: </b>Cooking-oil sprays burn at a lower temperature than oil, and their burnt-on residue is almost impossible to remove without using a scouring pad.</p>
<p><b>Store your pans properly: </b>Hang your pans, or store them in dividers in your cabinet. If you don’t have the space in your kitchen and need to stack your pans, line the interior and edges with microfiber cloths or <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-paper-towels/">paper towels</a>.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Flat, smooth surface: </b>Some nonstick pans have a convex surface — a slight dome in the center — which allows the pan’s metal base to expand as it heats and prevents warping. One of the most common criticisms of nonstick pans is that convex surfaces cause runny foods, such as eggs or pancake batter, to dribble down the center of the pan and into the pan’s sides. So you want a pan that has a smooth, almost slick, surface and flat bottom, which sits evenly on your cooktop.</p>
<p><b>Size:</b> Nonstick pans range in size from eight inches to 12.5 inches. If you want to cook an omelette or more than two eggs or pancakes at one time, we recommend a 10-inch pan. The 10-inch pan gives you enough room to flip eggs or pancakes. The larger pans certainly accommodate more food, but you’ll need a larger heating element to properly heat the entire pan.</p>
<p><b>Weight and grip: </b>How much a pan should weigh and how you want it to fit in your hand are completely subjective choices. But we recommend that a pan should be light enough to flip an omelette or — if you’re skilled or daring — a sunny-side-up egg with a couple of quick flicks with your wrist. Almost all of the 10-inch pans we tested weighed under two pounds, which is light enough to easily maneuver the pan. The Tramontina was a few ounces heavier, and it was more difficult to move the pan around.</p>
<p><b>Shape: </b>The best 10-inch nonstick pans are French skillets, which have a flat, smooth bottom and low, flared sides that give you easy access for flipping eggs, pancakes or fish.</p>
<p><b>Handle: </b>A French skillet has a long handle that’s slightly shorter than the diameter of the pan. This length allows you to flip food with a quick jerking motion of your wrist and elbow. The handle should either have a silicone covering (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001B1CJME/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon Advanced</a>) or be made of stainless steel (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PCI71TS/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips</a>) to protect your hand from the intense heat generated by the pan.</p>
<p><b>Price: </b>Some beautiful nonstick pans are available with high price tags; they’re not worth it. When the nonstick coating stops working (and it will), you’ll feel less pain replacing a $40 pan than you would an expensive one.</p>

<h3>Heat distribution</h3>
<p>We dusted flour over the bottom of each pan and turned the heat on low. As the flour browned we could tell how evenly the pan heated up. If the flour browned at the same time from center to edge, heat distribution was good. Only two of the finalists — the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001B1CJME/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B55RQBO/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Circulon </a> — browned the flour evenly. The other pans browned from the center and then radiated out to the edges or browned in spots.</p>
<h3>Fried eggs</h3>
<p>Most people who purchase a nonstick pan want to cook without oil. Because we wanted to test whether a pan’s coating was truly nonstick, we didn&#8217;t use oil in any of our cooking tests. Once the pan was heated, we cracked an egg in the center of the pan and another on the side furthest from the handle.</p>
<p>When the egg whites firmed up, we turned them over and noted any sticking. Finally, we attempted to shake the pan to release the eggs; if this failed, we gently eased the eggs out of the pan and again noted how much they stuck.</p>
<h3>Scrambled eggs</h3>

<p>We whisked two eggs together and poured them into the pan. We immediately began moving them with a silicone spatula from the edges to the center. Because the eggs were in constant motion, most of the pans performed well. We had the most trouble with the Circulon, since the concentric circles trapped and browned the eggs between the ridges.</p>
<h3>Pancakes</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23157" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nonstick-pan-testing-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1335" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nonstick-pan-testing-1-1000x668@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nonstick-pan-testing-1-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nonstick-pan-testing-1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nonstick-pan-testing-1-885x591.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nonstick-pan-testing-1-810x541.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nonstick-pan-testing-1-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nonstick-pan-testing-1-1000x668.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nonstick-pan-testing-1-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nonstick-pan-testing-1-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nonstick-pan-testing-1-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nonstick-pan-testing-1-320x214.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nonstick-pan-testing-1-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nonstick-pan-testing-1-885x591@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nonstick-pan-testing-1-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nonstick-pan-testing-1-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nonstick-pan-testing-1-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nonstick-pan-testing-1-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nonstick-pan-testing-1-320x214@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We used this <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21014/good-old-fashioned-pancakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basic recipe for pancakes</a> and poured circles of batter into the pan: one in the center, one close to the handle and two on the opposite side of the handle. We noted whether the center pancake cooked faster than the pancakes near the handle and sides of the pan. We also attempted to flip the pancakes without using a spatula. Only if the pancake stuck did we use a silicone spatula to release them from the pan.</p>
<h3>Filet of sole</h3>
<p>We wanted a very delicate fish that could easily stick and fall apart. We put a thin three-ounce filet of sole into the pan for 30 seconds and then attempted to turn it over. This test proved to be the tell-all, as the fish stuck slightly or a lot to some pans and broke into pieces as we turned it over.</p>
<p>Two pans, however, were the clear champs: our top pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001B1CJME/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon</a>, and our top pick for a nonstick-pan set, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003IKMR96/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; Chef’s Classic</a>. Both pans lightly browned the fish and were 100-percent nonstick. We turned the fish, and the filets were left intact.</p>

<p>We found cooking with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001B1CJME/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon &#8211; 82074 Advanced</a> a pleasure. It&#8217;s 100-percent nonstick, and the 10-inch skillet was one of the lightest that we tested, so flipping eggs and pancakes was as effortless as Julia Child made it look.</p>
<p>The Anolon &#8211; Advanced is composed of anodized aluminum, which means it’s been manufactured with an electrochemical process that hardens the aluminum and makes it extra durable. It’s triple-coated with Autograph 2, a top-of-the-line Teflon derivative from Dupont&#8217;s spin-off company Chemours.</p>
<p>The Anolon has low sides and a smooth, flat surface, so it sat completely flat on our cooktop. It has excellent conductivity and was one of the fastest of the pans to heat up — in a mere 15 seconds — at medium-low. Hovering our hands over the pan, we could feel the heat radiating upward over the entire pan.</p>
<p>We cracked the eggs in the center and side, and both cooked at exactly the same rate. Thanks to the Anolon’s entirely flat surface, the eggs didn’t move, giving us the ideal bulls-eye shape. We turned the eggs over, and when the yolk was cooked (in about five seconds), we gently shook the pan, and the egg easily slid onto a plate in a compact package.</p>

<p>Everything cooked in a flash. Scrambled eggs came together in about 30 seconds and slid off onto the plate. Pancakes were golden brown in seconds. Again, we simply shook the pan, and the pancakes released. The sole filet was perfect: lightly browned, and since none of it stuck to the pan, we could lift and serve the filet intact.</p>
<p>The 8-inch handle is covered in silicone, which is easy to grip, and protects your hand from the pan’s intense heat.  The Anolon was ridiculously easy to clean; once it had cooled, we simply wiped it with a paper towel in between tests and washed it with a damp sponge when we were done.</p>
<p>The 10-inch skillet is sold separately and as a set with a 12-inch skillet. The larger pan performed exactly the same, but because its handle is too short, we found it less easy to maneuver on and off the stove top.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s actually much cheaper to buy the set than it is to buy the 10-inch skillet separately.  Because of the larger pan&#8217;s slight design flaw, we can&#8217;t recommend the Anolon as a set. But the 10-inch skillet outperformed all other finalists, and so, by itself, the Anolon 10-inch skillet is the best nonstick pan.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>

<p>Cuisinart really stepped up their game with their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003IKMR96/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; 722-911NS Chef&#8217;s Classic</a> nonstick pan set. This high-end — but affordable — set includes a 9-inch skillet and an 11-inch skillet. Their stainless-steel, stay-cool handles are the appropriate length for the dimensions of the pans, which makes them both feel well balanced— unlike Anolon&#8217;s larger pan — and easy to maneuver.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart pans are triple-coated with a Teflon derivative called QuanTanium. Each QuanTanium layer is reinforced with titanium and ceramic particles, which Cuisinart claims give the pans maximum protection from wear and tear.</p>
<p>Visually, the Cuisinart &#8211; Chef’s Classic pans are stunners. Their glossy, mirror finish on the exterior has a professional look, and if you have the room for it, you would feel compelled to hang them over your stove.</p>
<p>Looks aren’t everything, of course, and the Cuisinart’s performance was on par with the Anolon. The pans&#8217; conductivity and heat distribution weren&#8217;t quite as good as the Anolon, since it took nearly a minute for them to fully heat, and the flour browned quicker in the bottom two-thirds of the pan.</p>
<p>When we cracked the eggs into the center and upper third of the pan, however, they cooked exactly the same in a minute. The cooked eggs released onto a plate with just a gentle shake.</p>

<p>Pancakes browned evenly, and with some bravado, we flipped them up and over, just like you might see on a cooking show. The sole filet cooked perfectly and effortlessly released from the pan.</p>
<p>On the negative side, the Cuisinart pans have a slightly convex surface, so egg white dribbled down into the sides of each pan.  Scrambled eggs also ran a bit into this gutter. However, though we had to move the eggs out of the sides, they cooked evenly and slid out onto a plate.</p>
<p>Cleaning was easy, and although the mirror glaze did not discolor from the high heat, we did notice a couple of slight spots on the bottom of the pan, which we scrubbed off. The Chef’s Classic pans are dishwasher safe, but Cuisinart does state that the pans will eventually lose their mirror finish with repeated dishwasher cleaning.</p>
<p>Cuisinart only sells the 9-inch and 11-inch pans as a set. The Chef’s Classic are so well-priced for such high-quality nonstick pans, you’re really getting two great pans for the price of one.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0170TFNXM/?tag=ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">All Clad &#8211; E785S264</a> nonstick pan set includes an 8-inch skillet and a 10-inch skillet. Both are similar in construction to the Anolon, but the All Clad pans are designed like classic saute pans: Low, straight sides and long handles. These features allow for searing meat and making pan sauces, but those tasks are more appropriate for a cast-iron skillet or stainless-steel pan.</p>
<p>The All Clad pans have convex surfaces, so the eggs and pancake batter ran into the side gutters and cooked too quickly. The pans’ nonstick coating was actually quite effective, however, and although the fish filet stuck slightly, it released without falling apart.</p>
<p>Both pans cleaned easily, but we did notice that food particles got stuck in between the pan and the rivets that connected the handle to the pan.</p>
<p>The All Clad is substantially more expensive than the Cuisinart set, which we believe to be better pans at a better price.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PCI71TS/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; Nonstick Pro Fry Pan</a> is a nicely constructed and well-balanced 10-inch skillet. It feels substantial in the hand yet also easy to maneuver. The stay-cool metal handle is contoured for a comfortable grip.</p>
<p>OXO markets their proprietary nonstick coating as German-engineered and PFOA-free. With some research, we learned that there are indeed German-engineered nonstick pans, and some may use ceramic or other non-PTFE materials, but OXO’s nonstick pans still have a Teflon-like coating.</p>
<p>OXO’s nonstick coating, however, isn’t really as effective as OXO makes it out to be. The pan’s heat distribution seemed off: The half closest to the handle was hotter than the opposite half. Everything cooked faster on the handle side so food stuck: It wasn’t a lot of sticking, but just enough that egg and fish wouldn’t release from the pan without prying them free.</p>
<p>OXO charges more for their kitchen tools and appliances, which are usually excellent. In this case, however we don’t feel that this nonstick pan’s performance merits its high price.</p>
<h3>Calphalon &#8211; Classic Fry Pan</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CY3MRDS/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Calphalon -1943286 Classic Fry Pan</a> is a well-made, anodized aluminum 10-inch pan with a dual nonstick coating. All of the other pans we tested had three layers, and since Calphalon is perhaps one of the most recognized companies for nonstick cookware, it seems odd for this pan to have only two coatings. Calphalon makes its own nonstick coating, which is PTFE-based — basically, it’s Teflon — but it did not perform better than other similar coatings.</p>
<p>Heat distribution originated from the center of the pan and radiated outward, so everything we cooked on the edges browned less. The Calphalon took longer to heat up, but once it did, it was blistering hot, and food stuck. The pan has a stainless-steel handle, which should be cool, but the one-third of the handle connected to the pan was too hot to touch.</p>
<h3>Circulon &#8211; Symmetry</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B55RQBO/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Circulon &#8211; 87507 Symmetry French Skillet</a> set includes a 9-inch pan and an 11-inch pan. Both have a silicone-encased 8-inch handle, which is too short for the larger and substantially heavier pan.</p>
<p>Like all Circulon pans, the Symmetry French Skillet has raised circular ridges on its surface that the manufacturer claims help release food from the pan. However, in all of our tests, everything — except for the pancakes — stuck in between the ridges.</p>
<p>The Circulon had even heat induction and distribution, so the entire surface of the pan heated at the same time. We had success with the pancakes, which were easy to flip, but the fish stuck and fell apart when we tried to turn it. The circular ridges were most annoying with the fried and scrambled eggs, which got stuck between the grooves and browned too fast.</p>
<p>Cleaning was also a challenge. The sides of the pan wiped clean with a paper towel, but we had to scrape out the food bits trapped inside the ridges.</p>
<h3>Tramontina &#8211; Professional Restaurant Fry Pan</h3>

<p>We were excited to try out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009HBKQ16/?tag=ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tramontina 10-inch skillet</a>, which was recommended by Wirecutter as the best nonstick pan. After testing the Tramontina, however, we were left scratching our heads wondering why Wirecutter praised it so highly.</p>
<p>It’s certainly a well-designed skillet, made of heavy-gauge aluminum and a long stainless-steel handle that’s further protected by a silicone sheath. At two pounds, however, the Tramontina was the heaviest of the 10-inch skillets we tested and difficult to maneuver.</p>
<p>Tramontina’s directions suggested massaging the pan with a little vegetable oil before cooking, but it didn’t do a thing; eggs, pancakes, fish and even the flour stuck.</p>
<p>It took somewhat more effort to clean the Tramontina, and the pretty-but-unprotected satin exterior finish on the bottom of the pan began to discolor during our test period. The Tramontina is reasonably priced, but its performance did nothing to win us over.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Competition is fierce for luring consumers to purchase pans that are purportedly “100-percent” or “totally” nonstick. We discovered from our testing, however, that many nonstick pans simply don’t work, unless you slather them with butter and oil, which completely defeats their purpose.</p>
<p>The best nonstick pan has a smooth, flat surface, a long handle either made from stainless steel or encased in silicone and even distribution of heat across the entire pan. The best nonstick pan, by far, is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001B1CJME/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon Advanced</a>.</p>
<p>In every test, everything we cooked on the Anolon Advanced was easily released by a simple shake of the pan, thanks to its high-quality nonstick coating. It has superb heat distribution to cook food evenly and quickly. The Anolon Advanced is dishwasher-safe, but it wipes clean in seconds with a paper towel or damp sponge, so there’s no need to risk damaging the pan’s nonstick coating in the dishwasher.</p>
<p>The best nonstick pan set is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003IKMR96/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; Chef’s Classic</a>, which includes a 9-inch skillet and an 11-inch skillet. The pans have a beautiful mirror finish and look like chef’s pans you might see in a fancy restaurant. The Cuisinart pans were also perfectly nonstick and easy to clean. They’re very reasonably priced — we’d even say budget-priced — for such high-quality pans.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>As home cooks, we have some general options about electric deep fryers we can use. We wanted to focus on countertop models, meant to be used inside your kitchen. There are many larger, gas-powered deep fryers available which are meant to be used only outside. We only tested one just to give some context, but it was not the focus of our test.</p>
<p>Even when sticking to indoor kitchen counter-sized models, the machine size and oil capacities varied a lot. We found fryers that ranged between four and 16 cups of oil capacity so we wanted to test the whole range of that.</p>
<p>Since most recipes call for deep frying around 350-375°F, we preferred a fryer with adjustable temperature settings and a built-in thermostat.</p>
<p>Since there aren&#8217;t many other folks who have put multiple deep fryers to the test, we relied heavily on Amazon reviews to determine which to test. We scoured hundreds of individual reviews to discover what features were important to home cooks, and what made good or bad units.</p>
<p>Many brands produced multiple deep fryer models, so we avoided doubling up unless it had some unique features warranting testing (like the two Presto units we tested). Luckily, there were many models to choose from and we avoided anything with an average rating less than four stars, or units with an abnormally high proportion of one and two-star reviews.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re health-conscious and want an alternative to frying your food in quarts of oil, you might consider looking into an air fryer. Although you&#8217;re sacrificing a bit of the taste and crunchy texture that deep fryers produce, an air fryer gives almost the same results but with nearly no fat absorbed by the food. If you&#8217;re interested in exploring air fryers, take a look of our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-air-fryers/">review of the best air fryer</a>.</p>

<p>Before we began testing home fryers, we wanted to research the fryers that had specific, easy-to-use features.</p>
<p><strong>Thermostat:</strong> Since it can be unsafe to continually test the temperature of the oil while it’s heating or cooking, we liked fryers that had reliable and accurate thermostats.</p>
<p><strong>Oil drainage:</strong> Many fryers are designed to hold up to 16 cups of oil (excluding the propane-fueled Bayou Classic Fryer, which holds a whopping four gallons of oil), so we preferred fryers with oil filtration and drainage.</p>
<p><strong>Basket size:</strong> Depending on how many people you’re cooking for, you’ll want a fryer that can hold a sizable portion of food so you don’t have to keep frying in batches.</p>
<p><strong>Odor filter:</strong> Frying is notorious for leaving that fast-food smell in the house, so fryers with sufficient venting and odor filtration were a plus.</p>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> All of the fryers we tested had magnetic breakaway plugs, but some were sturdier than others. The plug is designed to quickly shut of the unit in case of a flare up.</p>
<p><strong>Splatter guard:</strong> All of the fryers we tested, except for one (the Presto Fry Daddy), had sufficient protection from oil splattering when food is added.</p>
<p><strong>Ease of cleaning:</strong> There are two components : 1) is the fryer dishwasher safe? and 2) can the oil be stored in the fryer so manual filtration into a suitable container isn’t necessary?</p>
<p><strong>Design:</strong> Could the fryer be stored in a cabinet or pantry or is it too large and must “live” on a countertop? Because of its size, would you use the fryer occasionally or frequently?</p>

<p>The type of oil used for frying is another key element to achieving perfect and crispy fried foods. Many restaurants use canola or vegetable oil and don’t change the oil frequently, which results in strong odors and lingering tastes of food previously fried in the oil. After a heavy volume of frying&#8211;especially if food particles aren’t strained&#8211;the oil degrades, foams and turns rancid.</p>
<p>Different oils have varying smoke points&#8211;the temperature at which the oil begins to smoke and burn. For example, butter has a low smoke point (350°F); the fats in butter cook off rapidly and easily burn, as anyone who’s left a saute pan on the stove top a little too long knows. Clarified butter or ghee, is an exception. The clarification removes the butter’s fats, resulting in a pure fat with a high smoke point of 450°F.</p>
<p>For frying, you will also want to choose an oil that is neutral tasting so it doesn’t affect the natural flavors of the foods you’re frying.</p>
<p>Olive oil (not extra virgin) is fine for deep-frying thanks to its relatively high smoke point of 420°F, but it does impart its taste into food.</p>
<p>Both canola and vegetable oil have a high smoke point of 400°F and are good for small batches of frying. However, they are lower-quality oils and can turn rancid sooner than other oils.</p>
<p>Peanut oil is generally praised as the best oil for deep frying with its smoke point of 450°F, and in our preliminary test runs of the fryers, we agree that peanut oil is excellent. It also imparts flavor into food, most noticeably French fries, which many people like.</p>
<p>The alternative we settled on was grape seed oil. It has a smoke point of 390°F (none of the fryers we were testing heated above 375°F) and is completely neutral in taste. Grape seed oil is also not as costly as peanut oil and can be purchased in two-liter (a little more than eight cups) jugs.</p>
<h3>The best temperature for deep frying</h3>
<p>Keeping the oil at the proper temperature is a crucial element to deep frying. As noted earlier, a consistent higher temperature results in the rapid dehydration of the food, thus creating a crispy exterior, soft and juicy interior and minimal absorption of oil. For most recipes, it’s best to fry foods at an oil temperature ranging between 350°F to 375°F.</p>

<p>Just as important is how quickly the oil reheats to the desired temperature after the food has been added to the oil. If the oil does not reheat rapidly, it will take longer for the protective crust to form on the food and increase the amount of oil absorbed.</p>
<p>Most of the deep fryers we tested had internal thermostats that regulated the heating coil to maintain the oil’s temperature. However, we did find that in almost all cases, we could not rely solely on the fryer’s thermostat. It proved to be more accurate to continually test the oil’s temperature manually with either a candy/deep-fryer thermometer or an instant-read thermometer before and after food was added to the oil.</p>

<p>Oil can be re-used several times for deep frying. However, certain steps need to be taken after each use. Of all the fryers we tested, only the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NQ7QFGM/?tag=ybdfryr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">T-Fal Ultimate EZ Clean</a> has a filtration device built in. All of the other deep fryers required the oil to be filtered and properly stored for later use.</p>
<p>Take the following steps to re-use your deep fryer’s oil:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not cover the fryer’s oil pot or receptacle, and let it completely cool, which may take three to four hours.</li>
<li>When the oil is cool, if you have a fine-mesh strainer, gently skim the surface of the oil and pick up any floating food particles; for example, bread crumbs or bits of batter.</li>
<li>If you don’t have a strainer, then line a one- or two-cup funnel with a double thickness of cheesecloth, and insert the funnel into the top of a resealable bottle. (If you’ve already strained the oil with the fine-mesh strainer, it’s a good idea to further filter the oil with this step).</li>
<li>Slowly pour the oil through the cheesecloth into the bottle. Remove the funnel, discard the cheesecloth and seal the bottle.</li>
<li>If you have a small amount of oil and food particles in the bottom of the pot or receptacle, wipe it up with paper towels and discard.</li>
<li>Store the oil at room temperature in a cool, dark area.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re just using the fryer for French fries, the oil could probably be used six to eight times; four to six times if you’re frying chicken or fish. If the oil smells or starts to bubble when reheating then it’s turned rancid and needs to be discarded.</p>
<p>Never pour used oil down the drain. Animal fats, like lard, quickly harden in home drain pipes and cause blockages. All other oils combine with organic and inorganic matter in sewers and form into hard lumps that result in sewage overflows.</p>
<p>Return the used oil to its sealable container and discard. If it’s a large amount of oil, then dispose of it at an oil recycling center. Use <a href="http://search.earth911.com/?what=Cooking+Oil&amp;where=10007&amp;list_filter=all&amp;max_distance=25&amp;family_id=&amp;latitude=&amp;longitude=&amp;country=&amp;province=&amp;city=">this site</a> to find a recycling center near you.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Oil-to-food ratio</h3>
<p>Since the deep fryers we tested had varying capacities for oil and food, before testing we needed to calculate a ratio of how much oil to food would be equitable across the board for all of the fryers. For example, the Fry Daddy has only a four-cup maximum oil capacity, while the Hamilton Beach Deep Fryer and Cuisinart CDF-200 both have 16-cup maximum oil capacity.</p>
<p>Our test food was frozen French fries, fresh French fries, raw chicken wings and battered chicken tenders. Although the Fry Daddy manual claims to have a four-cup maximum food capacity, the amount of food that actually fit into its oil pot and could be submerged in oil was substantially less: Four ounces of frozen or fresh French fries, 10 ounces of raw chicken wings and eight ounces of chicken tenders.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart has a maximum oil capacity of 16 cups, so using the Fry Daddy’s food-to-oil ratio as the base, we calculated 16 ounces of French fries (a one-to-one food-to-oil ratio), 40 ounces of chicken wings (five-to-two food-to-oil ratio) and 32 ounces of chicken tenders (two-to-one food-to-oil ratio).</p>
<p>In another example, for the DeLonghi Roto Deep Fryer, which has a five cup maximum oil capacity, we tested five cups of French fries (1:1), 12-1/2 ounces of chicken wings (5:2), 10 ounces of chicken tenders (2:1).</p>

<p>The first test was the amount of time it took for the oil to initially heat to 360°F and then how long the unit heated the oil to the optimal temperature of 375°F.</p>
<p>Since heat recovery after food is added is a key element to deep frying, we then tested how long it took the oil to reheat to 360°F and 375°F after each of our test food was added.</p>
<p>The deep fryers that reached the initial heating temperatures of 360°F and 375°F were the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCECNM2/?tag=ybdfryr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart CDF-200</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005KB37?tag=ybdfryr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Presto Fry Daddy</a> and the propane-fueled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000TMHSZ4/?tag=ybdfryr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bayou Classic</a>. Only the Cuisinart and the Bayou Classic were able to reheat the oil to 375°F after food was added.</p>

<li>Raw chicken wings</li>
<li>Raw chicken tenders</li>
</ul>
<p>The chicken tenders were dredged in flour, then dipped in an egg-milk wash, and finished with Panko bread crumbs.<br />
The frozen French fries, raw chicken wings and battered chicken tenders were lowered into the heated oil per each fryer’s instruction manual.</p>
<p>We began timing the instant the food was submerged in oil. In most cases, cooking times were either considerably longer or shorter than the times recommended in the instruction manuals.</p>

<p>For the fresh French fries, we used the double-fry method. The raw fries were initially partially cooked in oil at 340°F. The fries were then drained and allowed to rest for at least 20 minutes. We then adjusted the thermostat so the oil would heat to 375°F and fried the partially cooked fries a second time until crisp and golden brown.</p>
<p>All of the cooked food was drained, seasoned lightly with sea salt and tasted, and results were based on color, external (crispy) and internal (juicy or soft) texture, greasiness and flavor.</p>
<h3>Other test factors</h3>
<p><strong>Basket and handle:</strong> How easy was it to insert into the oil pot? This proved to be an important test. Several fryers’ instruction manuals advised placing the food into the basket and then lowering it into the oil. With the Hamilton Beach Electric Deep Fryer, proper insertion of the baskets and their handles was awkward, and the baskets fell into the oil causing a dangerous splatter.</p>
<p><strong>Thermostat:</strong> How accurate was it? Every fryer (excluding the Fry Daddy, which does not have a thermostat) failed this test. Throughout the testing, we continually checked oil temperature with both a candy/deep-fryer thermometer and an instant-read thermometer, and none of the thermostats accurately set and maintained the temperatures required for deep frying.</p>
<p><strong>Wattage:</strong> Was it powerful enough to heat the oil? Wattage ranged from 1200 watts (Fry Daddy) to 1800 watts (Cuisinart and Hamilton Beach). The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005KB37?tag=ybdfryr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fry Daddy’s</a> lower wattage worked well for its compact size. The Cuisinart and Hamilton Beach are approximately the same size, and although the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCECNM2/?tag=ybdfryr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart</a> performed best, the Hamilton Beach’s rather shoddy construction could be the reason why it struggled to reach and maintain a temperature higher than 355°F.</p>
<p><strong>Convenience:</strong> Was the fryer easy to use and clean? All of the fryers were quite easy to put together and use right out of the box. Cleaning up, however, was a different issue. Except for the Fry Daddy, all of the fryer’s had some parts that were dishwasher safe and other parts that could only be cleaned manually.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Cuisinart CDF &#8211; 200</h2>
[masterslider id=&#8221;14&#8243;]
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCECNM2/?tag=ybdfryr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; CDF-200</a> is by far the best of the deep fryers we tested. It’s a well-constructed unit and was the only fryer that actually reached the optimal 375°F (in fact, it actually reached 383°F). Although its reheat time was slow, it did maintain a sufficient temperature to cook all the test foods evenly and without oily residue.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart has a sleek, brushed stainless steel casing and comes with a basket that easily held two-and-a-half pounds of chicken wings and two pounds of chicken tenders. The basket’s retractable handle makes it easy to store within the unit when not in use.</p>

The thermostat can be slightly delayed or inaccurate, so use a separate one if you're sticklers like us.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCECNM2/?tag=ybdfryr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The fryer has a stand-alone, built-in timer that does not control the power of the fryer, and its thermostat is more accurate than most.</p>
<p>Its initial heat time to 360°F was relatively fast at 11-1/2 minutes, and heating to 375°F took less than two minutes. When food was lowered into the oil, the heat of the oil dropped, and although the oil reheated to only 348°F maximum, the temperature was high enough for excellent results.</p>
<p>Chicken and fries were all dark golden with crispy exteriors and soft or juicy interiors. Best of all, none of the food was greasy and was restaurant-quality.</p>
<p>On the negative side, the thermostat fluctuates a bit. For example, the thermostat didn’t register that the oil had reached 375°F until it was actually 383°F. On another test, we lowered the thermostat to 340°F, but it didn’t register that the oil had hit 340°F until it was actually 350°F. Since built-in fryer thermometers tended to be inaccurate, we recommend you periodically test the oil with a candy/deep-fryer thermometer or an <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-digital-meat-thermometer/">instant-read thermometer</a>.</p>
<p>As with all of the fryers we tested that had a viewing window, due to the splatter of oil and steam during the cooking process, the window is virtually useless. We found it much easier to gauge how the food was cooking by removing the lid after a couple of minutes when the food’s external moisture was mostly released.</p>
<p>Since all of the electric deep fryers had issues with maintaining the oil temperature, we tested whether keeping the lid on affected the temperature, and we found there was no difference with the lid on or off.</p>
<p>During our research, we spoke with Waring on the phone. They let us that they&#8217;ve recently discontinued manufacturing home deep fryers and is transferring all models to Cuisinart. The Cuisinart CDF-200 was formerly manufactured by Waring (model DF250B) and Waring deep fryers are available for purchase at the time of this writing, but only while current stock lasts.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Cuisinart &#8211; CDF-200 is a sleek, attractive unit that is well-constructed and can be stored either in a cabinet or on the countertop.</li>
<li>It has a large frying basket that can accommodate two-and-a-half pounds of food.</li>
<li>Its retractable basket handle makes storage easier.</li>
<li>Its high wattage (1800 watts) helps heat and reheat oil quickly.</li>
<li>Restaurant-quality results with food crispy and not greasy at all.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NQ7QFGM/?tag=ybdfryr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">T-Fal &#8211; FR8000</a> is one of the highest customer rated electric deep fryers on Amazon. There is certainly a lot to love with this deep fryer. First of all, it is by far the easiest to clean of all the fryers we tested. The T-Fal deep fryer is unique for its ingenious, patented internal oil filtration and storage system, which truly does make cleaning up the “ultimate EZ clean”.</p>
<p>Once you’ve finished frying and allowed the oil to cool down (for approximately three hours), you turn a knob on the front of the fryer, which begins the filtration process. (If you wish to fry again later, simply leave the knob in the “frying” position.) The oil begins to drain through a small mesh basket into a plastic container beneath the oil box. This container can then be removed and refrigerated for future use. Some online reviews cite leakage from the corners of the plastic storage box, but we did not have this issue.</p>

<p>There is some confusion in the instruction manual about when you may begin the filtration process after frying. We called T-Fal and confirmed that the oil should indeed be cooled before switching the knob to the drain position.</p>
<p>One of the small but appreciated touches of the fryer’s design is the unique rubber grips in the slots for the handle. Once you’ve lowered the food into the oil, the handle slips firmly into place, unlike all the other fryers in which the handle is not secure.</p>
<p>The entire deep fryer is designed to make clean up extremely easy. Everything &#8212; excluding the heating coil &#8212; is dishwasher safe. All the food that we cooked in the T-Fal was visually and texturally appealing. It was also somewhat greasy, but not a huge deal. Its inability to reheat the oil to the optimal frying temperature once food was added contributed to our rating the T-Fal as the runner-up, but overall it is still a great pick.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The T-Fal &#8211; FR8000’s patented automatic oil filtration system and storage system makes clean-up easy and convenient.</li>

<h2 id="best-for-enthusiasts">Best for serious enthusiasts: Bayou &#8211; Classic</h2>
[masterslider id=&#8221;26&#8243;]
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000TMHSZ4/?tag=ybdfryr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bayou &#8211; Classic</a> is one of the highest rated fryers on Amazon and with good reason. It stands apart from the other fryers we tested, primarily because it is much larger and it&#8217;s propane-fueled. The propane allows you to control the oil’s temperature better and maintain the high temperatures needed for perfectly fried food.</p>
<p>However, since it is propane-fueled, the Bayou Classic is an outdoors-only fryer and must be constantly monitored while the oil is heating and during the frying. This isn’t a set-it-and-forget-it type of fryer, but if you’re a serious enthusiast who needs to fry large volumes of food, the Bayou Classic is definitely the one you should consider purchasing.</p>
<p>The Bayou Classic is well-constructed from stainless steel, and although it took us about an hour to put the fryer together, it wasn’t difficult. In fact, the instruction manual is one of the most detailed we’ve seen, but it’s also packed with warnings about temperature control and required tests for the propane connector and jet burner.</p>
<p>The Bayou &#8211; Classic comes in three sizes: two and a half gallons, four gallons and nine gallons. We tested the 4-gallon, Model #700-701. Once everything was hooked up, we poured in the oil and turned on the propane at a medium level. The oil heated up to 340°F in 22 minutes. This may seem like a long time, but the manual is very specific about heating the oil slowly.</p>

Cleanup is more difficult, but for large quantity frying nothing else came close.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000TMHSZ4/?tag=ybdfryr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>An internal thermometer, which needs to be installed, works reasonably well, although we did find it had a variance of five-to-ten degrees from the temperatures we continually took with the candy/deep-fryer thermometer and the instant-read thermometer.</p>
<p>For all of the food tests, the oil temperature dropped at most 15 degrees, but it rapidly regained heat in a little over four minutes, which is much faster than any of the electric fryers we tested. The gas regulator enables you to control the oil temperature, and the thermometer has a warning to turn off the gas when it hits 400°F, which is, in fact, too high for deep frying.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Bayou Classic’s ability to maintain 375°F, the all fries and chicken wings cooked perfectly: golden, crunchy and not the slightest bit oily. The only test that was less successful was the chicken tenders. Although they cooked in a remarkable one minute and 18 seconds, the interiors were slightly underdone.</p>
<p>The Bayou Classic comes equipped with a rather cumbersome drain hose for draining and recycling the oil, which still needs to be filtered and funneled into a suitable storage container. Also, the Bayou Classic is somewhat difficult to clean due to its size. These are minor quibbles on a generally superior product. The Bayou Classic is a great choice for someone who needs to fry large quantities of food and has the extra yard space to store this unit.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Bayou &#8211; Classic has a sturdy stainless steel construction, which retains the propane-fueled heat and maintains oil temperature.</li>
<li>Considering its four-gallon capacity, the fryer heats up to optimal frying temperatures in a relatively quick time.</li>
<li>Excellent for frying large quantities and different types of food at the same time.</li>
<li>Restaurant-quality baskets and reasonably accurate internal thermometer are included.</li>
<li>Good price for the overall quality of the fryer</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>DeLonghi Roto Deep Fryer</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003ZDNKVA/?tag=ybdfryr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DeLonghi Roto Deep Fryer</a> is an interesting concept. The fryer only requires five cups of oil, and the basket, once inserted, tilts downward and revolves, presumably so that the food fries evenly. Unfortunately, despite its stylish design (it was the most aesthetically pleasing of all the fryers), we needed to constantly turn the food to ensure uniform cooking. Even with 1500 watts, the unit simply did not get hot enough, which resulted in soggy and oil-laden chicken and fries.</p>
<p>In keeping with its thoughtful physical design, the DeLonghi is equipped with a built-in oil drainage pipe. It doesn’t have an internal filtration device, but the pipe allows you to easily drain the cooled oil through a lined filter into a storage container.</p>
<h3><strong>Hamilton Beach Electric Deep Fryer</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M39ML76/?tag=ybdfryr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach Electric Deep Fryer (35034)</a> comes with three baskets; one large and two small, which enables you to fry two types of food simultaneously, for example, fries and onion rings. However, the food capacity in the small baskets does not come close to suggestions in the instruction manual. We fried one pound of fresh and frozen fries, dividing them into equal portions into the small baskets. The manual suggests 18 ounces per basket; however, the Hamilton Beach struggled to cook eight ounces in each basket and the fries emerged crispy but oily.</p>
<p>The fryer’s construction also appears rather shoddy. The thin aluminum casing buckles easily when the enameled oil pot is inserted into it. The thermostat fluctuates continually, registering 375°F when in actuality the oil has only reached 355°F (in 19 minutes). We can conjecture that the reason this fryer is unable to heat up and maintain optimal heat is because of its flimsy outer casing.</p>
<p>Lastly, the lid captures so much steam during the frying process that it’s a bit dangerous to lift the lid off since the steam drips into the oil and causes spattering.</p>
<h3><strong>Presto Cool Daddy</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00066XRO4/?tag=ybdfryr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Presto Cool Daddy Cool Touch Deep Fryer</a> has a nice ergonomic design. It’s compact and easy to clean, although it is not dishwasher safe. The fryer is also not actually “cool touch”; it heats up quite a lot, but you could still touch it – to move it, for example – without burning yourself.</p>
<p>Despite this cool-touch feature, results were mixed. To begin, the oil never reached the optimal temperature and hovered between 310°F and 340°F. Heating and reheating times were 15 to 20 minutes longer than other competitors.</p>
<p>Chicken and fries were pale to golden brown with crispy exteriors, but because of the unit’s inability to reheat to the optimal temperature, all of the food was greasy.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you’re already familiar with deep-frying then you know that the usual method can be a messy business. While electric fryers can be the solution to all of the clean-up, our testing revealed mixed results in performance.</p>
<p>The most important thing to consider when purchasing an electric deep fryer is whether the unit attains and maintains the heat necessary to fry food so that it’s tasty and relatively healthy. The general rule is the hotter the oil, the less oil the food will absorb.</p>
<p>Only two of the fryers we tested were able to reach the optimal 375°F for deep frying: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCECNM2/?tag=ybdfryr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart CDF-200</a> and the propane-fueled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000TMHSZ4/?tag=ybdfryr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bayou Classic</a>.</p>
<p>None of the fryers we tested had thermostats that correctly registered the oil’s actual temperature, making it necessary to have an instant-read thermometer or a candy/deep-fryer thermometer at hand to occasionally test the oil. If you enjoy a weekly fish fry or fried chicken dinner or crispy fries to go with a burger or steak, then we highly recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCECNM2/?tag=ybdfryr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart CDF-200</a>.</p>
<p>The thermostat problem was the only negative we found with the Cuisinart CDF-200. All of the food we cooked in the Cuisinart was delicious with perfect crispy texture and no greasy residue. Although the oil does need to be filtered and drained into a receptacle, the unit is very easy to clean and, excluding the heating element, is dishwasher safe.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We spent more than 35 hours testing air fryers and cooking recipes to determine that the Black+Decker Purify Air Fryer is the best option for most people.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e threw everything we could think of at the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DIQ817G/?tag=ybdafry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; Purifry Air Fryer</a> in the hopes of tripping it up. From elegant baked chocolate cakes to rugged fish and big chicken drumsticks to breakfast dishes, this powerhouse nimbly came out a clear winner in our mission to discover the best air fryer. With more than 35 hours of research and testing, and several recipes cooked and eaten, we chose the Black+Decker over a crowded field of competitors, thanks in large part to its consistent performance and sleek looks.</p>
<p>Since we last reviewed air fryers, one of the models we tested — <span style="font-weight: 400;">Le Coucou</span> — has been discontinued and two models — <span style="font-weight: 400;">Philips &#8211; HD9220</span> and <span style="font-weight: 400;">GoWISE &#8211; GW22621</span> — were updated. We tested both new models, and the new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GoWISE-USA-3-7-Quart-Digital-Touchscreen/dp/B07FYWLZJM/?tag=ybdafry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GoWISE &#8211; GW22826</a> outperformed the new <span style="font-weight: 400;">Phillips &#8211; HD9641/99</span> and is our new runner-up.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-chose">How we chose the finalists</h2>
<p>We scoured dozens of threads, reviews, comparisons and Amazon listings to try and put together a fair fight based on main feature sets and consumer preferences. We put together a test group of comparable sizes, functionality and aesthetic characteristics. While we don’t use price as a primary factor, all of our leading contenders are in a competitive pricing market. That means that we do consider how a product might be a great value, based on its price and performance.</p>
<p>There is minimal differentiation in the market as far as the core technology behind the air fryer. What is impressive with air fryers, in general, is the across-the-board high ratings for these products. Consumers love them and it’s clear that they’re making a major impact in the lives of those who have become early adopters.</p>
<p>The more we explored the market, the more we realized just how similar many of these products there are. It is obvious that there are a number of products that are being produced in the same factories and are being either slightly altered and rebranded or just simply renamed for different manufacturers. For example, if you compare the displays of the Power Air Fryer XL and the 4th Generation GoWISE touchscreen model, they appear to be identical.</p>
<p>While a select few products break the barrier of $300 per unit, the majority of the market is priced between $100-150. We chose a range of manufacturers within that very affordable price point and made sure all were well-reviewed and being used in many kitchens.</p>
<p>We also wanted to see if a budget air fryer like the Le Coucou &#8211; Harmony could go toe-to-toe with a more expensive unit such as the Philips &#8211; HD9220. What do you get for the extra money?</p>
<p>Many of the more expensive models are simply upgrades in size and capacity. A select few also include more advanced presets or more complicated interfaces. We found that a simple two-knob control (temperature and time) was more than sufficient to operate the machines.</p>
<p>We are also concerned about the longevity of products with complicated internal electronics. Products with digital screens may be more prone to difficult repairs. Only our winning best air fryer, the Black+Decker &#8211; Purifry, offers a two-year warranty.</p>
<p>The five devices we tested were all roughly the same capacity, easily feeding two people. Larger families or frequent entertainers may want to consider a larger model than the ones we tested, but the rapid cook times for most recipes means most families can probably stick to one of our five finalists.</p>
<h3>Updated products</h3>
<p>When we learned that Le Coucou had been discontinued, we decided we should check the manufacturer websites for the air fryers we previously reviewed to see whether any of them had been updated or discontinued. Only the GoWISE and the Phillips have been updated, both of which are digital, so we ran them through the same tests as we did their earlier models. We also researched the newer air fryers on the market and determined that most were exactly the same as the models we already tested and thus didn’t warrant testing.</p>

<h2>Standard features</h2>
<h3><strong>Timer</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4731" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/philips-timer-knob.jpg" alt="philips timer knob" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/philips-timer-knob.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/philips-timer-knob-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/philips-timer-knob-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/philips-timer-knob-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/philips-timer-knob-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/philips-timer-knob-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/philips-timer-knob-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/philips-timer-knob-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/philips-timer-knob-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
Every model we tested features a physical or digital timer that automatically turns the device off after a certain amount of time. This is both a cooking function and a safety feature. Two of the five devices tested had timers up to 60 minutes, while the other three offered a maximum cook time of 30 minutes. We found that very few recipes require more than 30 minutes of continuous cooking without needing a visual check, rotation or shaking.</p>
<p>What is more important is the articulation in the timer and the ability to set a more precise cooking time. Some timers have notches that indicate every minute, while some only indicate every five minutes. We found that timers with a digital setting or individual minute indications were the easiest to work with.</p>
<h3><strong>Temperature gauge</strong></h3>

On the other end of the spectrum, the Black+Decker model we reviewed had temperature indications in jumps of 70°F, somewhat limiting one’s sense of confidence as to the accuracy of the device.</p>
<p><strong>Easy cleaning with non-stick coating</strong><br />
Every product we tested featured some level of non-stick coating in its product. It is extremely useful for the majority of the cooking surfaces to be non-stick to support the easy transfer of food from cooking to plating.</p>
<p><strong>Non-stick coating also greatly improves the cleaning experience</strong>, allowing a quick wipe down or rinsing in between cooking more complex recipes. The only device we tested with limited non-stick application was the Philips model, which featured a metal grate in its tray and was more frustrating to use and clean without using a dishwasher.</p>
<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs an air fryer</h2>
<p>There’s no doubt that our kitchen countertops are getting crowded. With coffee makers, microwaves, toasters and convection ovens making their way into our lives, kitchen real estate is at a premium. In order to secure a coveted spot, any new device must earn its keep.</p>
<p>There are many cooks that will love these devices. Whether you’re trying to watch your weight or find a few extra minutes in your busy life (aren’t we all?), there’s a use for you.</p>
<h3>For health-conscious eaters</h3>
<p>Manufacturers of air fryers rightfully market them as a healthy alternative to frying. Outright, they’re just a healthy way to cook. The mechanics of the machine allow you to cook with little to no oil and still create delicious, tender and appetizing cuisine. It will have you cooking leaner meats, healthy vegetables and fresh food in an easy-to-operate platform.</p>
<p>Because there’s a certain novelty to using an air fryer, you will find yourself trying new dishes with healthier and fresher ingredients. You’ll get great results by doing something as simple as throwing some broccoli, asparagus or mushrooms in with a dash of seasoning and a spritz of oil.</p>
<h3>For busy families</h3>
<p>Air fryers cook fast. Really fast. They get up to temperatures of 400°F in less than five minutes and the air circulation helps you create meals quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>When it comes to packaged or frozen foods, the air fryer manufacturers recommend cooking 70°F less and halving the cooking time. For example, for a serving of chicken nuggets that might recommend cooking at 375° for 20 minutes, you would cook it in your air fryer at 300° for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Air fryers aren’t just faster with these popular meals, they also do a great job preparing them to their best possible quality. We found packaged foods like corn dogs, frozen vegetables and burritos came out crispy, even and really good. And leftovers? Without a doubt, you’ll be asking for doggie bags and to-go containers.</p>
<p>They don’t just quickly handle these popular meals well, they also clean up in a cinch. The main components are easily wiped down or thrown into the dishwasher.</p>
<h3>For people with small kitchens and budgets</h3>
<p>In a small kitchen, bachelor pad, dorm room or RV, we see these products being an irreplaceable addition to daily life. Incredibly, we foresee these appliances as able to replace kitchen stalwarts such as small convection ovens, toasters and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-toaster-oven/" rel="noopener">toaster ovens</a>.</p>
<p>Air fryers don’t use microwave technology, so you can say goodbye to “nuking” your food. They use a more straightforward heating method: an electric burner and cycling air. And at a very fair price point, they also make great gifts.</p>
<h2 id="what-is">The core elements of an air fryer</h2>
<p>Though the patent was <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US4817509" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originally filed in 1989</a>, the air fryer has mostly remained under the radar as a core kitchen appliance in the US until recently. So what do home cooks around the world know that we don’t?<span id="more-4717"></span></p>
<p>It seems that every air fryer on the market still uses the same core technology as described in the patent 30 years ago. There are three main components to an air fryer:</p>
<h3><strong>Heat source</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4733" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bd-heating-element.jpg" alt="black and decker heating element" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bd-heating-element.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bd-heating-element-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bd-heating-element-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bd-heating-element-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bd-heating-element-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bd-heating-element-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bd-heating-element-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bd-heating-element-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bd-heating-element-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
The main heat source is an electric-powered coil, similar to one you may see on an electric stove. Among the products we tested, a similar coil was used. This is the main engine of the product and you see manufacturers of air fryers using similar technology in other home kitchen appliances such as <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-electric-kettle/" rel="noopener">electric kettles</a>, crock pots, sous vides and panini makers.</p>
<p>Because of the wide variety of products many of these manufacturers create, this method of heat transfer is a reliable and long-tested technology.</p>
<h3><strong>Airflow</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4734" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/philips-air-vent.jpg" alt="philips air vent" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/philips-air-vent.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/philips-air-vent-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/philips-air-vent-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/philips-air-vent-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/philips-air-vent-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/philips-air-vent-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/philips-air-vent-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/philips-air-vent-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/philips-air-vent-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
The heat from the coil is circulated by a convection system; a fan moving the hot air around the coil around your food. This creates a cooking system that is even and steady, with some extra heat for food directly under the coil. The ability to cook oil-free or with extremely limited oil is due to the airflow pattern in the air fryer. Oil circulates in miniscule proportions and drippings from the food drop to the bottom of the bin and off the tray.</p>
<p>There are some differentiating factors between the various models as to how they handle the air flow, but they’re mostly aesthetic or small degrees of differences. For example, we didn’t detect much differentiation between the Philips’ Starfish technology and other products which had a more standardized base.</p>
<h3><strong>Fryer basket</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4735" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gowise-large-basket.jpg" alt="gowise large basket" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gowise-large-basket.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gowise-large-basket-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gowise-large-basket-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gowise-large-basket-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gowise-large-basket-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gowise-large-basket-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gowise-large-basket-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gowise-large-basket-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gowise-large-basket-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
To hold the food while cooking, each product features a two-part basket that sits under the coil during cooking operation. A larger basket contains a smaller metal tray usually coated with a non-stick material for easy removal and cleaning. These baskets have some slight differences in design but are relatively uniform as far as features go. Some may have an additional safety mechanism or a different grate pattern.</p>
<h3>Cooking styles</h3>
<p>With these three core components, you are able to execute a cooking style that impressively blends a number of techniques into one machine. The manufacturers claim that their air fryers can grill, roast, fry, steam, broil and even bake.</p>
<p>From our testing, it seems that it can do all of these styles in some way or another. We found that cooking with an air fryer was closest to baking or roasting with the added benefit of creating a great, crispy outer layer on anything we threw in it.</p>
<p>The best news is that cooking with an air fryer is simple, easy and relatively foolproof as long as you keep an eye on your food. This isn’t a crockpot and it isn’t completely forgiving of unattended, slow cooking. But it is a great way to get over your fear of the kitchen. Preparations are simple; set the timer and enjoy your meal.</p>
<p>When using an air fryer, we highly recommend using a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-digital-meat-thermometer/" rel="noopener">meat thermometer</a> to make sure that your meal is fully cooked. The air fryer is great at making food that looks appetizing and fully done because of that even browning and crisping around your food. Visual cues are less useful when air frying, based on what you might be used to seeing.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, air fryers aren’t graceful, delicate cooking solutions. A fine chef might be embarrassed to use one in their restaurant and it lacks the excitement, aroma and flare of cooking over an open fire. But they are a serious addition to the lives of busy families looking to cook fresh or packaged foods on a regular basis in an easy-to-clean device.</p>

<p>Many of the reviews we researched had just a single product reviewed at a time or did not maintain similar scenarios for each product. We tested and compared multiple categories: cooking, cleaning, build quality, functions, features and ease of use.</p>
<h3>Cooking</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4723" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/fries.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/fries.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/fries-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/fries-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/fries-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/fries-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/fries-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/fries-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/fries-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/fries-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We set up all five air fryers simultaneously and cooked identical recipes and quantities in each product. We chose six different recipes recommended by manufacturer-included recipe books or various food blogs dedicated to cooking with these devices.</p>
<p>We chose recipes that we felt would both represent a typical usage of the machine as well as challenge the abilities and nuances of the product. We wanted to test out the claims that these items could handle frying, baking and grilling styles.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4724" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/chicken.jpg" alt="fried chicken test" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/chicken.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/chicken-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/chicken-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/chicken-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/chicken-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/chicken-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/chicken-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/chicken-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/chicken-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We cooked <a href="http://www.hotairfrying.com/crispy-jalapeno-poppers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jalapeno poppers</a>, <a href="https://recipethis.com/air-fryer-fish-chips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">catfish</a>, <a href="https://recipethis.com/how-to-make-kfc-chicken-in-the-airfryer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fried chicken</a>, <a href="http://www.mommyenterprises.com/moms-blog/37345/philips-airfryer-fritatta-recipe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frittatas</a>, <a href="https://recipethis.com/how-to-make-the-best-ever-air-fryer-fries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">french fries</a> and <a href="http://www.meredithlaurence.com/recipes/chocolate-souffles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chocolate souflées</a>. The more we cooked, the clearer it became which product could hold up to daily use and earn a permanent spot on the countertops and hearts of consumers.</p>
<h3>Cleaning</h3>
<p>One of the most desirable aspects of owning an air fryer is how easy they are to clean. Because you cook everything in one closed area, your messes are contained and oil splattering stays within the closed basket.</p>
<p>We tested each air fryer’s clean up by hand by wiping down the exterior and interior. And of course we tested the dishwasher-safe components of each machine.</p>
<h3>Build quality, functions and features</h3>
<p>We turned knobs over and over. We slammed the baskets in and out. We mashed buttons. We plugged and we unplugged and we plugged again. Basically, we gently beat the machines up to simulate repeated use in a busy household where you depend on your appliances to hold up to the daily challenges of life.</p>
<h3>Ease of use</h3>
<p>Our testing group included both younger and older, male and female users. We wanted to make sure that the devices were intuitive, logical and mechanically designed to meet the needs of a wide range of home chefs.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Top Pick: Black+Decker Purifry</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4720 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bd-solo.jpg" alt="black and decker solo" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bd-solo.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bd-solo-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bd-solo-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bd-solo-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bd-solo-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bd-solo-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bd-solo-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bd-solo-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bd-solo-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We are excited to give our digital statuette to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DIQ817G/?tag=ybdafry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; Purifry</a>. The model number tested, the HF110SBD Two-Liter, was incredibly consistent across every measurable category. Among the most important factors, it handled every recipe we threw at it with grace, was easy to clean and produced among the best results for each dish.</p>
<p>Beyond the functionality of the features and the excellent build quality, we loved the hot food that came out. The jalapeno poppers were gooey, the catfish flaky and juicy, the chicken crunchy and evenly cooked. It’s the sort of product that makes you want to invite people over and cook for them.</p>
<h3>What we liked</h3>
<p>The Black+Decker was the best-performing cooking platforms we tested. The Purify model provided incredibly even cooking across every recipe we threw in it. This is perhaps helped by its slightly smaller power draw compared to some other models (1200W vs. 1400 or 1500W).</p>

The Purify's simple controls make it versatile and easy to use, plus it comes with a two-year warranty.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DIQ817G/?tag=ybdafry-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The fact that this was the only model that came with a two-year warranty is no small feat. In an era of throwaway appliances, Black+Decker is a brand synonymous with long-lasting, reliable power tools and it shows in this product. Its strong, well-built dials are resistant to getting knocked around. And with minimal electronics, it seems poised to last a long time.</p>
<p>The heavy-duty build quality is clearly shown in the basket and tray. During testing, we found that it would slide in and out smoothly every time. It has all of the safety features you would want in an air fryer and can frequently be found at a price point <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DIQ817G/?tag=ybdafry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">just below $100</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4740 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/black-decker-dials.jpg" alt="black and decker dials" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/black-decker-dials.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/black-decker-dials-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/black-decker-dials-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/black-decker-dials-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/black-decker-dials-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/black-decker-dials-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/black-decker-dials-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/black-decker-dials-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/black-decker-dials-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The fact that this product is carried at many big-box retailers is an indication that it has passed internal QA in the corporate world. It’s clear that if these were models that were getting returned a lot, they probably wouldn’t be available at the mass-market level for as long as they have.</p>
<p>It was also one of the better aesthetic presentations. The black and silver combination matches well with our winners for best single-cup coffee maker, electric kettle and waffle maker, as well as many other top kitchen appliances.</p>
<h3>What we didn’t like</h3>
<p>No product is perfect and we hope that we see some of these improvements in future iterations. For one thing, we found that the temperature gauge was only marked in 70° F increments. This means that you may need to guess a bit when it comes to cooking temperature. That said, air fryer cooking is relatively forgiving when it comes to heat levels.</p>
<p>There was some residue left on the machine from the tape used to hold the fryer bin to the body. A little elbow grease removed the residue and at least the product is being held together during transport.</p>
<p>The Black+Decker didn’t include an in-depth recipe guide like some of its competitors. You can easily find great recipes online, but it might be worth developing to help consumers get started with their new favorite kitchen friend.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are a limited number of accessories currently available for the Black+Decker air fryer. This could be easily resolved by releasing and possibly including them in the package. This would bring their offering to match what <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D7N43UA/?tag=ybdafry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips</a> is offering at the top-end, complete with an overall better device.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>

<h2 id="runnerup"><b>Runner-up: GoWISE &#8211; GW22826</b></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gowise-usa-solo.jpg" alt="gowise usa GW22826" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>The updated <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GoWISE-USA-3-7-Quart-Digital-Touchscreen/dp/B07FYWLZJM/?tag=ybdafry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GoWISE &#8211; GW22826</a> cleared up several of the problems we encountered when we tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0106RV5JG/?tag=ybdafry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GoWISE &#8211; GW22621</a> model. As before, we enjoyed the precision of setting a timer and temperature. It felt more like working with a high-end oven than the other products and it also allowed the use of presets.</p>
<p>Although we still maintain that the GoWISE’s complex electronics might break more easily than a manually controlled air fryer, we no longer had trouble with its tray, which previously reset cooking time and temperature when it was left open. The new GoWISE now automatically pauses the time and temperature when the tray is removed and resumes when the tray is re-inserted.</p>
<p>GoWISE has redesigned the fryer so the digital menu with pictograms of foods and adjustable time and temperature controls are on the flat top of the unit. (The earlier model had the digital controls on the face of the unit.) The pictograms represent the programmed settings for time and temperature for chicken, fish, fries and desserts, which we tested and found to be accurate.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0106RV5JG/?tag=ybdafry-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gowise-new-cta-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gowise-new-cta-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gowise-new-cta-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gowise-new-cta-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gowise-new-cta-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gowise-new-cta-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gowise-new-cta-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gowise-new-cta-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gowise-new-cta.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Runner-up: GoWise - GW22826</h3><p>This updated model resolves issues we had with the previous version. Its digital interface is now easier to use and lets you make consistently crispy chicken, fish and French fries without dealing with messy grease.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0106RV5JG/?tag=ybdafry-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The new GoWISE also did markedly better in the cooking tests and was comparable with the updated Phillips. Previously, the GoWISE was unable to achieve the same crunch in both the fish and chicken tests. This time, however, the updated model performed very well, giving us crunchy exteriors and tender, flaky interiors.</p>
<p>The French fries were also excellent, tasting of potato with almost no after-taste of oil, as we had with the new Phillips model. The jalapeno popper was also delicious with the chili perfectly cooked and the cheese melted and gooey. The souffle had a cupcake consistency, but it was still light and evenly baked.</p>
<p>The GoWISE’s only fail was the frittata. Its exterior was a rich golden brown but the interior was soupy. We tried cooking it three more times for a couple of minutes, but the inside never fully cooked and the exterior turned rubbery.</p>
<p>In our previous test, the GoWISE tied with the Phillips as runners up. However, with the substantial improvements to the new model, we recommend the <span style="font-weight: 400;">GoWISE  &#8211; GW22826</span> over the updated Phillips.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>GoWISE has redesigned its digital interface for easier and more accurate programming of time and temperature.</li>
<li>The improved cooking tray automatically pauses and resumes programming without interruption when removed and reinserted.</li>
<li>The new <span style="font-weight: 400;">GoWISE  &#8211; GW22826 </span>performed better in the food tests, giving us crispy chicken, fish and French fries.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-others">Other air fryers we tested</h2>
<h3>Avalon Bay &#8211; AB-Airfryer 100</h3>
<p>This lesser-known <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NU68QWA/?tag=ybdafry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Avalon Bay &#8211; AB-Airfryer 100</a> performed admirably well compared to the heavy hitters it was going toe-to-toe with. On the fried chicken test, it produced one of the most delicious results, with one reviewer commenting that it “tastes better than KFC.” We found the cooking to be even across all of the tested recipes. It was also the lightest product at 11 pounds, which makes it, pound-for-pound, the best cooking product we tested.</p>
<p>The product comes with more accessories for the money than any of its competitors. The baking dish was well-built and stylish. The equivalent accessory for the Philips is over $30 as a separate item. The Avalon Bay also comes with a delightful full-color recipe book to get you started immediately.</p>
<p>We found the build quality to be on par with our winner, the Black+Decker, and the GoWISE touch-screen model. It was slightly under-built compared to the Philips.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest differentiator between the other four products was its fake brushed grey plastic accents which put it a level below the actual shine on the Black+Decker and GoWISE. It also lacked a safety release on the fry basket, not a critical component but one place where they were able to save a bit in production costs.</p>
<h3>Philips &#8211; HD9641/99</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/philips-air-fryer.jpg" alt="philips hd9641-99" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>In our first testing, we liked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D7N43UA/?tag=ybdafry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips HD9220</a> very much and recommended it as a top pick for the adventurous chef. Soon thereafter, Phillips discontinued the HD9220 and replaced it with the <span style="font-weight: 400;">HD9230</span>. Philips has updated that digital model with a newer version, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-HD9641-99-Turbostar-Frustration/dp/B0779THNHD/?tag=ybdafry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; HD9641/99</a>, and we were not as impressed.</p>
<p>Design-wise, the new digital model doesn’t seem to be as sturdily built, and the HD9220’s retractable cord — a feature we loved — has now been eliminated. The fryer temperature can only be adjusted in 25-degree increments, so for a 360 ℉ you need to compromise between 350 ℉ and 375 ℉. Any cook would consider the inability to program an exact temperature as a big fail.</p>
<p>Unlike the new GoWISE, the digital Philips does not automatically shut the convection off when the tray is removed. Consequently, the timing needed to be adjusted when the food was repositioned for even cooking.</p>
<p>As before, the most difficult component with the Philips was the metal grate system at the bottom of the fry tray. Not only is the grate difficult to insert and remove, but food got caught in the grate’s mesh, making it a pain to clean.</p>
<p>The instruction manual is one of the most confusing we’ve ever seen in an appliance. Perhaps taking its cue from IKEA, everything is in pictograms and the few written instructions (in several languages) refer you to a pictogram, which you have to search for since the picture is not aligned with the text.</p>
<p>In our previous testing, the Philips cooked food faster than the other air fryers. Such was not the case with the digital model. Although we had almost comparable results, the Phillips took a few minutes longer to cook food than the GoWISE. However, that stated, all of the food we cooked in the Phillips was very good or excellent.</p>
<p>As we noted in our first review, Philips has a loyal following, and we expected that its redesigned digital model would be as good or better than the non-digital model. At nearly three times the price of our top pick, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DIQ817G/?tag=ybdafry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker Purify</a>, we don’t feel the new <span style="font-weight: 400;">Philips &#8211; HD9641/99</span> is worth it</p>
<h3>Le Coucou &#8211; Discontinued</h3>
<p>Since our review, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018E680AI/?tag=ybdafry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Le Coucou Harmony</a> was discontinued and is no longer available for purchase from the company. (Oddly, its accessories can be purchased from <a href="https://le-coucou.com/collections/all" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Le Coucou’s website</a>.)</p>
<p>We found that Le Coucou’s build quality, food quality and electronics were subpar compared to the rest of the group. Each dish that we cooked in the Le Coucou was either as good or worse than the rest of the products. We surmised that Le Coucou was likely built in the same factory as our winner, the Black+Decker, as they share many characteristics in design. But apparently, Le Coucou skimped in production, which resulted in a poor final product.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The air fryer is a marvelous device to handle a wide variety of needs and new experiments in your home kitchen. Adding an air fryer to your kitchen is sure to open your mind to a ton of fast, easy and healthy dishes for you and your family.</p>
<p>Cooking with an air fryer is deceptively simple. While reading the manuals, you might be concerned with how many different tips, tricks and pointers there are. Without a doubt, after a few dishes, you’ll find the machine easy to use and a joy to cook with.</p>
<p>Our top pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DIQ817G/?tag=ybdafry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; Purifry</a>, is one of a number of quality, well-designed offerings on the market. But its style, build-quality and performance outmaneuver its competitors to earn our esteem.</p>
<p>It was able to cook french fries to perfection. It flourished preparing a frittata. It even baked a delicious souffle — and it did it all without breaking a sweat, the bank or our patience.</p>
<p>In our new testing of updated digital models <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-HD9641-99-Turbostar-Frustration/dp/B0779THNHD/?tag=ybdafry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Phillips &#8211; HD9641/99</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GoWISE-USA-3-7-Quart-Digital-Touchscreen/dp/B07FYWLZJM/?tag=ybdafry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GoWISE &#8211; GW22826</a>, we found the GoWISE was much easier to use, and thanks to the company’s smart redesign of the prior model, it also gave us great cooking results. With all of the model’s improvements, we’ve elevated the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GoWISE-USA-3-7-Quart-Digital-Touchscreen/dp/B07FYWLZJM/?tag=ybdafry-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GoWISE &#8211; GW22826</a> as a runner-up.</p>

<p>To narrow the many options to just nine top-notch digital thermometers, we began by looking at more than 50 sources and chose the 15 most credible to base our research off of. We read consumer reviews and subreddits, including r/Cooking, home and technology publications like Good Housekeeping and Wired, and blogs like Wise Bread and Lifehacker.</p>
<p>Our research indicated that the best digital thermometers feature accurate temperatures in hot and cold foods, wide temperature ranges that convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius, easy storage options, user-friendly interfaces, and helpful instruction manuals.</p>
<p>Some of the top nine are built specifically for the oven and feature small digital displays that sit outside the oven while a connected probe reads the temperature in the middle of the food.</p>
<p>These oven thermometers have alarms that alert you when the food reaches a specific temperature, which is helpful for the busy cook or someone who’d rather not set a timer to check for doneness.</p>
<p>Others, called instant-read thermometers, are made for taking the food’s temperature as quickly as possible. Within just a few seconds, they display an accurate reading — some down to a tenth of a degree.</p>
<p>After extensive research, we narrowed the many digital thermometer choices down to nine, which were all easy to use in a variety of foods, display temperatures in Fahrenheit and Celsius, and have a manufacturer’s warranty.</p>
<h3>Updates</h3>
<p><strong>When it came time for an update, we were hard pressed to find any real flaws in our top picks for new competitors to improve on.</strong> We focused on testing a new crop of bargain-priced instant read thermometers. We also checked out a fresh design for a wireless thermometer that doesn&#8217;t have the drawbacks of Bluetooth.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">The benefits of using a kitchen thermometer</h2>
<p>For such a small tool, a kitchen thermometer can significantly improve the quality of the food you prepare. It makes cooking more efficient and more accurate, while giving you peace of mind that your meal is cooked to perfection.</p>
<p>With a digital kitchen thermometer, there’s no need to cut open a piece of chicken, stick a toothpick in a cake, carefully observe the consistency of candy, or set a timer and hope your food is perfectly cooked when it goes off.</p>
<p>Kitchen thermometers are essential when cooking raw meat, so anyone who grills, roasts, or fries benefits from owning one, and if you have an old analog thermometer, the speedy accuracy of digital will be a step up.</p>
<h2 id="differences">Digital vs analog thermometers</h2>
<p>Thanks to digital thermometers, food temperatures are more accurate than ever. While analog thermometers have traditionally been used in kitchens, they haven’t offered much more than an approximate temp range, which can make cooking to medium-rare a challenging feat.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1907" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/digital-vs-analog-thermometer.jpg" alt="Analog and digital food thermometers" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/digital-vs-analog-thermometer.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/digital-vs-analog-thermometer-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/digital-vs-analog-thermometer-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/digital-vs-analog-thermometer-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/digital-vs-analog-thermometer-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/digital-vs-analog-thermometer-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/digital-vs-analog-thermometer-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/digital-vs-analog-thermometer-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/digital-vs-analog-thermometer-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
Digital thermometers, on the other hand, offer precise readings so you can hit the USDA’s minimum temperature recommendation to kill bugs like salmonella and e. coli, but not overcook your chicken breast. They’re also much more helpful than analog thermometers when facing finicky kitchen projects, like tempering chocolate or making cheese, which can easily go awry if the temperature reading is off.</p>
<p>Like most of today’s technology, digital kitchen thermometers have a range of features. Some of the thermometers we tested, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GRFHXVQ/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">like the Lavatools &#8211; Javelin</a>, were as simple as opening up the package and inserting the probe. Others were more complex, like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IJ1SQV2/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iDevices Kitchen Thermometer</a>, which involved downloading an app that uses a bluetooth connection to track the temperature on your phone or tablet from as far as 150 feet away.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-look-for">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>With so many thermometers on the market, it’s helpful to know what to look for to suit your kitchen needs. We recommend using the following metrics when shopping for a digital kitchen thermometer.</p>
<h3>Accuracy</h3>
<p>Above all, a digital kitchen thermometer should be accurate. Accuracy is the key to a tool that helps you cook food to the perfect temperature.</p>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<p>Speed is an important factor with a thermometer that claims to be instant, but it’s much less of an issue with oven thermometers. <strong>Look for an instant-read thermometer that stabilizes within three to 10 seconds</strong>. You’ll need the speed when reaching into a hot oven, over a grill, or into a pot to measure temperature.</p>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>A thermometer’s functionality can enhance your cooking experience. Know what you’re looking for before you start shopping. Whether you’re a cook who craves a simple, easy design or one who’s fascinated by the latest technology, there’s a thermometer for you.</p>
<p>The ability to switch from Fahrenheit to Celsius can come in handy for cooks who venture into global recipes. Some thermometers display temps to the tenth of a degree. Some digital displays even rotate, depending on the angle they’re held, like the <a href="https://www.thermoworks.com/Thermapen-Mk4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ThermoWorks Thermapen Mk4</a>.</p>
<p>Thermometers can come pre-programmed with minimum meat cooking temps and alert you when they’ve reached it. Others beep when they’ve stabilized, and some can even double as a timer if you’re monitoring time and temperature.</p>
<h3>Temperature range</h3>
<p>A wide temperature range is better if you plan to use a thermometer for more than just meat. A meat thermometer may run from about 32°F to 392°F, but an all-purpose one should have a wider range on the low end.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1909" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thermometers_temp-range.png" alt="thermometer temperature range" width="880" height="805" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thermometers_temp-range.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thermometers_temp-range-610x558.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thermometers_temp-range-360x329.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thermometers_temp-range-375x343.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thermometers_temp-range-414x379.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thermometers_temp-range-295x270.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thermometers_temp-range-180x165.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thermometers_temp-range-320x293.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Accessories</h3>
<p>The top nine thermometers we reviewed came with a variety of accessories like storage cases, magnets, detachable probes, and more.</p>
<h3>Manufacturer’s warranty</h3>
<p>Check out how long the warranty is good for, especially if you plan to get a lot of use out of your thermometer. The brands we tested range from one to five years.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Once we found our top thermometers, we dove into the testing process, creating qualitative and quantitative criteria on which to judge them:</p>

<p>Over ten hours of testing in the kitchen, we tested the top nine thermometers in ice water, boiling water, tempered dark chocolate, a whole roasted chicken, and a thick rib-eye steak.</p>
<h3>Accuracy Tests</h3>
[table id=227 /]
<h3>Test 1: Ice water</h3>
<p>Since not all thermometers can be calibrated by the user, the first test was designed to see how accurately the thermometers were calibrated in the factory.<br />
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F59K0IW/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Top Pick: Lavatools - Javelin PRO Duo</h3><p>The fast and accurate Javelin PRO nailed the temperature on our ice water test.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F59K0IW/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p><strong>Accurate thermometers should read exactly 32°F in ice-cold water</strong>. We filled a pot with an ice-to-water ratio of 3:1 and tested each probe by submerging it two inches into the water, stirring it gently without it touching the bottom.</p>
<p>The Javelin PRO Duo nailed it, with a reading of 32.0°F. While others got to within one degree, the Javelin PRO Duo and the premium-priced ThermoWorks were accurate to one tenth of a degree.</p>
<h3>Test 2: Boiling water</h3>
<p>We followed the ice water test with a boiling water test. This test can be tricky since water boils at different temperatures depending on altitude. At sea level, look for a temperature of 212°F, but the boiling temp drops with elevation gain. <a href="https://www.thermoworks.com/bpcalc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thermoworks has a calculator here</a>: Since we tested at 400 feet above sea level, at a pressure of 30.06 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch_of_mercury" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inHg</a>, we were looking for a reading of 211.53°F.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B00S93EQUK/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AlphaGrillers</a>,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KVLPUB2/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> EatSmart</a> and<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001GD1WHU/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Taylor &#8211; 147821</a> thermometers were all very accurate in boiling water, displaying within one degree of the actual temperature.</p>
<h3>Instant-read speed test results</h3>
[table id=226 /]
<p>We timed how quickly each of the instant-read thermometers came up to their calibrated temperature in each of the accuracy tests. We also tested with melted chocolate while we were tempering it — heating and cooling it to create a smooth texture. This process requires constantly observing the state of the chocolate and regular temperature readings.</p>
<p>We tested each of the thermometers at various stages in the tempering process: initial heating to 120°F, cooling to 82°F, and reheating to between 88°F and 91°F. Since the temperature of the chocolate is constantly changing — heating or cooling — the thermometers took longer to stabilize than they did with icy or boiling water.</p>
<p>The Javelin PRO came up with the fastest read in chocolate, at a mere 3 seconds, followed by the Lavatools &#8211; Javelin at 5.9 seconds. The <a href="https://www.thermoworks.com/Thermapen-Mk4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ThermoWorks &#8211; Thermapen</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KVLPUB2/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EatSmart</a> were quickest on average, though.</p>
<h3>Test 4: Roasted chicken</h3>
<p>For the three oven thermometers we performed a test on roasted chicken to see how they stacked up against each other. Since these thermometers are a bit more complicated than unfolding and reading the temperature, and because we already gauged their accuracy with the first two tests, we looked at ease of use and overall effectiveness.<br />
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001GD1WHU/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/taylor-digital-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/taylor-digital-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/taylor-digital-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/taylor-digital-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/taylor-digital-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/taylor-digital-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/taylor-digital-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/taylor-digital-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/taylor-digital.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Oven Thermometer: Taylor - 147821</h3><p>An accurate, inexpensive and reliable compliment to oven cooking that's also easy to set up.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001GD1WHU/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p><strong>Straight out of the box, the Taylor &#8211; 147821 is the easiest to set up and start using.</strong> It doesn’t have pre-programmed temperature settings for different types of meat, but it does have a temperature guide on the back of the device for reference. Taylor, ThermoPro and iDevices give the USDA-standard 165°F for chicken, while the Supreme Home preset is all the way up at 175.</p>
<h3>Test 5: Thick rib-eye steak</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1913" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/triple-thermometers.jpg" alt="three thermometers in steak" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/triple-thermometers.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/triple-thermometers-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/triple-thermometers-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/triple-thermometers-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/triple-thermometers-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/triple-thermometers-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/triple-thermometers-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/triple-thermometers-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/triple-thermometers-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
In our first testing roundup, we used all nine thermometers to track the doneness of a rib-eye steak.</p>
<p>We inserted the probes of the oven thermometers horizontally into the middle of the raw steak, put the steak in a pan on the stove, and started tracking the rising temperatures of all three. We set the oven thermometers to medium-rare to see how useful the presets were with a real steak.</p>
<p>We also used the instant-read thermometers throughout the cooking process to test for speed, trying several different depths and locations in the steak as the temperature grew close to the USDA’s recommended internal temperature of 145°F for medium-rare beef.</p>
<p><strong>The quickest response among the instant-read thermometers was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NY8J010/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Polder Stable-Read Digital Instant-Read Thermometer</a></strong>, <strong>which stabilized in 4.8 seconds.</strong> Following that, the EatSmart Precision Thermometer gave a reading at 6 seconds and ThermoWorks at 6.8 seconds.</p>
<h2 id="the-best">Best overall: Lavatools &#8211; Javelin PRO Duo</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/javelin-animation.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The best instant-read digital kitchen thermometer is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F59K0IW/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lavatools &#8211; Javelin PRO Duo</a>. In our kitchen tests, it was consistently accurate and quicker than most. It’s simple to use, easy to store, and works perfectly without needing re-calibration. It was the most accurate in the ice water test, down to a tenth of a degree, and it was the fastest in the chocolate test.</p>
<p>This thermometer really shines with its features; they’re simple to figure out and easy to use when cooking. <strong>One feature we particularly loved during testing is the ability to add a beep when the temperature stabilizes</strong>, so you don’t have to wonder if the thermometer has found the current temp yet. It then keeps displaying the temperature as it rises or falls, so it&#8217;s more helpful than a hold button.<br />

<p>The Javelin PRO also has one of the widest temperature ranges, from -40°F to 482°F, and also has the ability to show maximum and minimum temperatures within your current cooking session.</p>
<p><strong>This thermometer is water-resistant enough that you can safely rinse it off</strong>, <strong>and its magnetic back makes it easy to store.</strong> It features an anti-fog, LCD backlit screen but also has a power-saving mode, which can turn the backlighting off. It goes into sleep mode after an hour of inactivity, but it wakes right up if you move it. You can easily turn it off by folding down the probe, but we love the way this sleep mode saves batteries if you forget.</p>
<p>Priced at under $50, it comes with a three-year warranty as well as an easy-to-read manual with accuracy test instructions and a troubleshooting guide.</p>
<p><b>Key Takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Lavatools &#8211; Javelin PRO Duo is a quick, accurate thermometer with some great features that make it easier to use.</li>
<li>The Javelin Pro nailed our ice test, and was very accurate overall.</li>
<li>Getting the quickest read time during a tricky chocolate tempering test ensured we fell in love with this thermometer.</li>
<li>Waterproofing, battery saving, and an easy-read rotating screen are all great features that make this thermometer great.</li>
<li>The only real competition for this model is the $100 ThermoWorks. Lavatools doesn&#8217;t let you calibrate, but we don&#8217;t think most users will miss that.</li>

<p><b>Pair the Javelin PRO Duo with the</b><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001GD1WHU/?tag=ybdthrm-20"> <b>Taylor &#8211; 147821 Digital Cooking Thermometer with Wired Probe</b></a><b> for optimal accuracy in all your cooking tasks.</b> The Taylor thermometer functions as an easy-to-set timer and thermometer. We like that it’s versatile and conforms to your needs. Stand it up on your counter or stick it to the oven door, use the recommended meat temperatures, or set your own to suit your recipe.</p>
<p>At around $16, we were surprised at how well it performed. The Taylor was very accurate in ice and the most accurate oven thermometer in boiling water tests, where accuracy matters most for roasting and baking.</p>
<p>The response time on oven thermometers is usually slow, and this one is no different: It took about thirty seconds to stabilize after an extreme temperature change.</p>
<p>The display includes the basics: a timer, the set temperature you&#8217;re waiting for, and the thermometer’s current temperature reading. There are no presets for meat temperatures, but that means no extra buttons to get in the way.<br />

We've tested two diffent units and found them very accurate, but they won't take grill-flame heat. </p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001GD1WHU/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The timer buttons for setting hours and minutes won&#8217;t let you reduce time without pressing both buttons to reset from zero, but it&#8217;s handy to have if you like to keep your kitchen smartphone-free. (Or if you like to keep your smartphone kitchen-grease-free.)</p>
<p>You can also set the Taylor to alert you when it reaches the set temperature, or leave the alert off and simply observe the temp. All the important option switches like temperature scale and alert mute are physical toggle switches, so they don&#8217;t reset when you turn the thermometer off.</p>
<p>Even setting aside price, the simplicity of this thermometer is just hard to beat. You could spend more on a wireless unit like the ThermoPro or something with calibration options like the <a href="https://www.thermoworks.com/ChefAlarm">Thermoworks &#8211; ChefAlarm</a>, but for a simple oven thermometer we think the Taylor is just about perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Taylor &#8211; 147821 has all the features you need to monitor roasting, baking, or smoking.</li>
<li>In boiling water, this thermometer was the most accurate oven model we tested.</li>
<li>With an easy to read display and simple, reliable controls, there&#8217;s nothing about this thermometer to get in the way.</li>
<li>An added timer function is basic, but handy to have.</li>
<li>The maximum temperature on this model is 392 °F, so it&#8217;s not a good pick for a grill.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the EatSmart Precision Elite Food Thermometer was quick, it wasn’t quite as accurate as the Javelin in our ice-bath test. It&#8217;s not waterproof, and doesn’t have the Javelin’s user-friendly features like the stabilization beep and shake-to-wake power-saving mode.</p>
<p><b>Key Takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The EatSmart &#8211; Precision Elite is a quick, accurate, value-priced thermometer.</li>
<li>EatSmart&#8217;s accuracy results weren&#8217;t perfect in any one test, but matched the market leaders overall.</li>
<li>The ability to calibrate this thermometer will help satisfy the most demanding kitchen science nerds.</li>
<li>AAA batteries are easier to find than coin cells, but we think the waterproofing of our top pick is more valuable.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MSUJWDH/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ThermoPro &#8211; TP21</a> is a reliable, feature-packed wireless thermometer that&#8217;s still pretty affordable. The probe is also rated for grill temperatures, up to 700 degrees compared to the 400-500 degree limits of other oven thermometers. That makes it our pick for the best wireless oven thermometer.</p>
<p>After testing a Bluetooth wireless thermometer in our first roundup and being dissatisfied with all the complexity that comes along with that, we were relieved at the simplicity and reliability on offer here. It&#8217;s not just a bare-bones device, either: The ThermoPro has a display backlight that changes color as your food gets closer to the temperature you set.</p>
<p>The ThermoPro&#8217;s wireless range is impressive. We had to go to the other side of a neighbor&#8217;s garage before it started having any trouble updating the temperature reading consistently, a line-of-sight connection was strong well past the 300-foot listed range.<br />

<p>The wire hook/stand is handy for hanging the probe transmitter base on your oven or grill handle, but a magnetic backing would have made it even better. This model doesn&#8217;t allow calibration (which would be handy if the probe ever needs replacing) but it was within a few degrees of perfect in all our tests, which is close enough for just about anything you&#8217;ll be doing in the oven.</p>
<p>The timer on the TP21 is also less intuitive than the Taylor&#8217;s, since you have to cycle through all the temperature presets to find it. You also lose your seconds count on the TP21 when you set hours and minutes, where the Taylor always shows a seconds counter.</p>
<p>ThermoPro&#8217;s new probe style is a nice upgrade over typical fare, and They will replace it if it stops working in the first year, or for four years if you register on their site.</p>

<h3>A premium upgrade: ThermoWorks &#8211; Thermapen Mk4</h3>
<p>ThermoWorks has a great line of thermometers that covers every need &#8212; from basic instant-reads to a wifi-connected BBQ pit monitoring system &#8212; but we think the<a href="https://www.thermoworks.com/Thermapen-Mk4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ThermoWorks &#8211; Thermapen Mk4</a> is where their attention to detail really shines. This thermometer is the gold standard against which all other kitchen thermometers are judged.</p>
<p>ThermoWorks includes a certificate that demonstrates exactly how accurate each model is, theoretically always within ±0.7°F and traceable just like a laboratory or engineering instrument. It&#8217;s also the most expensive instant-read kitchen thermometer on the market, though it&#8217;s very competitive with other certified lab devices.</p>
<p>The fact that we saw a boiling water reading that was double the specified maximum error didn&#8217;t do this thermometer any favors, but you can manually calibrate or send the ThermaPen back under warranty if yours is out of spec.</p>
<p>ThermoWorks has a similar design to the Javelin thermometers and uses the same fold/unfold function to turn it off and on. ThermoWorks invented the rotating display and shake-to-wake sleep mode, and those features do make it easy to use. The instruction manual is a detailed 21-page lesson in operation, care, and getting accurate readings when cooking.<br />

It's fast, accurate and lets you change nearly any of its fancy features with buttons inside the waterproof battery compartment. There's only one drawback: the price.</p><a href="https://www.thermoworks.com/Thermapen-Mk4" target="_blank"><button>See Price at ThermoWorks.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>For most home cooks, though, removing the battery cover with a screwdriver to push a combination of small buttons for adjusting calibration or display settings is just too much. It&#8217;s great that this thermometer is out there for the most demanding gear nerds, but most of us don&#8217;t want to change the display settings on a thermometer, let alone calibrate one.</p>

<h3>AlphaGrillers</h3>
<p>AlphaGrillers is a small company selling a lot of thermometers. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B00S93EQUK/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AlphaGrillers &#8211; waterproof instant-read digital thermometer</a> packs a lot of features into an affordable package, and they&#8217;ve worked hard to stay ahead of the pack in this very competitive price bracket.</p>
<p>This thermometer is not as sophisticated as the Javelin Pro or ThermaPen. Its display doesn&#8217;t rotate for easy reading, and it doesn&#8217;t notify you when the temperature is stable. The AlphaGrillers also takes a pretty consistent six-to-eight seconds to read a change, much longer than the Javelin Pro and two seconds longer than the EatSmart.</p>
<p>The AlphaGrillers doesn&#8217;t disappoint for accuracy, though. The unit we purchased was dead-on for the boiling temperature calibration, which is exactly where accuracy matters most for a meat thermometer. The ice bath test wasn&#8217;t as close, reading almost a full degree low. That&#8217;s still well within the tolerances required for most of our cooking needs, and a lower error than most of the other thermometers had in their boiling-point read. If you do find that&#8217;s you&#8217;ve got an inaccurate unit, you can also manually calibrate this thermometer.<br />
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S93EQUK/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AlphaGrillersCTA-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AlphaGrillersCTA-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AlphaGrillersCTA-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AlphaGrillersCTA-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AlphaGrillersCTA-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AlphaGrillersCTA-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AlphaGrillersCTA-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AlphaGrillersCTA-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AlphaGrillersCTA.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Waterproof just in Case: AlphaGrillers</h3><p>AlphaGrillers designed this to be a reliable thermometer that's easy to clean. We still don't recommend dropping it in the sink, but they've got your back if water ever gets inside. Ours was also perfectly calibrated for hot items, which is exactly what you need in a meat thermometer.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S93EQUK/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The edge this thermometer has over our other runner-up, the EatSmart &#8211; Precision Elite, is that this is waterproof. Now, if you&#8217;re skeptical about the waterproofing on a $20 thermometer, we don&#8217;t blame you. We ran it under the tap for a full minute and didn&#8217;t see any sign of water ingress into the battery compartment. AlphaGrillers also has a good track record replacing failed or malfunctioning units for users who complain about faulty models. In a world where there are 20 or 30 listings for exactly this same thermometer with different labels, that&#8217;s worth seeking out.</p>
<h3>Lavatools &#8211; Javelin</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GRFHXVQ/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lavatools &#8211; Javelin</a> was off by quite a lot in the steak test, reading 150°F when the other thermometers were reading under 100°F. It did, however, function quickly and accurately in the other tests, and we liked the simplicity of the design.</p>
<p>Like the Lavatools &#8211; Javelin PRO Duo, it’s magnetic, turns on when it’s opened and off when it’s closed, has a wide temperature range and measures to the tenth of a degree. Another benefit is its lifetime warranty.</p>
<h3>Polder &#8211; Stable-Read Digital Instant-Read Thermometer</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NY8J010/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Polder’s Thermometer</a> is a super-simple tool that gets the job done. Like the Javelin PRO Duo, it has the ability to beep when it stabilizes, but it does take longer to do so.</p>
<h3>CDN &#8211; ProAccurate Thermometer</h3>
<p>Designed similarly to an analog thermometer, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0021AEAG2/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CDN &#8211; ProAccurate Thermometer</a> has a face that looks up instead of out, making it difficult to hold and read at the same time.</p>
<p>Since the initial reading of ice water was off by 1.9°, we tried to calibrate it by the instructions printed on the packaging, but we got an error message. It does have a five-year warranty, though, and we liked the pen-like protective case for the stem.</p>
<h3>ThermoPro &#8211; TP03A</h3>
<p>At less than $15, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IHHLB3W/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ThermoPro &#8211; TP03A</a> is a best-seller for obvious reasons. The response time is right in the middle of our tested results, but the accuracy was worse than average by quite a significant margin. It&#8217;s a usable thermometer, but if you pay around $7 more you can get a thermometer that&#8217;s much quicker and more accurate in the EatSmart.</p>
<h3>Other oven thermometers</h3>
<h3>iDevices &#8211; Kitchen Thermometer</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=22389&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB00IJ1SQV2%2F%3Ftag%3Dybdthrm-20&amp;dtb=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">iDevices &#8211; Kitchen Thermometer</a> is the most complex of the top nine, but it’s also the most interactive and fun. The box comes with a quick-start guide, but most of the instructions can be found in the manual within the app.</p>
<p>Recommended temperatures come pre-programmed in the app, and the user is notified on his or her smartphone when the temperature reaches the minimum setting, which is 165°F for chicken. You can also search for recipes, track the rising temperature of your dish, and share the results through the app.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1912" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/idevices-app.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/idevices-app.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/idevices-app-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/idevices-app-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/idevices-app-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/idevices-app-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/idevices-app-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/idevices-app-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/idevices-app-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/idevices-app-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/idevices-app-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The body of the iDevices &#8211; Kitchen Thermometer is magnetized for an oven or fridge, but it can also stand on a counter. And, with two wired probes leading back to the body, it’s the only thermometer we looked at that allows for simultaneously testing two locations.</p>
<p>That means you can monitor two separate dishes or different locations of the same dish — think turkey legs and turkey breast. It was also perfectly accurate in ice water right out of the box.</p>
<p>Once it’s set up, the iDevices app gives you a lot of information and it&#8217;s pretty cool to have full control from a touchscreen. But the time, complication and monetary investment (about $80) may turn away some shoppers.</p>
<p>The real weakness of this system is Bluetooth itself: different smartphones will have better or worse Bluetooth antennae, but the claimed range of 150 feet must require the planets to be in alignment as well as a clear line-of-sight path between your phone and the thermometer. Range and synchronization problems are the big complaints in every user review of the iDevices and Weber iGrill thermometers.</p>
<p>Weber has taken over the iDevices line and is now responsible for the app, and they&#8217;ve expanded the line with new iGrill models targeted at their core grilling and barbecuing customer base.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a devoted smartphone user who wants an app for everything, this will get you one step closer to your dream. Most of us are better off with a stand-alone thermometer.</p>
<h3>Supreme Home Cook &#8211; Oven &amp; BBQ Touchscreen</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O9GV906/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Supreme Home Cook &#8211; Oven &amp; BBQ Touchscreen Thermometer</a> was very accurate in the ice water test. That&#8217;s about all it has going for it, though &#8212; we didn&#8217;t have many favorable interactions with this device.</p>
<p>The instructions (on one sheet of paper) help the user decode the meanings of the one-letter labels on the touchscreen buttons and select the pre-programmed temperatures for poultry, fish, or red meat. That&#8217;s not a big problem by itself, but a typo made it very difficult to figure out how to change the taste setting of our rib-eye steak to medium-rare. Another quirk is that this device is programmed to set poultry at a surprisingly high 174°F.</p>
<p>Just setting a temperature manually requires awkward steps. You have to hold down the S-S button for two seconds. That&#8217;s not to be confused with the S-T button, which changes from Fahrenheit to Celsius scale. Also, each time it’s turned on, it automatically reverts to Celsius, which might annoy some.</p>
<p>The Supreme Home Cook’s screen, which gives you the alert temperature and the current cooking temperature, is slightly difficult to read at certain angles, and its flip-out kickstand doesn’t stabilize the body as well as the other thermometers.</p>
<h2 id="2019-update">2019 Updates</h2>
<p>For our update tests, we added some new budget-friendly options. We&#8217;re still very happy with the Javelin and the ThermaPen as the top instant-read thermometers on the market, but we wanted to see if a waterproof budget option could keep up.</p>
<p>The Taylor is also still our favorite oven thermometer, but we tested a new budget-friendly wireless option that&#8217;s more reliable that the Bluetooth design we tried in 2016.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Using both an instant-read along with an oven thermometer can help the accuracy and timing of your recipes, especially when cooking meat. The oven thermometer allows you to get close to your target temperature while the instant-read lets you take quick internal temperatures in several different locations of the food.</p>
<p>If you’re not roasting of baking with time-sensitive recipes, an instant-read thermometer alone should typically do the trick. Even though the EatSmart Precision Elite Food Thermometer had a faster average reading time in our testing, it didn’t have the accuracy, functionality, or features of our top recommendation, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F59K0IW/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lavatools &#8211; Javelin PRO Duo</a>. After clearly standing out in our tests, it has kept up in long-term testing, too, maintaining its accuracy and functionality in three years of additional usage.</p>
