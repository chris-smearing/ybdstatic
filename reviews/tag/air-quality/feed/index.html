								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter testing five vacuums in three different apartments and running controlled tests side by side, we&#8217;ve determined that the Shark &#8211; Apex is the best upright vacuum. This predator is at the top of the food chain with quiet power and effective cleaning on more surfaces than most other upright vacuum cleaners. The entry-level Shark &#8211; Navigator is also a good value at about half the price, and the Dirt Devil won a spot among our top picks with compact maneuverability.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>After spending the last year researching and testing selections for task-specific categories like <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">the best vacuums for pet owners</a>, <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum/">handheld vacuums</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuums</a>, we were ready to tackle a more general overview of the vacuum market.</p>
<p>We read comparison reviews by traditional publications like Wirecutter and Consumer Reports, but we also sunk hours into the endless testing footage available from vacuum enthusiasts on YouTube. We also investigated the latest buzz on the r/vacuums subreddit.</p>
<p>Vacuum cleaners, like many appliances, are often sold with different model numbers or packages at different retailers. Even finding the most recent models or determining differences between model numbers is sometimes nearly impossible. Our researcher compared specs on 18 different models for Shark alone, and that&#8217;s just the currently available models.</p>
<p>We included Shark&#8217;s perennial classic, the Navigator, since it&#8217;s their best value in terms of power for dollar and is still readily available. We also included the new Shark &#8211; Apex AZ1002, a model with all of Shark&#8217;s latest bells and whistles at a correspondingly higher price.</p>
<p>Selecting a worthy competitor for the Apex was tough. Every review of the Shark vacuums praises their relative maneuverability, while Dyson vacuums (though powerful) tend to be considered clunky by comparison. We selected the Dyson &#8211; Ball Multi Floor 2 rather than the larger, heavier, more expensive Animal or Cinetic models. (Some reviews actually show the Multi Floor to be more powerful than the Animal.)</p>
<p>Shark and Dyson have the high-end bagless vacuum market pretty much to themselves these days. We did find some well-regarded competitors in the budget bracket, though, with affordable and lightweight models from Dirt Devil and Eureka that had excellent customer reviews.</p>

[table id=240 /]
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Cleaning path:</strong> A wider cleaning path means fewer passes to clean an area, but it usually also makes a vacuum less maneuverable.</p>
<p><strong>Edge cleaning gap:</strong> This is a measurement of the distance of the pickup track from the edge, which determines how much dirt is missed when you&#8217;re vacuuming along baseboards or furniture.</p>
<p><strong>Steering design:</strong> Dyson really made a name for themselves with the &#8220;big ball&#8221; steering design, but we&#8217;ve come a long way since the days when every vacuum handled like a giant commercial model. Swivelling heads are now a common feature that actually made two other brands easier to turn than the Dyson.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories:</strong> Upright vacuums typically come with hose attachments that help you clean things like stairs, couches and drapes. Great attachments really make some jobs easier, but if you don&#8217;t have any upholstered furniture you might find yourself keeping them in the closet.</p>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> Lower weight is always better for carrying and using a vacuum, so long as you aren&#8217;t giving up features you need. This is also an important factor if you&#8217;re vacuuming on hardwood, since lighter vacuums are less likely to leave scuff marks.</p>
<p><strong>Noise:</strong> All vacuums are loud, but some are louder than others. Sleeping housemates will thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Filter performance and sealed systems:</strong> High efficiency particulate air (&#8220;HEPA&#8221;) filters are common, and the filter itself almost always does a great job filtering out even the smallest dust particles. The big difference between vacuums is whether they&#8217;re fully sealed or just let dust escape out of cracks and gaps.</p>

<p><strong>Height to fit under furniture:</strong> Coffee tables, beds and other low-clearance furniture can be tricky to vacuum under. Low-profile vacuum beater heads can slip into more places without stopping to use a specialty attachment.</p>
<p><strong>Cord Length:</strong> You want to be able to vacuum your entire floor without switching outlets, so cord length is a big priority for larger rooms or even just getting down the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>Length of hose:</strong> If you want to get the most out of your specialty attachments, it&#8217;s nice to be able to roam a bit. This is especially important for high ceilings.</p>

<p><strong>Total reach:</strong> This spec is usually a combination of cord length and hose length, plus the longest extension attachment. We think it makes more sense to think about your needs for cord length and hose length separately, though.</p>
<p><strong>Warranty and service network:</strong> In the past, vacuum repair worked like car repair: You buy an expensive machine from a dealer and take it back in for repairs. Dyson still has a repair network, while Shark works mostly by shipping things in the mail.</p>
<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs an upright vacuum?</h2>
<p>Upright vacuums are great on carpet. If you&#8217;ve got wall-to-wall medium-pile carpet, an upright vacuum is probably going to be your first choice. If you have more than 500 square feet of carpet to clean, an upright also makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>For bare floors, like hardwood or tile, an upright vacuum usually isn&#8217;t the best choice. Picks from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-steam-mop/">steam mop review</a> will be a much better choice on tile or vinyl, though a good upright vacuum will still pick up dirt.</p>
<p>Being able to turn off the brushroll is an important feature if you&#8217;re going to use an upright on bare floors, since the brush will usually scatter dirt too much and doesn’t really help on a bare floor. Brushroll control is a standard feature for all the vacuums we looked at.</p>
<p>Upright vacuums put the weight of the motor above the brushroll, which helps it work into carpet fibers. That extra weight pushing down helps with getting out tough dirt, and for &#8220;grooming&#8221; longer carpet into that gorgeous freshly vacuumed look.</p>
<p>A good upright vacuum also makes cleaning floors more convenient. An upright keeps all of your vacuum parts rolling on one set of wheels, which means you only have to stop vacuuming when you get to the end of your cord.</p>
<p>The cordless models from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuum review</a> are even more convenient to carry around. An upright is wider, though, so it can clean more quickly, and it can also go longer before the dust cup fills up. Most importantly, a plug-in upright won&#8217;t run out of battery power before you finish cleaning.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, an upright vacuum puts the suction motor, roller brush and dust receptacle in one piece riding on wheels with a long handle. A canister vacuum separates the motor and dust receptacle from the tools with a long hose, so you typically have most of the weight of the vacuum in a piece that follows you around on the floor while you hold the attachments and pickup tools.</p>
<p>Upright vacuums are similar to the oldest designs, basically adding suction and a bag to 19th-century carpet sweeper designs like the Bissel. Early upright designs were called &#8220;suction sweepers,&#8221; while early canister designs were called &#8220;suction dusters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those names highlight the strengths of each design: Upright vacuums are very efficient for &#8220;sweeping&#8221; over large surfaces, while the maneuverability and flexibility of a canister&#8217;s detached hose make it perfect for vacuuming things that aren&#8217;t your floor.</p>
<p>That said, most upright vacuums sold to consumers deliberately allow you to use a flexible hose and attachments, so you can still clean your drapes and upholstery.</p>
<p>Likewise, canister vacuums typically come with long-handled floor-sweeping attachments, and some even come with very nice electric-powered brushroll systems for plush carpet.</p>
<p>An upright vacuum really shines if you need to clean up and down a carpeted hall. The cord is long enough that you can finish the job without unplugging, and you won&#8217;t have to drag a canister along behind you. It&#8217;s also easier to store in a closet because of the small footprint.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re cleaning smaller rooms with lots of furniture, the lighter weight and low-profile head of a canister vacuum&#8217;s pickup tool make it much easier to work under and around obstacles. The drawbacks start when you have to move the canister body while you&#8217;re vacuuming.</p>
<p>Canister vacuums often come with air-powered tools, which means that only the flow of air is powering the brushroll that&#8217;s picking up hair and dirt from your carpet. Air-powered tools are better than nothing in a pinch, but they&#8217;re not nearly as effective as a motor-driven brush. We found out when testing the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">best pet hair vacuums</a> that just because a canister vacuum is expensive doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s always the right tool for the job.</p>
<p>Shark&#8217;s popular &#8220;lift-away&#8221; vacuum design tries to split the difference between a canister and an upright. If you want to separate the bulky motor housing from the floor tools you can just push a button and detach it. The hose is very short compared to a purpose-built canister system, but it has many of the same strengths when you need to vacuum under a bed or on carpeted stairs.</p>
<p>Note that among Shark models, only the powered lift-away models can run the brushroll motor when the base is detached. The un-powered Navigator, however, can still do bare-floor cleaning just as capably in this mode.</p>

<p>It might seem like distant history, but for most of the hundred or so years of vacuum cleaning we&#8217;ve relied on a bag to capture dirt that&#8217;s picked up. Once the bag was full, you had to throw it away and replace it with a new one. Bags could be made from paper for cheaper designs, but more expensive bags used other materials for better reliability and filtration.</p>
<p>Various bagless vacuum designs have been tried, but it was James Dyson who really popularized the bagless concept. Dyson pioneered the use of &#8220;cyclonic&#8221; airflow to separate dirt inside the dust receptacle through centrifugal force. Twenty years later, nearly all consumer-grade vacuums are bagless.</p>
<p>Without cyclonic dust removal, filters are the weak point of any vacuum system. If the filter is too fine, not enough air will get through and they will plug up quickly. If the filter lets a lot of air through, dust particles will also escape. Bag systems slowly lose suction efficiency as the filter pores fill with dust.</p>
<p>Modern bagless vacuums all use cyclonic action to separate dust, which means they can all use HEPA filters and filter-exhaust air down to sub-micron particles without instantly plugging up. Bagless systems generally use filters that are designed to be washed, so you should never have to buy replacement parts.</p>
<p>One more perk of bagless designs is that you can more easily find a piece of jewelry or a micro SD card that you accidentally pick up.</p>
<p>The savings are a relief, and not having to hunt for replacement bags when your vacuum is discontinued is nothing to sneeze at, either. But there is at least one downside to bagless designs.</p>
<p>When your vacuum collects dirt in a bag, you can simply throw it away and move on if you pick up something sticky, smelly or otherwise nasty. With a bagless vacuum, you&#8217;ve got to clean out the plastic receptacle and wash the filter.</p>
<p>In the marketplace, bagless has been a clear winner. You can still find a few of the old standby brands that maintain marketshare among commercial users, but even Panasonic has left the US vacuum cleaner market altogether after making Kenmore&#8217;s vacuums for decades.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We tested each of these vacuums in real-world conditions over the course of two months in three different apartments. We also spent a week testing for specific performance criteria in side-by-side dirt pickup tests on different types of carpet, and we measured noise and dust output.</p>
<p>After all that testing, we sat down and analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of each vacuum to decide which buyers they could be best for.<br />
[table id=241 /]
<h3>Maneuverability and weight</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/maneuverability.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We tested maneuverability around everyday living-room furniture. Weight played a big role in improving the scores of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet</a>, which also swivels well for quick turns. The Shark &#8211; Apex kept up, though, despite weighing about four pounds more than the budget-priced uprights.</p>
<p>The other surprising results for maneuverability were the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NAGRRRU/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson &#8211; Ball Multi Floor 2</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07J4R23VJ/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; PowerSpeed</a> models. The Dyson ball design just seems stiff and clunky compared to the new swivel-head designs from other makers. And remember, this is a lighter, smaller sibling in the Dyson family.</p>
<p>The Eureka was definitely the most frustrating, though. Without any consideration for swiveling, even the low weight made just turning it around at the end of a hallway far more difficult than it was with the other models.</p>
<p>The dust cups in this roundup were surprisingly similar. Dyson has a slight edge with a one-button release and dump system that makes emptying easier, though figuring out how hard to press the button takes some getting used to. Putting the Dyson&#8217;s pieces back in place is sometimes tricky, too. The other systems also have a drop-away bottom that makes emptying dirt easy, but fiddling with their latches isn&#8217;t quite as elegant.</p>
<p>Dyson&#8217;s outer canister separates completely from the cyclonic separator piece, so it&#8217;s easier to do a deep-clean if something gets lodged in there. None of the other dust receptacles were especially bad at trapping debris, but the Dyson system is (as one might expect) very elegant.</p>
<h3>Under-furniture height</h3>
<p>Measuring the height of each vacuum&#8217;s head gives an idea of how low the base of your furniture can be before the vacuum won&#8217;t fit at all. A model like the Dyson may fit under your couch part-way, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it will actually vacuum underneath. Most upright vacuums are too bulky, so you need to use an accessory tool on the hose to get all the dust bunnies.</p>
<p>Shark&#8217;s powered lift-away system on the Apex has a definite edge here. With the motor body removed, the brush head is free and clear to vacuum in tighter quarters.</p>
<h3>Edge cleaning</h3>
<p>We also tested the ability of these vacuums to pick up along the edge of a room or large furniture that goes to the floor. The Apex was a clear winner on this test, with good pickup right to a half-inch from a baseboard. The other finalists all left a track of dirt more than an inch wide.</p>
<h3>Attachments and Hose Length</h3>
<p>Our testers rated the usefulness of attachments for tricky situations like stairs, couches and drapes. Shark is almost cheating on this score, since the lift-away design means you can attach the handle directly to the motorized brush head to easily vacuum stairs, but the Shark vacuums include useful tools in other respects, too.</p>
<p>Of note is the motorized hand-sized upholstery brush included with the Apex. This kind of tool only works with vacuums that send power through the hose, so it&#8217;s pretty unique on a vacuum that doesn&#8217;t cost $600.</p>
<p>Hose length was a tricky feature to analyze: If you need to vacuum over and under a big sectional couch, for example, it might make all the difference. But the stand-out winner in this category, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NAGRRRU/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson &#8211; Ball Multi Floor 2</a>, had the hose storage system that was most annoying to work with. Dyson stores a rigid extension tube inside the hose, and it all nestles into the handle shaft, but getting the parts to click into place after use was difficult.</p>
<p>The Shark’s short hose length lost the most points with our testers. The hose on the Apex is only half the length of Dyson&#8217;s incredible ten-foot reach. It&#8217;s easy to lift the Apex&#8217;s body with one hand if you&#8217;re standing on a stepladder to reach a ceiling, but if you&#8217;re going to use the hose frequently you might start looking at the after-market hose extensions offered by other companies.</p>
<h3>Pick-up performance</h3>

[table id=243 /]
<p>We ran ten different tests to determine performance on various kinds of carpet and with different types of dirt. We weighed samples of icing sugar, sand and circle-shaped cereal and tested how much each vacuum left behind in a single pass on short-, medium- and long-pile carpet.</p>
<p>The stand-out performance in the pickup tests came from Dyson. If you&#8217;ve got medium- or low-pile carpet and want a deep clean, Dyson does a great job. In those cases it left behind mere grams of material. That said, in long carpet fibers, Dyson offers no height or power adjustment to keep it from simply getting stuck. If you&#8217;ve got luxurious carpet or area rugs, count Dyson out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark&#8217;s Navigator</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet</a> were nearly tied for how much they picked up on shorter carpet. We were especially impressed with the performance of the Dirt Devil, given how inexpensive and light it is.</p>
<h3>Long carpets and area rugs</h3>

<p>The real winner for overall usefulness was the Shark &#8211; Apex. While the Navigator and Dirt Devil performed acceptably well on long carpet in their bare-floor modes, the Apex is the only vacuum in this lineup to offer real suction or brush speed control.</p>

This is the only upright that didn't struggle on area rugs and high-pile carpet.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Dyson and Eureka designs (despite the &#8220;height control&#8221; setting on the Eureka) were impossible to use effectively on long carpet. These vacuums try to gobble up the long fibers with the brushrolls on, and all the suction power pulls the vacuum down into the carpet so you can&#8217;t move.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s even worse if your plush carpet is a small area rug: With a vacuum like the Dyson, you&#8217;ll just get totally stuck or even damage your rug when it gets pulled part-way inside the vacuum.</p>
<h3>Filtration and sealing against dust escape</h3>
[table id=245 /]
<p>For a real test of the filter performance, we used a Dylos air-quality meter to measure particle counts in particles per million by volume, measuring half-micron particles and ten micron particles separately but averaged together here. Readings were taken before and after a vacuuming session, as well as after an additional five minutes running the vacuum to allow its filter to capture particles that had been thrown around.</p>
<p>Sealed-system vacuums performed better than the budget-priced models, though we were impressed at how well the Shark &#8211; Navigator kept up with the more expensive competition, even spreading less dust than its bigger sibling.</p>
<p>The Eureka turned in an impressive result if you only look at the improvement from running the vacuum for five minutes after you finish using it; the amount of dust it spat into the air while it was vacuuming, though, was by far the highest.</p>
<p>These results show that even a well-sealed vacuum that has a good filter will still kick up a lot of dust. <strong>Dust will settle naturally, but it takes a while. You should always vacuum the day before you have asthmatic friends over, not immediately before they arrive.</strong></p>
<p>In our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">pet vacuum review</a> we saw comparable performance capturing smells. The sealed vacuums also performed well keeping pet dander and even odors inside the receptacle. The Eureka performed surprisingly well here capturing dust, much better than it did capturing smells, but there&#8217;s definitely enough variability in our testing environment and the way dust circulates in a room to account for that.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to keep your air as clean as possible, Shark and Dyson do a good job of keeping dust contained. Check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-air-purifier/">review of the best room air purifiers</a> if you want to get dust levels even lower than this after you&#8217;re done vacuuming.</p>
<h3>Noise</h3>
[table id=244 /]
<p>After we collected all of the test data on effective cleaning, we booted up our audio-analysis rig to get some noise readings. We used a calibrated mic and the Room Eq Wizard software, set to measure decibels with A-scale weighting.</p>
<p>We took noise measurements from six feet away in a single-car garage bay with a concrete floor. That&#8217;s about double the distance you&#8217;d be at when using the vacuum. We also included two other test vacuums: The tester&#8217;s old Dyson &#8211; DC25 (purchased in 2013) along with the Shark &#8211; Rocket stick vacuum, which won top place in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuum review</a>.</p>
<p>The average noise level is quite loud, 85 dBA for just a vacuum motor or 89 with the brushroll engaged and picking up dirt on a hard surface. These vacuums move a lot of air very quickly, so noise is inevitable. For the louder machines, these levels are actually close to what we got in tests from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-leaf-blower/">review of electric leaf blowers</a>.</p>
<p>The difference between the quietest and loudest vacuum was a full 10 dBA. Because of how sound works, people will perceive that as only double the loudness, but it&#8217;s the same power increase as running nine more of the quietest vacuums in a room together.</p>
<p>The quietest vacuum was the Shark &#8211; Apex, also the most expensive vacuum we tested. <strong>The cheaper Shark &#8211; Navigator was only 1dBA louder, with both vacuums peaking under 87 dBA with the brushroll turned on.</strong> That&#8217;s still loud enough that <a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2016/02/08/noise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to guidelines set by the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety</a>, you shouldn&#8217;t be up-close with these vacuum cleaners for more than an hour every day without hearing protection.</p>
<p>All of the other vacuums we tested (including the stick vacuum) were louder than 85 dBA from six feet away. From close-up, as you&#8217;d be using them, the loudest vacuums measured at 97 dBA. You shouldn&#8217;t use a loud vacuum cleaner for longer than half an hour every day without some ear plugs.</p>
<p>This is still much quieter than the noise exposure from power tools at a jobsite, but it&#8217;s something to keep in mind. If you clean for a living and need some hearing protection, check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-ear-plugs/">review of the best ear plugs.</a> Obviously, any of these vacuums are loud enough to wake most roommates (not to mention a baby).</p>
<p>One notable quirk is that while the Dyson is loud overall, its brushroll motor hardly adds any extra noise. Shark&#8217;s powerful brushrolls are quiet, but you can definitely tell when they&#8217;re turned on and off.</p>

<p>At just over $300 from most retailers, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex AZ1002</a> is a premium product that really works to justify the extra cost. This is Shark&#8217;s largest vacuum, and it includes all of the best toys: powered accessory tools, a wood-floor-friendly brushroll, a hair-proof brush cleaning system, an extra-long cord and some working carpet-height settings.</p>
<p>This is the biggest vacuum we tested, though it actually has a fairly narrow cleaning track at 11.5 inches. Compare that to 12 inches on the budget-friendly Dirt Devil or 13.4 inches on the smaller-sized Dyson we tested. Shark tends to focus on maneuverability and flexibility instead of a wide pickup path, and we&#8217;re pretty happy with that tradeoff.</p>
<p>At 16 pounds and drawing 1350 watts of power, the Apex definitely feels like a full-size vacuum when you first assemble it. Most impressive are the power and floor-surface control switches that are mounted on the handle for easy access. No more bending down just to pause to answer the door or move from carpet to hard flooring.</p>
<p>We also noticed the DuoClean brush rollers pulling the Apex across floors more briskly than other uprights. Thankfully, the quick-swiveling head is easy to steer, so we never felt like this was a runaway vacuum. It&#8217;s power you can feel, but you&#8217;re in control.</p>
<h3>Best for thick carpet</h3>
<p>Thick carpet is where this vacuum really shone. Some of the other machines could get you by if you turn off the brushroll to keep it from jamming up, but the Apex gives you just the right amount of suction and brush speed to move swiftly across the floor and effectively clean your carpet.</p>
<p>In our test picking up icing sugar, the Apex was only 20 percent better than the Dyson on long carpet. With sand, though, that difference jumped to an astounding 43 percent. The Apex was also the only upright to earn a perfect score picking up large objects, though the Dirt Devil was not far behind.</p>
<h3>Powered lift-away design</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21917" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away.jpg" alt="Shark lift-away design" width="1987" height="1325" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away.jpg 1987w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-lift-away-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Shark&#8217;s trademark design innovation is that they don&#8217;t let upright vacuums just be uprights: most of their line also converts to something more like a canister system, with the motor and dust cup in a &#8220;Lift-Away&#8221; pod that detaches from the handle tube.</p>
<p>The Lift-Away design makes the vacuum more flexible than a simple hand tool plugged into a hose could ever be. As mentioned above, since this is a powered Lift-Away model you can use the full-size brush head under furniture, and if you&#8217;re vacuuming a small area with lots of obstacles you can shed all the motor weight for more agility.</p>
<p>The downside of Shark&#8217;s Lift-Away designs has always been short hoses. You run out of hose very quickly if you try to use the Apex like a canister vacuum with the motor unit on the floor, so if you&#8217;re vacuuming a whole room with lots of furniture to clean under you&#8217;ll probably wind up carrying it in one hand while you vacuum with the other.</p>
<p>You can buy a wheeled cart for the canister, and there are non-powered hose extensions you can try, but most of the time it just makes far more sense to use the Apex in its upright mode.</p>
<p>Having too much extra hose can be annoying, and even Dyson&#8217;s remarkable collapsing hose is a bit unwieldy. Maybe there&#8217;s no perfect two-in-one canister and upright vacuum, but we really would like to see at least another three feet on the Apex to say it&#8217;s worth considering as a canister-mode design. For stairs and upholstery, though, it&#8217;s fantastic.</p>
<h3>Also the best upright vacuum for hardwood floors</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/brushspin.mov" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The Apex isn&#8217;t a one-trick fish, though. As well as tackling plush carpet, this is the best upright vacuum for bare floors. The Apex brings a few features to bear that you should consider if you&#8217;re vacuuming a hardwood floor rather than wall-to-wall carpet.</p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s Shark&#8217;s DuoClean brushroll. Many hardwood experts don&#8217;t like using a brushroll anywhere near hardwood, and you could use a vacuum that just has a simple easy-gliding suction head. (You could also use a dust mop.) <strong>But the DuoClean system is an exceptionally soft brush, and it works well to dust and even slightly polish your hardwood or manufactured flooring.</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got sand on your floor, it&#8217;s better to pick it up without grinding it in at all, but most of the time you encounter grains of sand on your floor you won&#8217;t know until you see a scratch. The Apex is, at least, designed to minimize the damage.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Top of the Food Chain: Shark - Apex</h3><p>Shark's vacuums are incredibly popular, and this model includes basically every feature they've come up with. Great control means this is actually a good vacuum on all surfaces, and the powered lift-away system makes it very flexible. To top it all off, this is quiet and captures dust effectively.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Another reason this is the best upright vacuum for hardwood floors is that it won&#8217;t choke on your area rugs. None of the other vacuums we looked at in this price range have controls for switching surfaces, so this is the vacuum that does the whole room at once.</p>
<p>We need to stop for a moment here and emphasize that if you&#8217;ve got a new engineered hardwood floor, you should double-check with the manufacturer that use of a soft brushroll won&#8217;t void your warranty. Flooring finishes should all be fine, but care instructions sometimes specifically say not to use a buffing machine or a &#8220;beater bar&#8221; head.</p>
<p>Again, we haven&#8217;t seen any evidence that this vacuum could damage a floor unless you&#8217;re running it through piles of sand and deliberately grinding it into your hardwood.</p>

<p>Shark sells the Apex in a few different versions, but we tested the version that had the best set of accessories, the AZ1002. This model ships with three compact attachments you can plug into the end of the hose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compact, motorized brush head</li>
<li>12-inch crevice tool</li>
<li>Combination upholstery brush &amp; mattress tool</li>
</ul>
<p>Also remember that the extension tube and the full-size head will plug into the handle, so you can get about 30 inches of extra reach with any of these tools for dusting high-up corners and drapes.</p>
<p>Shark sometimes runs promotions that will include extra accessories, like a flat-surface or under-furniture dusting tool, if you purchase directly from their site.</p>
<p>The motorized pet tool is a good pick if you&#8217;ve got corduroy upholstery or other surfaces that collect hair and need more than just suction to clean. It probably wouldn&#8217;t be worth picking this tool up all by itself if you buy the Apex without it, but it&#8217;s a nice perk and stores neatly on the base of the vacuum.</p>
<p>For stairs and other tricky carpeted surfaces, we think that plugging the handle directly into the regular carpet head and using the Apex like a super-powered handheld vacuum is a fantastic trick. If you&#8217;ve ever skipped cleaning carpeted stairs because you hate how clunky your vacuum is, you&#8217;ll love the Apex.</p>
<h3>Sealed system and HEPA Filter</h3>
<p>The Apex performed very well in our dust collection test. Any powered-brush vacuum will kick dust into the air, so don&#8217;t count on the Apex to make your air dust-free immediately after vacuuming, but the sealed system and HEPA filter will make sure that it&#8217;s not just blowing all the dust you pick up back out into your room.</p>
<h3>A bigger, better vacuum</h3>
<p>To sum up all our time with the Apex: this is a big vacuum that&#8217;s not clunky. Shark has some great tricks that make this a more versatile system than any other vacuum we found. If you have long carpet, area rugs, or any other tasks that utilize Shark&#8217;s special features it&#8217;s an easy vacuum to recommend.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re only vacuuming medium-length carpet, though, both the Shark &#8211; Navigator and the Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet will also do a good job. Those vacuums are lighter, so they&#8217;re easier to use, and they&#8217;re much less expensive, too.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex</a> is a big vacuum, but it’s still easy to handle.</li>
<li>On long carpet, the Apex easily beat all competitors.</li>
<li>This doesn’t quite have as much cleaning power as a Dyson on medium carpets.</li>
<li>Shark&#8217;s powered lift-away design gives flexibility.</li>
<li>Good sealing and filtration keeps dust to a minimum.</li>
<li>The DuoClean brushroll design is also good for hardwood floors.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-value">Best Value: Shark &#8211; Navigator</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Navigator NV352</a> earned a second-place ranking based on performance in our tests, but when you consider that it&#8217;s only half the price of the more expensive vacuums we bought, there&#8217;s plenty of reason to consider it best value overall.</p>
<p>The Navigator is a consistent winner in vacuum tests all over the internet. This is a step up from the cheapest vacuums that Shark makes, and a clear step down from their full-featured models. The NV352 doesn&#8217;t have the new hardwood-polishing soft brush, and the version with Shark&#8217;s new maintenance-free &#8220;ZeroM&#8221; brushroll is about $50 more. The lift-away mode won&#8217;t run the brushroll, and there&#8217;s no suction or speed control to make long carpets bearable.</p>
<p>That said, on mid- or short-length carpet this vacuum almost keeps up with a $300 Dyson in our pickup tests for sand and powder.</p>
<p>This is our pick for those whose biggest concern is pet hair pickup, so long as you don&#8217;t have longer carpet. If you do have high-pile carpet, this isn&#8217;t the worst-performing vacuum if you turn the brushroll off, but it&#8217;s not nearly as good as a machine with real multi-surface controls.</p>
<p>Just like the Apex, the Navigator beat the Dyson in both air quality and noise-output tests. It&#8217;s nice to know that for a value-priced vacuum, you don&#8217;t have to make compromises when it comes to your health.</p>

This isn't the very best in any one category, but it's got a strong motor and it's still easy to handle. The Navigator's filter performance and low noise are also competitive with the bigger machines.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If you&#8217;re vacuuming on low-pile carpet or bare floors, the Navigator did spray more sand than the Apex or Dyson. If you spot a pile of sand, you should always turn off the brushroll anyhow, but the Navigator seems to have an extra-aggressive brush.</p>
<h3>Shortcomings</h3>

<p>As you can see in the clip above, the Navigator had trouble in the cereal pickup test, especially on medium carpet. Even on short carpet, where it performed much better, there was a straggler.</p>
<p>In our maneuverability tests the Navigator easily beat the Dyson, but it&#8217;s not as easy to steer as the Dirt Devil. When we asked our tester which vacuum she would most like to keep for her apartment, she passed up the Navigator&#8217;s air filtration and power for the most maneuverable choice.</p>
<p>All in all, there are a few ways the Apex is clearly a better vacuum. The Navigator keeps pace, though, and actually outperformed the Apex in some tests. For most people, this will be a great vacuum.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Navigator</a> is a tried and true value pick.</li>
<li>If your biggest concern is pet hair on mid-length carpet, get this.</li>
<li>Even the less-expensive Shark filters exhaust air even better than Dyson.</li>
<li>The Navigator is almost as quiet as the Apex.</li>
<li>A non-powered lift-away design makes this less flexible than the Apex.</li>

<h2 id="budget-pick">Budget pick: Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet</h2>

<p>Dirt Devil&#8217;s lineup of vacuums is very much focused on the budget segment of the market, with few models crossing the $100 threshold. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Razor Pet Steerable Upright</a> is the upgraded model with swivel-action steering, and we think it&#8217;s a great vacuum if your budget is tight.</p>
<p>The Dirt Devil kept pace with the Navigator through the low- and mid-pile carpet tests, so it&#8217;s a vacuum that&#8217;s capable of thoroughly cleaning your carpet. But where it really stood out was in handling. The Dirt Devil is actually slightly heavier than the Navigator, but it&#8217;s easier to maneuver and wheel around.</p>
<p>This vacuum also fits under furniture with a clearance height just slightly lower than the Apex&#8217;s. Without the lift-away feature this isn&#8217;t as versatile in some tight spots, but there&#8217;s something great about a vacuum that&#8217;s just good at what it was built for.</p>

The Razor keeps up admirably on most carpet, and it's pretty good at dust control. You don't get the bells and whistles, but you'll be impressed at how easy this is to maneuver.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>For dust control, this vacuum doesn&#8217;t have a HEPA filter or a fully sealed system. It will spread more fine dust around than the Shark or Dyson vacuums. That said, it was surprisingly good at containing the smell and dust from pet hair in one tester&#8217;s apartment. It&#8217;s also slightly quieter than a Dyson.</p>

<p>Dirt Devil includes an air-turbine-powered hand tool with this package, and it&#8217;s the kind of tool that might help in a very few situations, but for the most part you&#8217;ll probably skip it. The Shark&#8217;s motorized brush is wider, and actually has enough torque to get dirt out of carpet or upholstery fibers.</p>
<p>Dirt devil also includes a two-in-one crevice and brush tool for capturing loose objects that fall out of your pockets into your couch. The tools are friction-fit, instead of snapping in place, but they work about as well as most cheap vacuum accessories and store neatly on the side of the vacuum.</p>
<p>One of our testers advocated for a second-place ranking for this vacuum. If you&#8217;ve got a small apartment or a limited area of carpet to clean, this is a vacuum that will get the job done without any pretentious extra features.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet</a> is an easy-to-steer upright vacuum.</li>
<li>If you need competitive cleaning power on a tight budget, here it is.</li>
<li>A low-profile head makes this easier to get under furniture.</li>
<li>The Razor&#8217;s filter and noise reduction won&#8217;t beat Shark, but it keeps up with Dyson.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Dyson &#8211; Ball Multi Floor 2 is a powerful vacuum with some great design details, but after spending time with all of the vacuums in this lineup, none of our testers really liked using it.</p>
<p>Dyson products are often tricky to review. When Dyson does something well, they usually do it very well. James Dyson revolutionized vacuum cleaners and has been a dominant force since the DC07 was released in 2001. That said, Dyson has never been very competitive with price, and there are some things about this vacuum that are nearly unforgivable.</p>
<p>At about $300, the Ball Multi Floor 2 is a solid performer. We don&#8217;t want to misrepresent the performance numbers: this is clearly the best vacuum for low-pile carpet if all you care about is deep-cleaning. The track is wide, and the suction and agitation get more dirt out —  on average, the Dyson picked up 95 percent of our test samples on carpets where it will actually move effectively.</p>
<p>Dyson also makes an even more expensive vacuum, but it doesn&#8217;t solve the Multi Floor 2&#8217;s biggest problem. The Ball Animal 2 is supposed to have even more power, but if you have high-pile carpet or area rugs that&#8217;s just like throwing gasoline on a fire. Dyson does not design these vacuums for people with multiple floor surfaces.</p>
<p>The Dyson is a few pounds lighter than the Shark &#8211; Apex, but despite all the ingenuity of the rolling-ball design, this is a difficult vacuum to push around and maneuver. Compared to clunky old commercial vacuums from forty years ago the ball is a great idea, but the new swivel-head competitors are much easier to use. Again, the upgrade model from Dyson would just make the problem worse with a bigger and heavier body.</p>
<p>This might be the best upright vacuum for tile floors, since the hard brushroll doesn&#8217;t matter the way it does on hardwood, and the most important feature is suction power in that case. But it&#8217;s clear that any of the choices from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-steam-mop/">steam mop review</a> would be a better tool for cleaning tile floors.</p>

<p>One strange quirk of the new Ball 2 design that you won&#8217;t see in promotional pictures or even most video reviews is the pressure relief vent at the top of the handle.</p>
<p>When you finish vacuuming and push the Dyson up into its standing mode, the suction switches from the brush head to the handle-mounted extension hose automatically. Air starts rushing in through the cap at the top of the handle.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s a bit scary if your hand is on top of the handle when you push it into the standing mode, and it&#8217;s not something we&#8217;d seen on the other Dyson vacuums we&#8217;ve used.</strong> You&#8217;re not going to lose a finger or anything, but it was a turn-off for our testers.</p>
<p>In 2018, Dyson <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/06/dyson-announces-cordless-future-with-end-of-plug-in-vacuums" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced that they&#8217;re no longer developing</a> new plug-in vacuum designs. We chose their V8 cordless stick vacuum as a top pick in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuum review</a>, so we know they&#8217;re on to something, but there are good reasons for many of us to own a conventional upright.</p>
<p>It seems like Dyson never got further than designing around great suction and long hoses. If that&#8217;s your primary concern, then this model or the even more powerful Animal 2 will beat most other vacuums. If you want a vacuum that&#8217;s easy to push and works on other surfaces than low-pile carpet, we suggest looking elsewhere.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07J4R23VJ/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; PowerSpeed NEU180B Upright</a> isn&#8217;t a terrible vacuum. It has good reviews on the retail websites we looked at, with a 4.4 average on Amazon and a good Fakespot grade, as well, so we don&#8217;t suspect those are disingenuous reviews. Many of them seem to be cat owners, so it&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re just easy to please.</p>
<p>But about the best thing we can say about the Eureka, in comparison to the other models we tested, is that it&#8217;s very light. Compared to the Dirt Devil at the same price, or the Shark &#8211; Navigator for about $60 more, it&#8217;s just not at all competitive. Not in pickup, not in maneuverability, not in ease of use, not in noise. It doesn&#8217;t even fit under furniture well.</p>
<p>The Eureka is worthless on long carpet. No, a Dyson isn&#8217;t much better, but that&#8217;s not a good excuse when you advertise &#8220;five height-adjustment settings.&#8221; It turns out that the setting just opens or closes the suction opening at the floor very slightly and directs it away from the brushroll. This vacuum did not work on area rugs or carpet with any kind of long pile.</p>

<p>Upright vacuums are tricky beasts. Just about any upright will do a decent job of getting everyday dirt out of low-pile carpet, and so picking the very best means testing for the most extreme cases. It also means we had to be a little bit more picky about likes and dislikes.</p>
<p>After testing vacuums in a variety of real-world settings and comparing them side-by-side in controlled tests, it&#8217;s clear that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex</a> is the vacuum to beat. Good performance on every surface was definitely a winning trait, and creature comforts like handle-mounted switches didn&#8217;t hurt. The powered lift-away design isn&#8217;t everything that a canister vacuum would be, but it&#8217;s pretty darn close for a two-in-one design.</p>
<p>Even with a runner-up pick, it&#8217;s hard not to feel like we&#8217;re short-changing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Navigator</a>. It&#8217;s small and light, but it packs a lot of power into that compact frame. This value-friendly model is still dust-sealed and quiet, but it doesn&#8217;t have multi-surface power settings or run the brush head in lift-away mode.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for something even cheaper, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet</a> is a budget-friendly underdog that keeps up with the pack. There&#8217;s no dust sealing and it&#8217;s not quiet, but it&#8217;s very maneuverable and picks up dirt well.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter four weeks testing four top-ranked dehumidifiers in the most muggy conditions we could create with a room full of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-humidifier/">humidifiers</a>, we’ve determined that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UWP07LK/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Frigidaire &#8211; FFAD7033R1</a> is the most-efficient, fastest-working and best dehumidifier overall.

If you don’t mind a bit of compressor noise, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073VBWKJZ/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">homeLabs</a> kept humidity levels stable and impressed us as a sturdy performer at a bargain price point.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>One of the challenges when picking a home appliance is the short cycle between updates: every year or two your favorite model will have a new name, and all the reviews on shopping or manufacturer sites will be for a model that’s out-of-date. Worse, there’s often plenty of stock on hand for old models, and pricing goes up and down in a way that’s hard to predict.</p>
<p>We figured out the manufacturer numbering schemes where we could, or faced the hold-music and called a sales rep to find out what was going on with tricky model names.</p>
<p>Discussion board posts comparing different models and options are pretty scarce, but review sites like <a href="http://www.dehumidifierbuyersguide.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dehumidifierbuyersguide.com</a> and <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-dehumidifier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wirecutter</a> agreed about the best model, and Consumer Reports listed an older model from the same manufacturer.</p>
<p>In the end, we bought up-to-date models from the three top-ranked brands on the trustworthy review sites that have comparable specs. We also picked one lesser-known dehumidifier from homeLabs: this dehumidifier is well-ranked on Amazon and has a pretty amazing average rating of 4.7.</p>
<p>We only tested one model with a built-in pump (the Danby) since most manufacturers sell both versions. The pump version can sometimes be hard to track down; fortunately, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000SM342Q/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">an add-on pump</a> is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJwFgi3D-6g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very easy upgrade</a> to any of these machines and will work just as well.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs a dehumidifier?</h2>
<p>There are two obvious applications for dehumidification, but we want to make sure that we’re laying all the cards on the table here: don’t just buy a dehumidifier if you’ve actually got an air conditioning problem.</p>
<h3>First case: the swampy south</h3>
<p>Put simply, if you’ve got a choice between air conditioning and a dehumidifier for a sweltering summer day, choose the air conditioner. Each type of machine is doing the same work — passing your room’s air over a cooling system — but the AC will remove heat from your room, while a dehumidifier only sucks out the water and dumps the heat back in your face.</p>
<p>What if your air conditioner isn’t doing the job? We talked to heating, ventilation and air conditioning professionals, including a project manager at <a href="https://www.siemens.com/global/en/home/products/buildings.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Siemens</a> and the owner of an HVAC company, to find out why some people report better performance running a dehumidifier and an air conditioner at the same time.</p>
<p>“It’s a larger problem than most people realize,” says Richard Ciresi, owner of <a href="https://www.aireserv.com/louisville/?L=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aire Serv Heating &amp; Air Conditioning</a> in Louisville. “First, heating and air conditioning units are sized for the hottest and coldest days of the year.<b> Therefore, on a moderate day they often don’t run long enough to remove the excess moisture from the air. </b>Second, some homeowners and even some contractors still believe in the &#8216;bigger is better&#8217; concept, which further exacerbates the problem.”</p>
<p>If your air conditioner is plus-sized and running at full fan speed, the moisture won’t have a chance to condense on the chiller before the thermostat tells the AC to shut down. Since dry hot air is far more comfortable than humid warm air, you can technically make a room more comfortable in the summer heat by running a dehumidifier if you have this problem.</p>
<p>If there’s an air conditioner anywhere in your equation, though, a dehumidifier is one step forward, two steps back. If your central AC is inefficient or broken, you can buy an efficient window air conditioner for the same price as a dehumidifier, and you’ll use far less energy that way. If you’re renting and can’t stand the heat, talk to your landlord about AC fixes before you spend $200 on a dehumidifier.</p>
<p>Modern air conditioners should also have a “dry” mode that will run at a lower fan speed to maximize the amount of moisture they take out of the air.</p>
<p>A good dehumidifier is less expensive to purchase than most <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-portable-air-conditioner/">portable air conditioners</a>, so if that’s all that fits in your budget and you can’t install a $200 window air conditioner, it’s better than nothing.</p>
<h3>Second case: for your basement</h3>

<p>Anytime you’ve got a lot of moisture in cold air, a dehumidifier shines. Because all the heat that’s made while running is dumped back into the room, these machines turn cold, damp air into warm, dry air. They’re perfect for basements or anyplace else that doesn’t get heat or ventilation.</p>
<p>If you’re in a colder region, you might have a heated basement that stays very dry during the winter, but even a well-drained house can get a damp basement in the late spring after you shut the heat off. If you’ve got an older basement without heat, then you probably know all too well the problems that come from stale, moist air.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a dehumidifier to stop mold and mildew in your basement, the biggest question you need to answer is where you can pump the water to. If you’ve got a floor drain, just about any model will be ideal; if you need to run a hose to a sink, toilet or out a window, then you’ll need a “vertical pump” feature.</p>
<h3>What size should I get?</h3>
<p>Dehumidifiers are rated based on how much water they can theoretically collect from the air in a 24-hour period. Generally, you’ll find 30, 50 and 70-pint models.</p>
<p>After looking at the available models and prices, we decided to test only 70-pint models. <a href="https://www.sylvane.com/choosing-the-right-size-dehumidifier.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There are guides available</a> that try to help you calculate how much capacity you need, but they tend to leave you guessing about how to define your conditions and will often return a recommended capacity that’s not available anyway.</p>
<p>Models capable of removing only 50 pints per day might be slightly smaller, but they don’t typically cost much less and the fans are sometimes actually louder to keep up. Unlike an oversized air conditioner, there’s really no drawback to having a bigger dehumidifier, it just gets you to a target humidity level more quickly.</p>
<p>If saving $50 on an appliance this big is going to be a dealbreaker, then the equivalent 50-pint or 30-pint models should run almost as well as the models we tested.</p>

<p>We put these machines through as much torture as we could in  late-spring southern California. The climate here is fairly dry despite our proximity to the Pacific, but we had a few days of fortuitous rain where we could gauge the usefulness of a dehumidifier in a real-life home environment.</p>
<p>For the hard numbers, though, we had to create some artificial environments in our test location. (We had a house full of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-humidifier/">humidifiers</a> on hand to get the job done.)</p>
<p>All the models we bought and tested included a defrost feature, and we’re a bit sorry (okay, not really) to say that even running late at night in mid-March, southern California isn’t cold or damp enough to freeze up any of these dehumidifiers.</p>
<h3>Controlled performance test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12037" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance.png" alt="controlled performance results" width="2000" height="1218" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance.png 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance-610x371.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance-768x468.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance-885x539.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance-1500x914.png 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance-295x180.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance-1000x609.png 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance-360x219.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance-375x228.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance-414x252.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance-320x195.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance-885x539@2x.png 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>In a 35-square-foot bathroom, we used a high-output humidifier to pump the relative humidity up to 60 percent at 78 degrees. (Not as extreme as a summer day in the Everglades, but enough to gauge the relative performance of each machine without being extravagantly wasteful.)</p>
<p>We set each dehumidifier to bring the relative humidity down to 45 percent, and used an Elitech &#8211; GSP-6 humidity and temperature logger to track how quickly each machine could change humidity in the room.</p>
<p>We also plugged each machine into a Kill-a-Watt electricity meter to measure the number of kilowatt hours consumed over a twenty-minute runtime. Factored with the change-per-minute in room humidity, we can see that the last-place performer needs about 50 percent more power to dry out a room than our top pick.</p>

<p>We set up in our living room late at night and measured the sound pressure level produced by each machine. Our test equipment included a Dayton Audio iMM-6 microphone (spot-checked by our resident audio nerd) patched through Room EQ Wizard.</p>
<p>We mounted the microphone on a stand (about one meter from each dehumidifier) and logged A-weighted decibels over all the different fan settings.</p>
<p>The Frigidaire’s noise results are deceptive, because while the fan is definitely louder than the others at full speed, it almost masked the compressor noise.</p>
<p>Danby’s case was the opposite. The nominal level on the meter was fairly low, but the compressor would buzz and rumble its way from 53.4 up to 55 dBA at times, and the change in noise is more noticeable than those numbers might lead you to believe. Overall, it was the least-pleasant dehumidifier to have running in the house, though not by a huge margin.</p>

<p>For our next set of tests, we set up the machines in our living room and ran them against a big humidifier. We weren’t tracking overall performance in this test so much as how high each model allows the humidity to go before it turns on.</p>
<p>Humidistat settings are in 5 percent increments on each machine, so there’s not much to say about precision. The machines that allowed a wider swing on each side wound up with a closer average accuracy, but if you’re buying a dehumidifier for your priceless antique guitars then that’s not much comfort.</p>
<p>Calibrating how you set the machines against a more-reliable <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AEQ9X9I/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">hygrometer</a> is going to be your best bet if you want stability. We’d say the homeLabs is your best bet for stability, though calibration may vary depending on what day of the week yours rolls off the line.</p>

<p>If you want to run a dehumidifier in close quarters, like an RV or a bedroom, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UWP07LK/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Frigidaire</a> 70 pint with &#8220;Effortless Humidity Control&#8221; is the model least likely to remind you of commercial cooling equipment. This is a well-designed package: a little bit smaller, a lot easier to pick up with its pop-up handle. It’s the best-looking dehumidifier, in our opinion, and all the details come together to make it our favorite.</p>
<p>Efficiency and speedy performance are best-in-class, removing more humidity while drawing less power than the competitors. The Keystone only uses 14 percent more power to do the same job, but it also sounds worse and creates a wider swing in room humidity.</p>
<p>The Frigidaire’s noise isn’t exactly the quietest (the fan moves a lot of air), but the buzzing sound from the compressor is the least pronounced out of all the models we tested.</p>

It's pricier, but the lower noise is great and it's easier to move around. The base model works well if you don’t mind emptying it or have a floor drain, but it’s available with a pump too.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UWP07LK/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Frigidaire is the only manufacturer to include a middle-speed option between low and turbo, which might be the best compromise between noise and performance. It’s another touch that just makes the machine more friendly to use than the others.</p>
<p>If you’re manually emptying your dehumidifier tank (hopefully saving the water, it’s not drinkable but it is distilled) then you’ll find another reason this design shines. While some water buckets are shaped in ways that channel water out of three or four different places while you empty it, Frigidaire uses a splash guard which makes it easier to pour carefully.</p>
<p>While this model has a gravity-fed hose outlet that will work great with a floor drain, the version of this model <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y1M6XPT/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">that has a built-in pump</a> would be our pick for catching the water in a toilet tank. An external pump like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000SM342Q/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Little Giant</a> should work just fine with the base model, too.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Frigidaire’s FFAD7033R1 includes the most powerful “turbo” fan, making this the quickest at removing moisture.</li>
<li>Even with great performance, this is still the most efficient model.</li>
<li>This isn’t the very quietest we tested, but it sounds more like a fan, not a rickety old freezer.</li>
<li>Only basic humidistat modes, but there’s still auto-defrost if you need it.</li>
<li>A compact build and well-designed carrying handle won the day.</li>

<p>This is a fairly unknown brand with a strangely-styled name that you won’t find in brick-and-mortar retailers. We picked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073VBWKJZ/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">homeLabs &#8211; 70-pint dehumidifier</a> to test because it has an astounding 4.7/5 review score, even after 1200 reviews. This listing still has a <a href="https://www.fakespot.com/product/home-70-pint-dehumidifier-energy-star-electric-dehumidifier-machine-for-basement-or-large-room-with-hose-drain-to-remove-mildew-mold-or-odor-safe-large-size-portable-wheels-auto-humidity-control" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fakespot rating of &#8220;A</a>&#8220;, so it seems like people are genuinely happy with this model &#8212; given the class-beating price, we had to check it out.</p>
<p>Let’s not mince words: there’s very little difference between most of the dehumidifiers you can choose from. Internal components probably only come from a few factories, and the similarities between the finished machines reflect that. If you take off the control panels and plastic covers, only the Frigidaire would stand out as a nominally-unique design (and not really much different at that).</p>

<p>That said, homeLabs doesn’t include sophisticated automatic modes like some of the competition, but it’s good at all the important tasks. The humidistat works as it should, cycling on and off as needed to keep room humidity stable.</p>
<p>The swings in room humidity during our tests were actually smallest with this model, only inching up to 1 percent below target humidity before it turned on again and ran down to 10 percent below the target.</p>
<p>The biggest concern we had with the homeLabs is that it comes in only third place for performance and last place for efficiency. It’d take years running every day for most people to see any savings from the efficiency difference of a different model, though, and the performance is still better than the not-much-cheaper 50-pint models you might also be comparing this to.</p>
<p>When we purchased our lineup the price difference between this the homeLabs and our top pick came to $30, but if you compare the average price in the past year homeLabs was $52 less than Frigidaire, mostly because this model sometimes appears in flash sales for a rock-bottom $109.</p>
<p>The Frigidaire is unquestionably nicer to have in the room with you, but if you’re leaving your dehumidifier in an unoccupied basement or crawl space you might not care about the noise difference or slightly-better performance and efficiency at all. A $30 savings will also cover most of the cost of an external pump, if you don’t have a floor drain and want this to run unattended.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Even when it’s not on sale the homeLabs &#8211; HME020031N is the cheapest 70-pint dehumidifier we found.</li>
<li>Solid performance, but not a class leader. Our top pick will be 33 percent more efficient on average.</li>
<li>Steady and stable, with less-dramatic swings in noise and humidity than the others.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CDFESPC/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Keystone</a> ranked second-place for performance and efficiency, so this is a OK choice for about $17 less than our top pick. On the whole, though, there’s not much reason to choose the Keystone over our budget pick.</p>
<p>Keystone covers all the basic dehumidifier functions, and adds a “comfort” mode that turns up the fan when the days are hotter. These sorts of auto-speed features might make a difference if you’re running this in a living space, but the basic humidistat is the only automatic function most people will need.</p>
<p>If you are planning to run a dehumidifier in a space where you’re working or sleeping, you should know that this isn’t as quiet as our top pick. When you crank up both fans, the Frigidaire puts out a few more dB in “whoosh,” but the Keystone’s compressor-noise is definitely a louder buzzing.</p>
<p>This is the only model that has any significant difference between the loudest compressor sounds and the noise it makes when it settles down, but that doesn’t help its rank.</p>
<p>Keystone’s humidistat also allows for the widest swings in humidity, sometimes 7 percent above the target. Coupled with the fairly efficient operation, this might mean it cycles on and off less frequently and saves a little bit more power than other designs, but we don’t consider a wide swing a benefit.</p>
<h3>Danby &#8211; Premiere DDR070BDPWDB</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XQ4PKPN/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Danby &#8211; Premiere</a> dehumidifier comes from a lesser-known Canadian company that specializes in refrigeration and specialty appliances. Note the spelling of “Premiere,” and the no-words-allowed control buttons that are equally confusing in all official Canadian languages.</p>
<p>The similarities between Danby and Keystone’s machines are uncanny: the filter screen from the back of the Keystone will fit in the Danby, and Danby’s bucket slides fairly easily into the Keystone.</p>
<p>The differences in test performance are real, though slight. Danby has made their Premiere model quieter on the low-speed setting than most brands, though the buzz of the compressor is still sharper than Frigidaire’s. When running, this dehumidifier sounds like a slightly-muffled version of the old freezer that sits in your Grandma’s garage.</p>
<p>The biggest difference is a notable lag in performance that was consistent across three tests. Compared to our top pick, this model would need 53 percent more power to remove the same amount of humidity.</p>
<p>There’s always some variability in appliance performance, and we’d expect that the average machine from Danby might be slightly better than the one we got, but that’s not enough to lift it from the bottom of the pile.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XQ425L2/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The pump-included version of this model sometimes goes for $199</a>, so if you need a basement dehumidifier that can dump automatically into a sink this might be your best buy, but most will be better off buying the Frigidaire or our budget pick with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000SM342Q/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">an external pump</a>.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you need a dehumidifier to get rid of your moisture problem and make your home more comfortable, the combination of best efficiency, best performance and least-annoying-sound from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UWP07LK/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Frigidaire</a> is hard to beat. Frigidaire isn’t the price leader in this category, but they’re not far off.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter three weeks using the top six models, 15 hours of lab testing and in-depth consultation with a team of air quality experts, we chose the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8DAYBA/?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Winix &#8211; 5300-2</a> as the best air purifier to keep our lungs clean. Winix runs quietly, plus it features an air quality sensor — the kind of feature that usually only shows up on much more expensive air purifiers. Filters for the Winix are easy to find and affordable. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BTKAPUU?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coway &#8211; 1512</a> is another strong performer, but its filters are available from fewer sources.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We scoured the web for opinions and feedback about the features and qualities that make a good air purifier. From the in-depth discussion on the usual subreddits to the advisory information published by agencies like the California air resources board, there is a lot of good information on the web that discusses the principles of air purification.</p>
<p>Sadly there’s also a lot of hype. Devices like the notorious Ionic Breeze have been making bold claims without hard evidence for a very long time, and it seems like there are always new products appearing with similar claims. Ionizer-type devices can help take particles out of the air if they&#8217;re well-designed, but mostly they dump ozone into your air, and that causes more problems than it solves. It’s bad enough that the CARB has <a href="https://www.arb.ca.gov/research/indoor/ozone.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an entire website of advisories</a> about this kind of device and a registry to help you avoid buying one.</p>
<p>We found that nearly all of the non-ionizer products on the market are high efficiency particulate-arresting-class air filters. HEPA is a classification for filter performance that’s well-established and understood, and the filters used in all of these devices are very similar in construction. (Though not necessarily in size, which determines how much air they can filter at once.)</p>
<p>There is a chance that a cheap air purifier will use “HEPA-like” filters that don’t actually meet that standard, but the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (&#8220;AHAM&#8221;)with their Verifide program are trying hard to make sure that you don’t get stuck with a fake. They test with three categories of pollution: large particles, pollen-size particles and smoke-sized particles.</p>
<p>Since the legit filters are all so similar, the differences between air purifier models, generally speaking, can be reduced to three questions: how much of your room’s air can it push through the filter, how loud is it and how much will it cost you to run?</p>
<p>The first question is also answered by the AHAM&#8217;s <a href="https://ahamverifide.org/ahams-air-filtration-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Verifide program</a>. Most air purifier manufacturers participate in the program, where an independent lab gives each device a “clean air delivery rate” certification. Generally this certificate also advertises a room size that will be effectively cleaned at that rate, based on the tested performance for cleaning smoke particles. You can also <a href="https://www.ahamdir.com/462-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search all certificate listings by recommended room size or other performance parameters</a>.</p>
<p>We picked products in two size categories: CADR 200, which should be effective in rooms up to 320 square feet, and CADR 100, which should be effective for a room smaller than 150 square feet.</p>
<p>We looked closely at retail sites and other reputable reviews from major publications to see what people love and hate about their purifiers, then we looked for devices in our size categories that should be easy to maintain with economical filter refills.</p>

<h2>Types of air contamination</h2>
<p>We spoke to experts who work with the California Air Resources Board to get an idea of what an air purifier can help with. The good news is that air purifiers can definitely help anybody who’s worried about air quality, but they aren’t a cure-all.</p>
<p>There are generally three classes of air pollution, with different effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small particles are the most prevalent form of air pollution. This includes everything from pollen to the soot in smoke, and fortunately this is the easiest class of pollution to clean. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16055881" target="_blank" rel="noopener">At 10 microns, particles are small enough to be easily inhaled</a>, and air quality indexes usually track particles automobile emissions at the 2.5 micron particle size, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8179653/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where it seems to have the most effect on our bodies</a>.</li>
<li>Ultra-fine particles are the very smallest particles, smaller than 0.3 microns. The sources of ultra-fine particles are everywhere, but the effects they have on our health are less well-understood.</li>
<li>Volatile Organic Compounds are basically gas vapors, most of which you can smell. These come from many sources: plastic, food, your dog and the paint on your walls. There are activated carbon filters that can remove VOCs, but if they’re big enough to be effective they will be expensive and need to be replaced frequently. Generally speaking, if you’ve got a source of VOCs that’s a problem, you should get it out of your house or vent the air rather than trying to filter it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some sources of air pollution are more difficult to manage than other. If you live in an area where smog and dust from a nearby freeway is an issue, then closing doors and windows and using an air purifier can make a big difference. If you’re dealing with smells from a nearby sewage treatment plant… there’s not as much you can do except close your windows and hope for the wind to blow the smell somewhere else.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-they-do">What can an air purifier actually do?</h2>
<p>An air purifier is, for the most part, a high-efficiency filter and a fan. Some models add features like static generators to clump particles, and a few include sensor circuits to turn the fan speed up only when it’s needed, but the basic task of cleaning your air is accomplished by moving as much of you room’s air as possible through a filter.</p>
<p>We asked our experts what a HEPA filter will or won’t remove. Does an air purifier capture viruses, for example?</p>
<p>Jeffery Williams, from the <a href="https://www.arb.ca.gov/research/indoor/indoor.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indoor Exposure Assessment Section at the California Air Resources Board</a>, notes that “There’s really no clean-cut answer to that question. The tests for these devices are using a very contrived scenario when they’re quantifying efficiencies. Specific dust sizes are generated and then the amount of dust before and after the filter is measured and you get an efficiency. In the natural world, you’ve got a very broad range of particles; some bacteria and viruses are large enough to get captured, some aren’t. A mechanical filter, like a HEPA filter, will do a good job with particles but not necessarily pull out the odors and VOCs.<b>”</b></p>
<p>While an air purifier can be very effective at removing dust, spores and other bothersome particles that are floating through your room, it can’t do anything about the particles trapped in your upholstery (let alone your pet’s hair).</p>
<p>If you have a home or apartment with airtight windows and doors, an air purifier can pretty easily clean out the dust and air pollution that wafts in when you open your doors, but if you’re moving around and kicking up dust inside the room, things get tricky. The more dust you kick up, the more air you’ll need to move through the filter to keep the air clean.</p>
<p>If you’ve got leaky windows and door, things get even more tricky, with some homes in warmer parts of the world changing the inside air for outside air one or two times per hour.</p>
<p>Most CADR room-size calculations aim for three air changes per hour, so they should be able to keep up with indoor sources of pollution like cooking and infiltration of dirty outside air, but it’s difficult to clean the air in just one “zone” of a house unless you can actually seal it off.</p>
<p>So what’s the hard evidence about health benefits? Jeffery Williams with the Air Resources Board says that there is some evidence that children with asthma in families who use an air purifier have improved sleep quality and fewer clinic visits<b>,</b> but “we don’t see a big difference in terms of symptoms between those that use air cleaners and those that don’t. You can’t say ‘use an air cleaner and your allergies will go away,’ it’s not like that.”</p>
<h2>What to try before you buy an air purifier</h2>
<p><b>Cleaning carpets and furniture: </b>Dust mites, skin cells and other particles accumulate quickly in carpet and upholstery, so vacuuming and cleaning regularly can take care of a lot of the dust that’s in your living space. A vacuum with a HEPA filter or a central <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">vacuum</a> that keeps the dust outside can make an even bigger difference. If you find that your vacuum is cumbersome for regular use, <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum/" rel="noopener">hand-held vacuums</a> can make a big difference in keeping the sofa dust under control.</p>
<p><b>Use your range hood: </b>If you do have an exhaust fan in the range hood above your cooktop, you can avoid filling your home with smoke and exhaust gasses from a natural gas range by turning on the fan when you’re cooking. (If the range hood recirculates air through a basic filter instead of venting it outside, you’ll probably already know that it doesn’t help air quality much.)</p>
<p><b>Pets and allergy solutions: </b>If you’re allergic to your best friend, what can you do? The <a href="http://www.aafa.org/page/pet-dog-cat-allergies.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asthma and Allergy Foundation</a> suggests you can get a little bit of relief by making sure not to give your pet access to your bedroom, but you’re still going to have to keep the rest of your house very clean. An air purifier will help with the dander and other pet-dust that’s floating through the air, but there are still particles in your carpet, upholstery and hiding in your pet’s hair.</p>
<p><b>Don’t smoke inside:</b> An air cleaner will be better than nothing if you’re dealing with second-hand smoke, but there’s really no way to remove the odor of tobacco smoke or all the danger of exposure if it’s in your house.</p>
<p>Barbara Weller, a manager in the Health &amp; Exposure Assessment Branch of the California Air Resources Board, tells us “Second hand smoke is very complex, and there are both larger and smaller particles. An air purifier would remove some but not all of those particles. You can’t take a room where people have been smoking and just run the filter and clean out the room, those second-hand smoke particles adhere to <i>everything</i>. [An air purifier] won’t eliminate the danger of second-hand smoke.”</p>
<p><b>Put out the candles, too:</b> Sadly, the romantic glow of candlelight <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/08/21/candles.air.pollution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also spreads soot and other particles into the air</a>. Soy or Beeswax are better than paraffin, and an air purifier will help manage the smoke that’s in the air, but it’ll be much cleaner if you don’t light them at all.</p>
<p><b>Seal windows and doors:</b> If you’re more concerned about the air quality outside than inside, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjmTlWE-6h8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weather-proofing your doors and windows</a> can keep the infiltration of polluted air to a minimum. Even if you do decide to go with an air purifier to deal with the pollution that comes into your house when you open the door, a well-sealed house will cut down on AC or heating costs.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-pick">How to pick the right air purifier</h2>
<p><b>CADR and room size:</b> Picking the right air purifier for the job is the most important choice. The “Clean Air Delivery Rate” is a lab-tested measurement of the number of cubic feet of air that the purifier can filter per minute: multiply that by 1.5 to get the number of square feet it can easily handle with an 8’ ceiling.</p>
<p>CADR is often listed for dust, allergens and smoke, but the smoke rating is the one to watch when picking a general-purpose air purifier. They tend to be very similar numbers.</p>
<p><b>Types of air cleaning:</b> There are a few different technologies on offer that can help make your air more breathable, but the technology we focused on for this review is HEPA filtration. Filters are effective and fairly economical; other technologies might add some benefits, but they’re either very expensive or they aren’t very effective with large volumes of air.</p>
<p><b>Timers and sensors:</b> If you’re looking for a filter to leave on 24/7, then you’ll want the lowest noise and most energy-efficient model you can get. If you can keep your room sealed from indoor or outdoor pollution except at certain times during the day, though, a timer or an air quality sensor means you won’t be running your air purifier more than necessary.</p>
<p><b>Fan noise:</b> A quiet machine may make a big difference for quality of life, you don’t want to trade air pollution for noise pollution.</p>

<p>We ran each of these air purifiers in a two-bedroom townhouse located near the 55 Freeway in Orange County, California. Air quality isn’t as bad as some parts of the state, but the outside air isn’t great. Our tester also just moved in, and the windows are sadly lacking in weather sealing.</p>
<p>We logged air quality with a Dylos particle counter, which uses lasers to track how many tiny particles are floating through the air: results definitely show an improvement when running an air purifier, even when cooking or with a toddler running around in the same room.</p>
<p>In a 238-square-foot living room, the CADR-100 machines struggled to keep up with heavy activity, though performance wasn’t all that bad during nap time. This casual, real-world testing definitely reinforced to us the importance of picking an appropriately-sized air purifier if you want to keep up with dust and leaky windows.</p>
<p>This testing also showed us the value of having some way of knowing when you need to turn up the fan on your air purifier. If you’re buying for a busy household you might just keep it running on full blast, but it quickly became obvious that that wasn’t necessary if our test-toddler was asleep and nobody was cooking. The Winix and Coway air purifiers, with their built-in air quality sensors, definitely make a lot of sense for someone who doesn’t have a way to test their own air.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>We set up two air-tight testing chambers to run filtration rate tests. We have no reason to be skeptical about the testing done by AHAM and Intertek, but the published clean air delivery rate tests only show performance at the fastest fan speed. We ran controlled tests at both high and low speed settings to see how much performance you’re giving up in order to turn down the noise.</p>

<p>For testing, we introduce controlled pollutants into our sealed test chamber: 10g of titanium dioxide, a very fine white powder that mostly has particles in the 0.3 to 1.0 micron range. (This is the same compound that makes paint white.) We also burned 1.5 grams of Dunhill pipe tobacco (about half a bowl in a small pipe) to generate some ultra-fine smoke particles and see if these devices could be at all effective in cleaning up second-hand smoke.</p>
<p>The Dylos counts both small (.5 micron) and large (10 micron) particles, but we’re publishing the small-particle rates since performance for each was very similar.</p>
<p>We ran two tests for each purifier, at high and low fan speeds, for an hour each. We normalized the start times used values from the logs to give a similar baseline.<br />

<h3>Noise</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11805" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/purifier-noise-chart.png" alt="noise testing chart data" width="2000" height="1716" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/purifier-noise-chart.png 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/purifier-noise-chart-610x523.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/purifier-noise-chart-768x659.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/purifier-noise-chart-885x759.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/purifier-noise-chart-1500x1287.png 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/purifier-noise-chart-295x253.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/purifier-noise-chart-1000x858.png 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/purifier-noise-chart-360x309.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/purifier-noise-chart-375x322.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/purifier-noise-chart-414x355.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/purifier-noise-chart-320x275.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/purifier-noise-chart-885x759@2x.png 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Along with the performance tests, we also checked noise output of each model. We measured the sound pressure level at a 3 foot and 10 foot distance with the lowest and highest fan settings. Testing was done by our resident sound engineer using the REW suite and a calibrated mic, with levels verified against a calibrated SPL meter.</p>
<p>As expected, the noise level was quite high at full blast, but we were pleasantly surprised at how quiet most of these air purifiers are on the lowest fan speed. The Coway really deserves a special mention here: on low settings, both Coway and Winix are so quiet they’re difficult to measure, but the Coway won by a decibel.</p>
<p>At full blast it was Honeywell who had the edge, but this is where it’s important to realize that low noise is typically directly related to a low performance. Honeywell performs better than the others on low, where it’s louder than the competition; on high, it’s quieter and lags behind on air cleaning.</p>
<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>We checked on filter replacement costs to see who is charging the most reasonable price to keep your air purifier running for the long term.</p>
<p>Because filter life will vary depending on how much each filter picks up, we also measured the filter area that the cost of a refill gets you. This is still going to be, largely, a matter of personal preference: like the cabin air filter in your car, most people can use these filters for much longer than the manufacturer rates them for without seeing a change in performance.</p>
<p>The activated carbon component of these filters is, in every machine except the Levoit, a replaceable pre-filter. The pre-filter does double-duty catching hair or big particles (something that could also be done with nylon mesh) and doing a very little bit of work capturing volatile organic compounds. You can read other reviews if you want to see details on how poor these skinny filters are at capturing smells or fumes.</p>
<p>If you have the option of buying a replacement HEPA filter and not replacing the carbon filter, you could cut down your filter cost significantly. On the other hand, if you’re willing to trade a little bit of airflow for slightly-better-but-still-negligible performance with VOCs, one Amazon purchaser has claimed success stacking the carbon prefilters to get more active surface area.</p>

<p>In any case, the life of a HEPA-type mechanical filter is as long as you’re willing to put up with the performance it offers. When it catches a lot of particles it will start to literally clog up; new particles are still captured, but it will take more time and electricity for your purifier to filter the air in your room. Unless you’re using it in a dog kennel or a woodworking shop, though, you can probably run the same filter for much longer than one year.</p>
<p>We also verified the kilowatt-hours of electricity each machine uses on highest and lowest speed to see what the long-term cost of ownership will be. We calculated the cost based on 20 hours/day of low-speed and 4 hours/day of high-speed use. That’s close to a worst-case cost scenario, since hopefully you’ll be able to turn each machine completely off after running it for a few hours a couple of times per day.

<p>Winix has a competition-blasting air purifier in their <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8DAYBA/?tag=ybdpur-20">5300-2</a>. Leveraging a big HEPA filter with an efficient and quiet fan, this machine is cheap to run and quiet enough that you might not even know it’s there. Even if you have a smaller room, this is our pick.</p>
<p>Simply put, this is a good price for a HEPA-type air purifier that’s certified to clean a room of up to 360 square feet. That’s 2,880 cubic feet of air, and the Winix will circulate that much through the filter more than four times in an hour at top speed. That in and of itself is not remarkable: HEPA filters are all basically the same, and this size class is a popular one since it will clean most living rooms easily and a bedroom even more quickly.</p>
<p>The big price-hike for air purifiers of this size tends to occur when a manufacturer includes an air quality sensor and Wi-Fi. Honeywell and Whirlpool are offering their no-sensor big-room filters for about $150, while Dyson, Blueair and Philips add sensors and a Wi-Fi connection for about $200 more. For the same price as the “dumb” purifiers Winix offers an air quality sensor to automatically turn up the fan, but it will never ask you to reset your router.</p>

This is one of the best-performing machines in its class, and it’s cheaper to run it all the time than many much smaller competitors.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8DAYBA/?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Coway is the other value-leader, but their 1512HH still typically costs $100 more than the Winix with the same features. Performance is basically the same; Winix uses a few watts more electricity when it’s sitting on the lowest speed, but it makes up the difference quickly by using 15 fewer watts at full blast without sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>The filters cost nearly the same on Amazon, and there are far more places we found selling Winix-compatible refills. The Coway filter does offer slightly more surface area when you measure the depth of the pleats, but if you’re replacing filters at the recommended rate of once per year you’d probably never get even close to clogging either brand.</p>

<p>The biggest difference we saw between Winix and Coway in day-to-day testing is that Coway has tweaked their auto-speed system to run at high speed for slightly longer at bigger intervals. While the Winix purifier sped up for a few minutes, slowed down, then sped up again five minutes later if there was still dust moving around the room, Coway’s speed controller will turn up the fan for five minutes at a time with longer breaks.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to control the individual particles that flow past the tiny sensors on these machines so we couldn&#8217;t really test their accuracy, but in our day-to-day use both purifiers turned on when we expected and didn’t seem wasteful.</p>
<p>Winix and Coway are both using an electrostatic ion generator of some kind to boost efficiency. (Winix calls it “PlasmaWave.”) Based on the performance differences with the filter-only Honeywell machine it does seem like the effect could be significant, and if Winix’s ion generator is slightly more efficient it would explain the slight edge they have shown in our test and the tests run by The Wirecutter.</p>
<p>PlasmaWave only drew 10 watts more when we turned it on, and the CARB approval certification means it isn’t creating ozone at nuisance or harmful levels the way some machines do with this type of system.</p>
<p>If you want a few perks, Winix also makes the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8DAYII/?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">5500-2</a>, which has a remote and will auto-dim the control panel when you turn off your lights. The price for the two models is often identical, so if you have a very long walk to the other side of your bedroom and you think you’ll want to turn the machine on or off when going to bed maybe that will be worth seeking out. The 5500-2 has a listed filter refill that’s slightly different, but based on the certified performance rating we can’t imagine how the real-world performance would be any different.</p>
<p>The 5300-2 has a “night” feature that turns off the control panel lights, but it only works in the auto-speed mode. You’ll have to ignore or cover up the lights if you want to leave the fan running on a constant speed to make background noise while you fall asleep.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Winix &#8211; 5300-2 took top spot for air-cleaning performance, though only by a hair.</li>
<li>The noise output is second quietest, but that was also a close race. It also plays a friendly song when you turn it on or off.</li>
<li>Winix’s power efficiency is the best we’ve seen.</li>
<li>Replacement filters for the 5300-2 are competitively priced and easy to find.</li>
<li>An auto-speed system turns up the fan only when it’s needed, which means it saves power and doesn’t make unnecessary noise.</li>
<li>If you have a 24”-by-15” spot for it, there’s not much reason to buy a smaller machine. If you need more capacity, buy two.</li>
</ul>

<p>Coway has garnered a lot of positive press and good will with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BTKAPUU?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AP-1512HH</a>. This is, by all accounts, a great air purifier. At the end of the day, though, any advantages it has over the Winix 5300 are slim at best, and the purchase cost is higher.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for the very quietest machine you can possibly find that still has room-clearing performance when you need it, Coway manages to have an ever-so-slightly slower fan at its lowest speed. It’s just a hair quieter, draws 2 watts less electricity, and will take a few minutes more to clear out particles. On highest speed, Coway and Winix are indistinguishable for noise levels, though Winix is cleaning very slightly faster and with 15 fewer watts used.</p>

<p>We should note that the air delivery rating from AHAM’s certified test is a whole cubic-foot-per-minute higher for Coway than it is for Winix, so there’s undoubtedly enough margin of error in our testing that you can call it a wash. The time to clear 50% of the particles in a sealed room is close enough between the two that you’d need to count by the second, and our testing tool only logs by the minute.</p>
<p>The Wirecutter has recommended Coway’s air purifier for years, and it seems they mostly picked Coway over Winix because those filters are slightly more expensive than Coway’s if you’re buying from the manufacturer directly. Shopping around, the price difference all but disappears. If you’re worried about getting genuine refills, Home Depot also has the <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Winix-True-HEPA-4-Filter-Activated-Carbon-Replacement-Filter-A-115115/202034412" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Winix filters for less</a>, and Coway filters are hard to find outside of one probably-authentic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C7WMQTW/?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon listing</a>.</p>
<p>If you find Coway’s model on sale and you like the shorter-but-deeper shape, it’s a great air purifier, but it’s so similar to the Winix in performance and features that looks are probably the only reason you’d prefer it.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Coway &#8211; AP-1512HH runs neck-and-neck with the Winix in every category but cost.</li>
<li>This fan is so quiet on low speed we were a bit shocked to see how well it’s still filtering.</li>
<li>Power efficiency is slightly worse on the highest speed, but it would only add a few dollars to your power bill over a year compared to the Winix.</li>
<li>Compared to Winix, Coway replacement filters are not as readily available in the U.S.</li>

<p>Honeywell has one of the biggest and best-known lineups in this product category, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BWYO3EM/?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HPA200</a> is the machine in that line that matches the 310-square-foot capacity bracket of the other bestsellers and top picks we tested.</p>
<p>This is a capable air purifier. The filter quality is as good as any other we’ve seen, though Honeywell uses two small filters to allow compatibility of refills across the entire HPA line. Literally, each step up from HPA100 to HPA200 to HPA300 adds 155 square feet of capacity by adding another 6”-by-10” filter and 100 CFM worth of fan output. This is a neat inventory management trick, but it almost certainly hurts the efficiency of the air purifiers themselves. The economy-of-scale effect isn’t reflected in the price of filter refills, either.</p>
<p>On high speed, the HPA200 is a little bit quieter than our top pick, but it’s also moving a bit less air. It uses more power to do so, probably because of the shape of the baffle used to create a good seal around two rectangular filters.</p>
<p>On low speed, Honeywell has made the opposite compromise: the fan runs faster, makes more noise, and still uses more power than our top pick. That means it’s doing more work when it’s on the lowest setting, but the Winix will save significant watts using the auto-speed air quality sensor to turn up the fan and use power when it’s really needed.</p>
<p>If the Honeywell were a significantly cheaper machine to buy than the Winix, it might be worth picking it up to use only occasionally for solid and reliable performance. Tracking the price, though, Honeywell is almost never cheaper than the Winix. Our top pick goes on sale a few times a year for even less than its already-great average price.</p>

<p>If you really don’t have space for a 24” x 15” tower fan, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VGIGVY/?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GermGuardian &#8211; AC4825</a> is slimmer, though not much shorter. On high speed it’s the quietest machine with adequate performance for a small room.</p>
<p>The GermGuardian is a relatively good air purifier for $80 (it’s far more effective than Levoit’s under-powered model). Compared to our top pick, though, the $70 price difference disappears within two years if you use the GermGuardian all day every day and replace the filter after six to eight months as the manufacturer recommends. If you can fit the extra width in your room and budget an additional $70 up front, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8DAYBA/?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Winix</a> will be a far more efficient and easy-to-use machine.</p>
<p>Compared to the Winix, GermGuardian lacks the auto-speed feature, and the filters are more expensive despite being only one-third as big. On low speed it’s actually louder than the Winix and draws six times more electricity. The small filter and fan also gives more of a “whistle” than “whoosh” sound, and that might annoy some.</p>

It comes at a lower price point, but its pricey replacement filters can soon erode that savings.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VGIGVY/?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If your budget is tight and you just need something while contractors make plaster dust renovating the next-door apartment for a week, this will clean the air in a 100-square-foot bedroom relatively well. The long-term cost of filters and electricity, though, give us pause.</p>
<p>The fact that this machine isn’t certified and listed by independent tests from the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers is concerning, though Guardian Technologies claims to use the same testing methodology for the “100+” CADR rating they list in the manual. Its performance matches the AHAM-listed Honeywell in our testing, so we don’t have too many doubts about the claim.</p>
<p>Banking on a UV-light “germ killing” feature to attract buyers is also a turn-off, as much as we’d love to live in a world where a simple appliance can keep you from getting sick. We asked our experts at the Air Resources board about UV sterilizers, and here’s what Jeffery had to say:</p>
<p>“As far as efficacy, it depends on [how long the organism is sitting] under the light. The UV light damages the DNA, so if the light is pretty bright and the airflow is slow enough in that part of the device then it can reduce the number of viable bacteria or viruses; it gets rid of some, but not all. Some spores, for example, are very resistant to UV. In general, it can help.”</p>
<p>Barbara Weller was quick to add, though: “you really are better off cleaning surfaces, washing hands, getting rest and a good diet so you’re as healthy as possible. Healthy habits will be a lot more effective than [a UV lamp in an air cleaner] at reducing flu in your home.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BWYO2FW/?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Honeywell’s HPA100</a> is literally a sized-down version of the bigger 200 and 300 models; it even takes the same filters refills as the bigger models, but only uses one at a time. (The carbon pre-filter is smaller, but you can fold the big sheet to fit if you buy the wrong refill.)</p>
<p>If you can grab this when it goes on sale for $80 or so, this might be a worthwhile purchase for a small room where space is limited. At the $105 average price, though, it’s not a good value. It costs almost as much to run as its big brother, and quite a bit more than our top pick (since it uses four times more electricity just to idle.)</p>
<p>In use, this is only a tiny bit louder than the GermGuardian, and its performance was almost identical. It’s not necessarily as easy to fit in a room, though, and we prefer the simple “I, II, III” rotary switch on the GermGuardian to the cryptic “germ, allergy, general, turbo” scale Honeywell uses their touch panel.</p>
<h3>Levoit &#8211; LV-H132</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-11728 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/levoit-lv-h132.jpg" alt="Levoit's LV-H132 purifier on a side table" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/levoit-lv-h132.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/levoit-lv-h132-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/levoit-lv-h132-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/levoit-lv-h132-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/levoit-lv-h132-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/levoit-lv-h132-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/levoit-lv-h132-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/levoit-lv-h132-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/levoit-lv-h132-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/levoit-lv-h132-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/levoit-lv-h132-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/levoit-lv-h132-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Levoit is a fairly new player in the home appliance field, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B071D58ZY5/?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LV-H132</a> has gained a lot of positive buzz since it launched last year. It’s a quiet and attractive device, with thoughtful features: there’s a blue night-light, but also a no-light mode for those of us who hate the tiny LEDs that plague our bedrooms. The filter also seems well-built and it should last as long as Honeywell’s for half the replacement cost.</p>
<p>The low noise output and power draw from this air purifier, though, seems to be an indication that it simply isn’t trying to move as much air as other devices we tested. Levoit lists “100 CFM” in the manual and some advertising copy, and if that were true it would probably match the performance of the Honeywell and GermGuardian, but given the performance we saw in testing and the low noise and power draw it’s moving far less air than that.</p>
<p>It’s not entirely surprising that a new, small company that’s flying under the appliance-manufacturing radar wouldn’t work as hard to get certification from AHAM’s Verifide program. The Guardian company certainly doesn’t seem in a hurry to get on the list, and their device is widely heralded as a great pick. Levoit’s performance, though, seems like a pretty clear case of over-rating a device and hoping nobody checks. We’re thankful we didn’t spend a lot of time testing their bigger, more expensive “CADR 135+” PUR131 model.</p>
<p>We reached out to Levoit for comment, and their engineers didn’t think we got a unit with defective electronics or anything else that would cause a sub-standard test result; they didn’t directly comment on the result, either.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>There are a lot of lessons we learned about what air purifiers can and can’t do, but we’re impressed by the abilities these machines have when doing their main job, cleaning most of the particles out of your air. If you live in a place with bad outdoor air quality, or if you’ve got a lot of things inside that are making your indoor air quality worse, then any of these machines will make a difference.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8DAYBA/?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Winix has a great air purifier in the 5300-2</a>, but it’s the auto-speed sensor that really makes it our top pick. Without lab equipment it might be hard to guess when you should have an air purifier turned all the way up and when it can sit at low speed; Winix takes care of that for you, and you can trust that it’ll clean your air as fast as anything else.</p>
<p>You can get faster performance for really big rooms if you buy a giant machine with four times more fan power and filter area, but most of us would probably be better off (and definitely save money) buying three or four of this model to take care of hotspots.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BTKAPUU?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The runner-up from Coway</a> is in most respects an equivalent machine. We’re a little bit happy that it’s more expensive and that it isn’t as easy to find Coway filters, since that makes picking the Winix as our winner even easier.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter five weeks of testing humidity output and evaluating day-to-day usability of nine top products, we picked the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077H19VJ6?tag=ybdhumid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Honeywell &#8211; HEV620</a> as the best humidifier. Honeywell’s biggest humidifier is easy to fill and clean, and it has a humidistat that keeps even a spacious room at a stable humidity. Its wicking-filter evaporative system also works great with any kind of water. Our top pick for cough relief is the compact ultrasonic-type<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MOI5QUU?tag=ybdhumid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Vicks &#8211; VUL520</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>To track down the best humidifiers, we checked in with discussion groups and buyer reviews, looking for real-world results from the driest parts of the continent.</p>
<p>When we found reviews from major publications, they were fairly polarized, with Consumer Reports favoring the inexpensive ultrasonic models and Wirecutter sticking to tried-and-true evaporative humidifiers that use replaceable filters.</p>
<p>Typically we filter our initial product list by customer-review averages to weed out models with reliability or quality-control problems. We look for scores well above four stars, but almost all of the models recommended by other major roundups have Amazon customer ratings below four.</p>
<p>It’s scary when you realize that a product category has worse average scores than the oft-maligned inkjet printers. What makes so many people leave low-score reviews for their humidifiers?</p>
<p>Almost every negative humidifier review brings up an issue with something growing in or around the wet parts of the machine over time, be that mold on a filter or algae inside the tank. In the end, we tried to prioritize models that are the easiest to clean so that maintenance isn’t difficult.</p>

<h2 id="types">Two types of humidifiers</h2>
<h3>Evaporative</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11311" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/honeywell-wicking-filter.jpg" alt="Honeywell HEV620b's wicking filter" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/honeywell-wicking-filter.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/honeywell-wicking-filter-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/honeywell-wicking-filter-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/honeywell-wicking-filter-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/honeywell-wicking-filter-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/honeywell-wicking-filter-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/honeywell-wicking-filter-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/honeywell-wicking-filter-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/honeywell-wicking-filter-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/honeywell-wicking-filter-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/honeywell-wicking-filter-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Evaporative humidifiers use a large sponge-like filter to “wick” water out of the reservoir and allow air to pass through, meaning that there’s also a fairly big fan in all of these models that makes some noise. The vapor is invisible rather than the billowing cloud you get with an ultrasonic type, but it’s still a cool mist rather than steam.</p>
<p>The biggest benefit to this kind of humidifier is that because air has a limited capacity for holding moisture, evaporation works quickly when your air is dry, but a machine like this can’t easily oversaturate air that’s already humid.</p>
<p>The downside is that the filter will collect all the minerals in your tap water and eventually become crusty, if not brown. Plan on replacing a filter every 30-60 days if you’re using your humidifier daily.</p>
<p>If you leave the machine turned off for a week when there’s still water in it, non-mineral things will probably be growing in that filter, too. You should always let the filter dry, and put the machine away if you’re not using it.</p>
<h3>Ultrasonic</h3>
<p>Also called “nebulizers,” these humidifiers use tiny vibration pulses to force water into a safe, cool mist that looks like steam. Next, a tiny fan pushes the vapor out into your room. These machines are nearly silent, and we could watch the mist rising, settling and swirling around for hours.</p>
<p>The downside for an ultrasonic humidifier is that it makes the same amount of vapor no matter how damp your air is already, which means if the air is already saturated you’ll start to see a puddle under the machine.</p>
<p>The vapor also contains the same stuff that’s in your water — mineral or otherwise — which means hard water spots on your mirrors or potentially bigger problems if your water has other stuff in it. If you don&#8217;t trust your tap water, then using distilled water is definitely a good idea. Some manufacturers, however, sell filters to collect minerals before they’re &#8220;uploaded to the cloud.”</p>
<p>The worst problems with ultrasonic humidifiers come from letting the tank get dirty. Rinsing the tank out every week with vinegar will make a big difference. But if you can’t get in there with a sponge or scrubber, it doesn’t take much algae growth to ruin a machine.</p>
<h3>The dilemma</h3>
<p>Using distilled water and cleaning diligently will solve any concerns for ultrasonic models. If you’re buying distilled water at 90 cents per gallon and using the humidifier constantly, the $12 filters (which should last at least a month) in an evaporative type will probably be a better value proposition in the long run.</p>
<p>Really, it’s a preference decision you have to make: Would you rather stock up on water or filters every season?</p>
<h2>Buying a humidifier for babies</h2>
<p>Beyond improving comfort in extra-dry climates, the main reason people pick up a humidifier is for croup or other painful coughs, especially in infants and small children.</p>
<p>Studies haven’t clearly demonstrated improved outcomes <a href="http://cochranelibrary-wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002870.pub2/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in settings like emergency rooms</a>, but many <a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/the-scope/shows.php?shows=0_bo3b8lay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pediatricians recommend humidifiers</a> for home treatment of symptoms. Whether it’s actually changing recovery time or not, most people feel more comfortable with moist air when they have a sore throat.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/expert-answers/cool-mist-humidifiers/faq-20058199" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warm mist hasn’t been shown to do anything different</a> than cool mist for symptoms, so the once-popular steam machines have mostly disappeared since there are burn and fire risks with a heating element and hot steam around. If you really like the feel of heated mist, our upgrade pick does include this as an optional mode, but be careful not to expose infants to the heated mist directly.</p>
<p>The main thing to note if you’re buying a humidifier for your health is to be aware of potential risks from a neglected machine. <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/5046.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The consumer product safety council has even issued a strongly worded advisory</a> about keeping your humidifier clean.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s recommended using a disinfectant like vinegar to clean your humidifier, you should always rinse it thoroughly with water. Never add anything you don’t want to breathe into your humidifier water: Disinfectants designed to be added during use were once popular in South Korea, but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5081304/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widespread reports of lung problems</a> led to a ban in 2011.</p>
<p>One <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21199854/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case study of an infant developing lung problems</a> after prolonged use of an ultrasonic-type humidifier with mineral-heavy water is especially sobering. Using distilled water and thoroughly cleaning your humidifier tank will help eliminate risks, and that’s why we reward easy cleaning so much in our rankings.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>A humidistat</b>: If you want to set-and-forget a humidifier, this is an essential feature. Just like a thermostat that turns on heat or AC when the temperature changes, a humidistat turns on a humidifier when the room gets dry.</p>
<p><b>Tank size:</b> A bigger tank means less-frequent filling if you’re running a humidifier all the time, but it will also make the unit heavier and trickier to find a place for. If you’re only buying a humidifier for temporary use, a smaller model might be the way to go.</p>
<p><b>Rate controls:</b> If you don’t have a humidistat to automatically turn the humidifier on and off, a way to turn down the mist when the air outside is extra cold will help keep condensation off your windows.</p>
<p><b>Easy-cleaning water tank</b>: The worst problems reported by humidifier users are cases of things growing in the tank. Rinsing occasionally with vinegar usually keeps things sanitary, but it’s much easier to clean a tank if you can fit your hand inside the filler hole.</p>
<p><b>Nightlights:</b> A few of these humidifiers feature a separate control for turning on a light under the tank. Fortunately, you can also use them without a light if that’s just going to keep you up at night.</p>
<p><b>Oil diffusion:</b> While none of these humidifiers can disperse essential oils the way <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-essential-oil-diffuser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a dedicated diffuser can</a>, some models allow you to add drops of essential oils to a separate pad, where they evaporate and blend in with the humidifier mist.</p>

<p>For our small humidifier tests, we prepped a 35-square-foot bathroom by running a dehumidifier until our Elitech &#8211; GSP-6 humidity meter showed a bone-dry 22-percent relative humidity at a toasty 80 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>At that point we started our meter and recorded changes in room humidity as the humidifiers ran for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>If you’re just looking to improve the humidity in your bedroom or your baby’s nursery, note that all of the top performers will add moisture to the air at about the same rate, and even the worst-performing models can get a dry room above 40 percent in less than half an hour.</p>

<p>For larger machines, we were most concerned about their ability to hold humidity stable in a 400-square-foot space by using a “humidistat” sensor that turns on the machine when the room gets dry.</p>
<p>This case is a little more tricky, since we were testing in a large room not sealed off from the rest of the house. The Honeywell is the only evaporative humidifier in this group, and its big fan distributed moisture in the dry room much more quickly than the ultrasonic models.</p>
<p>We put our sensor at one end of the room and a dehumidifier at the other, with the tested humidifier adding moisture in the middle.</p>
<p>The Honeywell was also the only machine to overshoot the relative humidity target by more than five percent, while the others were very accurate.</p>
<p>We tracked how close these machines could hold a room’s humidity to the target, running a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-dehumidifier/">dehumidifier</a> for two minutes every 30 minutes to offset any differences in ambient humidity or temperature.</p>
<p>After two hours of tracking the humidity in the room, we found that they were all fairly good at maintaining the set humidity, though none were especially good at displaying an accurate number for us to see. It seems that the calibration for the on/off points is separate from the numbers shown on the display.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11432" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/humidistat-accuracy-data.png" alt="humidistat accuracy testing" width="2000" height="1151" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/humidistat-accuracy-data.png 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/humidistat-accuracy-data-610x351.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/humidistat-accuracy-data-768x442.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/humidistat-accuracy-data-885x509.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/humidistat-accuracy-data-1500x863.png 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/humidistat-accuracy-data-295x170.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/humidistat-accuracy-data-1000x576.png 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/humidistat-accuracy-data-360x207.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/humidistat-accuracy-data-375x216.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/humidistat-accuracy-data-414x238.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/humidistat-accuracy-data-320x184.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The big surprise was that the Honeywell’s display was only accurate when it was running. When the fan was adding humidity to the air, the display reading was typically within two percentage points of our hand-held tester. Once the fan stopped, though, the display quickly counted up to about 10 percent above what our testing meter showed.</p>
<p>The ultrasonic humidifiers with humidistats did very well for accuracy; the <i>displayed </i>humidity was always off, but our testing monitor showed that they successfully maintained the average humidity of the room at the target level even better than the Honeywell did.</p>
<h3>Ease of cleaning</h3>

<p>This wound up being the most conclusive test we ran. You probably won’t notice the difference between keeping a room at 40 percent and 45 percent relative humidity, but you will definitely notice a tank you can’t clean. (Especially if you’re unfortunate enough to find mold or algae growing in it.)</p>
<p>We filled, emptied and tried to scrub the inside of each tank a few times over our five weeks of testing. The biggest difference is one that’s almost impossible to see in advertising for a humidifier, but readily apparent when you’re filling them: Some of these tanks have tiny fill openings that you can’t even get a bottle brush into.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are a few standout winners in this category. Honeywell and Vicks (both owned by Kaz USA) seem to know well that consumers want to be able to clean their humidifiers. Except for the Vicks &#8211; V700, each of the models from this company offers an opening big enough to get your hand through.</p>
<p>The other standout winner in this test was the Levoit, though it’s also the most expensive.</p>
<p>The hardest models to clean, without question, had pointy-shaped tops. Pure Enrichment and Crane don’t give you a very large opening to begin with, but even if you could fit a bottle brush inside, it would be impossible to effectively scrub all the corners.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Top pick: Honeywell &#8211; HEV620</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077H19VJ6?tag=ybdhumid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Honeywell’s HEV620</a> is a smart, capable, easy-to-use machine. It’s tall, so plan on giving it some floor space in the corner, but it doesn’t have a very big footprint compared to Honeywell’s other large humidifiers. It will happily blend into the background and dispense humidity as needed, without flashy fog shows to draw your attention.</p>
<p>The best thing about this humidifier is its tank. Even with almost two gallons of capacity, it’s shaped just right to fill in a kitchen sink. Better yet, you can fill it directly from a water pitcher while it’s sitting in the machine, since there’s a grate-style lid instead of a completely closed top.</p>
<p>The best thing about the grate-style lid is that you can take it off and wipe down the inside of the tank without any trouble. Filling the tank, cleaning it periodically and drying it for storage are all very easy.</p>
<p>This type of humidifier does rely on a fan to get the moisture into your air, so if you’re looking for something silent you’ll want to check out our upgrade pick. Honeywell uses a quiet fan, but it&#8217;s definitely noticeable when running on high speed.</p>
<p>This was the only evaporative-style humidifier we found with a timer or humidistat, and the fact that the tank is so much better than most makes it easy to forgive the need for occasional maintenance of the filter.</p>

It’s easy to keep filled, it mostly takes care of itself and maintenance is simple.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077H19VJ6/?tag=ybdhumid-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The filter, then, is really the only reason you might not like this machine. The Honeywell will remind you to check it every 30 days. Replacements can sometime be tricky to find (they’re back-ordered at some retailers as we publish this review, but available <a href="https://www.replacementfilters.com/honeywell-replacement-humidifier-wicking-filter-filter-t.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from this filter shop</a> and <a href="https://www.honeywellpluggedin.com/filters-and-accessories/honeywell-replacement-humidifier-wicking-filter-filter-t" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Honeywell&#8217;s store</a> at better prices than Amazon typically has).</p>
<p>If you flip the filter every week (so one side isn’t always absorbing more minerals than the other), you can keep them going longer. The manual suggests soaking to loosen buildup, but if you’ve got rust in your water you’ll probably want to replace your filter every month.</p>
<p>The accuracy of Honeywell’s humidistat is good, but the way it works means it’s not exactly laboratory-grade. If you just want to let the Honeywell maintain a room’s humidity, it works well, but you have to run the fan for a few minutes to get an accurate display of the room’s humidity.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Honeywell &#8211; HEV620 has a giant tank to run for a long time in the driest climates.</li>
<li>A humidistat means you don’t have to turn this on and off all the time: It knows when it’s needed.</li>
<li>The giant reservoir is also the easiest to fill and clean, which makes a big difference for long-term life of the machine.</li>
<li>The filter will need replacing eventually, but you don’t have to worry about water spots or buying special water.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want a high-capacity humidifier to treat a large room, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MYGNGKK/?tag=ybdhumid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Levoit &#8211; LV600HH</a> is our pick for a model that doesn’t use filters. It had no trouble keeping up in a 400-square-foot room, though it can’t pump out moisture as quickly as the Honeywell in a performance test.</p>
<p>All the essential qualities and features are covered: The reserve tank is easy to fill and clean, the humidistat was the best we tested at keeping humidity at a stable average and Levoit also makes (in our opinion) the best-looking humidifier.</p>
<p>The electronic controls, sadly, are a bit complex: Don’t throw away the manual if you want to use this machine to its full potential. The “auto” button works well to get your room up to 68- percent relative humidity (which is the <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/File%20Library/Technical%20Resources/Technical%20FAQs/TC-04.03-FAQ-12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest level recommended for indoor air</a>), but most people are going to be better off at around 45-55 percent. (Go lower if you see <i>any</i> condensation on your windows or walls in the winter.) Skip the auto setting and tap the “water drop” button until it shows your target level.</p>

<p>While the humidistat is very good at keeping the average humidity level you set, according to our instruments the display reads eight percent lower than the actual room humidity.</p>
<p>Heated mist is a feature that’s becoming hard to find because of fire hazard concerns. The Levoit has auto-shutoff features, but you should never leave the machine unattended when it’s heating, just in case something goes wrong. Also note that we didn’t find any evidence that heated mist is any better for your symptoms — it’s a nice perk on a cold day, though.</p>
<p>The <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-essential-oil-diffuser/">essential-oil diffuser</a> built into this model works just like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001MABUS8/?tag=ybdhumid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a fan-drawn diffuser</a>, so it won’t heat up your oil like the Vicks model does with the VapoPad holder. Diffuser options might not be a big deal, if you haven’t already bought a dozen bottles of oil blends from your EO-enthusiast friends. But if you’ve thought about buying a diffuser and a humidifier, this model does double-duty.</p>
<p>As with any ultrasonic-type humidifier, this machine will spray whatever’s in the water into your air. If you’ve got hard water that leaves deposits around all your sink fixtures, this type of humidifier will probably cause spots and white dust to appear on glass or metal surfaces.</p>
<p>If you’ve already got mineral-free water, though, the fact that there are no filters to replace means this will wind up being cheaper than the Honeywell after a few months of steady use.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Levoit &#8211; LV600HH is an ultrasonic-type with all the bells and whistles.</li>
<li>It has the most accurate humidistat we found for set-and-forget operation.</li>
<li>Optional heated mist makes you feel better, even if it’s not medically significant.</li>
<li>Essential oil lovers will like the evaporator pad, though it’s not exactly a diffuser.</li>
<li>The tank is fairly easy to fill and clean and holds almost as much water as our top pick.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bedrooms">Best for bedrooms and babies: Vicks &#8211; VUL520</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/vicks-animation2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>If you’re looking for an inexpensive bedroom-sized humidifier that won’t need replacement filters, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MOI5QUU?tag=ybdhumid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">VUL520</a> from Vicks is our pick.</p>
<p>For parents dealing with croup or other throat infection, <a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/the-scope/shows.php?shows=0_bo3b8lay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a humidifier is one of the first recommendations you’ll typically get from a pediatrician.</a></p>
<p>This model’s half-gallon capacity won’t last for more than one night, but it makes up for that by being easy to carry, fill and set up. The compact size means it’ll be easier to find a place to store it when your babies feel better.</p>
<p>Unlike the evaporative-style humidifiers, this is basically silent. The ultrasonic parts and the little fans make a quiet buzz, but the Vicks doesn’t rely on moving significant amounts of air like the Honeywell &#8211; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016ZACZ88?tag=ybdhumid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HEV320</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077H19VJ6?tag=ybdhumid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HEV620</a> do.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MOI5QUU/?tag=ybdhumid-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Vicks-VUL520-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Vicks-VUL520-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Vicks-VUL520-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Vicks-VUL520-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Vicks-VUL520-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Vicks-VUL520-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Vicks-VUL520-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Vicks-VUL520-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Vicks-VUL520.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Small Room Pick: Vicks - VUL520</h3><p>This is a compact ultrasonic model that does its job well. The feature that seals the deal for us? You can actually clean it, unlike most other models this size.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MOI5QUU/?tag=ybdhumid-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>For a short-term humidity boost in a bedroom, the Vicks gives you everything you need. There’s even a slot for Vicks VapoPads (one freebie included), which gives you the benefits of VapoRub without spreading grease on your skin. This works just like a heated plug-in essential-oil diffuser, so there’s no reason you couldn’t put other essential oils on a VapoPad after the menthol/eucalyptus scent fades.</p>
<p>Cleaning really set the 520 apart from other small ultrasonic humidifiers. There are a few corners inside the tank that are harder to scrub, but most people will be able to easily fit a hand inside to wipe it down.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Vicks &#8211; VUL520 is an ultrasonic-type, so it’s nearly silent and doesn’t have a filter to maintain.</li>
<li>The compact size means this is easy to store, perfect for those buying because of croup or a bad cough.</li>
<li>Of the inexpensive models, this was definitely the easiest to clean.</li>
<li>Optional VapoPads are a bit of a gimmick, but grandmas swear by that stuff.</li>
<li>Everything that’s in the water will go into the air, so distilled water is recommended.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Another large humidifier: TaoTronics &#8211; TTAH001</h3>
<p>We tried three larger models with humidistat functions, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JYIAUEY?tag=ybdhumid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TaoTronics &#8211; TTAH001</a> is the one that fell hardest when we ranked them side-by-side.</p>
<p>Beyond the humidistat, the only feature that sets this model apart from cheaper ultrasonic humidifiers is the mineral filter. If you don’t want to buy distilled water, this might help reduce the amount of white dust you see on your mirrors and windows. It’s not as good as a pitcher-style filter system, though, since you’ve still got tap water leaving deposits in the tank.</p>
<p>The TaoTronics tank was nearly impossible to clean well. You can pour in vinegar for a rinse, but that’s it.</p>
<p>The performance we saw from this model was good but nothing special. If you really don’t care about being able to scrub out the tank, then it’s a little quicker than the Levoit and more accurate than the Honeywell. The smaller tank, though, means you’ll be filling more frequently.</p>
<h3>Honeywell &#8211; HEV320</h3>
<p>If you don’t need a humidistat or a week of capacity, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016ZACZ88?tag=ybdhumid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Honeywell &#8211; HEV320</a> has most of the strengths of our top pick in a more affordable package.</p>
<p>Compared to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077H19VJ6?tag=ybdhumid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HEV620</a>, the HEV320 has the same great performance of a wicking filter but without the electronic controls. This model holds half as much water as our top pick, and you have to unscrew a cap to fill it.</p>
<p>This is still one of the easiest humidifiers to clean, and the fan isn’t overly loud. (If anything, you might be disappointed if you were hoping the fan noise would mask loud neighbors or traffic sounds.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001YAPHS/?tag=ybdhumid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Filters</a> for this model are a little bit easier to find than for our top pick, but on the whole we aren’t sure who will benefit most from this size of machine.</p>
<p>If you’re running a humidifier in a large room, this model will need babysitting that the larger Honeywell doesn’t. If you’re just using this in a bedroom for occasional relief of cough or cold symptoms, you might find the visible mist of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MOI5QUU/?tag=ybdhumid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">our ultrasonic runner-up</a> more comforting.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to buy a big humidifier and would rather replace filters than buy distilled water, then this is a good pick over the Vicks &#8211; VUL520 at about the same price.</p>
<h3>Vicks &#8211; Starry Night V3700</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004AUZV46?tag=ybdhumid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">V3700</a> from Vicks is a relative of the Honeywell &#8211; HEV320; it even uses a similar tube-shaped wicking filter. The big difference is that this model features a basic sort of planetarium projector to light up a bedroom ceiling.</p>
<p>The V3700 didn’t rank well in our testing because of a few basic shortcomings. First, the fan is smaller than the Honeywell, so it doesn’t put out as much moisture on high speed. Second, the opening for filling and cleaning the tank is small.</p>
<p>The star projector is a bit too simple and can’t be aimed if you need to put it in the corner of a room. There’s nothing terrible about this model, but nothing stands out as a reason to pick it.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crane-USA-Cool-Mist-Humidifiers/dp/B00E3OQ88M/?tag=ybdhumid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Crane &#8211; Adorables</a> line is a set of humidifiers designed to blend in with your nursery or a child’s bedroom decor. We picked the purple Hippo (our test-toddler named it “Henry”) and spent some quality time watching the mist pour out of the ears. There’s a train-engine-shaped model that makes a bit more sense if you’re going for realism, but they should all perform the same.</p>
<p>We like the performance of the Adorables model, but it has all the flaws of a typical cheap ultrasonic humidifier. The tank has only a tiny access hole for filling and cleaning, and you have to steady it with one hand while you fill it from a jug of distilled water. Worse, it can take a few tries to figure out which way it fits in the base, an annoyance if you’re refilling in the middle of a long, sleep-deprived night during cold season.</p>
<p>Cleaning isn’t much better, since most of the surfaces that would attract mold or algae are to the side of the hole and on the other side of the chimney.</p>
<p>We hoped this would be a great humidifier for kids, but in the end that’s only true if you’ll let your kids steal the themed spout and wear it as a hat.</p>
<p>On second though, it’s not a good hat, either. Don’t buy this.</p>
<h3>Pure Enrichment &#8211; MistAire</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MistAire-Ultrasonic-Cool-Mist-Humidifier/dp/B013IJPTFK/?tag=ybdhumid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pure Enrichment &#8211; MistAire</a> is an unremarkable ultrasonic-type model. It’s not especially bad; we didn’t encounter any specific problems with it during testing, and it seems about as well-made as any of the other machines.</p>
<p>The reviews of this machine on Amazon are mostly positive, so it would seem most people don’t have issues in the long run, but some people have had machines stop working. (Usually this is caused by a stuck or broken float valve.)</p>
<p>Nearly every critical complaint talked about how difficult it is to clean this model, and we agree; it just doesn’t make sense to buy a humidifier you can’t clean. The capacity is small, and the output is slow, so there’s no reason to buy this model.</p>
<h3>Crane &#8211; Drop</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crane-USA-Humidifier-Cool-White/dp/B0046A6WJI/?tag=ybdhumid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Crane &#8211; Drop</a> is very similar to Crane’s Adorables model, but for whatever reason it didn’t disperse moisture as quickly when set to full speed.</p>
<p>The tank here isn’t much different than the Adorables tank. It’s still impossible to scrub out, and it still can’t rest on a flat surface while you’re filling it.</p>
<p>The one concern that pushed this model to the bottom of our ranking is that the tank has a semi-opaque finish. If you diligently rinse this machine with clean water every time you use it and with vinegar every week, you might never have a problem with something growing inside the tank. If you do have a problem, though, you might not know until you can smell it in the air.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Our top pick overall is for people who need a device that will maintain the humidity in a large space over an entire season. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077H19VJ6?tag=ybdhumid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Honeywell &#8211; HEV620</a> uses a high-performance evaporative system, and the large easy-filling reservoir means you’ll spend less time keeping it going.</p>
<p>This machine is by far the easiest to clean, and the filter is easy to monitor and replace if it gets clogged by minerals from your water. Best of all, you won’t have to worry about white dust on your picture frames or puddles of condensation on your nightstand.</p>

The LV600HH has a great humidistat, good capacity and a tank you can really clean. The only downside is the white dust left behind if you’re in a hard water area, but distilled water is a good fix.</p>
<p>If you’re not looking to invest in an appliance with computerized control, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MOI5QUU?tag=ybdhumid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vicks &#8211; VUL520</a> is a great humidifier that you can keep in a cupboard most of the year without worries. Most will want to use distilled water to avoid white dust, but there’s no filter to replace.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After over a month of research and testing, we found Stillpoint Aromatics to be the best essential oils based on factors such as scent, farming and production, and storage practices.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ur writer and researcher for this article is a holistic health practitioner studying nutrition, human anatomy, physiology, spirituality, as well as aromatherapy. After over a month of research and evaluation, we determined <a href="https://stillpointaromatics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stillpoint Aromatics</a> offers the best essential oils. They source the finest plants and make the greatest effort to preserve the oils’ pristine quality by keeping them in cold storage, capped with nitrogen. Running a close second — and for half the price — <a href="http://www.floracopeia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Floracopeia&#8217;s</a> essential oils smelled very fresh and quite similar to Stillpoint’s, but lacked the energetic quality from our top pick.</p>

<h2 class="collapse" id="how-we-found">How we found the best essential oils</h2>
<p>After several weeks of exhaustive research, we sifted the Internet to find as many essential oil brands as possible that were available in America. We searched through web retailers, scoured essential oil and natural health blogs, online forums and reviews, along with searching through Subreddits like /r/essentialoils and /r/aromatherapy.</p>
<p>We then spoke with professionals in the business including a Clinical Registered Aromatherapist, several massage therapists and a Holistic Health Coach. In addition we read through scientific research studies, and numerous essential oil, natural health and aromatherapy books — both historical and modern.</p>
<p>Finally, with a clear understanding of exactly what makes a great essential oil, we combed through our large list of candidates — plus found a few more companies of high integrity — to see if they truly met the demanding criteria for quality.</p>
<p>With this knowledge we selected a total of seven different brands to test in-house:</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="the-seven-best">Compare the best essential oil companies</h2>
[table id=34 /]
<h2 class="collapse">What are essential oils?</h2>
<p>The term, “essential oil” is actually the shortening of a historical term: “quintessential oil,” alluding to the oils as the spirit or life force of the plant. Of course the oils are a physical substance, not supernatural; however, their ethereal aromas and therapeutic talents can have a spiritual, as well as a mental/emotional effect on us.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.naturalhealthyconcepts.com/2014/12/04/essential-oils-fda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Essential oils are in fact NOT oils at all</a>, they’ve simply acquired that name because they do not mix with water, just like regular oils. They are a vital liquid present inside living plants — a natural solution of various complex chemical constituents. <strong>Scientifically, essential oils are concentrated aromatic volatile plant compounds</strong> <strong>(‘volatile’ meaning they can change state or evaporate very easily).</strong> They are mostly derived from the flowers, leaves, stems and fruits of plants, while some are extracted from the bark and even the sap of trees.</p>
<p>Inside the living plant, essential oils serve several purposes, one of which is defense. Acting like the plant’s immune system, the oils help it fight off fungus or bacterial infection, and protect it from insects and animals. Another purpose is reproduction; the pleasing aromas attract pollinating insects like bees and butterflies. We’re not the only animals who like the smell of flowers.</p>
<h2 class="collapse">How are essential oils produced?</h2>
<p>The most common processes for extracting the essential oils from the plant material after harvesting are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distillation &#8211; steam from boiling water passes through plants drawing out the oils, then the oils are separated from the cooled, re-condensed water</li>
<li>Expression &#8211; (also called cold pressing) heavy pressure squeezes the oils from the materials; used mainly with citrus fruit peels<br />
Maceration/Distillation &#8211; the plant material is softened in warm water to release the oils</li>
<li>The amount of essential oil present within the plant material is scarce, more so for some plants than others. <strong>It can take up to 60 roses to produce one single drop of rose essential oil.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="collapse" id="essential-oils-vs">Essential oils vs. absolutes vs. hydrosols</h2>
<p>When searching for and purchasing essential oils from reputable companies you might come across the terms “absolute” and “hydrosol” often right next to the essential oils of the same plant. Be aware, these are not the same as essential oils.</p>
<p>An absolute is a fragrant liquid that is extracted from the plants using chemical solvents, like alcohol. Though the solvents are removed after the extraction process, there still remains a tiny amount of the chemical in the final product. Absolutes are much thicker and more concentrated than essential oils, and because of this they are often used in skin care products and lotions.</p>
<p>A hydrosol is simply the aromatic water that is left over from the steam distillation process. Hydrosols are basically just scented H2O and are generally used as perfume, cologne, air or fabric freshener, or they can be added to a soothing bath.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="benefits">Benefits of essential oils and aromatherapy</h2>
<p>Aromatherapy is an ancient practice of natural healing and plant medicine that has been documented in human civilizations around the world for over 6,000 years. The use of prescribing aromatic plant extracts for massage, for bathing and for mental, emotional and spiritual imbalances has proven benefits through both practical and scientific evidence.</p>
<p>The scents and the therapeutic capacities of each essential oil are unique to each plant and can have many physiological and psychological benefits. The oils have the ability to calm and release stress, to uplift depression, to stimulate and awaken the body and mind, to relieve sore muscles, or even loosen a cough if used correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Aromatherapy does not literally take away stress or depression, but rather it balances the disturbances within your body and mind, and fortifies your weaknesses, allowing your body to heal itself.</strong></p>
<p>And since the oils have anti-viral, anti-fungal and antibacterial qualities within the plants, we as humans can also make use of these benefits for our own health. Again, of course, when used properly.</p>
<p>It’s very important to keep in mind that the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates essential oils mainly as cosmetics, NOT as therapeutic supplements, herbs or medications. So if you come across an essential oil company or salesperson who claims their oils can cure certain diseases or mental illnesses, they are violating federal law and can be prosecuted and fined by the US government.</p>
<p>One very public example of this came in September of 2014 when <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2014/ucm415809.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FDA cited both dōTERRA</a> and <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2014/ucm416023.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Young Living</a>, multi-level marketing essential oil companies. FDA agents found clear evidence that some of Young Living and dōTERRA reps were making claims that their oils could prevent and cure Ebola and many other illnesses! The situation was quickly remedied.</p>
<p>Such bold claims should raise red flags for wise buyers. Be a smart consumer.</p>
<p>This brings us to some extremely important information for your own health…</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="safety">Safety when using essential oils</h2>

<p>Essential oils can be considered, fundamentally, as medication. Although derived from plants and natural resources they are still used as a treatment for health ailments. The oil’s high concentration makes them very powerful and potentially dangerous substances if used incorrectly. It is imperative that you do thorough research before using any essential oil because if used improperly they can cause serious health issues like allergic reactions, rashes, burns and long-term internal damage. The temptation to self-diagnose and self-prescribe can be a great influence in using essential oils, but without professional diagnosis and supervision, you run a risk of causing yourself harm. With that in mind here are some very important guidelines to follow:</p>
<p><strong>Avoid use of essential oils (unless under medical supervision) if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You are pregnant</li>
<li>You have a skin condition</li>
<li>You have asthma</li>
<li>You have severe allergies</li>
<li>You have epilepsy or are prone to seizures</li>
<li>You have heart disease</li>
<li>You have high blood pressure</li>
<li>You are on a course of treatment with prescribed medication</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rules for safe usage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many essential oils are too powerful to be applied directly to the skin undiluted (also known as “neat”), they must be diluted with a neutral carrier oil, such as jojoba oil, to avoid irritation.</li>
<li>Never use essential oils on or around the eyes or mucous membranes.</li>
<li>Several oils, like bergamot and other citrus, can cause allergic sensitivity to the sun and should be used with caution.</li>
<li>Children and the elderly can be extra sensitive to the effects of essential oils.</li>
<li>Essential oils are flammable, so keep them away from open flames.</li>
<li>Never ingest essential oils unless it is under the close supervision and prescription of a clinically-trained medical or aromatherapeutic professional. Some oils can be toxic, and if taken internally may be fatal. If you don’t know the specific chemistry of the oil, do not take it internally.</li>
</ul>
<p>We here at Your Best Digs take your health and safety very seriously, that’s why we spend so much time and effort researching products for you.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve laid out some ground rules for essential oils, let’s see what you can do with these little gifts from nature.</p>

<p>Of course essential oils smell great, but there’s much more to them than just a pretty scent. There are three main techniques to make use of essential oils: aromatic, topical and internal.</p>
<h3>Aromatic</h3>

<p><strong>Diffusion:</strong> This is the healthiest, safest and most effective method of use. The fragrances from essential oils that are detected through your sense of smell actually have profound effects on your body, mood and behavior. When the oils are diffused into the air the healing properties of the essences enter your body through your nose while you appreciate the pleasant smell. The best way to achieve these benefits is by using an essential oil diffuser. We <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-essential-oil-diffuser/" rel="noopener">reviewed these diffusers in-depth</a> and found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MPV473S/?tag=ybdoils-20" rel="nofollow">Smiley Daisy</a> to be the best.</p>
<p>As the vaporized microscopic particles come into contact with the soft and moist tissue inside your nose and sinuses their beneficial properties enter directly into your bloodstream and get dispersed throughout your body. At the same time they travel up the olfactory nerve (the one that operates your sense of smell) to the limbic region of your brain where you process feelings and emotions. This is also an important area of the brain involved in memory. Smell and memory are processed through the same part of the brain; that’s why when you smell cookies baking in the oven you may have flashbacks of childhood.</p>

<p>As you smell the beautiful aromas this triggers your brain and the cells of your body, affecting your mood to uplift or calm you, affecting your behavior to slow you down or excite you, affecting your thinking to help you clear your mind and think sharper while remembering important things.</p>
<p>And since the essential oil particles are entering your bloodstream, you are also getting the physical benefits they may offer like muscle relaxation, pain relief, improved digestion and more.</p>
<p>Another added benefit of diffusion is its ability to clean the air. When the air in a space is stagnant, smelly and unclean — like in the winter when your home is closed up — there can be infectious airborne bacteria, viruses and spores floating about ready to make you sick. But when the right essential oil is diffused, in the correct amount, you can actually kill those little buggers in the air before they get to you.</p>
<p>In a quote from aromatherapy expert, David Crow, he writes, “[T]he antimicrobial effects of essential oils are most potent not when the oil is used in liquid form… but when pathogens are exposed to the vapors of the oils.” Not only do the oils clean the air and get into your nose, but they are also penetrating your skin, getting into your bloodstream, protecting and healing you.</p>
<p>Don’t overdo it though. Remember, these oils are extremely concentrated. Prolonged exposure to essential oils can cause ill effects like headaches, nausea or other unpleasant symptoms. Vary your use with different oils of different chemical compounds so that they don’t build up in your system. And avoid letting your diffuser run all day, every day; there is such a thing as too much of a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>Inhalation:</strong> With oils that are safe to use on the skin (know before you try), you can also take a single drop into one of your hands and rub your hands together to warm them up and spread the oil. Then cup your hands around your nose and take in a deep breath. Doing this, you can achieve the same mood and emotional benefits as with diffusion. A little goes a long way.</p>
<p>It’s good to note that most essential oils can lose their healthy powers when heated, so it’s best to avoid heat-based diffusions like candles and incense burners; stick with a good diffuser.</p>
<h3>Topical</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5375" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage.jpg" alt="eye dropper using essential oil on hand" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>For cautionary reasons, it is safest to assume that all essential oils should not be applied to the skin undiluted. Some are safe to use ‘neat’ right out of the bottle, while others can cause you great pain or irritation. Again, know all about your oil before you use it!</p>
<p>A typical dilution is around 2%, which means adding about 12 drops of essential oil to every one ounce of carrier oil. A carrier oil is a neutral nut or vegetable oil you use for dilution. Jojoba and Argan oils are the most common and beneficial, but almond, grapeseed, olive, coconut, sunflower, avocado or kukui oils will work just fine.</p>
<p><strong>Massage:</strong> Place several drops of your diluted oil mixture into your hand and rub them together. Then spread that oil onto your skin — or your partner’s skin — with long strokes. The warmth and friction of your hands will dispense the oil directly into the skin, muscles and bloodstream. Using the right essential oils can relax tension, relieve sore muscles and even improve your skin. Plus it just feels so darn good to get a massage.</p>
<p><strong>Compress:</strong> For localized issues like aches or bruises, place about ten drops of essential oil into a bowl of hot water. Soak a clean cloth in this water solution, then place the cloth on the troubled area for about 10-20 minutes. Repeat if necessary. As before, make sure you know if the oil you use is safe.</p>

<p><strong>Bath:</strong> Avoid dripping your essential oil directly into the bath water; you always want to mix it first with a natural emulsifier like honey, milk, a carrier oil, or even sea salt. Doing this will help emulsify and disperse the essential oils into the water. If you don’t do this, the oils will simply sit on the surface of the water and come into direct contact with your skin, possibly causing burns and dermal toxicity.</p>
<p>Try 5-10 drops of essential oil into ½-1 cup of emulsifier or salt, then stir that mixture into your warm bath water. Soak and relax for as long or as short as you wish as the oils penetrate your skin and stimulate your senses. Be aware that the overuse of essential oils in the bath can cause irritation, so choose only the mild and soothing extracts, and be smart.</p>
<h3>Internal / Ingestion</h3>
<p>Ingesting essential oils for health benefits has been prescribed for centuries by experienced professionals. This process, when administered safely and correctly under supervision, can have profound healing effects on your body with issues like digestion, immune defense and hormonal imbalances. However, ingesting the wrong oils — or even the right oils in the wrong portions — can have disastrous and permanent effects on your internal tissues and overall health, and worst of all, you may not even realize any damage has been done until decades later in your life.</p>
<p>In short: <strong>DO NOT TAKE ESSENTIAL OILS INTERNALLY unless they have been prescribed to you individually by a qualified and clinically-trained medical professional or Clinical Registered Aromatherapist.</strong> When working with essential oils you are ultimately playing with chemistry; if you do not know the specific chemistry of the specific oils, and what that specific collection of chemical constituents in that oil can do to your body, then avoid internal administration and stick with the aromatic processes.</p>
<p>The practice of taking essential oils internally, by mouth, has been a heated debate within the essential oil community. Since the recent rise of the multi-level-marketing essential oil companies, and other brands claiming that their oils are pure enough to eat, the idea of freely ingesting essential oils has plagued the minds of the average consumer.</p>
<p>In our research, we came across a number of ill-informed consumers who readily believe that any essential oil, from any company, is safe to consume. Sadly, the exact opposite is true: ANY essential oil can be harmful if ingested improperly and without professional supervision.</p>
<p>Clinically trained professionals have spent years learning the delicate and complicated chemistry of essential oils and how they relate to the sensitive tissues of the human body, inside and out. Please, seek the guidance of a knowledgeable professional before putting any essential oil into your mouth.</p>
<p>We’ve learned how to safely use essential oils, now it’s time to go shopping.</p>

<p>When we set out to find the best essential oils available in America we thought it would be a straightforward matter of finding the companies with the best ratings and reviews, buying some oils and testing them for smell and feel. We never expected to find it such a difficult task.</p>
<p>In the world of essential oils there is an enormous amount of controversy and competition, with some companies accusing other companies of being less pure, while others claim trademarks and exclusivity on their products. All of this noise creates plenty of confusion for the average consumer to sift through, especially since there is no official regulation or oversight on the essential oil industry, federal or otherwise.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, the FDA generally classifies essential oils as cosmetics, but they can also <em>sometimes</em> be considered drugs. In a quote direct from <a href="https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductsIngredients/Products/ucm127054.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the US Food and Drug Administration website</a>, “The law doesn’t require cosmetics to have FDA approval before they go on the market.” In addition, if a product claims to affect the health and function of the body, such as relieving anxiety, aiding digestion or calming sore muscles, the product must be approved by the FDA as a drug, which is a very long and costly process.</p>
<p>Most private and holistic essential oil companies simply can’t afford to go through that process, so they instead opt to comply with the FDA’s much more lax regulations regarding cosmetics; no approval required. So this leaves the real regulation up to you, the consumer.</p>
<p>To help us get a more clear understanding of what to look for in essential oils we spoke with Clinical Registered Aromatherapist, Anna Doxie. She is the founder of the <a href="http://authenticaromatherapyeducation.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Institute of Holistic Phyto-Aromatherapy</a> and Director Coordinator and Director of the Southern California Region of the <a href="https://naha.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy</a> (NAHA) and an esteemed Aromatherapy instructor. We’ve also combed through NAHA’s educational materials, consulted the prolific writings of Dr. Robert Pappas — a highly respected name in essential oil testing and education — and sought many other independent sources of information to present to you some guidelines for finding the best essential oil:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cultivation of the plants</li>
<li>Distillation and Extraction</li>
<li>Testing and Purity</li>
<li>Storage</li>
<li>Labeling and Information</li>
<li>Price</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cultivation and farming</h3>
<p><strong>The most important terms to look for regarding the way the plants are grown and harvested are Certified Organic, Wild Harvested, or unofficially organic</strong> <strong>(sometimes called “unsprayed”).</strong> A reputable essential oil company will freely disclose all information about where and how their source plants are grown, and they’ll be proud of their organic choices.</p>
<p>More importantly, the founders and owners of the companies will have personal relationships with the farmers so they can be certain of what they are getting. There are many tiny, locally operated farms around the world who can’t afford the extremely high costs of organic certification, yet they still practice organic farming which includes: no use of chemical pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers, no genetically modified seeds, and healthy crop rotation to protect the soils. That is what is meant by Unsprayed.</p>
<p>Wild harvested is just that, the plants are cut from their natural, indigenous location; no farming, totally wild.</p>
<p>Another important factor to know about the oil is the geographical location each plant was grown. Plants grow naturally and thrive in climates and conditions suitable for their health. Plants farmed in locations outside of their natural habitats will be less effective when distilled. The climate, the soil, the time of year (and sometimes even the time of day) have great effects on the quality of the essential oils and good companies know this.</p>
<h3>Distillation and extraction</h3>
<p>Distilleries can be certified organic also, but as with the small farms, small distilleries can’t afford the certification, yet they practice organic methods.</p>
<p>It is important to know exactly how the oils were extracted. As we discussed earlier with how essential oils are produced, specific methods are required for specific plants. A good essential oil company will declare the method used for each individual oil. If you don’t see any method of extraction, or you find a blanket statement saying that all their oils are steam distilled, be wary, they could be fake.</p>
<h3>Purity</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5378" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label.jpg" alt="label stating 100% pure oil" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>This is the biggest and most hotly argued aspect of the unregulated essential oil market. Be aware, there are no official legal bindings to the terms, “Pure”, “100% Pure”, “Natural”, and “Therapeutic Grade”; in fact there are no grades at all regarding essential oils. If you see any of these, or similar terms on essential oils, they are completely meaningless marketing slogans.</p>
<p>For effective therapeutic uses, it is imperative that only the purest of essential oils are used. What we mean by ‘pure’ is that the only thing inside that tiny bottle is the essential oil from the specific plant on the label, no additives, no other chemicals, no synthetic fragrances or diluents, and no other kind of oil — natural or otherwise.</p>
<p>To cut costs many low-quality companies will fill their bottles with mostly vegetable oil or water and only add a small percentage of real essential oil. Others will put in cheaper essential oils that smell similar to the real plant and label it as the real thing. An example is using litsea oil in place of lemongrass. This is called adulteration.</p>
<p>The worst deception is when poor companies use synthetic fragrances mixed into vegetable oil and pass it off as true essential oil. This is where the real danger to your health can come: the National Academy of Sciences reported that the 95 percent of synthetic fragrances come from petroleum and have the potential to cause cancer, birth defects, central nervous system disorders and allergic reactions.</p>
<p>So how do you know if the oils are real?</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>In order to know if an essential oil is pure and true it must be tested in a chemistry lab. The Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) test is a standard in the industry. This test separates and analyzes the chemical compounds while confirming the elemental composition within a sample, helping chemists to determine whether or not the essential oil has been tainted. Good companies will have third-party GC/MS reports for every batch of oil available for you to read.</p>

<p><a href="https://essentialoils.org/news/eo_myths" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Robert Pappas says</a>, &#8220;There are a lot of companies out there selling essential oils and most of them have no ability (or in many cases no desire) to do the necessary quality control to verify what they are getting from their supplier before they pass it on to their customers.” The GC/MS test determines the quality and can show evidence of adulteration, although it is not perfect. Good companies will employ other tests as well like, Organoleptic (sensory tests), or FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy).</p>
<p>There are many companies out there, even popular, big name essential oil companies, whose oils have been independently tested by consumers with GC/MS and other processes, and have been found to include synthetic and other ingredients within their apparently “pure” essential oils. That is why it is so important to have batch-specific tests for every oil, and to buy from a company you really know and trust.</p>
<h3>Storage</h3>

<p>As mentioned earlier, essential oils are volatile which means they can degrade quickly under poor conditions, especially with exposure to light, heat or oxygen. To protect the integrity of the oils it is best to keep them in dark glass containers in a cool location in your home — refrigeration is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Every essential oil has a unique shelf life and the good companies will tell you how many years the oil will keep its potency. It’s a good practice to write the date on the bottle when you first open it so you know exactly how old it is years later.</p>
<p>There are few companies who take storage to the highest regard by keeping their oils refrigerated in bottles with nitrogen pumped in to prevent exposure to oxygen. You don’t need to go that far at home, but just don’t leave them in the sun.</p>
<h3>Labeling</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5380" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats.jpg" alt="product details on a label" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Very simply, you want to read on the label — or information page for every oil — the true Latin name of the plant from which the oil was extracted, as well as the country from which the plant was harvested. Some companies will go further and tell you the method of extraction, the farming quality and also the chemical family of the oil. Plus seeing the batch number on the bottle helps you match it with its testing.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>The old adage, “you get what you pay for” is generally quite true when it comes to essential oils. Producing and distributing high-quality essential oils is a time consuming and expensive process. If you find an essential oil at a price significantly lower than most major brands, you’re not getting a good deal, you’re probably getting a fake product.</p>
<p>The most expensive oils will usually offer you the highest purity, quality and integrity. What you’re paying for is the care and great attention to quality. The last thing you want to save a couple of bucks on is your own health or the health of your family.</p>
<p>Knowing the average cost of a good quality oil needs to be taken into consideration when purchasing from large companies with large marketing agendas. Marketing costs a lot of money, as do quality essential oils, so be certain that every dollar of your hard-earned money is going fully into the quality of the essential oil rather than its promotion, advertising and salespeople.</p>

<h3>Scent</h3>
<p>Very simply, the essential oil must smell like it’s supposed to, and that’s where knowing the aromas comes in handy. If your bottle of eucalyptus smells more like mint, then you probably don’t have eucalyptus in your hands.</p>
<p>Of course, you won’t know this until you actually buy and open the oil yourself, so we took care of that for you.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Since we are not chemists, nor do we have the resources or equipment to evaluate the chemical purity of the essential oils, we stuck with methods of evaluation available to the average consumer. Out of the nearly 40 different essential oil companies researched we were able to narrow down the list to a total of seven reputable companies by using the parameters listed above in our section ‘<a href="#what-to-look-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What to look for when purchasing essential oils</a>.’</p>
<p>Then we purchased bottles of Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), and Lemon (Citrus limon) from each of the seven companies we selected to perform our in-house testing. We gathered a group of four people from our office and administered a formal blind smell test to evaluate which oils smelled the best and which smelled the worst out of the selections.</p>
<p>Disguising the names of the companies we placed two drops of each oil on a strip of white card paper marked with a single letter for reference. We had each test participant smell a strip of lavender, one at a time, from each company rating it for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Freshness</li>
<li>Strength</li>
<li>Familiarity</li>
<li>Purity (smelling something in the background besides the lavender)</li>
<li>Richness (fully rounded smell, or incomplete and empty)</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, once each brand of lavender was evaluated individually we asked them to compare all of the different lavender scents to judge their personal preference and to rate which ones gave the highest sense of quality.</p>
<p>We then did the whole thing over again with the lemon essential oils. Here are the cumulative rankings from the testing:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5372" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings.png" alt="blind scent ranking data chart" width="901" height="645" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings.png 901w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-610x437.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-768x550.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-300x215.png 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-295x211.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-885x634.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-360x258.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-375x268.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-414x296.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-320x229.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Finally, we performed a common and simple test for purity. Since essential oils are not truly oils they respond differently when they come into contact with blotting paper. When pure essential oils are dropped onto a piece of blotting paper they will impregnate the paper and then evaporate leaving no obvious trace. However, if you place a drop of diluted essential oil on blotting paper, the vegetable oil used to stretch the original will leave an oily stain on the paper.</p>
<p>We placed a single drop from each bottle onto individual pieces of blotting paper and watched with fascination as the spots disappeared with every sample. No dilutions. No carrier oils. All pure. We expected that, but it’s nice to see it in person.</p>

They have excellent oil scents, along with the highest standards for farming, production and storage practices.</p><a href="http://www.stillpointaromatics.com/essential-oils" target="_blank"><button>See Price at StillpointAromatics.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>In 2010 they started Stillpoint to offer over 200 of “the purest therapeutic quality essential oils that we have ever experienced.” Additionally, they offer true Aromatherapy Certification programs that are accredited with both the National Association of Holistic Aromatherapy (NAHA) and the Alliance of International Aromatherapists (AIA).</p>
<p>Here’s what makes their essential oils so great:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cultivation and distillation: All of their oils are either Certified Organic, Wild Harvested, or Unsprayed (organically grown without certification)</li>
<li>Testing and purity: Every single batch of every single oil they sell is GC/MS tested by an independent laboratory in France. Then the chemical family of the oils is printed directly on the bottle’s label to assist experienced Aromatherapists.</li>
<li>Storage: Once they receive their shipments directly from the distiller (no middlemen) they immediately pour them into amber-colored bottles, then they remove the oxygen by filling the remaining space in the bottles with nitrogen before placing them in cold storage; this drastically reduces oxidation and greatly enhances the shelf-life and vibrancy of the oils. And if that weren’t special enough, Joy and Cynthia literally hand-pour every bottle to order. What this means is, the essential oil stays in cold storage, with nitrogen, until you place your order, only then will the oil be poured custom into the tiny 15mL amber bottle, just for you! No one else takes such pride and care.</li>
<li>Labeling and information: Each hand-poured bottle displays:<br />
-the Latin name<br />
-the source country<br />
-the quality of farming (organic, etc.)<br />
-the part of the plant this oil came from<br />
-how it was extracted<br />
-the chemical family of this oil<br />
-the batch number, so you can see the GC/MS test for that specific oil</li>
<li>Price: Yes, these oils are pricy. At $23.00 for a tiny 5mL bottle of wild lavender, it’s the second most expensive oil, with Oshadhi coming in first at $36.30 for 10mL. But the price is well worth it for the enormous quality you are getting with these oils.</li>
<li>Love: Every order shipped comes with a custom, handwritten note from Joy and Cynthia thanking you for choosing them.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our scent tests the Stillpoint’s oils started off smelling mild and fresh, but then after a minute or two they magically blossomed and became very rich, deep, vibrant, stronger and more clear; almost like a fine wine opens up after being uncorked for some time. And for those who may be sensitive to subtle energies, these oils possessed a very clean and high vibration, which is an enormous benefit when using the oils for spiritual practice. No other oils we tested performed this way.</p>
<p>Our testers rated Stillpoint tops in all tests. With their impeccable standards for quality and preservation, there is no question that Stillpoint Aromatics has the best essential oils.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.floracopeia.com/Essential-Oils/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Floracopeia</a> is another small, independently-owned company with very ethical roots. Started in 2004 in Grass Valley, CA by David and Sara Crow, Floracopeia is our second-best essential oil company. Like Stillpoint, they have strong personal relationships with their distillers; they will even get their hands dirty as they help harvest the plants for extraction when they visit.</p>
<p>Floracopeia’s goal is not only to offer great essential oils but also to help create sustainable ecological, environmental and economic situations that support the small, rural farmers and distillers, as well as the planet. Their Eco-Projects, like the wild agarwood trees in Thailand, reduce illegal harvesting and help create a sustainable forestry system while supporting the livelihoods of the local villagers. And just like Stillpoint, David and Sara offer training and certifications in Aromatherapy.</p>

<p>All of their essential oils are either organic or wild harvested, and while they do not do their own testing, they rely on trusted and vetted relationships with their distillers who provide them with GC/MS tests.</p>
<p>The labels on the Floracopeia bottles offer all the important information you need from a trustworthy brand, including Latin names, organic quality, country of origin and batch number. Not as information-rich as Stillpoint’s bottles, but they still give you all the significant facts for quality oil.</p>
<p>Floracopeia’s very delicate and pure scent comes at almost half the cost of Stillpoint Aromatics’ oils. Priced at $25.00 for a 15mL bottle of organic lavender, that’s about $1.67 per mL, compared to Stillpoint’s $3.17 per mL for wild lavender.</p>
<p>Although Floracopeia doesn’t provide the extensive storage and preservation practices like Stillpoint, their pure and authentic essential oils, with ethical and sustainable practices, as well as a good price, make them an easy pick for our runner up.</p>

<h3>From Nature With Love</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5408 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love.jpg" alt="From Nature With Love bottles" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Our third choice was a company called <a href="https://www.fromnaturewithlove.com/soap/EssentialOils.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">From Nature With Love</a> in Oxford, CT. In our scent tests they actually scored in second place overall however there were a few other issues that dropped them below Floracopeia.</p>
<p>First, their bottles didn’t come with the little plastic dripper caps that cover the mouth of the bottle (aka. orifice reducer), they just had a simple screw cap. Without the orifice reducers, you either have to pour the oil out and make a mess or dip an eye dropper into the oil which can potentially contaminate the product if you’re not careful. Plus if oil gets into the little rubber bulb of the eyedropper it can get stuck in there and go bad, further contaminating the oil.</p>
<p>Second, From Nature With Love is a wholesaler which means they offer products like cosmetics bases and other ingredients for making your own lotions, creams, soaps and more. So their primary focus is not top quality essential oils, but instead, being a one-stop shop for natural body care cosmetics makers.</p>
<p>Third, even though they are a member of NAHA, only some of their essential oils are organic — the lemon was not — and they do not perform GC/MS testing. However, they do fill the amber bottles with nitrogen just like Stillpoint, but that’s the extent of their preservation.</p>
<p>From Nature With Love has some very nice oils, and if you’re planning on making your own lotions they’re a good buy. But for everyday uses, we’d recommend sticking with Stillpoint Aromatics or Floracopeia.</p>
<h3>Mountain Rose Herbs</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5385 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mountain-rose-herbs-bottles.jpg" alt="Mountain Rose Herbs bottles" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mountain-rose-herbs-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mountain-rose-herbs-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mountain-rose-herbs-bottles-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mountain-rose-herbs-bottles-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mountain-rose-herbs-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mountain-rose-herbs-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mountain-rose-herbs-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mountain-rose-herbs-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mountain-rose-herbs-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mountain-rose-herbs-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Based in Eugene, OR, <a href="https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/catalog/aromatherapy/essential-oils" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mountain Rose Herbs</a> offers USDA Organic essential oils, in addition to a variety of other products like teas, spices, bath and body items, and kitchen tools. They are a very eco-conscious and sustainable company, but in the scent tests we tried, they seemed to lack the aromatic quality of the top choices.</p>
<p>The prices were about average at $12.75 for 15mL of lavender, but with so many alternate products they offer, their full attention to quality in the essential oils becomes spread a little thin.</p>
<h3>Plant Therapy</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5384 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles.jpg" alt="plant therapy bottles" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.planttherapy.com/essential-oils" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plant Therapy</a> essential oils is a family owned company in Twin Falls, ID, and they’ve teamed up with world-renowned Aromatherapy expert, Robert Tisserand to help them ensure their oil’s quality and purity. They offer both USDA Organic and conventionally farmed essential oils in all the popular scents, and they test each batch with GC/MS.</p>
<p>With all those glowing statistics it came as a surprise that our testers gave very mixed reviews with these oils. Some thought they were strong and clear, while others noticed strange undertones and even artificial, candy-like qualities. Because of this, they ranked number five overall in our smell test.</p>
<p>Plant Therapy’s labels are a bit scarce in their information. They display the proper Latin names and the USDA Organic logo, but that’s it. Instead of including the country of origin and other important notes — which can be found on the website — they have a long description of what the oils could be used for and how to use it, followed by an FDA disclaimer so they won’t get in trouble.</p>
<h3>Oshadhi</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.oshadhiusa.com/essential-oil-singles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5390 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles.jpg" alt="Oshadhi bottles closeup" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.oshadhiusa.com/essential-oil-singles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oshadhi</a> is a German company imported to America and it was the most expensive oil at $36.30 for 10mL of lavender; that’s more than Stillpoint. But even with that high price these oils got some pretty low ratings with our test group. They noticed sourness in the lavender, hints of chemical flavor in the lemon and weakness in all the scents.</p>
<p>They do sell only organic and wild harvested oils and have been in the essential oil business since 1990. Their labels have everything you need to know, including the chemical family of the oils and very clear batch numbers, but that just wasn’t enough to convince us to like the the way they smelled.</p>
<h3>Rocky Mountain Oils</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.oshadhiusa.com/essential-oil-singles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5392 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils.jpg" alt="Rocky Mountain Oils" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></a></p>
<p>This brand got the worst test scores of all. <a href="https://www.rockymountainoils.com/shoprmo/essential-oils/shop-singles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rocky Mountain Oils</a> from Orem, UT smelled weak and medicinal; someone even said it smelled like a laundry detergent. This was our only brand that did not offer organic oils of any kind, and perhaps that lower quality of farming was what gave them such strange aromas.</p>
<p>RMO, as they brand themselves, tests every batch with GC/MS analysis which you can easily view on their website, but their labels are inconsistent. All of them show the Latin name, but only some offer you the country from which the plants were sourced, but like the other companies, all useful information can be found on the website.</p>
<h3>Other companies</h3>
<p>The popular multi-level marketing companies, dōTERRA and Young Living didn’t make our top picks for several important reasons: their high retail prices, their lack of organic certification for all of their oils, and their insistence that most of their essential oils are safe to take internally not giving any regard to the potential health hazards of self-prescribing without professional clinical supervision.</p>
<p>We want you to be safe and we don’t want abundant marketing to convince you that you can be your own chemist without the necessary training. For all of these reasons, we have chosen not to include these companies in our testing.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Every one of the oils we tested offered their own unique signatures of aroma, and with this very subjective task we have undertaken, it made finding the best essential oils an extremely difficult project. Our criteria was strict and our noses were ready for the challenge. When it comes to your health we didn’t want to let money be a deterrent for finding you the truly best.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stillpointaromatics.com/essential-oils" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stillpoint Aromatics</a>, with their vibrant, rich scents, plus their devotion to the utmost of quality in sourcing, storage and preservation made them stand out high above the crowd. You can sense the life and the energy in these oils, and no other brand can compare to that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.floracopeia.com/Essential-Oils/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Floracopeia</a> has a passionate dedication for the health of the planet and the farmers who work upon it, while providing pure and authentic essential oils. Their freshness and integrity is present in every bottle of oil they offer, and at nearly half the price of our top pick they earn a deserving and proud second place.</p>
<p>Everyone has their own preferences in scents, brands and quality, so your personal opinions on what you like best may differ from ours. With a respectful, neutral perspective and a fresh experience on essential oils we are confident that you will get the most exceptional products from these companies.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After 30 hours of testing we found the best-in-class thermometer has an important feature that most other models were lacking.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n 2019, several indoor outdoor thermometers that we had tested in our previous review were discontinued. So we tested four new models and now recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071VKV4HJ/?tag=ybdiotherm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">La Crosse Technology &#8211; C85845</a> as the best indoor-outdoor thermometer. Its full-color screen with large icons gives you accurate temperature and humidity readings for both inside and outdoors. If you just want to know the temperature and time indoors and out, then our former top pick, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001DNIIOS/?tag=ybdiotherm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">La Crosse &#8211; WS-9160U</a>, is a good, basic option for the budget-conscious.</p>
<p><em>(Editor’s note: The Acurite &#8211; 01027A and Acurite &#8211; 75055A that we reviewed in 2016 were discontinued in 2019. Since our prior testing, The Ambient Weather &#8211; WS1171B was upgraded to the Ambient Weather &#8211; WS-2801A, which we tested for this 2019 update. We also researched and tested several of the latest models, including our new top pick, the La Crosse Technology &#8211; C85845.)</em></p>

<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>If you’re considering purchasing an indoor-outdoor thermometer, first decide what&#8217;s important to you. Temperature is an obvious one, and depending where you live, you might want to know the humidity level as well. All of the thermometers we tested had a clock display, and all of the newer models have a weather-forecast mode.</p>
<p>When we originally reviewed indoor-outdoor thermometers, we found that the models with extra features were less effective, and the more features they had, the worse they performed. That’s not the case with the new models. Although two were somewhat difficult to read, we found that all of the thermometers we tested for this update were accurate.</p>
<p>Except for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FXB76J5/?tag=ybdiotherm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ThermoPro &#8211; TP67A</a>, all of the new thermometers we tested were battery-operated with an optional electric adapter. When the adapter is plugged in, the thermometer switches over to electric power and automatically illuminates the thermometer’s face. When the adapter is unplugged, the illumination remains lit for 10 seconds, and then like your laptop, “sleeps” to save battery power.<br />
The following list details the core features that all of the new models we tested have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indoor/outdoor temperature</li>
<li>Clock</li>
<li>LED display</li>
<li>High/low daily temperatures</li>
<li>Forecast prediction</li>
<li>Humidity level</li>
<li>Barometric pressure</li>
</ul>
<h3>Barometric pressure</h3>
<p>Barometric pressure is the pressure exerted by the weight of air in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. Air pressure affects the weather by influencing the movement of air around the world. High pressure areas tend to bring sunny skies, while low pressure areas generally develop clouds and precipitation.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in a sunny climate, this feature might not be as interesting to you. But if you dream of someday predicting the weather in more volatile climates, the new models we tested include those calculations in their LED screens.</p>
<h3>Remote sensor</h3>
<p>The battery-operated remote sensor should be positioned outdoors in a protected shady area, such as a porch or roof eave &#8212; someplace where it won’t get wet. Installing the sensor in a sunny area will give incorrect readings, since direct sunlight will heat the sensor.</p>
<h3>Range</h3>
<p>The models we tested had receiving/transmittal ranges between 200 &#8211; 330 feet. However the range is adversely affected by solid walls and wireless signals, such as cell phones and Internet routers. When you’re first setting up your thermometer, you may need to try several outdoor locations to determine where the receiver will pick up the strongest signal.</p>
<h3>LED display</h3>
<p>All of the thermometers we tested gave accurate readings for indoor and outdoor temperatures and varied by only one or two degrees. However, we found one of the most important features is a bright and easy-to-read LED display.</p>
<p>When we first reviewed indoor outdoor thermometers we noted that only the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001DNIIOS/?tag=ybdiotherm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LaCrosse Technology &#8211; WS-916OU-T</a> had the best LED display because its numerals were large and crisp against the backlighting and also because it had a back stand that tilted the screen up.</p>
<p>The new models all have the back stand and can be tilted up. But we found that the new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071VKV4HJ/?tag=ybdiotherm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LaCrosse Technology &#8211; C85845</a> was the easiest to read, thanks to its large numerals and color coding that delineates indoor readings from outdoor readings.</p>

<h2 id="best">Best overall: La Crosse &#8211; C85845</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25788" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lacrosse-solo-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>La Crosse Technology is one of the leaders in indoor outdoor thermometers, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071VKV4HJ/?tag=ybdiotherm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">La Crosse Technology &#8211; C85845</a> is the third version of this popular model. It’s a weather-station type with settings for indoor/outdoor temperatures and humidity percentages, date, time and weather forecast. It has a 330-foot range, and in our testing, the receiver picked up a strong signal from the sensor at that maximum distance.</p>
<p>This La Crosse model is the largest of the new thermometers we tested and was the easiest read from across the room. Its bright LED display is divided into four sections: outdoor temperature and humidity (colored green), indoor temperature and humidity (colored blue), weather forecast with 3D icons of clouds, sunshine, rain, hail and snow, and date/time, which synchronizes with the atomic-clock signal broadcast from Colorado.</p>
<p>This is a weather station for weather geeks. Besides the basic readings, you can also program settings for temperature trends, minimal and maximum temperature levels and alerts for uncomfortable humidity levels and high/low temperature. Programming is a little complex, but the La Crosse Technology website walks you through it in detail.</p>

It has programming for recording temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, all of which are easy to read on its bright, large LED display.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071VKV4HJ/?tag=ybdiotherm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>The La Crosse records barometric pressure over a week’s time before it can begin to forecast the next day’s weather. Like all of the new models we tested, the instruction manual warns that forecasting is 70 &#8211; 75% accurate. Our tests were conducted in Southern California, where there are few fluctuations in weather, and on an especially humid day, the La Crosse predicted rain in the forecast, which is unlikely. However, if you’re living some place where weather is more variable, a high humidity reading would probably mean a chance of rain is in the forecast.</p>
<p>The Lacrosse Technology &#8211; C85845 is incredibly well-priced for all of the features you get with this weather station. The one negative we have is that it will stay lit only when it’s plugged in. When it’s on battery power, you need to press the “snooze” button on top of the unit for the backlight to illuminate. Since this was the case with all of the new thermometers we tested, we don’t consider this a significant reason for passing by this excellent weather station.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Lacrosse Technology &#8211; C85845 is one of the best new models of indoor-outdoor thermometers. It has a powerful receiver/transmitter than can pick up signals up to 330 feet away.</li>
<li>Packed with features, such as weather forecasting and temperature/humidity trends, it’s an incredible value.</li>
<li>Its brightly lit and large LED display is easy to read from across the room.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001DNIIOS/?tag=ybdiotherm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">La Crosse Technology &#8211; WS-916OU</a> is a minimalistic and well-designed indoor outdoor thermometer that gives you basic information: indoor and outdoor temperatures and the time. Its slight tilt upward makes it easier to read from afar (and up close), giving it a natural position for reading its display no matter where you are in the room. Its large, crisp digits also contribute to simple yet elegant aesthetic. Overall, it’s definitely bare bones, but if you’re not looking to spend a ton of money, it delivers in quality.</p>
<p>One negative that comes with the La Crosse’s low price point is its range. Although it’s supposed to have a 330-foot range, in actuality, it’s about half of that. We walked the sensor out to 300 feet from the receiver’s location, and it struggled to pick up a signal. We gradually walked the sensor closer, and it begin picking up a signal at approximately 150 feet.</p>

<p>For such a simple device, the La Crosse was a bit tricky to program at first. However, La Crosse has very helpful videos on its website that run through the programming step-by-step. If you want an indoor outdoor thermometer for your porch or carport, the La Crosse Technology &#8211; WS-916OU is an affordable option.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The La Crosse Technology &#8211; WS-916OU is well-designed with a clean, minimalist appearance and an easy-to-read display.</li>
<li>It only gives basic information: indoor/outdoor temperatures and the time</li>
<li>Although it doesn’t have a long range, it’s still great for an outdoor porch or carport.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="others">New thermometers we tested</h2>
<h3>ThermoPro &#8211; 67A</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25788" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/thermopro-solo.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FXB76J5/?tag=ybdiotherm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ThermoPro &#8211; TP67A</a> has the simplicity of the La Crosse &#8211; WS-916OU and the complexity of the La Crosse &#8211; C84854. It has an easy-to-read LED display and weather-forecasting features, including a graph that shows changes in barometric pressure in six 1-second increments. The barometer adds a bit of visual excitement to an otherwise lackluster display, but its value is questionable, since there is also an icon for current weather conditions.</p>
<p>The ThermoPro has a 330-foot range, which proved to be accurate in our testing. It has a couple of unique features worth noting. First, the sensor is powered by a rechargeable lithium battery, and although a wall adapter isn’t included, it can be charged with a cell phone charger. Another feature is that the sensor is water-proof. Although it’s recommended that the sensor shouldn’t be placed out in the rain, it will still send its signal even if it gets wet.</p>
<p>The unit itself is battery operated and without a wall adapter, the screen is never lit unless its light button is pushed. It stays illuminated for 15 seconds, which is just barely enough time to read the display. Although the ThermoPro &#8211; 67A is an accurate thermometer, it’s overly complex and hard to decipher at a quick glance.</p>
<h3>SMARTPRO &#8211; S62</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25788" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smartpro-solo.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PFGTXXK/?tag=ybdiotherm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SMARTPRO &#8211; SC62</a> is a prime example of piling on too many features. It’s about half the width and height of the La Crosse &#8211; C85845, and it has just as many functions, but they’re all squeezed together, resulting in a blurry mess. Although the SMARTPRO’s range isn’t stated in the instruction manual, it still transmitted 300 feet away, and its temperature and humidity readings were accurate.</p>
<p>The manufacturer, however, seems confused as to what the SMARTPRO should be. It has a clock function with snooze alarm that’s twice the size of the weather read-outs. There’s also a calendar with numeric date and month and abbreviated day of the week and an icon to show what phase the moon is in.</p>
<p>Adding to the confusion, the SMARTPRO has a moving barometric pressure graph and a current-weather icon that moves in an attempt at 3D but looks more like Pac Man. The backlight stays illuminated for 10 seconds, but you’ll need more time than that to figure out anything but the time of day.</p>
<h3>Ambient Weather &#8211; WS-2801A</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25788" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ambient-solo.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p><em>(Editor’s note: The model we tested in 2016, the Ambient Weather &#8211; WS1171 B, has been discontinued. We selected the manufacturer’s most recent model to test for this 2019 update.)</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FID5TIG/?tag=ybdiotherm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ambient Weather &#8211; WS-2801A</a> is a full-color indoor outdoor thermometer that’s packed with features, and though it’s the same small size as the La Crosse &#8211; WS-916OU, we had no trouble reading the LED display. Temperature readings, calendar and time are clearly illuminated in white against a black background, and the current-weather icons pop out like 3D. The barometric pressure graph and reading are a muted orange and don’t steal focus from the indoor and outdoor temperatures.</p>
<p>It’s a well-designed unit, except for one major issue: It has terrible range. It’s supposed to have a 300-foot range, but we barely got a signal 20 feet away. The Ambient Weather also struggled to send/receive a signal through a closed glass patio door &#8212; none of the other thermometers we tested had this issue. Adding insult to injury, this particular model of Ambient Weather is also the most expensive.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Since we last reviewed indoor outdoor thermometers, the latest models have been significantly improved over the ones we originally rated. If you’re really into weather and want a thermometer that will give you accurate temperature, humidity and barometric-pressure readings, we recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071VKV4HJ/?tag=ybdiotherm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">La Crosse Technology &#8211; C85845</a>. It has a large, boldly lit and easy-to-read LED display and a powerful receiver/transmitter that can pick up signals over 300 feet away.</p>
<p>If you don’t need all features and just want to know the current temperature and time, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001DNIIOS/?tag=ybdiotherm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">La Crosse Technology &#8211; WS-916OU</a> is our budget pick. Although it doesn’t have a long-range signal (about 150 feet), it has a clean, minimalist look, and its always-illuminated screen can be easily seen from across the room.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ith more than 50 hours spent researching and testing top products on the market, we concluded that the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MPV473S/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Smiley Daisy &#8211; Hibiscus</a> is the best essential oil diffuser available. Three years after we first tested it, it&#8217;s still the best on the market. From the new crop of diffusers in 2019, we also like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075V1R8LT/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InnoGear</a> diffuser. This one in particular is great for larger spaces.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-found">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We spent more than 40 hours researching essential oil diffusers in order to find the best products to test. We started by looking at the biggest brands in the category (such as dōTERRA), then expanded our search through subreddits like r/aromatherapy and r/essentialoils.</p>
<p>We also read through several essential oil and aromatherapy internet forums, read studies and articles about the benefits of essential oils and diffusing those oils, and read about the diffusers that industry experts recommended.</p>
<p>Once we knew what to look for, we narrowed our search with a few more criteria. Each diffuser needed to meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have an automatic shutoff feature</li>
<li>Operate for<i> at least</i> 4 hours</li>
<li>Have a water capacity of 120ml or more</li>
<li>Come with a trustworthy manufacturer’s warranty</li>
</ul>
<p>From there, we factored in positive reviews on Amazon and by professional reviewers as well as several interviews with brand representatives to determine which products we should test in-house.</p>
<p>In 2019, we looked for updated products that would fill a larger room and run for a longer time. We&#8217;re still happy with our 2016 top pick for most situations, but we found a new runner-up that will run even longer and added some style options for people who don&#8217;t like fake woodgrain.</p>
<h2 id="the-seven-best">Compare the best essential oil diffusers</h2>
[table id=258 /]
<h2 id="what-is">What exactly is an essential oil diffuser?</h2>
<p>There are several different types of essential oil diffusers on the market. For this article, we focused on ultrasonic diffusers. Ultrasonic diffusers are best for diffusing essential oils because they do not utilize heat in the production of vapor. Since heat can have a negative effect on essential oils, ultrasonic diffusers are the best way to get the full benefit of diffusing essential oils.</p>
<p>Ultrasonic diffusers work by vibrating the water in such a way that it vaporizes into the air. Since the essential oils are mixed into the water, they are carried along with the water. Ultrasonic diffusers generate the vapor without any heat, which best preserves the integrity of the essential oil.</p>
<p>Diffusers are better than any scented candle, because you can put more than 100 different essential oils into them. You can even combine two or more essential oils to create a unique blend.</p>
<h3>The difference between a diffuser and a humidifier</h3>

<p>While a diffuser uses the same mechanism and adds a small amount of humidity into the air, the design of an ultrasonic humidifier is different.</p>
<p>An essential oil diffuser has a much smaller tank of water, usually somewhere between 80ml to 500ml. This means that the humidifying effects of a diffuser are relatively minimal when compared to a humidifier.</p>
<p>Unlike a humidifier, a diffuser is made from materials designed to hold essential oils. Crystal-clear acrylic water tanks let you see how clean the water is in your humidifier, but discoloration and cracking are common results of experimentation with essential oils. It&#8217;s possible to make a humidifier with a tank that can stand up to the organic compounds in common essential oils, but none of the models we tested in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-humidifier/">humidifier review</a> are designed to do so.</p>
<p>We did test some humidifiers that use a small heated pad to release the volatile compounds of an essential oil into the air without adding it to your water tank. Many essential oils change when heated, though. For those who want aromatherapy benefits and humidity, it is best to use an ultrasonic essential oil diffuser <i>and</i> a humidifier.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-essential-oil">Benefits of essential oils</h2>
<p>Essential oils have been <a href="http://www.utne.com/mind-and-body/history-of-herbal-medicine-ze0z1404zcov.aspx?PageId=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">used for thousands of years</a>, from cultures as far-reaching as Ancient Egypt and India. These oils have been used for a variety of purposes, from spiritual to medicinal, and there are a significant number of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0032645/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modern scientific studies</a> that support the theory that essential oils can be beneficial in a number of very real and quantifiable ways.</p>
<p>The following are just a few examples of the types of benefits that essential oils can provide:</p>
<h3>Eucalyptus</h3>
<p>Eucalyptus has been used across many cultures and is often used in over-the-counter medications. When placed near the sinuses or on the chest it helps with congestion and sore muscles. Eucalyptus is particularly useful for diffusers like the ones we are testing — especially when used for congestion.</p>
<h3>Lavender</h3>
<p>Lavender is typically used for bruises, cuts, and skin irritation. Studies also show that the scent can reduce levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Application on the skin has its uses, however lavender is popular for diffusers because it can create a soothing, relaxing scent in a room.</p>
<h3>Peppermint</h3>
<p>Used in many OTC remedies, peppermint can be added to beverages and soothe the stomach. Studies show that peppermint increases oxygen levels in the blood, and can help a person be more aware.</p>
<h3>Tea Tree</h3>
<p>Tea tree oil is commonly used directly on the skin, and can be used for everything from acne to fungal infections.</p>
<h3>Lots of others</h3>
<p>There are literally hundreds of essential oils to choose from, some more useful than others. We recommend you do some research to find a few essential oils that will work best for you. When researching and testing the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-essential-oils/">best essential oils</a>, we discovered that quality can greatly vary by brands. Proper use and selection are required to maintain safety and to properly enjoy the benefits of these oils.</p>

<h2 id="do-you-need">Do you need an essential oil diffuser?</h2>
<p>A surprisingly small number of people actually know what an essential oil diffuser is. When we conducted a poll, only about half knew what an essential oil diffuser was.</p>
<p>That said, diffusers are gaining popularity due to a growing interest in the health benefits of essential oils, as well as the fact that scented candles are not as safe as many once thought.</p>
<h3>The health benefits of essential oil diffusers</h3>
<p>For many essential oils, there are different benefits attributed to applying them directly on the skin, versus diffusing them into the air. Some essential oils shouldn’t be placed directly on the skin at all.</p>
<p>Essential oils serve a number of purposes, including the following:</p>
<h3>Aromatherapy</h3>
<p>Essential oils are used for everything from relaxation (lavender) to pain relief (rosemary) to decongestants (peppermint and eucalyptus). By diffusing these oils into the air, you can gain the benefits for hours without needing to reapply the oils onto your skin.</p>
<h3>Ambiance</h3>
<p>There’s a reason why many spas have a distinctive smell — they’re using essential oils! Oils such as tea tree oil have been used for centuries to create the ambiance of a calm, safe place.</p>
<h3>Insect repellant</h3>
<p>Many people are already familiar with the fact that citronella is a useful mosquito repellant. However, there are lots of other essential oils that work as well — which is a good thing if you’re not a fan of the citronella scent!</p>
<p>Essential oils that act as insect repellants include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cedarwood and eucalyptus for fleas</li>
<li>Thyme, juniper, and rose geranium for ticks</li>
<li>Citronella and peppermint for mosquitos</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, it’s worth mentioning that while there are candles that can perform many of the same functions as the oils listed, essential oils (especially 100% pure oils) contain none of the harmful chemicals found in many scented candles currently on the market.</p>
<h2 id="math">Essential oils vs. scented candles</h2>

<p>Some people think that essential oils are out of their price range. After all, when people think “essential oils” they often image an expensive day spa. <strong>However</strong>, <b>essential oils are in fact significantly less expensive than scented candles</b>.</p>
<p>For the math enthusiasts, here’s a breakdown:</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JDGC78/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">22-Ounce Yankee Candle</a> costs about $27 on Amazon, and is guaranteed to burn for somewhere between 110 and 150 hours. If we take the high end (150), and divide by the cost ($27), we get a cost of <b>18 cents per hour</b>.</p>
<p>The essential oil math is a little bit more complicated.</p>
<p>There are approximately 20 drops in a milliliter of Lavender essential oil, and 29.574 milliliters in an ounce. This comes out to about 591 drops per ounce.</p>
<p>A four ounce bottle of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TSTZQEY/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">Lavender essential oil</a> costs about $10.50 on Amazon, which means you can purchase 2,364 drops of Lavender essential oil for $10.50, at a cost of $0.0044 per drop.</p>
<p>Smiley Daisy recommends that we use about 3 drops of oil per 100ml, which means in the 350ml Hibiscus tank, we would need 10.5 drops, which we will round up to 11 drops. At $0.0044 per drop, those 11 drops cost $0.0484.</p>
<p>A 350ml tank lasts somewhere between 6 and 7 hours. If we estimate conservatively, that means the 11 drops will last 6 hours. Since the cost of the 11 drops is $0.0484, then the cost per hour is $0.0081 cents.</p>
<p>This means that the product cost for an essential oil diffuser is 4.5% of what it would be for a scented candle. When put into the context that essential oils have health benefits and scented candles have potential health risks, the choice is easy — even when we account for the electricity costs of a diffuser.</p>
<h3>Research on the dangers of scented candles</h3>
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/16/scented-candles-toxic-safer-options_n_7536410.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growing body of research</a> which indicates that scented candles are not as safe as many think. It&#8217;s not just soot: many candles release harmful metals and compounds into the air — including lead, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde.</p>
<p>While there are scented candles that do not release these harmful chemicals, a <a href="http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/P1009BZL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">significant number do</a>. This issue has underscored the value and importance of finding alternatives to candles.</p>
<p>If you currently use scented candles for anything from aromatherapy to ambiance, research your brand of candle to ensure it does not contain chemicals that could be harmful to you or your family.</p>
<p>A better option would be to switch over to an essential oil diffuser, which provides many of the same benefits as a scented candle. If you strongly prefer the ambiance of a flame to the swirling mist of a diffuser, think about putting an <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-air-purifier/">air purifier</a> in the same room to give your lungs a break.</p>

<p>There are a lot of essential oil diffusers available online. In fact, there are more than 32,000 essential oil diffusers available on Amazon alone. With so many products to choose from, narrowing the field to a few finalists can feel overwhelming. That’s why it’s important to filter for only the best quality <i>and</i> best value diffusers.</p>
<p>First, determine the size of the room you want your diffuser to cover. Most (high-quality) diffusers list the size of a room in which they can effectively diffuse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too much” diffusing is not a common problem with essential oil diffusers, especially since many offer a way to reduce output if necessary.</p>
<p>It’s also important to look at the water capacity of a diffuser, along with the estimated operating time. The operating time informs you of how long you can expect the essential oil scent to last in the room, while you can estimate the amount of water (and oil) diffused by taking the water capacity and dividing it by the operating time (e.g. 100ml and 2 hours would mean 50ml diffused per hour).</p>
<p>It’s also important to take into consideration the build quality of the diffuser you buy. Essential oils can be corrosive to some plastics, which means that a cheaply-made diffuser might break down after only a few months of use. All high-quality diffusers use polypropylene, or another strengthened polymer or material, to ensure the longevity of the product.</p>
<p>Ease of use is another important consideration. This includes both setup (which should involve little more than putting water and your preferred essential oil into the diffuser) and clean up.</p>
<p>The size, or dimensions of a diffuser might not matter to everyone. However, for those with limited space, it might be worth looking into a diffuser with a smaller footprint. Similarly, a noisy diffuser can be distracting in an otherwise-quiet setting — such as a yoga studio or even your bedroom.</p>
<p>Features such as a timer and ambient lighting can be a nice touch, and are worth taking into consideration when comparing one diffuser to another.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>In order to determine the best aromatherapy diffuser on the market, we ordered our seven finalists and put them through a series of tests in our San Diego office.</p>
<p>The first thing we did was open the box and read the instruction manual.</p>
<p>Next, we looked at the pieces and assessed how easy it would be to set up the diffuser. We also took into consideration the build quality of the diffuser.</p>
<p>After that, we looked at the settings and options available on the diffuser, including auto-off, lighting, timers, etc. We also took note of how intuitive the controls were, and whether we needed to actually refer to the instruction manual more than once.</p>
<p>We also checked to confirm that the specs and features listed on each diffuser’s product page matched the product itself. Specifically, we checked ambient lighting, operating time, water capacity, timers, and automatic shutoff when the water reservoir is depleted. Fortunately, all seven finalists held up to expectations, so we moved on to differentiating between their diffusing performance.</p>
<h3>Diffuser performance metrics</h3>
[table id=259 /]
<p>To test each of the diffusers, we closed the doors and windows in our conference room, which measures 21 by 10 by 12 feet, for a total of 2520 cubic feet and 210 square feet.</p>
<p>We then filled the first diffuser with water and the recommended number of drops of essential oil (we used sweet orange oil for our testing because it has a distinct and easily-detectable scent), making sure to use the same ratio of water to oil for each diffuser.</p>
<p>With the conference room closed off, we put the first diffuser at one end of our 8-foot conference table and calculated how long it took for the scent of the sweet orange oil to reach the other side of the table — with three judges to ensure as accurate a measurement as possible.</p>
<p>The notable performers in this test were the dōTERRA and PureSpa &#8211; Deluxe, both moving the scent quickly through the room. This doesn&#8217;t seem correlated to having a more diffuse plume of vapor or a faster (and thus louder) fan.</p>

<p>On the other end of the scale, PureSpa&#8217;s Compact model put out so little vapor that it took eight minutes to reach the other side of the room.</p>
[table id=260 /]
<p>After measuring how long it took for the scent to reach the other side of the conference table, we left the room and let the diffuser run for 30 minutes with the doors and windows closed. We went into the room and touched the diffuser to determine if any parts were warm, and also used a decibel meter to measure the noise level from an inch away.</p>
<p>Note that the main sound coming from a diffuser is, in most cases, bubbling water. The models with the loudest noise level, like the Greenair and InnoGear, also have a small fan to help the vapor spread through your room.</p>

<p>While all seven of the diffusers we tested do a good job of releasing essential oils into the air, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MPV473S/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">Smiley Daisy &#8211; Hibiscus</a> was easily the best of the pack. The diffuser’s short stature, coupled with strong build quality and four sturdy rubber feet means that this diffuser won’t get knocked over very easily.</p>
<p>What makes the Hibiscus really stand out is the vapor output it produces, as well as the quality of that output. The water capacity of the Hibiscus diffuser is 350ml, which is more than double the capacity of most other diffusers we tested. With a maximum run time of between 6 and 7 hours, this translates to approximately 55ml of vapor per hour.</p>
<p>The diffuser also produced a strong stream of vapor, which could be seen as much as 20 inches from the table, or about 16 inches above the spout on the diffuser. It&#8217;s</p>
<p>The large capacity and strong vapor stream of the Hibiscus made a noticeable difference during our testing. We found that there was a strong scent — about as strong as when the diffuser was on — for about 15 minutes after we turned the diffuser off. The scent remained quite noticeable until the 30 minute mark, and a lingering scent remained until almost an hour after turning the diffuser off.</p>

<p>Operation of the Hibiscus is simple as well. The instruction manual has very straightforward instructions, and using the product feels intuitive right away. There are two separate buttons on the front of the diffuser — one for turning the diffuser on or off (including a setting for a 2 hour timer), and a separate button for turning on and off the light.</p>
<p>The light itself offers seven different color options, which can either cycle or be locked onto one color. The light itself isn’t particularly bright, so it could serve as an effective night light without disrupting sleep. (Especially if you choose the red light, as we found out in <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-night-light/#really-matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our night-light research</a>.)</p>
<p>Finally, the Hibiscus essential oil diffuser is quiet. In our office, which measures about 40 decibels with the doors and windows closed, the diffuser only generated 46.5 decibels of noise.</p>
<p>Smiley Daisy also offers a 180 day warranty, which ensures that, if you’re one of the unlucky few that get a defective product, you’ll be able to get a replacement at no cost and with no hassle.</p>
<p>Overall, the Smiley Daisy Hibiscus Essential Oil Diffuser offers impressive build quality and the best overall performance of the essential oil diffusers we tested. At a price point below $40, the diffuser is a great value as well.</p>
<h3>What we didn’t like about the Hibiscus</h3>
<p>While the Hibiscus was our best pick, there were a couple of negatives about the product. The biggest potential problem is the large footprint of the diffuser. Unlike most diffusers, which utilize vertical space in their design (and particularly for their water reservoirs), the Hibiscus is short and wide, measuring 8.3 by 6.6 inches (and only 3.2 inches of vertical height).</p>
<p>In addition, the light generated is minimal, functioning more as a design element than an actual source of light.</p>
<p>All that said, these negatives are very minor when compared to the overall package. We&#8217;ve been using the Hibiscus for three years now, and it&#8217;s still humming along cheerfully.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MPV473S/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smiley Daisy &#8211; Hibiscus</a> has a strong build quality with sturdy rubber feet.</li>
<li>It has double the water capacity of most other diffusers, which means less refilling.</li>
<li>Smiley Daisy achieved the strongest vapor release rate in our tests.</li>
<li>With cycling seven colored light options, this is a worthy mood-light.</li>

<p>After three years of great performance from our top pick, we set out to find a diffuser that would fill a different role, but with similar strengths. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075V1R8LT/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InnoGear &#8211; Premium 500ml Diffuser</a> isn&#8217;t just great at spreading your favorite essence across a large space: It can also do so for up to 12 hours of run-time.</p>
<p>Our previous endurance pick, the PureSpa &#8211; Deluxe, relied on a low output rate to get long run times from its 120ml tank. The InnoGear makes no such compromises.</p>
<p>The InnoGear diffuser also has a distinctive look. Unlike the faux-wood or white plastic shells that are so common, this model features a metal screen that adds some contrast to the colored lighting options.</p>

<p>This design doesn&#8217;t solve all of our reservations about the Smiley Daisy. If you&#8217;re looking for a compact diffuser to keep at a desk or on a small side-table, this is even less ideal than our top pick.</p>
<p>One other tiny flaw is noise: this is on the louder end of the lineup we&#8217;ve tested. There&#8217;s a small fan inside helping spread your favorite scent to all corners of a room, and that makes it just a hair louder than ultra-quiet models like the dōTERRA &#8211; Petal. It&#8217;s not going to be distracting during the day in a large room, but if you can&#8217;t sleep next to devices that make quiet, constant sounds this isn&#8217;t the best choice.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The InnoGear is a large diffuser that will run for a very long time.</li>
<li>You still get a good, strong output from this design for the whole time it&#8217;s running.</li>
<li>A unique look sets this model apart.</li>
<li>The plume of vapor from the InnoGear is the tallest, but the most diffuse.</li>

<h2 id="the-others">Other finalists we tested</h2>
<h3 id="second-best-doterra-petal">dōTERRA &#8211; Petal Diffuser</h3>
<p><img class="full-width alignnone size-full wp-image-19569" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/doTERRA_Petal-Diffuser_web.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NZFGLHS/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">dōTERRA &#8211; Petal Diffuser</a> is another very strong option from our list of finalists. The materials feel strong and sturdy, and we expect that the Petal diffuser will stand the test of time.</p>
<p>During our testing, we also found that the Petal diffuser was able to reach the other side of our 8-foot conference table very quickly — the average our testers agreed upon was just 35 seconds. This is less than half the time that the Hibiscus diffused, and while not a particularly scientific testing method, it does say something significant about the dōTERRA diffuser’s ability to permeate a room quickly.</p>
<p>The light produced by the diffuser is a pleasant, soft white, and provides notably more light than the Hibiscus. However, the Petal diffuser is limited to only white light, as opposed to the wide range of color options offered by our top picks.</p>
<p>The Petal diffuser is very quiet as well. In our conference room, where ambient noise registered at 40 decibels, the Petal diffuser only generated 46 decibels when our noise meter was less than an inch away — comparable to the Hibiscus.</p>
<p>Similarly, the scent was quite noticeable for nearly 30 minutes after shutting off the diffuser (just like the Hibiscus), and the essential oil could still be smelled for about one hour after the diffuser was shut off.</p>
<p>Operation of the diffuser is simple. There are two buttons on the front, one for the light and the other for turning the diffuser on or off. One interesting feature we noticed was that the Petal Diffuser must have water in it before being turned on — however we consider this a safety feature that we are better off having.</p>
<p>Another strange feature we noticed was that the diffuser defaults to a 2 hour timer, and hitting the button again then cycles through the 1 and 4-hour settings before shutting off again. This is a minor quirk, but it did stand out to us during testing.</p>
<p>There were a few areas in which it fell short of our top pick<span style="font-size: 16px;">. </span>First off, the Petal diffuser produces less vapor and has a smaller capacity than our top picks. The Hibiscus runs for around seven hours, and the InnoGear can pump out approximately 45 ml per hour for ten hours. The Petal&#8217;s four-hour maximum runtime and its high price make it harder to recommend when you look at the competition.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the dōTERRA &#8211; Petal is a great product, and is more compact than the Hibiscus. However, in an apples-to-apples comparison, the Hibiscus is a better buy.</p>

<p><img class="full-width" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PureSpa_Deluxe_web-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VKER63E/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pure Enrichment &#8211; PureSpa Deluxe</a> is a great product, and if we hadn’t also tested so many other great diffusers, we would have been confident recommending it as our best pick.</p>
<p>The PureSpa Deluxe has a 2-year manufacturer warranty provides peace of mind, and we like the clean and polished design (despite the overly-loud logo).</p>
<p>What makes the PureSpa Deluxe really stand out is its 8 to 10 hour running time, one of the longest we found<strong>.</strong> This means you can turn the diffuser on at the beginning of your workday (or before going to sleep) and it will run consistently throughout the entire day (or night) without a second thought.</p>
<p>The lighting is also well-executed, with the option to cycle through blue, green, red, yellow, and purple — however there is <i>not</i> a setting to stay locked onto one color. Also, much like our top picks, the PureSpa Deluxe did not become hot anywhere, even after running continuously for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Despite the positive features of the PureSpa Deluxe, there are a few problems that we couldn’t overlook, particularly when compared to the Smiley Daisy &#8211; Hibiscus and the dōTERRA Petal Diffuser:</p>
<p>First off, the water capacity of the PureSpa Deluxe is just 120ml, less than both the Hibiscus (350ml) and the Petal (150ml). That, coupled with the extended runtime of the PureSpa Deluxe means that the amount of vapor produced per hour is significantly lower than either of our top picks.</p>
<p>We calculated the vapor diffused by the PureSpa Deluxe per hour was around 12ml to 15ml. This stands in stark contrast to the Hibiscus (55ml per hour) and the Petal (37.5ml per hour).</p>
<p>This difference was noticeable in our testing as well. After 30 minutes with the PureSpa Deluxe on, we found that the scent in the room was certainly present, but notably weaker than it was with either the Hibiscus or the Petal diffusers. Furthermore, the scent was all but gone 15 minutes after turning the diffuser off.</p>
<p>Finally, the PureSpa Deluxe is notably louder than both the Hibiscus and the Petal diffusers. Our noise meter detected 51 decibels, which is about 5 decibels louder than both of our top picks.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the PureSpa Deluxe is worth considering if you want a diffuser that can run all day without needing to be refilled, and if you are more interested in having a subtle scent of essential oil in a particular room.</p>
<h3>ZAQ Allay LiteMist Diffuser</h3>
<p><img class="full-width alignnone size-full wp-image-19569" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ZAQ-Allay_web.jpg" alt="ZAQ Allay_web" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0161ZYOA4/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">ZAQ Allay diffuser</a> has one of the more creative designs of the diffusers we came across. The LED lighting looks great emanating from the long cap (which itself is available in multiple colors).</p>
<p>However, the diffuser itself only has a water capacity of 80ml, which with a maximum 4 hour runtime means that this diffuser only produces about 20ml of vapor per hour.</p>
<p>In addition, we noticed that the mist fell to the table — which indicates that this particular diffuser does not break the water into small enough particles to float through the room. This observation was supported by the fact that the it took 2 minutes and 15 seconds for the scent of the essential oil to reach the other side of our 8-foot conference table.</p>
<p>Finally, the build quality of this diffuser, while not terrible, can’t really compete with several of the other products we tested. For the $40 price point, there are simply better options available.</p>
<h3>Nestar</h3>

<p>We picked up the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JFPTSP9/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Nestar ceramic essential oil diffuser</strong></a> because of its compact size, clean lines, and affordable price. The tank is slightly larger than the similar Smiley Daisy &#8211; Love in a Mist diffuser below, and the rated maximum room size is bigger. The light only shines white.</p>
<p>While we like the look and the features on offer with this model, it just didn&#8217;t quite live up to the performance expectations we had after testing larger diffusers. It&#8217;s quicker to diffuse scents in an eight-foot-long room than many of the smaller models we tested, but it&#8217;s no competition for the dōTERRA.</p>
<p>This is smaller than our top pick, but it&#8217;s also a little bit more wobbly. For some people, that might be fine; it&#8217;s not going to fall over by itself. But for cramped quarters like a college dorm room or an essential-oil-friendly workplace, we&#8217;d prefer to give up a few square inches of desk space in return for certainty that you&#8217;re not going to spill scented water everywhere.</p>
<h3>Smiley Daisy &#8211; Love in a Mist</h3>
<p><img class="full-width alignnone size-full wp-image-19569" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SmileyDaisy_Love-in-a-Mist_web.jpg" alt="SmileyDaisy - Love in a Mist" /></p>
<p>The intricate shapes etched into the porcelain make the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SDM5XXG/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">Love in a Mist diffuser</a> arguably the prettiest product we tested. The build quality of this diffuser is fantastic inside and out, with high-quality plastic for the interior reservoir. The Love in a Mist diffuser also has several lighting color options, which can cycle or remain locked.</p>
<p>However, during our testing it took 3 minutes and 15 seconds for the scent of the essential oil to reach the other side of the table — significantly longer than our best picks. Unfortunately, we detected 52 decibels of noise next to the diffuser, notably louder than our best picks.</p>
<p>While this is a beautiful diffuser, it is more expensive than the other products we tested (around $60) with less impressive results. However, if you are more concerned with beauty rather than peak performance, this is a compelling (and reasonably functional) option.</p>
<h3>PureSpa Compact Diffuser</h3>
<p><img class="full-width alignnone size-full wp-image-19569" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PureSpa_color-change_web.jpg" alt="PureSpa_color-change_web" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VKEEY8E/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">PureSpa Compact diffuser</a> is one of the most popular options on the market, with thousands of Amazon reviews averaging 4.6 stars. This diffuser is simple, easy to operate, and provides 7 hours of diffusing with 100ml of water. This diffuser also has ambient LED lighting, and is made from cheap, but durable materials.</p>
<p>The most significant downside to this diffuser is the 100ml tank and 7 hour run time — which translates to a paltry 14.3ml of vapor per hour. This deficiency presented itself in the 2 minute and 30 seconds it took for the scent of the essential oil to reach the other side of the table.</p>
<h3>Greenair Spa Vapor+</h3>
<p><img class="full-width alignnone size-full wp-image-19569" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/greenair_Spa-Vapor_web.jpg" alt="PureSpa_color-change_web" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00889F0ZK/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">Greenair Spa Vapor+</a> was the last diffuser we tested, and overall it is a decent product. With a 150ml tank and a 4 hour run time, this diffuser generates an impressive 37.5ml of vapor per hour.</p>
<p>However, this diffuser is on the noisier side, registering 52 decibels, and the scent of the essential oil disappeared soon after we turned off the diffuser (within 10 to 15 minutes). This fact, in conjunction with the considerable vapor production, signifies that the Spa Vapor+ is simply unable to produce vapor particles small enough to remain suspended in the air for extended periods of time.</p>
<h2>Long-term testing notes</h2>
<p>After years of almost-daily use, both the Smiley Daisy Hibiscus and the dōTERRA Petal diffusers are still working very well. One thing we noticed with the Hibiscus in particular was that the residual smell of essential oils builds up in the reservoir over time. This doesn&#8217;t have a huge impact, but can have an undesirable effect on some scents.</p>
<p>We were able to successfully remove the residual scents by cleaning the reservoir with a little dish soap, some warm water, and <em>very</em> light scrubbing with a paper tower. We don&#8217;t recommend using any cleaning products beyond dish soap or vinegar, and make sure you triple-rinse the diffuser before using it after cleaning. Remember that everything that&#8217;s in the tank will go into your room air and lungs.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>All of the diffusers we tested can generate enough vapor to make a small to mid-sized room smell like the essential oil of your choice. However, some did better than others, especially when price is taken into account.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MPV473S/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smiley Daisy &#8211; Hibiscus</a> stole the show, generating lots of vapor and producing a long-lasting scent in our conference room. The Hibiscus also has excellent build quality, and its low center of gravity makes it a sturdy fixture on any flat surface.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075V1R8LT/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InnoGear &#8211; Premium 500ml</a> is a new model for 2019 that gets our pick for large spaces, with a 12-hour reservoir capacity and steady output. It&#8217;s also a unique style option that some of our testers loved.</p>
<p>The rest of the options all have their pros and cons, but for the money the Smiley Daisy &#8211; Hibiscus provides the best value <i>and</i> the best performance across all the metrics we tested.</p>
