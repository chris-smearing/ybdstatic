<h2 id="standards">Pet food standards</h2>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) works hand-in-hand with the <a href="https://www.aafco.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Association of American Feed Control Officials</a> (AAFCO) in regulating pet food standards. The AAFCO is a voluntary membership organization of local, state and federal agencies who regulate the sale and distribution of animal feed and pet food.</p>
<p>The AAFCO’s panel of scientists, veterinarians and experts on animal nutrition devised industry-wide standards for the ingredients used in manufacturing pet foods. For any pet food to be deemed certified by the AAFCO, ingredients must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Species appropriate</li>
<li>Proven safe</li>
<li>Nutritionally adequate</li>
</ul>
<p>Together with the AAFCO, the FDA enforces the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/Products/AnimalFoodFeeds/IngredientsAdditives/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">required labeling of pet foods</a>. All pet foods must be labeled with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ingredients</li>
<li>Manufacturer’s name and address</li>
<li>Guaranteed analysis (such as protein, fiber, fat, etc.)</li>
<li>Nutritional adequacy statement</li>
<li>Feeding directions</li>
<li>Calorie statement</li>
</ul>
<p>A manufacturer of dog food must comply with the FDA’s regulations to sell their product. As long as the manufacturer follows the rules for labeling, they are free to add virtually any ingredient to their dog food.</p>
<h2 id="dogs-need">What do dogs need in their diet?</h2>
<p>As with humans, a dog’s diet is the foundation of good health. There are foods that can heal a dog, foods that harm a dog, and foods that do both. A frequent term used by veterinarians is “species appropriate,” which means the type of food the animal consumes in the wild. Since dogs and wolves share 99.9% of DNA, a species appropriate diet for a dog would be similar to a wolf’s diet: high protein, high moisture and low carbohydrates.</p>
<p>Although it’s popular to think a dog is omnivorous — and it certainly does seem like they eat anything — they have not evolved from their carnivorous origins. Dogs require meat in their diet, despite the fad of feeding them just vegetables and whole grains. Their digestive system breaks down raw meat, bone, offal and fur into nutrients and then passes waste material quickly.</p>
<p>We’re not advocating feeding bones, internal organs and fur to your dog, but the nutrients these body parts supply should be integrated in your dog’s diet. Reputable dog food manufacturers strive to make foods that meet your dog’s nutritional needs. There are, however, many dog food manufacturers — household names, no less — that plump up their product with unnamed meats, bulky grains and additives to save costs.</p>
<h3>Changing your dog’s food</h3>
<p>Conventional wisdom is that you should never change a dog’s food. According to veterinarian <a href="https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/dr-karen-becker.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Karen Becker</a>, that’s like being told as a child that the only thing you can eat for the rest of your life is oatmeal.</p>
<p>In the wild, canines have a smorgasbord of foods at their disposal, so if you’ve been feeding your dog the same canned and/or dry food for years, there’s a good chance that he/she is bored with it. A quick change, however, may cause digestive distress. There’s <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/how-often-should-i-change-foods.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a definite procedure</a> for changing your dog’s diet, but it will be nutritionally beneficial for him/her to switch foods periodically.</p>
<h3>Grain-free diet</h3>
<p>No doubt you see a lot of savvy marketing for “grain-free” dog foods. It’s true that grains add unnecessary carbohydrates, but as dogs evolved, their digestive systems adapted to processing grains. (The exception is whole ground corn, which is difficult for dogs to digest and process.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thisdogslife.co/10-breeds-prone-allergies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some breeds</a>, however, have a genetic predilection for gluten and other food allergies, so a grain-free diet is necessary for them to thrive.</p>
<p>In 2018, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/animalveterinary/newsevents/cvmupdates/ucm613305.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FDA launched a study</a> into possible links between grain-free diets and canine heart disease. Removing grains from pet foods eliminates taurine, an important amino acid for both cats and dogs. The Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association reports that the FDA’s study is not just focused on grain-free diets, however, but also on the possible detrimental effects of replacing grains with legumes.</p>
<p>Jme Thomas is the Executive Director of <a href="https://www.motleyzooanimalrescue.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Motley Zoo Animal Rescue</a>, and she advises that since the FDA’s study has caused some concern in the pet industry, you might consider feeding your dog a food that has small amounts of grain. However, If your dog is allergic to grain, then it’s best to simply add a taurine supplement to his/her food.</p>
<h2 id="how-made">How dog food is made</h2>
<h3>Canned</h3>
<p>The primary ingredients of canned dog food are fresh meat and meat by-products, which include the cleaned carcass and internal organs of the slaughtered animal. The meat is frozen and either cut into chunks or ground. It is then steamed in water or broth, and the cooked meat is then combined with other ingredients, such as vegetables, grains, vitamins and minerals. A starch or thickener is added to gel the mixture together. The mixture is packed into individual cans, vacuum-sealed and sterilized in a heating chamber.</p>
<h3>Dry food</h3>
<p>Fresh or frozen meat and meat by-products are combined with ground grains, fats, vitamins, minerals and meals derived from ground bone or ground dehydrated meat or meat by-products. This mixture, resembling bread dough, is forced through an extruder, which cooks and cuts it into shapes. The pieces are then oven-dried, cooled and sprayed with flavor enhancers and preservatives.</p>
<h3>Freeze-dried</h3>
<p>Cut raw meat is placed inside a vacuum chamber, which freezes the meat solid. The chamber’s temperature is gradually increased and pressurized. The meat’s frozen internal liquid converts to vapor and is extracted. Freeze-dried food may be fed as is or rehydrated.</p>
<h3>Dehydrated</h3>
<p>Conversely, dehydration involves a heat process of removing moisture from meat. Low heat is slowly applied to the raw product until it is completely dried. Dehydrated foods must be rehydrated before feeding.</p>
<h2 id="package">Packaging and labeling</h2>
<p>Since dog food is marketed to owners and not their dogs, most of the manufacturer’s deception and specious claims are found on the product’s packaging.</p>
<p>The majority of dog food packaging — if not all of it —is plastered with bright and bold colors and mouth-watering photographs of roasted or raw meats and vegetables, sometimes ladled with gravy or cross-hatched with barbecue grill marks. These enticing images are obviously intended to draw your eyes to the packaging.</p>
<p>Next, the manufacturer will grab you with marketing catch phrases on the bag or can, such as “increases vitality,” “vibrant maturity,” or “proactive health.” Also you’ll see “premium,” “super-premium” and “ultra-premium.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no set standards for using these phrases, and a company will label their product to appeal to the consumer’s emotions and conscience. Although there are dog food manufacturers who are indeed using higher-quality ingredients, others are simply marking up the price of their product for the inclusion of ingredients that have no proven higher nutritional value.</p>
<h3>AAFCO labeling rules</h3>
<p>The FDA and AAFCO cannot enforce truth in advertising. However, dog food manufacturers are required to use specific wording for the percentages of meat in their products. Below are the standardized phrases and their definitions as dictated by the AAFCO.</p>
<p><b>95-percent rule: </b>Ninety-five percent — not including the water added for processing —  of the product must be the named ingredient, for example, beef or chicken. If the water is counted in the total percentage, then the named ingredient must comprise 70-percent of the total. If the name includes two ingredients —  for example, “Beef ‘n Liver Dog Food” — they must comprise 95% of the total weight with the first ingredient listed having predominance.</p>
<p><b>25-percent or “dinner” rule: </b>If the named ingredients comprise at least 25% of the product (not including water for processing), it must be labeled as “dinner. For example, ‘Beef Dinner for Dogs” must only contain at least 25% of beef in the total weight of the product. If two ingredients are listed, like “Beef ‘n Liver Dinner,” the second named ingredient must weigh only 3% of the total.</p>
<p><b>3-percent or “with” rule: </b>This rule was originally created for advertising the inclusion of a minor ingredient, such as cheese, in the food. The AAFCO has modified the rule so that the word <b>“with”</b> indicates that 3% of the ingredient comprises the total weight. So for example, “Dog Food With Beef” means there is only 3% beef total in the food.</p>
<p><b>Flavor: </b>No percentage is required for this word to be used, but it must contain an amount that is detectable. “Beef Flavor Dog Food” may have beef as an ingredient, but more than likely it is beef meal, beef by-products or a “digest,” a concentrated flavor enhancer derived from the liquid of boiled-down meats.</p>
<p><b>Natural: </b>The AAFCO defines “natural” as meaning ingredients that are derived solely from animal, plant or mineral that have not been processed using chemicals or chemical additives. A product may be labeled as “100-percent natural” or “all-natural” only if it does not contain synthetic ingredients.</p>
<p><b>Organic: </b>The same requirements established by the <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/about-ams/programs-offices/national-organic-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Department of Agriculture </a>(USDA) for foods consumed by humans apply to dog foods. Ingredients must be produced by approved methods without synthetic fertilizers, irradiation or genetic engineering. The USDA does not consider organic foods to be necessarily healthier or more nutritious than conventionally produced foods.</p>
<h3>How to read the label</h3>
<p>Reading the label of the canned or dry food is the only way to really know whether it is the best food for your dog. The FDA enforces federal regulations for information that must be printed on every pet food label. Individual states may elect to follow the guidelines established by the AAFCO, which are more specific.</p>
<p>Each label should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proper identification of the product</li>
<li>Proper listing of ingredients</li>
<li>Manufacturer’s name and address</li>
<li>Guaranteed analysis.</li>
<li>Feeding directions</li>
<li>Calorie statements</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>As we discussed in <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-dog-treats/">our best dog treat review</a>, the ingredients in pet foods are not always easily identifiable. However, the AAFCO’s standards and definitions will help you understand exactly what’s in the dog food you buy.</p>
<p>All ingredients are required to be listed in order by weight, and the primary ingredients (those with the most weight) will be the first four or five that are listed. Since dog food manufacturers know that you want to feed meat to your dog, in most cases meat will be the first ingredient listed.</p>
<p>Bear in mind, however, that the water needed to cook the meat in canned food is included in the weight. In canned food, water or broth for processing is often the second — hence, the second weightiest —  ingredient.</p>
<p>The same rule applies to dry food before processing. You might see chicken listed as the first ingredient, but once that chicken’s been cooked and its moisture (nearly 75% of the meat’s weight) has been removed, the chicken’s weight has been reduced to approximately 20%.</p>
<p>There are three types of meat that are used in canned and dry dog food.</p>
<p><b>Meat:</b> Defined as “the clean flesh of slaughtered mammals and is limited to muscle tissue attached to the skeleton by tendons with or without the accompanying and overlying fat and the portions of the skin, sinew, nerve and blood vessels which normally accompany the flesh.”</p>
<p>The species of animal from which the meat was harvested must also be identified. “Slaughtered mammals” is very broad and could include meat you would never consider feeding to your beloved pet.</p>
<p>A major controversy in the pet food industry is known as “4-D meat.” The FDA has strict laws for the use of raw 4-D meat — diseased, dying, down, dead — in pet foods. A significant number of veterinarians and pet food nutritionists don’t believe the FDA is able to fully enforce these laws with all suppliers of meat. They warn that pet food labeled “meat” or “animal” could be harmful to your pet’s health.</p>
<p>As a general rule, never purchase a pet food that does not identify the species of animal meat or meat by-products used.</p>
<p><b>Meat by-products:</b> Rendered animal parts deemed not suitable for human consumption. They include carcasses, internal organs, heads, feet, hair and unhatched eggs. Although by-products are not considered esthetically pleasing by many people, they are oftentimes safe and nutritious for dogs.</p>
<p><b>Meat meal and by-product meal: </b>Meat and meat by-products, including bone, from which fat and moisture have been removed. Bone meal is similar to meat and by-product meals, but it can include entire carcasses. Unlike meat and meat by-products, animals other than cattle, sheep and goats may be used without identification on the label.</p>
<h3>Ingredients to beware</h3>
<p>The following list are ingredients that are frequently added to canned and dry dog foods. Veterinarians and pet nutritionists warn that these ingredients should not be fed to your dog. Some of the ingredients can cause your dog immediate harm, while others could affect your dog&#8217;s health over the long term.</p>
<p><b>Generic animal fat: </b>If the animal fat isn’t identified on the label, you’ll have no idea from what species of animal the fat has been trimmed.</p>
<p><b>BHA and BHT:</b> Banned in most countries for potential links to cancer, these chemical preservatives are still added to certain dog foods in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p><b>Artificial coloring:</b> Red, blue and yellow dyes have been added to appeal visually to you; your dog won’t care.</p>
<p><b>Corn syrup, fructose and sucrose:  </b>These sugars and other sweeteners are added to make lower-grade ingredients taste better.</p>
<p><b>Xylitol: </b>A sugar substitute used in products like chewing gum, this is toxic to dogs.</p>
<p><b>Propylene glycol: </b>This is a chemical food additive notable for its use in &#8220;safe&#8221; antifreeze. It’s often used in semi-moist dry dog food as a humectant. Although <a href="https://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/red-flag-ingredients/propylene-glycol-dog-food-aid-or-automotive-anti-freeze/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">propylene glycol has been banned from cat food</a>, it’s still allowed in dog food (and for human consumption at low levels).</p>
<p><b>Ethoxyquin:</b> First created by Monsanto as a pesticide and a food preservative, ethoxyquin has been linked to cancer. Its use in human food is heavily restricted, but it’s used in dog foods as a preservative for fish and fish meal. A manufacturer of dog food is not required to list ethoxyquin on the label if fish or fish meal was purchased from a supplier outside of the U.S.</p>
<h3>Guaranteed analysis</h3>
<p>Manufacturers are required to list the minimum amount of crude protein and crude fat and maximum amount of crude fiber and moisture on all dog food labels. “Crude” does not refer to the quality of the nutrient but to the method of estimating the quantity of the nutrient.</p>
<p>These percentages, however, vastly differ between canned dog food and dry dog food. For example, canned dog food might have 12% minimum crude protein and dry dog food might have 36%. You would assume the dry food is higher in protein than the canned food. In actuality, that’s not accurate.</p>
<p>Canned food has quadruple the amount of moisture of dry food, and so to make a meaningful calculation of nutrients, the FDA advises using the <a href="https://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/choosing-dog-food/dry-matter-basis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“dry matter basis.”</a> This may seem overly complex, but it’s easy to do and the only way of determining how nutritious a canned or dry food is.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Step 1: </b>Subtract the percentage of moisture listed on the canned food’s label from 100. As an example, the label on the canned food lists moisture as 72%. Subtract 72 from 100, leaving you with 28. This is now the percentage of dry matter in the canned food.</p>
<p><b>Step 2: </b>Divide the percentage of protein listed on the label — in our example, 12% — by the dry matter. So 12 divided by 28 equals (rounded off) .43.</p>
<p><b>Step 3: </b>Multiply that result by 100, and this will now give you the actual percentage of protein in the canned food.</p></blockquote>
<p>Repeat the calculation with the dry food, and compare them side by side. You now have an accurate representation of how much protein each contains.</p>
<h3>Nutritional adequacy statement</h3>
<p>Any dog food manufacturer that claims its product is “complete and balanced” must be labeled with the AAFCO nutritional adequacy statement. The food has been tested using AAFCO Feeding Trial Protocols under strict guidelines.</p>
<p>On the label, look for the following wording:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“&#8230;formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO Dog Food Nutrition Profiles for All Life Stages.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>If you don’t see the AAFCO’s nutritional adequacy statement, the product has not met the AAFCO’s stringent standards.</p>
<h3>“Made in the USA”</h3>
<p>By the Federal Trade Commission’s definition, “made in the USA” means that all or virtually all of a product has been made in the U.S. The FTC is less strict, however, about pet foods. A manufacturer of dog food may indeed process its product in the U.S., but it may source ingredients outside of the U.S.</p>
<p>In 2007, melamine in wheat gluten imported from China and used in canned dog food resulted in thousands of canine deaths. The FDA issued a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/animalveterinary/safetyhealth/recallswithdrawals/ucm129932.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recall of all the pet foods</a> made in the U.S. that used the imported wheat gluten. Currently the FDA is still investigating and studying what happened but has yet to issue regulations for importation of ingredients used in the manufacture of pet food.</p>
<p>The best you can do to ensure that the dog food you buy is made with U.S.-sourced ingredients is check whether the company has taken the <a href="https://associationfortruthinpetfood.com/the-pledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Association for Truth in Pet Food’s Pledge to Quality and Origin of Ingredients</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-best">What makes the best dog food?</h2>
<h3>Canned</h3>
<p><b>The primary ingredients are an identified whole meat:</b> The first ingredient should be an identified whole meat. The second ingredient is usually water or broth for processing. (Some of the canned foods we researched actually had water as the first ingredient.) The third ingredient should also be another identified whole meat or meat meal.  If you see brown rice, white rice, corn or barley as the third ingredient, that&#8217;s too much filler that will add carbohydrates.</p>
<p><b>Whole unprocessed vegetables and limited grains: </b>The nutrients, vitamins and antioxidants of whole foods will survive processing better than ground grains and vegetables. For example, “peas” are more nutritious than “pea flour.”</p>
<p><b>High protein, high moisture, low carbohydrates:</b> The AAFCO recommends a minimum of 22.5% protein and a minimum of 8.5% fat for puppies, and a minimum of 18% protein and 5.5% fat for adult dogs. The AAFCO does not measure carbohydrates, but estimates them by calculating other components, including crude fiber.</p>
<p><b>AAFCO nutritional statement: </b>Look for a statement on the can’s label that the food “provides complete and balanced nutrition for all life stages.”</p>
<h3>Dry dog food</h3>
<p><b>The first three ingredients are an identified whole meat: </b>Manufacturers know that you want to feed meat to your dog, so it will be listed first. If you see “chicken,” that’s great. Remember that the chicken loses up to 75% of its weight during processing. So the second ingredient should be another identified whole meat, and the third ingredient should be meat or a meat meal.</p>
<p><b>Whole vegetables and limited whole grains: </b>Whole vegetables and grains will retain more nutritional value than vegetable or grain flours during processing. Grains add carbohydrates, so look for dry foods that have grains lower on the list of ingredients.</p>
<p><b>Appropriate protein-to-fat ratio: </b>The percentages of protein to fat are dependent on your dog’s age and weight. The AAFCO recommends a daily consumption for a healthy adult dog as a minimum of 18% protein and 5.5% fat. The best dry dog foods we researched overall had a 2.5-to-1 protein-to-fat ratio.</p>
<p><b>AAFCO nutritional statement: </b>“Provides complete and balanced nutrition for all life stages” should be on the food’s label.</p>

<p>Our recommendations for best canned dog food are based on research and the analysis of twenty-three products that can be purchased at grocery stores, pet supply stores and online. We’ve consulted veterinarians and pet food nutrition experts for their opinions about what criteria canned dog food should meet to be considered exceptional.</p>
<p>Castor &amp; Pollux has several blends of their excellent canned dog foods. The Butcher &amp; Bushel blends are predominantly organic meats with whole vegetables and use less water and broth for processing than their other Organix recipes.</p>
<p>Castor &amp; Pollux’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Organix-Butcher-Organic-Carrots-Potatoes/dp/B00DQR8TXO/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chopped Turkey and Chicken Dinner</a> is high in protein and moisture and low in carbohydrates, which is exactly what you want in a canine food. Primary ingredients are meat: organic turkey, organic chicken and organic chicken liver. Peas, potatoes and blueberries are the vegetables and fruit. There’s also some flaxseed, which is a rich source of healthy fat and antioxidants.</p>

<p>The Castor &amp; Pollux Organix brand is USDA-certified 100% organic and verified by The Non-GMO Project as produced in accordance with best practices for GM avoidance. It also bears the AAFCO nutritional statement on the label.</p>
<p>There are three more grain-free Organix Butcher &amp; Bushel recipes: Chicken Wing and Thigh (which actually has chicken bone attached to the meat), Carved Turkey Dinner and Shredded Chicken Dinner. All of the Butcher &amp; Bushel recipes have an abundance of meat in the first four ingredients. The regular Organix recipes and other grain-free recipe have more brown rice or starchy vegetables as primary ingredients.</p>
<p>Using the dry basis method, the Organix Chopped Turkey and Chicken dinner has 42% protein and 22% fat, which is an acceptable protein-to-fat ratio per the AAFCO’s guidelines for an adult-maintenance diet.</p>

<p>Our recommendations for best dry dog food are based on the analysis and comparison of 27 products that can be purchased at big-box stores, supermarkets, pet supply stores and online.</p>
<p>We’ve selected <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NatureS-Logic-Canine-Salmon-26-4Lb/dp/B000FAK3RU/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nature’s Logic</a> as the best dry dog food. Nature’s Logic has nine formulas of dry dog food. All the recipes have non-GMO millet in their first five ingredients, so they’re not grain-free. Millet, however, is an excellent source of phosphorus, B vitamins and iron, and it’s a carbohydrate that’s easier for dogs to digest.</p>
<p>There is no corn, soy, wheat, rice, peas or lentils in any of Nature’s Logic’s dry foods. Peas and lentils are often added to dog foods as a grain replacement. Peas, lentils and other legumes are currently being studied by the FDA as possible links to canine heart disease, so we applaud Nature’s Logic excluding them from their recipes.</p>
<p>The Duck &amp; Salmon Meal Feast has three meat meals — duck, turkey and salmon — rather than whole meat, which do not diminish in moisture and weight when processed. So you’re actually getting more meat in Nature’s Logic that you would in other dry dog foods that list meat as the first ingredient</p>

<p>Also added to the ingredients are 19 different dried fruits and vegetables with antioxidant properties and menhaden fish meal, which is high in Omega-3 fat content.</p>
<p>Nature’s Logic has eight other varieties of dry dog food, but the majority have chicken (or other identified animal) fat as the third ingredient and pumpkin seed as the fourth ingredient. We prefer the Duck &amp; Salmon recipe to the others because it has three meat meals. Only the Venison and the Rabbit recipes have more than one meat meal as a primary ingredient.</p>
<p>Using the dry method calculation, Nature&#8217;s Logic duck and salmon recipe has 40% protein and 19% fat, which is an appropriate protein-to-fat ratio by AAFCO standards. The Nature’s Logic label states that its food provides complete and balanced nutrition for all life stages and complies with AAFCO nutritional adequacy standards.</p>

<p>Orijen is a Canadian company that takes great pride in not using meat meals in their foods. Based on our analysis, we would agree with Orijen’s marketing that their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Orijen-Original-Formula-Wild-Caught-NEST-Laid/dp/B07MN2LV1F/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Original Dry Dog Food</a> is indeed biologically appropriate. Not only does Orijen dehydrate their fresh meats, but they’re also up-front about the fact that poultry bones and cartilage are ground up in the mix.</p>
<p>Eighty-five percent of the Orijen &#8211; Original is composed of meat, and the remaining 15% includes vegetables, fruits and herbs. The only additive is a zinc chelate, which helps promote a healthy immune system.</p>
<p>The Orijen &#8211; Original is grain free, and like other grain-free dog foods, a variety of legumes — lentils, pinto beans, green peas, navy beans and chickpeas — are added instead. As we noted earlier, the FDA is currently studying the links between grain-free and legume-heavy diets and canine heart disease.</p>

This superior Canadian-made dog food is one of the few we analyzed that is species appropriate.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Orijen-Original-Formula-Wild-Caught-NEST-Laid/dp/B07MN2LV1F/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Orijen has eight recipes in total, two of which are designed for puppies. Orijen states that all of their foods are 85% whole or dried meats, and we don’t doubt that. For the Original recipe, three and three-quarters pounds of fresh, raw and dehydrated meats, fish and whole eggs are used to make a 4.5-pound bag of food. However, during processing, the actual weight of the raw meats and fish is greatly diminished.</p>
<p>That said, the rest of Orijen’s dehydrated meat and fish ingredients make up for the loss, and it’s why their dog foods are so protein-packed. With its abundance of meat, Orijen &#8211; Original has 43% protein and 20% fat, which is an above-average amount of protein to fat.</p>
<p>Orijen &#8211; Original (and all Orijen dog foods) is formulated to meet the nutritional standards established by the AAFCO for all stages of canine life. It’s an excellent dry dog food, but it’s about one-third more expensive than other high-quality grain-free brands. In our estimation, it’s the best grain-free dry dog food and worth the price.</p>

<p>Canidae has four formulas in their All Life Stages dry dog food, and of the four, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CANIDAE-Life-Stages-Multi-Protein-Formula/dp/B0009XQWDM/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Multi-Protein Formula</a> recipe is the best.  Canidae doesn’t use corn, wheat or soy, but there is a significant amount of brown rice, white rice and rice bran in all of their formulas, usually as the second, third and fourth ingredients.</p>
<p>The Multi-Protein Formula, however, is the exception in this brand and lists chicken meal, turkey meal and lamb meal as its first three ingredients. Ocean fish meal and salmon oil are far down the list but are most likely in the same proportions as the preceding millet, barley, oatmeal and flaxseed.</p>
<p>Protein is calculated at 26%, which is below the average of other dry dog food, and fat is 16%, which is about average.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Whole-Earth-Farms-Recipe-12-7-Ounce/dp/B00LP9DDE0/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Whole Earth Farms &#8211; Grain-Free Adult Recipe</a> is a canned food and has meat in its first five ingredients: chicken, chicken broth, turkey, chicken liver and whitefish. Peas, potatoes, carrots and apples round out this well-balanced dog food. Its dry matter protein is 43% and fat is 27%. This recipe blend has about the same acceptable protein-to-fat ratio as the Castor &amp; Pollux &#8211; Organix Butcher &amp; Bushel.</p>
<p>Whole Earth Farms has three other blends that also have meats and fish as primary ingredients. The company also makes a variety of high-quality meat stews. These, however, have broths as their second and third ingredients and consequently don’t meet all the criteria of what makes the best canned dog food.</p>

<p>Wellness has a large variety of canned dog foods, which they call “paté.” Their CORE blends are packed with meat or fish as primary ingredients.</p>

This recipe is packed with protein (calculated by the dry method basis) at 54%, but its fat is 36%, which is higher than the AAFCO average.</p>

<p>Castor &amp; Pollux has several Ultramix dry dog food formulas, and they all have meat and meat meal as their primary ingredients. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Ultramix-Grain-Recipe-Bites/dp/B0123HC0V4/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Red Meat Recipe</a> is grain-free and has beef, pork meal and lamb meal as its first three ingredients. Some of the beef’s weight is lost in the processing, but this is compensated with the addition of freeze-dried raw beef nuggets.</p>
<p>The Red Meat Recipe is packed with additional meats and fish meal, vegetables and antioxidant fruits. The only ingredient that’s not identified is “natural flavor.” The AAFCO defines natural flavoring as &#8220;materials treated with heat, enzymes and/or acids to form concentrated natural flavors.&#8221; This is such a high quality dog food, we would prefer that Castor &amp; Pollux stated what’s in their natural flavor.</p>
<p>As might be expected, the Red Meat Recipe has lots of protein, 42%, and surprisingly low fat, 17%. Similar to Orijen &#8211; Original, this is an above average protein-to-fat ratio.</p>
<h2 id="others-no-recommend">Other products we do not recommend</h2>
<p>As Dr. Karen Beckers says “a dog needs to thrive not just survive.” The following canned and dry dog foods are popular and have been around for years. They meet the minimum AAFCO standards. Their ingredients are unidentified meat and meat by-products, starch and other fillers or unnecessary additives.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/3-5OZ-SteakEgg-Dog-Food-Cesar/dp/B00QN6NWKA/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cesar Sunrise: Grilled Steak &amp; Eggs Flavor</a>: The primary ingredients in this particular recipe are water, beef by-products, animal (unidentified) liver, meat (unidentified) by-products, beef and chicken by-products. You certainly do not want to feed your dog unidentified meat. The AAFCO is very specific about how meat should be identified on the label.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Purina-Prime-Gravy-Dog-Food/dp/B00AQT8B8I/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alpo Prime Cuts</a>: This popular and cheap canned food’s first listed ingredient is water, which means that it is the heaviest ingredient by weight. The next ingredient is unidentified poultry, which, as defined by the AAFCO, is cleaned meat, skin and bones of any bird considered to be poultry. Unfortunately, the manufacturer is not required to state what type of bird is used.</p>
<p>The third most abundant ingredient is unidentified meat by-products. Packed with wheat gluten, soy flour, modified corn starch (as a thickener) and artificial coloring, we advise you to pass this one by.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pedigree-Choice-Gravy-Adult-Canned/dp/B008572JC2/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pedigree Choice Cuts</a>: Again, the first and heaviest ingredient is water, followed by chicken, meaning meat and bone. But then the third primary ingredient is — like Alpo — unidentified meat by-products. This canned food is also full of unnecessary additives, like sodium nitrate, food coloring and gluten.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Purina-Dog-Chow-Complete-Adult/dp/B0789N3KRH/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Purina Dog Chow</a>: This long-time favorite is representative of what dry dog food should <i>not </i>be. On Amazon, a 52-pound bag is less than $27, which indicates how cheap the ingredients must be. Dog Chow’s number one ingredient is corn. The next four ingredients are unidentified poultry by-product meal, corn gluten meal, beef fat, ground rice and soybean meal. Other highly objectionable ingredients are beef, egg and chicken flavors, unidentified poultry and pork digest (concentrated liquid from boiled-down animal parts) and four artificial colorants.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kibbles-Bits-Original-Chicken-31-Pound/dp/B01KA7W3KM/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kibbles ‘n Bits</a>: This popular dry dog food is another example of a cheaply made product with corn as its main ingredient. Throw in corn syrup, fat and unidentified animal digest, and this low-grade dry dog food is about as nutritious as fast food.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Your dog’s age, breed, health and activity level will factor into which dog food is the best for him/her.  There are many dog foods available, but not all of them might be right for your dog, so you should discuss feeding options with your veterinarian.</p>
<p>Our recommendations are based on analyzing the ingredients and nutritional statements of more than 50 canned and dry dog foods. We compared them to the test protocols and standards established by the AAFCO for determining “complete and balanced nutrition at all life stages.”</p>
<p>For the best canned dog food, we recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Organix-Butcher-Organic-Carrots-Potatoes/dp/B00DQR8TXO/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Castor &amp; Pollux &#8211; Organix Butcher &amp; Bushel</a>. The chopped turkey and chicken dinner is grain free and has three organic meats as its primary ingredients combined with vegetables and antioxidant fruits.</p>
<p>Our choice for best dry dog food is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Organix-Butcher-Organic-Carrots-Potatoes/dp/B00DQR8TXO/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nature’s Logic &#8211; Canine Duck &amp; Salmon Meal Feast</a>.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ver a six-week period we tested the top three upright canister vacuums on the market that are specifically designed for pet hair. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Navigator-Lift-Away-Anti-Allergy-NV352-Lavender/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; NV350</a> outshone the others with its powerful cyclonic suction, HEPA air filtration system and superb maneuverability.

<h2 id="selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We began our research by checking out websites that are devoted to pet care, such as Rover.com, and other websites that reviewed and made recommendations for the best pet hair vacuum. It soon became obvious that almost none state how they tested the vacuums, and most recommend vacuums for general purposes and not those specifically designed for the challenges posed by pet hair and dander.</p>
<p>We decided to focus on vacuums that either had a special pet hair attachment, such as a mechanized roller brush, or vacuums that were specially designed for vacuuming pet hair. Once we had assembled our list, we narrowed it down to the vacuums reviewed by Amazon consumers as the most effective, durable and easy to use.</p>
<h2 id="six-best">Compare the best vacuums for pet hair</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/pet-vac-lineup-b.jpg" alt="lineup of tested pet hair vacuums" width="2000" height="1335" /><br />
[table id=213 /]
<h2 id="who">Who needs a pet hair vacuum?</h2>
<p>Dog and cat owners can probably agree on one thing: their fur baby sheds constantly, and if you allow them on the furniture or in your bed, then you’ve got pet hair everywhere. Pets shed all year round, and many dog breeds have shedding seasons when they lose their top coats and thick undercoats all at once. If you don’t keep up with it, you’ll be suffocating in tumbleweeds of hair.</p>
<p>You could be conscientiously grooming your pet every day, but you’re not just dealing with hair; you’ve got to rid your living space of dander too. For people with allergies, those microscopic flecks of skin will make them miserable if the air is filled with dander. Air purifiers certainly help, but you need a vacuum that can simultaneously suction up pet hair and filter pet dander.</p>
<p>Vacuums, of course, come in many shapes, styles and sizes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upright bagless canister</li>
<li>Upright bagged canister</li>
<li><a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">Stick vacuum</a></li>
<li>Corded handheld</li>
<li>Cordless handheld</li>
<li>Robot vacuum</li>
</ul>
<p>The vacuum that will be most effective on pet hair will depend on the size of your home and whether you have carpet, hardwood floor or both.</p>
<p>Most vacuum manufacturers advertise that their product is best for pet hair, and some simply stamp a paw print icon on their product’s box to target pet owners. We learned from our research, however, that the differences between a regular vacuum and a vacuum for pet hair are actually pretty minimal.</p>
<p>In fact, when we compared handheld pet hair vacuums with the &#8220;regular&#8221; vacuums in <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum/">our handheld vacuums review</a>, we found that they were notably similar. A pet hair handheld vacuum may have an additional feature, such as a motorized beater-brush like our top pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-Cordless-SMARTECH-Scent/dp/B06XHJGH69/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; HHVJ325BMP07</a>, or a rubber comb, but that’s about it.</p>
<p>Manufacturers claim that a bagged canister vacuum is the most powerful for deep cleaning on a regular basis. But if you’re a pet owner who wants to vacuum every day, it doesn’t make sense to lug one of those around to every room and up and down stairs.</p>
<p>An upright bagless canister vacuum is lightweight, has great maneuverability and is easy to clean. It’s really the best and most convenient for vacuuming pet hair up from both carpeting and bare floor.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Cyclone separation technology:</b> You’ve probably read or heard about “cyclonic” vacuums. Dyson is the most famous vacuum that uses cyclone separation. (Check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/dyson-v7-trigger-vacuum/">Dyson review here.</a>) In brief, it’s a method for creating a rotating high-speed air flow, like a mini cyclone, that sucks everything up into the vacuum. The vortex inside the vacuum canister keeps the pet hair elevated and spinning. Dust and dander are then separated from the hair by centrifugal force and are trapped in an air filter.</p>
<p><b>Air filtration:</b> An air filtration system collects dust and dander from pet hair, and in some cases, freshens the air flowing through the vacuum’s exhaust vents. All upright canister vacuums have a filter made of sponge, foam or ridged fabric. The filters are easy to remove and clean by simply running them through water and squeezing them dry.</p>
<p>A HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter — found in many air purifiers — is often a secondary filter in a vacuum cleaner, and it traps virtually all airborne particles. Of the three upright canister vacuums we tested, only our top pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Navigator-Lift-Away-Anti-Allergy-NV352-Lavender/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; NV350</a> had the additional HEPA filter.</p>
<p><b>Beater brush control:</b> The rotating brush — or beater brush — under an upright canister vacuum whisks up embedded dirt and debris from a carpet, which is then sucked into the canister. Beater brushes, however, are not effective on a hardwood floor, since they scatter more hair and dust than they actually brush up. Look for an upright canister vacuum that has a control to turn the beater brush on and off or raises and lowers it.</p>
<p><b>Special pet hair brush attachment:</b> All vacuum cleaners have attachable accessories, such as brushes and extension wands, for vacuuming drapery, upholstery and tight spaces. Upright vacuums for pet hair also have an extension wand, a brush or two and sometimes an upholstery tool, which resembles a lint roller brush.</p>
<p>Two of the upright canister vacuums we tested — the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Navigator-Lift-Away-Anti-Allergy-NV352-Lavender/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; NV350</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dirt-Devil-Steerable-Bagless-UD70355B/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; UD70355B</a> — had a special pet hair brush attachment. It’s about one-third the size of the regular beater brush, so you simply attach it to the extension wand and use it to get in between couch pillows or under your bed. Dirt Devil’s attachment has a rubberized claw, which is excellent for raking up hair from pile carpet.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Test conditions</h3>
<p>Our tester lives in a two-bedroom 1200 square-foot condominium that has approximately 90-percent low-pile carpeted floor. Every two weeks for a six-week period, he tested the vacuum cleaners by allowing hair from his mixed-breed terrier to accumulate.</p>
<p>Each vacuum was tested in a specified area of the condo, each area having both carpeted and marble-tile floors and several pieces of upholstered furniture, where his dog was allowed to sit and nap. If the vacuum was portable, our tester also vacuumed sections of the condo’s fifteen carpeted stairs. All of the handheld pet hair vacuums were tested on the stairs.</p>
<p>Our tester owns a Miele bagged canister vacuum and vacuumed an area as a comparison with the three upright bagless canister vacuums we decided to test. He changed the Miele bag at the beginning of the testing period so its suction power would not be diminished.</p>
<p>For the three handheld pet hair vacuums, he also allowed dog hair to accumulate on his car’s upholstered driver and passenger seats, carpeted floor and rear hatchback area.</p>
<h3>Vacuuming</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/vacuuming1.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Our tester vacuumed each designated area three times with each vacuum over the six-week period. After each vacuuming of the carpets and floors, he checked the beater brush to see whether any hair had been trapped in its bristles. If the vacuum had a special attachment for pet hair, he then vacuumed the upholstered furniture. Finally, using the same attachment, he vacuumed a section of the carpeted staircase.</p>
<h3>Ease of use</h3>
<p>During the testing our tester noted the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Maneuverability:</b> Two of the uprights we tested &#8212; the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Navigator-Lift-Away-Anti-Allergy-NV352-Lavender/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; NV350</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dirt-Devil-Steerable-Bagless-UD70355B/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; UD70355B</a> &#8212; had swiveled steering, which allowed easy access in corners and beneath the furniture and bed.</li>
<li><b>Weight: </b>Upright canister vacuums are designed to be lightweight. We tested how much effort it took to push the vacuum and also carry up the stairs.</li>
<li><b>Motorized attachment: </b>Several vacuums have a motorized brush attachment and we determined whether motorizing the separate beater brush was actually more efficient in picking up pet hair.</li>
<li><b>Length of power cord:</b> A longer power cord allows convenient access to multiple rooms from one electrical outlet.</li>
</ul>

<p>After each vacuuming, our tester documented the amount of hair, dust and debris trapped inside the canister and how easy or difficult it was to remove. Unlike a bagged canister vacuum, which does not need its bag changed after each vacuum, a bagless canister vacuum should have its canister emptied and washed every time.</p>
<p>Theoretically the vacuum’s filters should be changed once a year, but presumably that is advisable only if you wash the filters on a regular basis. Our tester noted how much dust each filter collected and washed it to determine its efficacy the next time he vacuumed.</p>
<p>The handheld vacuums were not as easy to clean. It was a challenge removing everything from the compact canister, and the filters were a dusty mess after each use. The Bissell &#8211; 33A1C’s ridged filter was especially troublesome to clean, since pet hair got trapped between the ridges and needed to be extracted by hand.</p>
<h2 id="upright">Best upright for pet hair</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shark-nv350.jpg" alt="Shark NV350" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>The most critical thing we can say about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Navigator-Lift-Away-Anti-Allergy-NV352-Lavender/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; NV350</a> is that its power cord could be longer. Besides that, this powerful, quiet and nearly perfect upright canister vacuum will make short work not only of pet hair, but also dirt, dust, debris and and anything else you may vacuum.</p>
<p>(The Shark &#8211; NV350 comes in a number of colors, each of which has a different serial number. We tested the lavender Shark &#8211; NV352.)</p>
<p>The Shark &#8211; NV350 is marketed as “liftaway,” which means that the canister can be detached from the main chassis to transform into a portable vacuum. This feature allows you to vacuum anywhere within the power cord’s 25-foot reach and get into tight areas and up and down stairs.</p>
<p>The Shark &#8211; NV350’s cyclone separation technology and completely sealed HEPA filtration system suck up every last bit of hair and dust. The HEPA filter also freshens the exhaust air from the side vents.</p>
<p>The canister is removed by unlatching top and bottom latches, which completely prevent any debris from flying up and out when you empty it into the trash. Before the testing period, our tester vacuumed frequently with a Miele bagged canister vacuum, so he was shocked when he saw how much more embedded hair and dust the Shark &#8211; NV350 vacuumed up.</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shark-detaching.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>If that wasn’t eye-opening enough, our tester vacuumed over the same areas where he tested the Eureka &#8211; NEU180B and the Dirt Devil &#8211; UD70355B, and the Shark sucked up a half-full canister of more hair and dust.</p>
<p>The Shark &#8211; NV350 is lightweight — less than 13 pounds — and has superb maneuverability thanks to its swivel steering and motorized power brush. The power brush can be turned on for carpets and off for bare floors. It took slightly more effort to push the Shark on bare floors, but on carpet, it practically whizzed around the room on its own volition.</p>
<p>The Shark has the usual attachments — crevice tools, a couple of brushes — and also includes a pet upholstery tool, which resembles a lint brush. It’s pretty good at picking up pet hair on furniture, but you need to brush in a downward direction.</p>

<p>Depending on where you purchase the Shark &#8211; NV350, a mini power brush is included (note: the mini power brush is not included with the Shark that is sold by Amazon). It works the same as the large motorized power brush, but it’s about one-third the size, which makes it perfect for stairs and reaching under the bed.</p>
<p>Clean-up is a cinch. The aforementioned liftaway canister makes it easy to empty the vacuumed-up debris into the trash, and it washes clean in seconds. Both foam filters are cleaned by simply rinsing them through with water and squeezing them dry.</p>
<p>Shark offers a five-year limited warranty and a lifetime guarantee for the foam filters and motor belt. The Shark &#8211; NV350 is the most expensive of the three upright canister vacuums we tested, but at $145, it’s still moderately priced for such a high-quality product that outperformed the other vacuums we tested.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight but extremely powerful, the Shark &#8211; NV350 can suction up every last bit of pet hair, dust and debris from both carpeted and non-carpeted floors.</li>
<li>It has excellent maneuverability thanks to its swivel steering and motorized beater brush.</li>
<li>The Shark &#8211; NV350 is one of the few vacuums marketed specifically for cleaning up pet hair that has a sealed filtration system with a HEPA filter.</li>
<li>Its “liftaway” canister turns the vacuum into a portable vacuum for getting into corners, up and down stairs and under furniture.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="handheld">Best handheld for pet hair</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-vac.jpg" alt="Black+Decker - HHVJ325BMP07" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>All three of the handheld vacuums we tested had elements designed specifically for picking up pet hair. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-Cordless-SMARTECH-Scent/dp/B06XHJGH69/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; HHVJ325BMP07</a> did the better job of vacuuming dust and dirt as well, thanks to its Smartech auto-sense feature that automatically changes speed and power levels by sensing whether you’re vacuuming carpet, bare floors or upholstery. The auto-sense’s LED indicator also shows battery life and whether it’s time to change the filter.</p>
<p>The Black+Decker is a cordless handheld and is charged by a lithium ion battery for a minimum of six hours. For all of our tests, the charge lasted approximately 18 minutes, which was nearly double the time that the Shark &#8211; SV780 (the other cordless handheld we tested) lasted.</p>
<p>During the period of its charge, the auto-sense did indeed switch speeds when we moved back and forth from carpeting (higher speed), furniture (middle speed) and floor (lowest speed). The charge did dip a bit to about 15 minutes when we kept the vacuum running at its highest speed.</p>
<p>The Black+Decker has very strong suction that lasted during most of its charge, and even when it began to diminish, it was still able to remove stubborn pet hair that clung to car carpeting.</p>

Its unique sensor automatically shifts power levels from carpets to hardwood floors to upholstery.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-Cordless-SMARTECH-Scent/dp/B06XHJGH69/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The vacuum itself resembles a Dustbuster with an elongated nozzle that can be used for vacuuming tight corners and under cabinets. One of the Black+Decker’s excellent features is its beater-brush attachment that slips on to the nozzle. The brush’s alternating rows of rubber bristles and soft rubber tabs prevent long pet hair from getting wrapped and trapped when you’re vacuuming carpeted areas and upholstery.</p>
<p>We were also impressed by how well the Black+Decker sucked up dust from between couch cushions and pillows, which was revealed when we opened up its canister and examined its dual-filter system.</p>
<p>Everything is sucked into the canister where large debris, such as dog hair or cat litter, is separated. Dirt and dust are forced through the filter cup and trapped in the fabric filter bag that’s locked inside the cup. Once vacuuming is done, the filter cup can be removed and the pet hair in the main container emptied without dust flying everywhere.</p>
<p>Two fabric filters are included with the Black+Decker, one of which is scented and perfumes the exhaust air as you vacuum. The “fresh linen” scent is a bit overpowering, but the second filter bag is unscented. As with all handheld vacuums, they should be cleaned after every use. Cleaning is a simple task since the canister and filters can be quickly rinsed and dried.The Black+Decker &#8211; HHVJ325BMP07 is the most expensive of the three handheld vacuums for pet hair that we tested, but thanks to its brush attachment, we found that it was the only one that “powers through pet hair” as advertised. This is a fantastic all-around handheld vacuum you can use for any small area and upholstery.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Black+Decker &#8211; HHVJ325BMP07 has unique sensing capability that automatically switches power levels from carpet to bare floors to upholstery.</li>
<li>Its lithium-ion battery charges the Black+Decker for a solid 18 minutes, giving you plenty of time to vacuum a number of small areas.</li>
<li>Its power brush is made of alternating rows of rubber teeth and flaps, which prevent long hair from getting wrapped and trapped.</li>
<li>The Black+Decker’s dual filter system effectively sucks up and traps dust and dirt for easy and quick clean-up.</li>

<h3>Dirt Devil &#8211; UD70355B</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dirt-devil-pet-vac.jpg" alt="Dirt Devil - UD70355B" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dirt-Devil-Steerable-Bagless-UD70355B/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; UD70355B</a>, also known as the Razor Pet, is another cyclonic upright canister vacuum and appears to be one of the better made vacuums by this company. Dirt Devil markets the Razor Pet for pet owners by stamping a paw print icon on the box and canister, but it’s otherwise similar to the regular <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dirt-Devil-Steerable-Bagless-UD70350B/dp/B06XDK8Q3B" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil Razor</a>.</p>
<p>The only addition to the Razor Pet is its “turboclaw” attachment. It’s a mini beater brush with nine rubber teeth that presumably are designed to rake up hair from a carpet. However, to work properly, the claw must be held at a 45-degree angle so the beater brush can actually reach the carpet. The vacuum has strong suction, so pet hair is lifted up without the assistance of the useless — but cute — turboclaw.</p>
<p>The Razor Pet did an excellent job of consistently sucking up pet hair into neat whirling balls inside the canister. It has swivel steering like the Shark &#8211; NV350, and you can lower the vacuum head so it’s nearly flat (which lets you get under furniture) but we found the steering to be stiff and not very easy to maneuver. In fact, even though the Razor Pet is lightweight, we needed quite a bit of elbow grease to push the vacuum around.</p>
<p>The cyclonic separation works differently in the Razor Pet than it does in the Shark &#8211; NV350. The vortex keeps the vacuumed hair separated and elevated and dust and dirt is forced upwards through a conical foam-covered filter. A latch on the bottom of the canister releases the hair, but the filter must be removed from the top of the canister by unlatching a needlessly difficult lock.</p>
<p>Once removed, the foam is slipped off the ridged fabric filter, which traps hair between the ridges and must be pulled out by hand. A good amount of dust is trapped in the filter, but since it’s not sealed, like with the Shark &#8211; NV350, the Razor Pet cannot capture pet dander. It’s a good all-around vacuum, but it really isn’t a vacuum for handling the challenges of pet hair.</p>
<h3>Eureka &#8211; NEU180B</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/eureka-neu180b.jpg" alt="Eureka - NEU180B" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eureka-NEU180B-Lightweight-Powerful-Graphite/dp/B07J4R23VJ/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; NEU180B</a> is an upright canister vacuum that’s marketed specifically as a pet hair vacuum, but again, in reality, it’s just a vacuum with a lint brush tool. It’s very lightweight, because it seems to be made almost entirely of plastic. One Amazon reviewer wrote that it looks like a kid’s toy, and we have to agree. Even though it weighs only ten pounds, we found it difficult to push around carpeted floors, and it has no steering capability at all.</p>
<p>It has an extra large canister, but it’s not a cyclonic vacuum, so everything blows up into and swirls around the lower third of the canister. Other than a thin piece of foam in the canister, the Eureka doesn’t have an air filter system, so clearly it’s not been designed for pet dander and dust — plus, the exhaust air does not smell clean.</p>
<p>The beater brush can purportedly be adjusted to five levels with a lever, two of which are mysteriously not labeled, but we turned the lever to each level, and nothing moved. Since the beater brush should not be used on a hardwood floor, this is a major design flaw.</p>
<p>For such a noisy vacuum, it doesn’t seem to have much suction power. The ultimate test result was that we vacuumed the same area with the other two upright vacuums, which picked up double the amount that the Eureka did.</p>
<h3>Shark &#8211; SV780</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shark-sv780.jpg" alt="Shark - SV780" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>This cordless handheld vacuum has cyclonic technology, like its upright vacuum, with a built-in beater brush. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pet-Perfect-Cordless-Technology-Rechargeable-SV780/dp/B0037HHFMO/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; SV780</a> is powered by a rechargeable 18-volt nickel metal hydride battery, which lasts longer than alkaline batteries in high-drain electronics. Be that as it may, each time we charged the Shark &#8211; SV780, full power lasted slightly less than eight-and-a-half minutes.</p>
<p>For the brief time that the Shark &#8211; SV780 is at full power, it’s got powerful suction and grabbed up everything in its path, including pet hair deeply embedded in car carpeting. Its side vents are positioned beneath the rubberized grip handle, so the exhaust blows backwards and doesn’t scatter the debris you’re vacuuming.</p>
<p>It has a sturdy bag filter that captures dust and dander, and it’s very easy to clean. It’s a terrific handheld vacuum that does indeed seem like it was designed for pet hair. However, because of its short charge, it just doesn’t give you enough time to clean up anything other than quick little messes.</p>
<h3>Bissell &#8211; 33A1C</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/bissell-33A1C.jpg" alt="Bissell - 33A1C" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bissell-Eraser-Handheld-Vacuum-Corded/dp/B001EYFQ28/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissell &#8211; 33A1C</a> is one of the most highly rated handheld vacuums on Amazon. The majority of reviewers cite the low price, and at $30, it’s absolutely the least expensive of handheld vacuums for pet hair. We found it to be very effective on our dog’s bed; it grabbed up every last hair. However, its rubber-teethed mouth doesn’t really rake up the hair, and we had to go over the bed several times before all the hair was picked up.</p>
<p>It’s corded, so it has limitations as to where you can vacuum. We found the vacuum especially challenging when trying to clean the car, since you need an outlet nearby that can accommodate its cord.</p>
<p>The vent exhaust is close to the head, so for anything other than hair, the exhaust air blows it around. The Bissell’s tapered mouth allows you to vacuum in tight spaces, but the spaces in the rubbered mouth are so small that it really can’t pick up much besides pet hair.</p>
<p>Finally, cleaning the filter is a pain, especially if you have a pet with long hair. The Pet Hair Eraser has a ridged fabric filter, which traps long pet hair and can only be removed by picking it out with your fingers.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>There’s clearly a lot of competition in marketing a vacuum to pet owners, and at first, it can be daunting to decide which type of vacuum you need and then whether it really can do as advertised. You could certainly spend a month’s rent on a very high-end vacuum, but we focused our research and subsequent testing on reasonably priced upright and handheld vacuums that were designed specifically for vacuuming pet hair.</p>
<p>The best upright bagless canister vacuum for pet hair was unquestionably the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Navigator-Lift-Away-Anti-Allergy-NV352-Lavender/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; NV350</a>. Its swivel steering and motorized beater brush give this lightweight vacuum excellent maneuverability, so you can get under furniture and into tight corners. The Shark &#8211; NV350 has a dual air filtration system with a HEPA filter, which eliminates virtually every speck of dust and dander on your carpets and floors. It also has a canister that can be removed to transform it into a portable vacuum that’s perfect for going up and down stairs.</p>
<p>Our pick for the best handheld vacuum for pet hair is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-Cordless-SMARTECH-Scent/dp/B06XHJGH69/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; HHVJ325BMP07</a>. It’s a cordless handheld and its charge lasts 18 minutes, giving you plenty of time for rapid clean up of small areas. The Black+Decker’s automatic sensor shifts power levels automatically when you move from carpets to bare floors to upholstery. It’s more expensive than other handheld vacuums, but it really does the job that others didn’t in our tests.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to evaluate</h2>
<p>Pet insurance is a mixed breed that straddles human health care and property insurance. As a fairly new industry, it can be a confusing topic. We turned to the North American Pet Health Insurance Association (NAPHIA) for guidance. NAPHIA aims to improve pet insurance standards as well as public awareness. We learned from NAPHIA that there are roughly a dozen pet insurers that cover the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>Our research began by looking at consumer ratings on third-party review sites such as Pet Insurance Review and PetInsuranceQuotes.com (recently acquired by Petco). We read pro tips from veterinarians like Dr. Doug Kenney at PetInsuranceGuides.com and Dr. Frances Wilkerson at Pet Insurance University. In-depth reviews on Wirecutter and Reviews.com further rounded out our study.</p>
<p>We next analyzed the types of insurance plans offered by each company. Every insurer takes a different approach. Most include more than one plan type. We picked through websites page by page, gleaned missing info from FAQs and downloaded sample policies to get into the details.</p>
<p>Boned up on fundamentals, we narrowed down our finalists to only include plans that cover both illness and injury, known in the insurance world as a “comprehensive plan.” To further cull the group, we eliminated all plans that capped the dollar amount the insurer would cover; having an “unlimited” payout ensures your pet will be covered for whatever emergency comes up.</p>
<p>This process eliminated common brands like Petfirst and Embrace Pet Insurance. Lastly, we identified companies backed by the same underwriter (essentially same policy, just different branding) and went forward with the ones that had the more favorable customer reviews.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs-insurance">Who needs pet insurance?</h2>
<p>Pets have moved from sleeping in the barnyard to the backyard to the foot of the bed — or, for some of us animal lovers, with their heads on the pillows. During our research phase, we came upon one subreddit post that summarizes it well: “If you are the kind of pet owner who would spare no expense for your pet’s health, pet insurance is an absolute must.”</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://naphia.org/industry/research-and-reports/state-of-the-industry-report/naphia-state-of-the-industry-report-highlights-download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAPHIA’s 2018 State of the Industry Report</a>, pet insurance in the US doubled in size between 2013-2018, growing from a $500M industry to just over a $1B industry. This rapid growth has outpaced the industry’s ability to educate consumers. As noted among the 100 pet insurance facts compiled by PetInsuranceQuotes.com, the number one reason people buy pet insurance is because they “want to make decisions about their pet&#8217;s health care without worrying about whether or not they can afford treatment.&#8221;</p>
<p>That last point emphasizes the true value of pet insurance: peace of mind. Though some plans pay exam fees, the main benefit of health insurance is to cover high-cost, unexpected illnesses and injuries. A solid policy means you won’t need to worry about draining your savings account or euthanizing your pet because you can’t pay the vet costs, a dreadful situation known as “economic euthanasia.”</p>
<p>There’s a prevailing mindset, advanced by pet insurance companies like Trupanion and Healthy Paws, that you shouldn’t use pet insurance to pay for routine care. In fact, most pet insurers exclude preventive care from their plans. It’s the unforeseen, expensive care you need to guard against, such as the following high-cost claims (this info is taken from Trupanion&#8217;s testimonials page and Healthy Paws&#8217; home page).</p>
<h3>Sample coverage of high-cost claims</h3>
[table id=180 /]
<p>It’s best to enroll your pets while they are young. Most insurers let you enroll as early as eight weeks. Not only does that get you the lowest rates, it also provides the best chance your pet won’t be diagnosed with a pre-existing condition that won’t be covered (more on that below). Most insurers let you begin enrollment around seven to eight weeks old.</p>
<p>Pet insurance is also a wise investment for people who own purebred dogs or cats. By comparison, mixed breeds have more diverse bloodlines that make them hardier. Purebreds, on the other hand, are more susceptible to certain high-risk conditions. Before enrolling your purebred, talk to your vet about which diseases your breed might be predisposed to, then make sure those conditions are covered by your prospective insurer.</p>
<h3>How much should I expect to pay?</h3>
<p>NAPHIA’s 2018 State of the Industry Report indicates dog owners paid an average annual premium of $536 in 2017 for accident-and-illness plans; cat owners averaged $336. That equates to about $45 for a dog’s monthly premium and $28 per month for a cat. The report shows premiums have increased on average at about 6 percent per year 2013-2017.</p>
<p>We spoke with Kristen Lynch, executive director of NAPHIA, and learned one reason premiums increase is due to advances in vet technology. New devices enable veterinarians to perform more sophisticated procedures; these improvements cost money, which is in turn passed on to policyholders in the form of higher premiums. That’s the trade-off for access to better treatment — and when your pet is on the operating table, what pet parent doesn’t want them to have the best care they can get?</p>
<h3>Is pet insurance worth the investment?</h3>
<p>That’s precisely the question Consumer Reports tried to answer in <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/pet-products/is-pet-insurance-worth-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a>. As pointed out in their review, it’s an incredibly tough question to answer because every pet has potential to suffer different conditions. An indoor, mixed-breed cat is less likely to need vet care than an active purebred dog who’s bloodline is subject to hip ailments. Your vet can advise you on how likely your specific breed is to develop a costly chronic condition, but there’s no guarantee that any breed won’t develop cancer. Per that CR article, it’s about “playing the odds”.</p>
<p>And odds are you may never see a return on the monthly premiums you pay out. However, what you’re really investing in is peace of mind from knowing your pet will receive essential vet care should the need arise. That’s really no different than insurance for people: In the United States, we pay enormous premiums for health coverage, but we never actually hope to suffer a stroke or heart attack so that all those monthly payments will zero out.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re one of the unlucky few whose pet requires ongoing care, such as for cancer or diabetes, then your investment will more than pay for itself. That’s how insurance systems work: Many people pay into the system so that those few who actually need treatment will be covered.</p>

<p><b>Types of insurance policies, rates and covered conditions vary widely between insurers.</b> The three common policy types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comprehensive:</b> These plans cover both illness and injury. Since you can’t predict which conditions will affect your pet over their lifetime, this is the safest, most inclusive coverage you can get. Premiums cost more, but you also get a lot more.</li>
<li><b>Injury-only: </b>Sometimes labeled “Accident-only,” these plans only cover physical injury to your pet. Monthly premiums are much less than for comprehensive plans, but so is your coverage. You might consider an injury-only policy if you’re on a tight budget and have an energetic pet who likes to explore hazardous situations.</li>
<li><b>Wellness-only: </b>These plans cover routine exams as well as preventive care such as vaccinations, flea and tick control, deworming and dental.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some insurers offer only of these plan types, and few insurers offer all three. Here’s a snapshot of how each type can vary in price.</p>
<h3>Sample plans and pricing for 3-year-old mixed-breed dog</h3>
[table id=181 /]
<p>Although the lower-cost accident-only and wellness plans may seem appealing, coverage is substantially less. Consumers appear to grasp the value of going the comprehensive route. NAPHIA reports that in 2017 an overwhelming 98 percent of U.S. pet owners chose to purchase comprehensive policies; only two percent opted for accident-only plans. Of the three bulleted policy types above, only comprehensive plans cover both illness and injury/accident, making it the plan type we recommend.</p>
<p>Many insurers offer supplemental wellness care on top of their base comprehensive plans. These add-ons, called <i>riders</i>, tack on coverage for preventive, behavioral or naturopathic treatments. Monthly premiums increase by about $25. In our opinion, it’s better to forego these riders. You’ll need to pay for routine care, but the money you save in reduced premiums (about $300/year) should easily cover annual vet exams and routine care.</p>
<h3>What pet insurance covers</h3>
<p><i>Benefits</i> are the specific types of vet care for which you are insured and will be reimbursed. Comprehensive insurance policies help pay for the vast majority of ailments and injuries, and may extend to certain types of preventive care such as vaccinations. It all depends on what’s listed in your policy. To gain that essential peace of mind, a good insurance policy covers at least the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chronic conditions such as cancer and diabetes</li>
<li>Hereditary and congenital conditions</li>
<li>Surgeries and hospitalization</li>
<li>MRI or CT scans, X-rays, ultrasounds and lab tests</li>
<li>Vet-prescribed medications</li>
</ul>
<p>Most insurers only cover dogs and cats. The one exception is Nationwide’s Avian &amp; Exotic Pet Plan, which covers animals such as birds, rabbits, turtles and snakes. Yes, they even cover iguanas and potbellied pigs.</p>
<p>With any policy, the common stipulation is that your pet must receive care from a licensed veterinarian. However, unlike health insurance for people, most plans let you choose your preferred vet.</p>
<h3>What it doesn’t cover</h3>
<p>Let’s start with the big one. No pet insurance company covers “pre-existing conditions.” If your vet records list a previous illness or injury, or if your vet discovers an issue during an enrollment exam, the insurer will not cover that condition should it recur. This is especially relevant to older pets that are more likely to have experienced an issue in the past.</p>
<p>When you analyze a sample policy, you’ll find it’s more about what’s listed as “not covered” than covered. Common exclusions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preventive care</li>
<li>Spaying or neutering, pregnancy and birthing</li>
<li>Microchipping (your local Humane Society can do this for about $15)</li>
<li>Special foods, dietary supplements or vitamins</li>
<li>Behavioral training or therapy</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether for pet or person or auto, insurance can be a highly confusing topic. So we’re going to go slow and break down each concept. The clearest way to explain pet insurance is to walk through the typical process step-by-step.</p>
<p><b>Step 1: Compare quotes and sample policies to choose an insurer</b><strong>.</strong><br />
The <i>quote</i> is the estimated cost you will need to pay each month. Additionally, most insurers let you download a <i>sample policy</i> that details your contractual relationship. Use this research to select an insurance company, referred to as your <i>insurer</i>.</p>
<p><b>Step 2: Enroll your pet.</b><br />
Assuming your pet meets age requirements, submit all required paperwork — and be sure to thoroughly review your official policy. Your insurer will obtain medical records (if they exist) from your preferred veterinarian, referred to as your <i>provider</i>. Some companies also require a vet exam to enroll.</p>
<p><b>Step 3: Pay your monthly premium.</b><br />
The <i>premium</i> is the dollar amount you owe your insurer each month. Most companies let you set up automatic payment from your bank.</p>
<p><b>Step 4: Pay your next vet bill.</b><br />
At your next vet appointment, you need to cover all vet fees out of your own pocket (such as by debit or credit card). This is the case whether or not your insurer covers the specific type of vet care received. For covered treatments, you will be reimbursed later.</p>
<p><b>Step 5: Meet your deductible.</b><br />
The <i>deductible</i> is the dollar-amount threshold you must pay before your insurer begins paying any vet fees. It only applies to covered conditions. Once you meet your deductible, the insurer covers the majority of all costs for the rest of that year. This remains in effect until start of following year when the deductible resets to zero and you must again reach the threshold before coverage kicks in.</p>
<p><b>Step 6: Pay your co-pay percentage.</b><br />
After you meet your deductible, you are still responsible for a <i>co-pay</i> portion of the total vet bill. This ranges from 10-30 percent. Your insurer covers the remaining cost, referred to as the <i>reimbursement percentage</i> (usually 70-90 percent). You must submit your co-pay for each covered condition for the rest of the given year.</p>
<p><b>Step 7: Submit a claim to your insurer.</b><br />
Send a copy of your vet receipt to the pet insurance company. Many insurers have mobile apps that let you upload a photo of the receipt. Most also allow you to send by email, regular mail or even by fax.</p>
<p><b>Step 8: Receive reimbursement.</b><br />
The insurer reviews and processes your claim. Once approved, your insurer issues reimbursement (by check or direct deposit) to cover your out-of-pocket expenses. Depending on the company, claims processing can range from a few to over 30 days.</p>
<p>A key takeaway from above is that pet insurance operates as a reimbursement system. Unlike people’s health insurance, the system works similar to auto insurance, another form of property/casualty insurance. At the time of your vet appointment, you pay the full vet bill from your own bank account or credit card, then the insurer pays you back (less the co-pay, of course). If you find yourself facing a very expensive vet bill, don’t despair — try looking into one of these financial aid resources posted by the <a href="http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/resources/tips/trouble_affording_veterinary_care.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Humane Society</a>.</p>
<h3>Getting your first quote</h3>
<p>All of our finalists’ websites offer online quote calculators that are simple, fast and intuitive to use. This is an invaluable tool for comparing quotes between insurers. Each site requires you to enter an email address. We worried about being deluged with endless pesky emails, but it honestly wasn’t that bad, and you can unsubscribe at any time.</p>
<p><b>First, enter your pet’s information.</b> These factors will set the baseline cost. If you want to insure more than one pet, you’ll have that option later.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Pet type:</b> Select dog or cat. Dog premiums cost one-third to twice as much as cats.</li>
<li><b>Gender:</b> Select male or female. When we ran our quotes, we did not see any cost difference for male versus female.</li>
<li><b>Age:</b> Your insurer will use the birth date listed on pet’s medical records. If you don’t have any records, most insurers will use your vet’s best estimate.</li>
<li><b>Breed:</b> Each site has a lengthy drop-down list of purebreds. You can also select “mixed breed,” in which case you might be prompted to specify your pet’s size.</li>
<li><b>Zip code:</b> Your pet must reside with you at this address.</li>
<li><b>Email:</b> You need to enter this info to advance to the quote screen.</li>

Next, adjust variables to estimate your monthly premium. This is the crux of the matter — determining how much you will need to pay per month. While options vary by insurer (as is the case with all things in the insurance world), there are three main variables. Most insurers let you customize these settings.</p>
<p><b>(1) Annual limit:</b> This is maximum amount your insurer will pay out each year. It typically starts at $5K and maxes out at $15k or $20K. Or you can go the “Unlimited” route and rest assured you’ll be covered for anything that comes up.</p>
<ul>
<li>A higher annual limit increases your monthly premium, but you’ll be covered for expensive treatments (especially if you go Unlimited).</li>
<li>A lower annual limit reduces your premium, but you’ll be on the hook for any vet fees that exceed your limit.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>(2) Annual deductible:</b> This is the amount you must pay before coverage from your insurer kicks in. It typically ranges from $100 to $500, though some go up to $1,000.</p>
<ul>
<li>A lower annual deductible increases your monthly premium, but if your pet needs treatment you&#8217;ll pay less to reach your deductible, at which point your insurer begins covering vet costs.</li>
<li>A higher annual deductible reduces your monthly premium, but you’ll pay more out-of-pocket vet fees each year to reach your threshold.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>(3) Reimbursement percent:</b> Think of this as your co-pay. For example, if you choose 80-percent reimbursement, you will be responsible for 20 percent of the vet fee. The common options are 70, 80 or 90 percent.</p>
<ul>
<li>A higher reimbursement percent increases your monthly premium, but you&#8217;ll pay less in out-of-pocket co-pay fees.</li>
<li>A lower reimbursement reduces your monthly premium, but your out-of-pocket co-pay fees will cost you more.</li>

We encourage you to visit a few sites and give each one a try. It’s remarkably easy to adjust sliders and buttons to find a premium you can afford; watch your monthly premium go up or down as you toggle different options. But there’s more to consider than just the numbers, which we’ll get into next.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Plan eligibility and variables</h3>
[table id=182 /]
<p>Comparing quotes is important, but here are the other critical factors that should shape your decision.</p>
<p><b>Pet’s age: </b>The sooner you start, the lower your premiums (start at age one if possible). If you first enroll your pet when they are age seven to eight, when dogs and cats start to enter their geriatric years, you may find the monthly premiums beyond what you can afford. Many insurers will not enroll pets after they turn 14-years-old.</p>
<p><b>Monthly premium: </b>Take a hard look at your monthly budget and figure how much you can afford to pay. This is really a matter of personal income. Be aware that your monthly premium will likely increase a bit each year. This is due to (1) rising costs of vet care, and (2) some companies raise premiums as pets grow older and more susceptible to illness.</p>
<p><b>Policy document:</b> The official policy specifies the legal terms and conditions of your contract. Fortunately, most insurers avoid too much legalese and instead use language that’s easy to understand. Be sure to dissect every paragraph. If there’s anything you don’t understand, don’t hesitate to contact customer support.</p>
<p><b>“Exclusions” and “limitations”: </b>These two policy sections require very close scrutiny.. Exclusions are conditions that aren’t covered at all. Limitations impose restrictions. Since the primary value of pet insurance is to cover high-cost treatments, be sure you are fully covered for these big-ticket issues.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Chronic conditions: </b>This type of care is ongoing from year to year, including cancer and diabetes. That means costs can really add up. Never accept restrictions on chronic disorders.</li>
<li><b>Hereditary conditions: </b>These genetic disorders are passed down bloodlines. This coverage is most important for purebreds. Hip dysplasia, epilepsy and intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) are common examples.</li>
<li><b>Congenital conditions: </b>These are issues that your pet developed in utero (i.e., pre-birth). Examples include heart disease, nervous system issues, cataracts and liver disease.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Maximum payout:</b> This is a type of limitation you need watch out for. We strongly recommend you avoid plans that include any of the following payment cutoffs.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Lifetime limit:</b> This is the maximum amount the insurer will pay out over the lifetime of your pet. Once you hit the dollar amount threshold, the insurer stops reimbursing costs and your policy will be terminated.</li>
<li><b>Per Incident limit:</b> This is the max amount your insurer will pay out for a specific illness or injury. Once you reach the limit, they will no longer issue reimbursement for that specific condition, though you will still be covered for other issues. We eliminated AKC’s “Companion Plus” plan due to this provision (a rep told us they may soon be getting rid of this limit).</li>
<li><b>Benefits schedule:</b> This is a line-item list of covered conditions along with the max amount the insurer will pay for each one. These price limits are supposed to be based on typical medical costs, but there’s no way to guarantee how much your vet will actually charge. Avoid this claims structure. For example, Nationwide’s “Whole Pet with Wellness” is a good comprehensive plan, but their “Major Medical” plan uses a benefits schedule that we recommend you steer clear of.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Waiting period</h3>
[table id=183 /]
<p><b>Wait periods: </b>Think of this as a probation period. The clock begins ticking down starting from the day of your enrollment. If your pet acquires an illness or injury during this time, it will be considered pre-existing and that specific condition will not be covered. There are two types of wait periods, and each varies per insurer: illness (1-30 days) and injury/accident (1-15 days). Many insurers impose longer wait periods for hip and knee conditions. Look for the terms “hip dysplasia” and “cruciate ligament” or “patella” in your policy. These special wait periods can extend from six up to 12 months.</p>
<p><b>Location: </b>Urban areas cost more than rural areas, which reflects the cost of vet care in different regions. Also, plans vary by state because insurers need to have their policies legally approved by each state’s regulatory boards. When you review a sample policy, make sure it applies to the state where you live.</p>
<p><b>Discounts: </b>Most every insurer offers some form of discount. A multipet discount for two or more animals is most common and usually set at 5 percent. Some offer a savings if you pay your premium annually rather than monthly. Others apply a discount if your pet is spayed/neutered or if you have military status.</p>
<p><b>Claims process: </b>Once you pay your vet bill, you want to receive reimbursement quickly and painlessly. Most insurers offer a mobile app that lets you upload a photo of your vet bill. Under 10 days is a good timeframe for reimbursement, but some insurers take up to 30 days. To help speed things up, take advantage of direct deposit, now offered by many companies.</p>
<p><b>Customer Support:</b> During our research phase, we found all our finalists’ support staff to be friendly and knowledgeable. Wait times were short. Some insurer websites even feature live chat to field quick questions. Once you narrow down your insurers, it’s worth taking the time to read consumer reviews on <a href="https://www.petinsurancereview.com/insurers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pet Insurance Review</a> to hear what others are saying.</p>
<h3>Can I change insurers?</h3>
<p>You are free to switch to another company — but it’s not recommended. First, any issues recorded in your pet’s medical records will be deemed “pre-existing conditions” by your new insurer and therefore will not be covered. Second, you will essentially be starting new; if your pet is older (especially if beyond age 7), expect your monthly premium to increase significantly. A waiting period also applies anew.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-evaluated">How we evaluated</h2>
<h3>Consumer review scores</h3>
[table id=184 /]
<p>Since it’s not realistic to acquire pet insurance from each company and then test for many years, we looked at consumer reviews on five popular websites: Pet Insurance Review, Trustpilot, ConsumersAdvocate.org, Canine Journal and PetInsuranceQuotes.com. In addition to the scores, we scanned to learn what people find most important.</p>
<p>As we combed through customer reviews, the number one complaint was being denied coverage by claim departments. Many gripes seem legit, but it also appears a lot of people don’t understand their policy. It’s critical to know your annual limit, how preventive care applies and which treatments aren’t covered due to any specific exclusions or limitations.</p>
<p>Healthy Paws consistently received the highest customer reviews across all four sites. Trupanion is also highly reviewed on two of the four sites. Coming in with fewer positive reviews, Figo has some catching up to do, but that’s likely because they’re a fairly new company and still building up a customer base.</p>
<h3>Quote comparisons</h3>
<p>To compare apples to apples, we first established our baseline criteria. We used male pets for simplicity (same rate for both genders), set size at medium (for dogs only), located ourselves in San Diego and acquired quotes for four different age groups based on subdividing from the age-13 upper limit. We set our three important variables as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Annual limit: </b>As discussed above, an “unlimited” payout is the only way to ensure you’re covered for those break-the-bank situations.</li>
<li><b>Deductible: </b>We reasoned that our main goal is to be covered for those rare high-cost conditions. So we chose to go with $500 to keep our monthly premiums lower (some deviations noted below).</li>
<li><b>Reimbursement percentage: </b>We saw only a small cost bump ($5-$10/month) to go from 80 to 90 percent. We went with 90 percent to minimize our co-pay.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the charts below, it’s important to point out that these costs are for newly enrolled pets — so if you enroll your pet at age one when your rate will be lowest, expect annual premiums to creep up due to inflation and rising vet costs, but you shouldn’t pay anywhere near the rates for a nine- or 13-year-old dog as shown in these charts. Still, we think these age/rate comparisons are a good reflection of each insurer’s overall pricing.</p>
<p>We should further point out that Nationwide’s &#8211; Whole Pet with Wellness plan has a set $100 deductible (that’s the only option). Also, Healthy Paws uses fixed rates for pet age eight and older. You’ll see these noted throughout the charts below.</p>
<h3>Table A: $500 deductible for mixed-breed dog (medium size) in San Diego</h3>
[table id=185 /]
<p>Mixed-breed dogs and cats are less prone to genetic ailments, which translates to lower premiums. The mixed-breed category serves as our benchmark for comparing others.</p>
<p>Right away, you can see how much less expensive rates are if you enroll your pet when it’s young. Again, rates increase over time, but if you enroll your dog at age one, your premium shouldn’t jump up to the cost shown for a five-year-old in the above chart.</p>
<p>Pets Best &#8211; BestBenefit Plus Plan and Healthy Paws offer the lowest rates. On the high end, Figo leads off with priciest rates but is surpassed by Petplan as dogs enroll at more senior ages. ASPCA &#8211; Complete Coverage is the midrange low and Trupanion is the midrange high.</p>
<p>To get a fuller perspective, we also ran quotes for a $250 deductible with all other criteria set the same. See chart below.</p>
<h3>Table B: $250 deductible for mixed-breed dog (medium size) in San Diego</h3>
[table id=192 /]
<p>Again, you need to pay vet costs out of pocket until you meet your deductible, at which point the insurer covers all costs except your co-pay. You’ll reach the threshold faster with a lower deductible, but monthly premiums are higher. Comparing rates for a $250 versus $500 deductible, costs range $10-$15 higher at age one; after that, they escalate considerably. We think a $500 deductible is more affordable for the average consumer.</p>
<h3>Table C: $500 deductible for mixed-breed cat in San Diego</h3>
[table id=193 /]
<p>Compared to dogs, pet insurance for cats is much less expensive. Premiums range from two-thirds the cost to lower than half as much. As with mixed-breed dogs, <a href="http://pets-best-pet-insurance.evyy.net/c/1341923/185910/2424" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pets Best</a> and <a href="http://www.healthypawspetinsurance.com/?affid=RH05745" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Healthy Paws</a> come in on the low end. Petplan, Trupanion and Figo make up the high end.</p>
<h3>Table D: $500 deductible for purebred American bulldog in San Diego</h3>
[table id=194 /]
<p>Purebred dogs and cats are <a href="https://naphia.org/news/breeds-with-the-best-pet-insurance-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more predisposed to hereditary disorders</a>, and that’s reflected in each company’s higher rates. We selected five popular breeds known to have health issues: Cocker Spaniel, German Shepherd, American Bulldog, Rottweiler and Basset Hound. Our bulldog quote fell midrange, so that’s the one we’ve shared here.</p>
<p>For our five purebred categories, ASPCA just barely edged out Pets Best for lowest monthly premiums. Petplan and Figo were both substantially more for all five breeds, and in some cases were over three times as much as the lowest rates.</p>
<h3>Table E: $500 deductible for purebred British shorthair in San Diego</h3>
[table id=195 /]
<p>We ran quotes for five feline purebreds: Persian, Maine Coon, British Shorthair (shown here), Abyssinian and Manx. Pets Best delivered notably lower rates across the board. Healthy Paws and ASPCA jockeyed for second place. Similar to purebred dogs, Petplan and Figo were significantly more expensive.</p>
<h3>Table F: $1,000 deductible for mixed-breed Dog (medium) in San Diego</h3>
[table id=196 /]
<p>Termed “catastrophic” coverage by some insurers, this approach sets your deductible at the upper limit. The idea is to greatly reduce your monthly premiums, but still have unlimited coverage for major illnesses or injuries. If you’re on a tight budget, you may find this an affordable option.</p>
<p>Of our finalists, only Trupanion, Pets Best and Petplan let you set a $1,000 deductible. Pets Best again offers lowest monthly rates. Trupanion follows not far behind. Petplan starts at twice the cost of Pets Best and only goes up from there.<b></b></p>
<h3>Table G: Comprehensive+wellness, $500 deductible for mixed-breed dog</h3>
[table id=197 /]
<p>If you’re the type of pet owner who really wants to optimize their pet’s well-being by sticking to annual exams and pushing preventive care, consider a wellness add-on. But be advised that tacking on a wellness rider will bump up your rates by roughly $25 per month. Over the course of year, that adds up to around $300; by contrast, a vet exam plus routine vaccines should cost under $100 (at time of this publication, it’s about $90 in San Diego). That’s why many pet owners elect to go with basic comprehensive coverage and pay for annual vet visits out of pocket.</p>
<p>Only Pets Best, Nationwide and ASPCA offer a comprehensive/wellness combo. Riding toward the middle of the pack thus far, Nationwide’s &#8211; Whole Pet with Wellness surges to the front in this category. This is the only plan they offer that has an unlimited annual payout, and it happens to come packaged with a full suite of wellness care. Take a look at their <a href="https://www.petinsurance.com/enroll/Files/Whole_Pet_with_wellness.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">covered care summary</a>. Considering it comes with a low $100 deductible that applies to other non-wellness treatments, this combo plan delivers incredible value.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.healthypawspetinsurance.com/?affid=RH05745" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Healthy Paws</a> uses one simple plan structure. Their single policy type is set at unlimited annual payout, so there’s no dollar cap to confuse new customers. All you need to do is pick your annual deductible ($100, $250 or $500) and co-pay (70, 80 or 90 percent). While they don’t offer a multipet discount, you can get reduced rates if you are a member of AAA, AARP or Costco.</p>
<p>When we spoke with Healthy Paws co-founder and CEO Rob Jackson, he emphasized the company’s goal is to provide a comprehensive plan that’s easy for consumers to understand. Rob shared their motto is “One plan. Four paws. All covered.” That straightforward approach is reflected in their policy, which uses plain language and isn’t bogged down with jargon and legalese.</p>
<p>In terms of cost, Healthy Paws offers some of the lowest monthly premiums on the market. As with most plans, the sooner you enroll, the lower your rate will be. Pets must be at least eight weeks old to enroll. Be aware that Healthy Paws does not cover hip dysplasia for pets that begin coverage after they turn six years old.</p>

Four paws. All covered.” They offer a comprehensive plan that’s easy for new customers to understand. Their low rates, hassle-free claims process and near-perfect customer feedback make Healthy Paws our top dog.</p><a href="http://www.healthypawspetinsurance.com/?affid=RH05745" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Healthy Paws</button></a></div></div>
<p>Like our other finalists, Healthy Paws covers all major illnesses and injuries; hereditary and congenital conditions; chronic conditions like cancer; plus diagnostic treatment, surgery and hospitalization. They also pay for prescription medications and cover “alternative care” for acupuncture, chiropractic and hydrotherapy at no extra cost, where some insurers require a wellness add-on.</p>
<p>To keep rates low, Healthy Paws doesn’t cover preventive care, which applies to vaccinations, flea control, heartworm medication, deworming, nail trimming, dental cleaning, spaying or neutering. Nor do they cover exam fees, even for covered conditions; that’s unfortunate, but tolerable if it keeps premiums affordable.</p>
<p>Healthy Paws earned the highest customer scores on all five review sites that we researched. We really can’t undervalue the hefty number of glowingly positive customer reviews. With over 4,200 reviews on <a href="https://www.petinsurancereview.com/insurers/healthy-paws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pet Insurance Review</a>, a 9.8 score is fairly astounding. Customers praise the staff’s communication, hassle-free claims process and speedy payment.</p>
<p>There are a few specific limitations you should be aware of. First, newly enrolled pets must have a one-time pet exam, which helps identify any pre-existing conditions. Second, Healthy Paws applies a lengthy 12-month wait period for hip dysplasia, a common ailment for dog breeds such as Labrador retrievers. This type of hip disease can be common in dogs under age one, so talk to your vet about the risks before enrolling.</p>
<p>Healthy Paws also limits plan options for older pets. If you enroll your pet after their eighth birthday, you still get unlimited coverage, but you’re forced to go with a $750 annual deductible and your co-pay is set at 40 percent. That can be a big cost hit if your vet bill climbs into five digits. Still, if you compare other insurers’ rates for newly enrolling older pets, Healthy Paws’ premiums are the only ones most people can afford.</p>
<p>According to the Healthy Paws home page, they process 99 percent of claims in just two days. You can easily submit a claim by uploading a photo of your vet bill through their mobile app. Reimbursement typically takes three to 10 days. Their support department let us know they once paid out $60,000 to cover a single claim.</p>
<p>Aside from the wait period hurdles you need to navigate, the Healthy Paws plan is all positives. It’s not hard to see why they score so high in both consumer and professional reviews.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Healthy Paws&#8217; single plan option is straightforward and policy language is easy to understand.</li>
<li>Premiums are lower than most other insurers, especially if you enroll while your pet is young.</li>
<li>Healthy Paws has the highest customer scores on all major pet insurance review websites, reporting stellar service and quick claim payments.</li>
<li>For new enrollees, there is a lengthy 12-month wait period for hip dysplasia.</li>
<li>Pets that enroll at age 8 or older must use a fixed plan with only 60 percent reimbursement (40-percent co-pay).</li>

<p>In our quote research, the <a href="http://pets-best-pet-insurance.evyy.net/c/1341923/185910/2424" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pets Best &#8211; BestBenefit Plus Plan</a> repeatedly delivered the lowest monthly premiums of all seven contenders. A good plan is not all about price, but it’s certainly an important factor. With all the different categories we ran quotes for, we put our finalists to the test and were surprised by Pets Best’s consistently low rates.</p>
<p>Pets Best was founded by Dr. Jack Stephens, who back in 1981 helped launch the first pet insurance company in North America. As a practicing veterinarian, Dr. Stephens recognized how tragic it is for pet parents to have to put their animals down simply because they couldn’t afford treatment. As a result, the Pets Best mission is to end economic euthanasia. That helps explain why their rates are so affordable.</p>
<p>Regarding plan structure, Pets Best offers three different plans, but they are very similar. The mid-tier “Plus” plan adds coverage for exam fees associated with an eligible illness or injury (not included with their basic “Essential” plan). And the top-tier “Elite” plan further adds on rehab for special care like acupuncture or chiropractic. We went with the “Plus” plan for solid coverage at reasonable rates.</p>

Plans are highly customizable, and this mid-tier plan also reimburses for exam fees associated with a covered condition, a bonus not offered by all insurers.</p><a href="http://pets-best-pet-insurance.evyy.net/c/1341923/185910/2424" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Pets Best</button></a></div></div>
<p>Pets Best offers lots of flexibility to set your annual deductible and reimbursement percentage — just be sure to select the “Unlimited” annual limit. Though we prefer to pay for annual exams out of pocket, Pets Best does offer two different wellness add-ons, priced around $15-$25, that cover annual exams and preventive care. As an additional option, they provide a 5-percent multipet discount if you have more than one pet.</p>
<p>Wait periods are reasonable at 14 days for illness coverage and just three days for injury. The exception is cruciate ligament conditions, which have an extended six-month waiting period that cannot be waived by exam.</p>
<p>Pets Best touts that they process most claims in just three to five days. They also offer direct deposit, plus a “Vet Direct Pay” option. Once you submit paperwork for payment directly to your vet, that provider will remain on file for the next time you need to pay vet fees.</p>
<p>With all the (good features/positives), we might have considered Pets Best for our top pick were it not for some mixed customer reviews. Comments on Pet Insurance Review and Trustpilot are largely on the positive side. But Pets Best didn’t score nearly the same rave reviews as Healthy Paws, which led us to rank them a runner-up, still a very solid showing.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Pets Best &#8211; BestBenefit Plus Plan consistently yielded the lowest monthly premiums when we ran our quote comparisons.</li>

<p>Among our finalists, <a href="https://www.petinsurance.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nationwide’s &#8211; Whole Pet with Wellness</a> plan is unique in that it combines comprehensive with wellness care. It’s also Nationwide’s only plan that uses an unlimited payout. The extra benefit means you’re not going to get the lowest rates, but you do get a lot of bang for your buck.</p>
<p>Be sure not to confuse this “Whole Pet” plan with Nationwide’s “Major Medical” — that plan uses a benefits schedule that limits payouts based on line-item pricing (think of it as a menu for each type of treatment). Also, be aware their “Pet Wellness” plan only covers routine exams and preventive care, and not the injuries and illnesses covered by a comprehensive plan.</p>
<p>Once you clear those two hurdles, there is very little that’s confusing about the Whole Pet with Wellness plan. And that simplicity is one of its merits. Rather than choose between deductible and co-pay options, the Whole Pet plan is fixed at an unlimited annual payout, a $100 deductible and a 10-percent co-pay. For a fixed plan, those are very favorable settings.</p>
<p>To hammer that point home, not only do you get to use a low $100 deductible for any illness or injury, you also get a highly inclusive wellness package — routine exams, vaccinations, flea and tick control, dental cleaning, behavioral care, dietary supplements — if you can think of it, it’s probably on <a href="https://www.petinsurance.com/enroll/Files/Whole_Pet_with_wellness.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the list</a>.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.petinsurance.com" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/nationwide-cta-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/nationwide-cta-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/nationwide-cta-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/nationwide-cta-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/nationwide-cta-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/nationwide-cta-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/nationwide-cta-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/nationwide-cta-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/nationwide-cta.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Value Combo: Nationwide – Whole Pet with Wellness</h3><p>Using an approach that bucks the norm, Nationwide pairs their only “unlimited” annual cap plan with wellness care. Whole Pet with Wellness covers the full range of vet fees. And the best part: You get all these benefits at a low $100 deductible.</p><a href="https://www.petinsurance.com" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Nationwide</button></a></div></div>
<p>Considering overall value, Whole Pet monthly premiums are very reasonable. Compared to our other plans at a $500 deductible (and without wellness), Whole Pet falls right in the middle. At a $250 deductible, Whole Pet is as low or less than the competition.</p>
<p>In terms of restrictions, dogs must be at least age 1 and under age 10 to enroll (no such restriction on cats). The wait period is 14 days for both illness and injury. Unlike some other insurers, there are no special wait periods for hip or knee conditions.</p>
<p>Consumer comments on Pet Insurance Review are for the most part complimentary. You need to look closely because the major complaints we saw were all regarding Nationwide’s Major Medical; we agree, that’s not a good option. Other, minor comments suggest that their claim processing should be faster.</p>
<p>As a company, Nationwide has been in business since 1925. Their pet insurance division was originally Veterinary Pet Insurance (VPI) — who, by the way, issued the very first pet policy to Lassie — founded in 1982 and acquired by Nationwide in 2014. With such established history, you can depend on Nationwide to be around for the long run.</p>
<p>When we started this review, we didn’t set out to consider wellness care. Yet, we sure came to appreciate this plan’s value. Nationwide’s Whole Pet with Wellness was another strong contender for our top pick. But we think pet insurance should be affordable by as many pet parents as possible, and that means going with a lower-priced plan that doesn’t attach the extra cost of wellness coverage.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Nationwide &#8211; Whole Pet with Wellness covers the entire range of vet services by combining comprehensive illness and injury with extensive wellness care.</li>
<li>This is the least confusing plan available because all variables are fixed — favorably so: $100 deductible, 10-percent co-pay and unlimited annual payout.</li>
<li>Unlike many other insurers, there are no special wait periods.</li>
<li>As a highly respected company with over 90 years in business, you can count on Nationwide being there for the long run.</li>
<li>This all-encompassing plan can’t compete against the low rates of plans that forego wellness, yet it still delivers incredible value at a reasonable price.</li>

<p>Honestly, our research suggests that all of our seven finalists provide great coverage that we would not hesitate to recommend. Put another way, each of these pet insurance companies can provide that essential “peace of mind” from knowing your favorite companion will receive whatever emergency vet care is required, regardless of expense. It really comes down to the fine details and the fact that some insurers’ rates are higher than others.</p>
<h3>Trupanion</h3>
<p><a href="http://trupanion.sjv.io/c/1341923/503468/8654" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Trupanion</a> led the way in offering a streamlined plan that helps prevent customers getting overwhelmed. Their one policy comes with unlimited annual payout and 10-percent co-pay. You just need to choose your deductible, which can be set at one-dollar increments from $0-$1,000.</p>
<p>Trupanion is the only company that uses a “per incident” deductible: For each condition your pet develops, you pay vet fees up to your deductible; once you meet the threshold, that condition is covered for the life of your pet, though you’re still responsible for the co-pay. The risk is that you may have to pay multiple deductibles if you have an unlucky or accident-prone pet who requires more than one vet visit.</p>

<p>Another unique feature is Trupanion’s “Vet Direct Pay” system. Trupanion pioneered the way for paying vets directly. This minimizes your out out-of-pocket expenses. Most other companies now also offer direct pay, but they make you do the legwork to process a “veterinarian release form.” Trupanion runs a dedicated software system connected to vet offices. Vets need to opt into the system, but once they do Trupanion can issue payment within minutes of your checkout.</p>
<p>According to Trupanion’s website, they settle 65 percent of claims on same day received, and 80 percent within seven days. Another plus is that they don’t require any special extended wait periods. In reviewing Trupanion’s policy doc, we noted your pet needs to receive required vaccinations or they won’t be covered for those specific conditions.</p>
<p>Trupanion’s reviews are nearly as high as Healthy Paws on Pet Insurance Review and slightly less favorable on Trustpilot. Founded in 2000, Trupanion has built a strong reputation. With all their innovative features, we were inclined to push them into the winner’s circle. But when we compared quotes, Trupanion frequently came in third most expensive. If rates were lower, they’d surely be a contender.</p>
<h3>ASPCA &#8211; Complete Coverage</h3>
<p>Formerly the Hartville Pet Insurance Group, this Crum &amp; Forster company formed a strategic partnership in 2006 with the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA). Similar to Pets Best, their plan is highly customizable. The <a href="https://www.aspcapetinsurance.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ASPCA &#8211; Complete Coverage</a> plan also offers very reasonable rates, coming in third place just behind Pets Best and Healthy Paws.</p>
<p>ASPCA is one of our few finalists to pay for vet exams that are part of diagnosing a covered condition. Wait periods are short and there are no special extensions for hip or knee conditions. They also cover vet-prescribed medications and foods needed to treat an ailment.</p>
<p>Other insurers offer a multipet discount at 5 percent (if they offer it at all), but ASPCA provides customers a 10-percent discount for enrolling more than one pet. That’s a nice perk if you’re wrangling a small herd of beagles.</p>
<p>ASPCA has a good ranking on Pet Insurance Review and an even better score on Trustpilot where it’s second only to our top pick, Healhy Paws. We honestly have nothing bad to report about ASPCA. The only reason they’re not one of our top picks is that they didn’t stand out in certain categories like others.</p>
<h3>Figo</h3>
<p>Started in 2015, Figo is a newcomer to the scene. They offer three comprehensive plans, but only the <a href="https://figopetinsurance.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Figo &#8211; Ultimate</b></a> plan offers unlimited annual payout. Unlike other companies, Figo’s deductible options vary by age: $100-$750 for pets eight weeks to five years; $250-$1,000 for pets aged six to nine years; and $500-$1,500 for pets 10 years and older.</p>
<p>Figo imposes short wait periods of five days for accidents/injuries and 14 days for illnesses. The exception is cruciate and patella (knee) injuries, which have a six-month wait period; however, that requirement can be waived if a vet examines your pet within the first 30 days and confirms no pre-existing condition.</p>
<p>On the downside, Figo yielded the second highest premiums for most of our quote categories. Only Petplan came in higher. Figo also offers an add-on to cover exam fees — but this only applies to covered illnesses and injuries, and not to routine exams or preventive care. We think there are better options out there.</p>
<h3>Petplan</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.pntrs.com/t/TUJGRUxKR0JGTUpHR0xCRkhLR05K" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Petplan</a> offers a high degree of customization. However, when we ran our quotes, we found Petplan consistently had the highest monthly premiums. Some rates were two-to-three times as much as lower-cost competitors, especially for older pets.</p>
<p>Another drawback, Petplan is our only finalist to require an annual vet checkup and dental exam (plus any specific periodic treatment “suggested” by vet to prevent illness or injury). Failure to have an annual checkup means that any new conditions discovered at next vet exam will be used as a basis for pre-existing conditions, for which you will not be covered.</p>
<p>Petplan has decent customer reviews and over 40 years in business, but the above issues led us to steer clear of picking them as a winner.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Pet insurance is one of those rare, pricey things in life that you hope you never need to use. No one wants their pet to get sick or hurt, but it sure is comforting to know you’ll be covered if it happens.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.healthypawspetinsurance.com/?affid=RH05745" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Healthy Paws</a> gives pet parents peace of mind. Customers applaud their excellent customer service and smooth claims process, which has earned them the highest consumer review scores on both Pet Insurance Review and Trustpilot, Unlike our other finalists, we couldn’t find a single complaint about being denied coverage for a claim.</p>
<p>In terms of rates, Healthy Paws offers some of the lowest monthly premiums available. Just be sure to enroll early, as limitations start to apply after your pet turns six-years-old. We also appreciate their simple plan structure that’s easy to understand and doesn’t overwhelm with numerous decisions to be made.</p>
<p>If lowest rates are your top priority, run a quote for <a href="http://pets-best-pet-insurance.evyy.net/c/1341923/185910/2424" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pets Best &#8211; BestBenefit Plus Plan</a>. You’ll be challenged to find a better monthly premium. Not only does their plan allow a high degree of personalization, but they are our only finalist who that offers both high-deductible plans and wellness add-ons.</p>
<p>If you’re willing to spend a bit more to get more, you can reap the benefits with <a href="https://www.petinsurance.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nationwide’s Whole Pet with Wellness</a>. This plan covers about every vet service you can think of, including all routine exams and all sorts of preventive care. And if you’re looking to insure a feathered friend, <a href="https://www.petinsurance.com/birds" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nationwide’s Avian &amp; Exotic Pet Plan</a> is the only policy that covers pets other than dogs and cats.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter 10 weeks of research and extensive in-home testing with our top five products, we found the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MA2T9BC/?tag=ybdlttr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Pet Zone &#8211; Smart Scoop</a> to be the best automatic litter box. In addition to being automatic, it’s brilliant at the basics: you can use regular litter, it has a familiar open litter box shape and is not disruptive with its quiet cleaning. Our test cats, Kit Kat and Jelly Bean, preferred its familiar, open design and we appreciated its low maintenance and efficient cleaning. Coming in as our runner-up, the highly regarded<a href="http://share.litter-robot.com/lS7vb" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Litter-Robot III &#8211; Open Air</a> litter box offers impressive design, but at a higher cost.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>The promise of having to scoop even one less clump of litter is enticing to any cat owner. However, these products can feel like an expensive gamble as they can be ten times more expensive than a manual litter box and have less-than-stellar reviews.</p>
<p>Our research brought us to many articles that only ranked the automatic litter boxes by their advertised features and consumer reviews. Unfortunately, we didn’t come across articles with any real in-home testing, so we took this opportunity to do our own discovery.</p>
<p>We also combed through the /r/Pets subreddit, where it seemed like many cat owners resorted to their own hacks for manual litter box clean-up since automatic litter boxes can be tricky. Finally, we read through hundreds of Amazon reviews on various automatic litter boxes to help us identify what users look for in the perfect automatic litter box.</p>
<p>With our hours of research and personal experience in caring for two cats, we honed in on the most important features for a good automatic litter box:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost</li>
<li>Effectiveness in cleaning</li>
<li>Impact on cat’s usage</li>
<li>Setup and programmable features</li>
<li>Environmental presence</li>
<li>Odor control</li>
<li>Frequency of maintenance</li>
</ul>

<p>With over three million Google search results for “how often do I have to clean my cat’s litter?” you can easily surmise it’s an unpleasant chore that is often delayed. While it may stink that you need to clean it, it’s never good for your cat to have a filthy, full litter box. This could lead to a number of issues, ranging from negative association with the litter box (causing accidents around the house) to more serious health issues like urinary tract diseases. An automatic litter box can easily aid in maintaining a clean and approachable bathroom area for your cat by taking care of the cleaning process and removing waste from the litter for you.</p>
<p>The health benefits for your cat mostly depend on a litter box that’s clean, so let’s face it, this is just as much about what <b><i>you</i></b> need. A self-cleaning litter box is valuable to any cat owner wanting to add convenience to their daily routine unless you have one of those magical felines who will participate in toilet-training. The automatic box can make an even bigger difference if you have multiple cats. If you’re tired of scooping out your cat’s litter box daily, then an automatic litter box is probably something you’ve considered more than once already.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Cost:</b> The price tag for an automatic litter box can range from a minimum of $100 to $450. This doesn’t include the cost of litter and the accessories the box may require. Also, a good rule of thumb for the number of litter boxes in your house is one per cat, plus an additional one.</p>
<p><b>Effectiveness in cleaning:</b> The whole purpose of buying a self-cleaning/automatic litter box is in its name. You want a product that fulfills its claims. It’s important to consider what type of mechanism the litter box uses to clean the waste. Does it rake? Does it scoop? Does it sift? We found that sifting did much better than raking, with scoops performing somewhere in between.</p>
<p><b>Impact on cat’s usage:</b> Transitioning any cat to change can be a difficult undertaking. You have to be careful in not disrupting your cat’s habitat too much, regardless of how convenient it is to your lifestyle. If the design is very different than what your cat is used to, consider keeping their regular litter box around to ease the transition (and your ability to return the new box to the manufacturer if the cat won’t touch it.)</p>
<p><b>Setup and programmable features:</b> Nobody likes reading through long pages of manuals to set up a new product. It’s also important to note what features are available with your litter box. Can it be programmed to clean at certain times? Is there an indicator for how many times your cat has used it?</p>
<p><b>Environmental presence:</b> Your cat’s bathroom area shouldn’t be a statement piece in your home. It should be able to coexist with your living space and not be so loud that it frequently annoys you.</p>
<p><strong>Frequency of maintenance and odor control:</strong> Again, automatic litter boxes should turn the litter box maintenance from a daily process to a weekly one, keeping your cat’s litter area tidy enough between maintenance sessions and controlling the smell that comes from a filthy litter box.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>When you’re trying to choose the right product, online searches can lead you down a rabbit hole of reviews and lead to reservations about spending so much on a design you’re not confident in. While the existing reviews we found only rank litter boxes by comparing features, we did the real dirty work for you.</p>
<h3>Comfort for your cats and for you</h3>

<p>If you’ve ever turned a printer on around a cat, you know firsthand how intrigued and surprised a cat can be about an inanimate object moving. <strong>Now imagine how they feel when their litter box comes to life.</strong></p>
<p>It was a careful and calculated process transitioning Kit Kat and Jelly Bean to test out the efficacy of these litter boxes. As cats are creatures of habits, it is recommended that you keep their existing litter boxes next to or near their new ones to help ease the transition. This is a bit of an issue for the CatGenie, which had to be placed next to a toilet. Then, slowly phase their old litter boxes out once they get adjusted to the new one.</p>
<p>With this in mind, and our five self-cleaning litter boxes ready, we set up their new automatic litter boxes in their existing bathroom area. We kept their old litter box nearby, too. With the litter boxes that used regular litter, we stuck with our tried and true, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003LPSIO6/?tag=ybdlttr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fresh Step &#8211; Ultra Unscented.</a> With the litter boxes that required specialized litter, we used their respective branded products.</p>
<p>We observed how they reacted to the cleaning mechanisms in action and whether that scared them away from using some boxes. We also noted how easy (or difficult) it was for the cats to get in and out of the boxes.</p>
<p>Of course, despite our planning and adhering to litter box transition guidelines, cats aren’t robots: we had two accidents. We know that this was not an easy adjustment for them, either, so we added an <i>additional </i>manual litter box nearby to help them transition. Overall, it’s important when changing anything with your pet’s surroundings to be attentive, and react when you see that they need help.</p>
<p>The litter box room-presence was another important aspect of <i>human</i> comfort we considered. Our cats use the litter box quite often, so it was imperative that the automatic litter box wasn’t loud, as it would be running often. We also noted how each litter box looked in our living space.</p>
<h3>Automatic cleaning mechanism</h3>
<p>We never knew there was so much to learn about litter boxes. However, after testing out five litter boxes with particular cleaning mechanisms, we discovered the pros and cons of each method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scoops did a good job cleaning waste but sometimes left crumbs around the litter box.</li>
<li>Rakes did not leave a mess but were sometimes loud and would often get waste stuck on the teeth, requiring additional maintenance.</li>
<li>The toilet system cleaned very thoroughly but was hot and loud</li>
<li>The sifting system also cleaned well but the turning dome could be intimidating to cats.</li>
</ul>
<p>We rated the effectiveness of each cleaning mechanism by comparing to our usual method of manually cleaning with a scooper by hand.</p>
<p>It was important that the automatic litter boxes sifted through the litter, removed the waste completely and reset the litter so it was smoothed out. We also observed how each mechanism disposed of the waste and whether it controlled the odor. Odor control really depended on how well the litter type covered the smell and how each receptacle kept smells in.</p>
<h3>Setup and additional features</h3>
<p>We determined if the setup was easy or difficult by timing how long each litter box took to set up, whether it required additional tools, and if it required a specific location. Manuals that were simple and easy to follow also made a difference in setup time.</p>
<p>The setup also revealed whether there were additional things to program and what the buttons on the litter box did. It was significant for us that the litter box could sense the cat’s presence, which they all were able to do. All of the litter boxes included a safeguard to stop the litter box from running if a cat is detected in the box. Additional features were a bonus and not necessary in the effectiveness of cleaning and convenience of use.</p>

<h3>Maintenance and cost of ownership</h3>
<p>We noted how frequently we had to monitor the litter box for any clogs or clumps that were stuck. It was imperative the cleaning mechanism worked effectively as this influenced the maintenance of the litter box. We also observed the size of the waste receptacle and how often we had to replace or clean it out.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the litter boxes required additional accessories or specialized brand litter, adding extra costs for the usage of the litter box.</strong> It also was relevant how much the litter box itself costs, as they vary greatly in price. So when you take into consideration wanting multiple automatic litter boxes, it can add up even more quickly.</p>

<p>This was a clear win. Even though the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MA2T9BC/?tag=ybdlttr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Pet Zone &#8211; SmartScoop</b></a> did not have the flashy features of other models, it simply worked well. It can be difficult to determine what the best automatic litter box is when they all tout special features like the best cleaning mechanism or appealing design. However, the most important aspects were not whether you could flush your cat’s waste through a toilet or a counter that tracks the frequency of your cat’s litter box usage to help monitor their health: the simple and thorough cleaning mechanism wins.</p>

This no-frills automatic litter box is easy to adapt to and cleans up consistently. Our cats preferred its open, familiar design and we appreciated its low maintenance.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MA2T9BC/?tag=ybdlttr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Pet Zone provided convenience with its ease of handling and simple, functional features. It can sense when a cat enters the litter box and stays for a period of time. It cleans up after the cat leaves, preventing any odor from lingering too long.</p>
<p>There’s enough room for even the twenty-pound Kit Kat, with a considerable litter area and without the closed space that might cause problems for bigger cats. It was not obtrusive in our room; it looks like a regular litter box and is low to the ground. The noise level is minimal, with a low whirring sound as it runs through its cleaning cycle.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is designed to be simple and easy for both cats and humans to use. It is a straightforward, open top litter box. Unlike some competitors, it provides a recognizable rectangular shape and allows for the regular litter your cats are accustomed to using.</p>
<p>The uncovered design allows for an easy entrance for any sized cat. All together, Pet Zone provided a familiar bathroom environment, so both our cats adjusted to using it quickly. It raked and scooped fairly quickly, so the noise didn’t last too long either. This was important since it never bothered or intimidated the cats from using it.</p>

<p>Pet Zone’s raking and scooping deflector has a pretty thorough method of cleaning. The dual system uses regular litter and ensures the clumps of litter gets raked clean to one side, which then gathers it all so it can be swept up in a scooping motion and deposited into the waste drawer. Although some clumps got stuck, it didn’t happen frequently, and only with larger blocks of waste. It came with a tool designed for the very purpose of removing clumps, so it was a painless task to just tap the scooper to unblock it.</p>
<p>There are no bells and whistles with the Pet Zone. It has a simple AC adaptor that you plug into an outlet, and an on/off switch. It doesn’t need to programmed since the cleaning timer was already excellent. We never had issues with either cat being in contact with the rake. The Pet Zone only needs to be plugged in, no extra setup requirements. It did its job well and thoroughly and cut back on a lot of manual cleaning.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Pet Zone &#8211; Smart Scoop’s open top and large rectangular shape allows for any size cat to use and adapt to it quickly</li>
<li>It allows you to use regular litter so it’s familiar for your cats</li>
<li>Pet Zone’s cleaning system ensures it is thoroughly cleaned. The waste gets deposited into a receptacle with good odor control</li>
<li>It ran quietly and quickly and did not bother the cats</li>

<p>High-end and high-tech aren’t words we would use to describe the typical litter box. However, those two qualities are found in our runner up, the <a href="http://share.litter-robot.com/lS7vb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Litter-Robot III</a>. From the smooth round design and sturdy build to the impressive rotating dome sifter, this is a remarkable litter box. It even lights up inside and emits a blue glow when it’s dark.</p>
<p>Litter-Robot’s patented rotating and sifting system was one of the most thorough cleaning mechanisms we observed. <strong>It uses regular litter and does the most effective job in completely cleaning clumps of waste, as this method leaves no litter unturned (litter-ally).</strong> The detached globe slowly rotates to sift the clumps through to a waste drawer, then rotates back to settle the litter.</p>
<p>The Litter-Robot includes more settings than many of the other litter boxes, which is helpful for pet owners who want more customization. You can adjust its timer to decide how long after a cat uses the litter box to activate cleaning mode. This box comes with a programmable sleep mode as well.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://share.litter-robot.com/lS7vb" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/litter-robot-III-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/litter-robot-III-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/litter-robot-III-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/litter-robot-III-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/litter-robot-III-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/litter-robot-III-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/litter-robot-III-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/litter-robot-III-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/litter-robot-III.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Runner-up: Litter-Robot III</h3><p>The highly-regarded Litter-Robot III - Open Air litter box is also an impressive feat of design and mechanics. It enables you to use regular litter, and it boasts one of the more advanced cleaning methods with its unique rotating sifting system.</p><a href="http://share.litter-robot.com/lS7vb" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Litter-Robot.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The setup and waste removal were the easiest among its competitors. Like our top pick, it only needs to be plugged into an outlet to work. When it came time to remove the collected waste, you simply pulled out the waste tray underneath and dumped it out. Additionally, the waste tray is large, which cuts back on the frequency of maintaining its cleanliness to every two weeks. When it ran through its clean cycle, the noise was never an issue. That being said, it was a bit slower than the other models we tested.</p>
<p>A few areas in which the Litter-Robot fell short were its entrance and imposing size. While the design is remarkable, almost like a mini rocket ship, it doesn’t blend discreetly into your home decor and takes up a lot of space. The entry to the litter box was also a hindrance to our larger and older cat, Kit Kat, and made it difficult for him to use.</p>
<p>While Kit Kat never quite got accustomed to using the steeper vertical entrance, Jelly Bean eventually became less daunted by the entryway and used it quite frequently. However, she is a smaller and more active cat. So keep in mind, it would be less convenient for older cats. Litter-Robot does sell a separate <a href="https://www.litter-robot.com/accessories/lr3-ramp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ramp</a> that you can place in front of the entrance to help out older cats.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Litter-Robot is a premium product with a premium price — more than double the cost of our top pick. It is not a cost-effective solution, especially if you want more than one automatic litter box in your home. We also would need to purchase a ramp to make the entry more accessible, which adds another $50 to the cost. That being said, if you’re able to foot the bill and can make room for it in your home, the Litter-Robot is an exceptional automatic litter box that lives up to expectations.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Litter-Robot’s impressive patented rotating and sifting cleaning system did the most thorough job of cleaning the litter</li>
<li>It also allows you to use the clay litter your cat is used to</li>
<li>The Litter-Robot has a remarkably easy setup, waste removal, and maintenance</li>
<li>Its large size might be too imposing for some homes, and its entryway is difficult for older/less active cats</li>
<li>Its price tag is highest among automatic litter box competitors</li>

<p>The PetSafe was unique in that it used specialized crystal litter. Instead of clumping, the litter absorbs urine. Unfortunately, it doesn’t do nearly as well at covering the smell of feces. Moreover, bits would often get stuck on the rake. This was one of the quietest among its competitors, but that’s because the motor that pushed the rake was not as powerful.</p>
<p>It also comes with a hood that can help with its odor issues but may make the opening too small for larger cats to enter.</p>
<p><strong>That being said, the PetSafe was one of the easiest boxes to clean.</strong> With its disposable litter trays, all you had to do was lift the plastic top off, remove the cardboard litter tray, throw it out and install a new one. Some nice-to-have features that add to the litter box’s value are a health counter (which tracks how many times your cat uses the box) and an adjustable timer.</p>

<p>The LitterMaid was a pretty standard self-cleaning litter box. It uses normal clumping litter and a rake to push clumps into the waste receptacle. Carbon filters included with each of the waste receptacles kept odor under control. Clean up was as easy as throwing away the waste receptacle and replacing it with a new one.</p>
<p>The carpeted ramp was nice since it made it easier for cats to get in the litter box and also helped prevent litter from tracking outside of it. It also has an optional sleep timer to deactivate it at night.</p>
<p>However, a big issue was that feces would get stuck fairly often on the rake, although there was a scooper included that made it easy to remove. <strong>Since the track for the rake is on the inside of the litter box, sometimes litter (or even worse, feces) would get on the track.</strong> When that happened, the rake would grind very loudly as it ran, like someone sharpening a pencil. This means extra maintenance was required, which detracted from how convenient using this litter box was otherwise.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://share.litter-robot.com/lS7vb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CatGenie</a> was the most unique and complex litter box. It uses biodegradable plastic granules instead of regular litter and is connected to your toilet/water line. The system rotates the granules into the scooper and emulsifies the solid waste by adding water to it. It then flushes the granules with water in its “SaniSolution,” and finally blows warm air to heat and dry the granules. The benefit of it being connected to your toilet/water line is that there is no manual disposal of waste required.</p>
<p>The cleaning cycle is very loud. Since it blows warm air during the drying cycle, it heats the area around it as well. <strong>The 30-minute cleaning cycle is quite long and also sounds like an open dishwasher running through a wash cycle.</strong></p>
<p>In addition, the plastic granules are unfamiliar to a cat used to clumping litter.  With all these factors in play, it was one of the most intimidating litter boxes for our cats to use. Due to the way it cleans, we were unable to add clumping litter to at least give it a recognizable scent. Jelly Bean used it to pee once and Kit Kat would not go near it at all.</p>
<p>The lack of familiar design, loud cleaning cycle and foreign litter can be a deterrent for an easy litter box transition. It also took up a substantial amount of space and its required hook-up to a water line made for an inconvenient setup and location.</p>

<p>If you have a shredder at home, you can easily make your own cat litter with three ingredients: newspaper and paper scraps, baking soda and water. Simply use your shredder to shred any scrap paper from around the house such as old newspapers, junk mail or documents you plan to recycle. Place the shredded paper in a deep bucket, and pour water over it letting it soak for around 5 minutes. Then, grab the shredded paper by hand and squeeze out all of the water, but avoid doing it over the sink as it could clog your drains. Once you make sure the shredded paper is as dry as possible, mix in baking soda — we prefer to use 1 cup of baking soda per 5 cups of wet paper shreds. Place the mixture in a single layer at the bottom of a container, allowing to to dry, in the sun if possible.</p>
<p>When it comes time to use your homemade cat litter, add more baking soda to the bottom of your litter box prior to using the mixture each time you replace it to keep your litter box smelling fresh.</p>
<h3>Chicken Feed Cat Litter</h3>

<p>Did you know that chicken feed is a common alternative to store-bought cat litter?</p>
<p>It’s much less expensive and is a great alternative to cat litter due to its texture. It’s recommended to use a chicken feed that doesn’t have any antibiotics or medication in it to ensure your cat’s safety. Note that chicken feed can attract bugs, so make sure you are storing it in an airtight container and change our the litter box regularly.</p>
<p>If the smell becomes too potent, add baking soda to the mixture to help cover up the scent.</p>
<h3>Cedar Shavings</h3>

<p>Although only one ingredient, we couldn’t go without mentioning the use of cedar shavings as cat litter. Not only is the material budget-friendly, but it’s known for covering up odor with a natural wood scent. There are brands that market cedar cat litter, but you can also purchase cedar chips from a local hardware store to save some money. It’s also worth noting that cedar is known to repel insects, but it’s still recommended to change it out regularly.</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s difficult to avoid the smell of cat litter even if you change it out regularly. Although this deodorizer can’t be used as cat litter itself, it’s a great way to add a refreshing scent to your cat litter. Simply add baking soda to a jar or bag, then drop a couple drops of essential oils to it — our favorite scent to use is lavender. Shake up the mixture and let it sit overnight. Then, sprinkle it over your cat litter whenever you need a refresher.</p>
<p>Cats can be picky when it comes to their cat litter — something we found with our own kitties, Jelly Bean and Kit Kat. If you’re planning to transition your adult cats to a new cat litter, make sure you do so slowly. You may want to consider mixing their accustomed cat litter with your homemade version to make the transition comfortable and familiar to them. Remember that you may need to try a few formulas before you find one that sticks.</p>
<p>Once your homemade cat litter is ready, print out one of our cat litter labels and adhere it to the container!</p>

<p>Unlike many of the other products we test at Your Best Digs, there was very little information available online regarding folding wagons. In addition, there are very few established brands that we could use as a reference point.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we dug deep into the Amazon reviews of the most popular folding wagons and read through blog posts and articles that mentioned specific folding wagons as standout options for consumers.</p>
<p>From there, we narrowed our list of products to those that could comfortably carry enough cargo for a day at the beach or for a group of tailgaters.</p>
<p>This left us with a list of five finalists. We ordered the finalists and tested them extensively over the course of one month.</p>
<h2 id="the-five-best">Compare the best folding wagons</h2>
[table id=15 /]
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested the wagons</h2>
<p>We used each of the outdoor utility wagons in a series of everyday situations. These included walking to and from our downtown office to the car, as well as carrying cargo at the beach, along gravel and dirt roads, and up and down hills.</p>
<p>In addition to real-world testing, we looked at several different features and metrics to compare each of the finalists against one another.</p>
<p>Folding wagons are used to carry anything from tailgating gear (some will fit your favorite <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">cooler</a>!), to <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-pet-insurance/">pets</a>, and sometimes even your little ones. This means that one of the most important aspects of any wagon is the quality of materials used and sturdy construction.</p>
<p>For each of the five finalists, we looked at how sturdy they were, how easily the material stretched and ripped, and whether there were any early signs of wear and tear that could indicate problems down the line.</p>
<p>We also looked at the general stability of each wagon, including how easy or difficult it was to expand and collapse.</p>

    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/folding-motion.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The size and type of wheels used by each folding wagon were considered as well. Our top pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KQH575E/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty</a>, has oversized wheels that made movement over tough terrain significantly easier.</p>
<p>Next, we measured how much weight each wagon could comfortably hold. While each of the wagons had a recommended “maximum weight”, we were more interested in practical weight limits, not “technical maximums”.</p>
<p>Put another way, we wanted to know how much weight each wagon could reliably carry without tipping or otherwise becoming cumbersome to use. We also measured the volume inside each wagon (length x width x height).</p>
<p>We also tested each wagon to see how easy or difficult it was to tip over. We tested this by turning the wheels at a 90-degree angle and pulling sharply. This process was repeated with the wagons empty, with 20 pounds of cargo, and at each of their maximum weights.</p>
<h2 id="uses">Uses for folding wagons</h2>

<p>If you ever had (or saw) one of the red Radio Flyer wagons as a child, you understand how useful (and fun!) having a wagon can be. Folding wagons incorporate many of the benefits of a wagon like the Radio Flyer while also being lighter, more portable, and capable of reliably carrying more cargo.</p>
<p>If you enjoy tailgating, or simply need a way to transport supplies to and from the beach, lake, etc, a folding wagon can simplify the process significantly.</p>
<p>Wagons are great for running errands as well. Whether you’re bringing groceries into the house or starting a gardening project in your backyard, a folding wagon can help get everything from the car to wherever it needs to be.</p>
<p>A reliable wagon can help ensure that all of your food, drinks and anything else you need get from point A to point B gets there safely, and without anyone needing to carry everything in your arms.</p>
<p>If you have tired children (or pets) that need a break from walking, putting them in a folding wagon is a fun way to bring them along for the ride – just make sure to pay attention to weight maximums.</p>
<h2>Folding wagons vs strollers</h2>
<p>In 2019 we compared the best double strollers with wagons. There are a few advantages wagons have over strollers.</p>
<p>For one, wagons fold flatter, so they&#8217;re easier to store and transport in your car. Folding and unfolding is also easier than on most strollers.</p>
<p>Another perk is room: a collapsible wagon for kids is basically a small playpen on wheels. You can even get oversized four-seat wagons like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMD77BS/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Wonder Fold XXL</a> that carry more kids than any stroller we&#8217;ve seen. Even strollers with lay-flat seats or bassinet attachments don&#8217;t have as much extra room as a wagon.</p>
<p>The sacrifices you&#8217;ll make moving from a stroller to a wagon are fairly serious, though. For one thing, sitting in a wagon with your legs stretched out isn&#8217;t very comfortable, so most kids will prefer riding around for hours in a sit-up stroller seat.</p>
<p>Car seat adapters are also tricky: yes, you can pull a carseat around loose in a wagon, but it&#8217;s not secure. Think very carefully about how you intend to use a wagon with a small infant in it. The best infant carseats like the group we reviewed are all designed to be safe when secured to a stroller, and manufacturers will issue recalls if they find out about ways infants might be in danger. With a wagon, you&#8217;re on your own to make sure that a car seat doesn&#8217;t roll around.</p>
<p>Wagons are also far less maneuverable than strollers. You can still get them most places if you&#8217;re careful, but it&#8217;s like trading a minivan for an 18-wheeler. Since the beginning of 2019, a Walt Disney World and Disneyland wagon ban explicitly prohibits bringing a wagon into the parks to prevent traffic jams; most double strollers are still within the new size limits. Other parks and malls still allow wagons, but it&#8217;s not hard to see how hundreds of them in the same footpath have caused problems.</p>
<p>On the whole, if you have multiple kids but don&#8217;t need a double stroller every day, a wagon is a cost-effective and versatile way to let your older child take a break on your longer mall trips. It&#8217;ll also help you carry your shopping.</p>
<h2 id="think-about">Important features to consider</h2>

<p>The first thing you’ll want to think about is what the wagon will be used for. If you frequently go to the beach, you’ll want to make sure that the wagon you choose can handle sandy (or other rough) terrain. If, on the other hand, you are using the wagon in tight hallways or other areas where there isn’t much room to maneuver, it will be useful to have a wagon with a smaller turn radius, which is where the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KQH575E/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty Wagon</a> is without question the leader.</p>
<p>It’s also worth considering how much cargo space you’ll need. If you’re just transporting some groceries, a smaller wagon is probably enough. If, on the other hand, you plan on transporting a child (or pet), or if you need to carry a lot of cargo, a larger wagon makes more sense.</p>
<p>The terrain your wagon will traverse is important to think about as well. If your wagon will be rolling over sidewalks and driveways for the most part, smaller and thinner wheels &#8212; like the wheels on the smaller <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BUUUIGK/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac Sports &#8211; Utility Wagon</a> &#8212; can be easier and more efficient.</p>
<p>If you plan on going over gravel, sand or anything else difficult to traverse, a more rugged wheel will get the job done, while still being easy enough to use on flatter terrain as well.</p>
<p>Finally, consider the amount of easy storage space you have available for your wagon. One of the most significant advantages of using a folding wagon is that it takes up less space when it is not in use. Folding wagons also fit more easily into smaller vehicles, so getting them to and from wherever you plan to use this is more practical than a “fixed” wagon.</p>
<p>If you have limited storage space (e.g. you live in an apartment), a folding wagon that folds significantly smaller than its unfolded size is particularly useful as well.</p>
<h2 id="the-best">Best overall: Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty Collapsible</h2>

<p>After using all of the wagons extensively over a one-month period, we determined that the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KQH575E/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty Collapsible Wagon</a> was the best among our finalists for use on mud and sand. If you&#8217;re moving it over tougher terrain or carrying bigger loads it&#8217;ll meet your demands without complaints.</p>
<p>While all five of our finalists worked fairly well in our more general tests, The Mac Sports wagon also stood out as an overall winner because it combined durability and weight capacity with a tight turn radius and general ease of use.</p>
<p>Before we even started testing the wagons, the Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty stood out as a premium product. Both the metal frame and the fabric are sturdy and capable of handling more than 100 pounds of cargo. In our month of heavy testing, we saw no signs of wear and tear, which indicates that the wagon should last for years without any issues.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3979 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03.jpg" alt="mac sports heavy duty" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>While there was plenty to like about the Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty, one thing that quickly stood out from the rest of the field was dramatically-better steering, courtesy of the large wheels and sharp turn radius this wagon is capable of.</p>
<p>The more we tested the five finalists, the more we came to appreciate just how much better the steering is on the Mac Sports wagon. While it might seem like having four wheels in each corner would be more efficient, our testing found that having the two front wheels close to each other and, most importantly, directly connected to the steering handle, worked significantly better than the alternatives.</p>
<p>The width of the wheels was noteworthy as well. The wheels are significantly wider than they were on the other wagons, which made them far more capable of traversing sandy beaches and other rough and uneven terrains.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s even more important if you&#8217;re carrying anything heavy. Even if you&#8217;re only weighed down with a couple of big kids, wide wheels won&#8217;t sink as quickly in sand or mud.</p>
<p>The thing we liked most about the wheels, however, was the sharp turn radius they offered. Unlike the other four collapsible wagons we tested, the handle of the Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty wagon is directly attached to the wheels themselves, giving the user direct control over the direction without needing to pull the wagon itself.</p>

<p>Finally, the oversized plastic wheels were also easier to clean than the other finalists. While rubber might seem like a more durable choice, the sturdy plastic used by the Mac Sports wagon showed essentially zero damage during our testing, and was also significantly easier to clean – a major plus for those who’d rather not track mud and dirt through their home.</p>
<h3>Handle</h3>
<p>The telescopic handle, while featured to some extent on all of our finalists, was best executed on the Mac Sports wagon. The telescoping handle was flexible enough for both a 5-foot-2-inch individual and a six-foot individual, and the handle itself is easy to pull, turn, and maneuver.</p>

This is definitely the Best beach wagon of the bunch.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KQH575E/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>In addition, the handle fits into a “dock” when not in use so that you don’t have to pick it up from the ground, or snap it into place every time (as was the case with other finalists).</p>
<h3>Design and ergonomics</h3>
<p>One of the added benefits of having two of the wheels front and center came when folding the wagon for storage and transportation. The wheels are able to line up with the outer wheels, reducing the folded footprint and making it easier to pull the wagon even when folded.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3980 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded.jpg" alt="mac sports folded" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The volume, or capacity, of the Mac Sports wagon cart was solid as well – however all of our finalists were able to carry considerable cargo, so if this is the <em>only</em> factor you&#8217;re considering, the less expensive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BUUUIGK/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac Sports &#8211; Utility Wagon</a> might be a better option.</p>
<p>Finally, the two mesh cup holders make the Mac Sports wagon just a bit more useful, both for tailgating and going to the beach – as well as any other situation where you might want a place to put your beverages.</p>
<h3>Weight capacity</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3978 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled.jpg" alt="mac sports heavy duty filled with cargo" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Mac Sports claims that their wagon can carry up to 150 pounds of cargo. We put that weight to the test, and found that the wagon didn’t start groaning under the pressure until there was about 170 pounds of cargo inside.</p>
<p>That being said, in practice you should be carrying less than the maximum weight in this wagon. We found that up to about 80 pounds was very easy to carry, but there started to be minor maneuverability issues around 130 pounds. While you could technically carry 150 pounds in this wagon (and we did) we don’t recommend it.</p>
<h3>Some minor issues</h3>
<p>There was plenty to like about the Mac Sports wagon. However, there were a couple of issues we noticed during testing.</p>
<p>The first and most significant issue is the tipping risk we noticed when carrying heavy loads, and loads that went more than two feet over the top of the wagon. More specifically, we found that the Mac Sports wagon would tip if we turned the wheels to a 90-degree angle and pulled moderately hard on the handle.</p>
<p>While not ideal, the solution to this is to simply be careful when carrying large loads in the wagon. The tipping risk is essentially non-existent when carrying lighter loads, and was only an issue when turning tight corners quickly. Our final assessment was that this is a minor issue and a fair trade-off for the improved turn radius of the wagon.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty Folding Wagon is a durable and versatile wagon that is both easy to use and efficient.</li>
<li>Large wheel treads make this the best beach wagon for pulling through sand and mud.</li>
<li>The design of the front wheels gives the wagon an exceptional turn radius while also somewhat reducing stability on sharp turns.</li>
<li>The wagon offers an excellent ratio of cargo capacity to folded size.</li>
</ul>

<p>When we started researching folding wagons, we weren’t aware of any brand that was synonymous with this particular niche market. While we still wouldn’t say that there is an overwhelming dominant brand for folding wagons, it became clear through our testing that Mac Sports knows what they are doing.</p>
<p>While the Mac Sports Heavy Duty Wagon was our top pick overall, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BUUUIGK/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac Sports &#8211; Utility Wagon</a> was a respectable runner-up for garden wagon use. While it doesn’t have the versatility of the heavy-duty variant, this wagon is a strong option for those who aren’t planning to travel over rougher terrain. That, in conjunction with a considerably lower price point, makes the Mac Sports Utility Wagon a strong contender for second place.</p>
<h3>Things we liked</h3>
<p>Many of the things we liked about the Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty are also present in this utility wagon. The durability was the most readily apparent of these, along with the telescoping handle. The cargo capacity for the Mac Sports wagon was impressive as well, with 3.62 cubic feet of cargo space inside the compartment itself (not including anything stacked above).</p>

<p>This wagon was also very easy to fold and unfold – much like its “big brother”.</p>
<p>The price was a significant factor as well. At the time of publishing this article, this wagon was about half the cost of the Heavy Duty variant (about $60 versus about $120). This is a significant difference, and those who are looking to save some money should absolutely consider this version before going for the heavy-duty variant.</p>
<h3>What we didn’t like</h3>
<p>Overall, this version of the Mac Sports wagon is worthy of serious consideration. However, the wheels are significantly less versatile when compared to our top pick. In addition, while Mac Sports does claim that the maximum weight is 150 pounds, we found that the wagon became fairly difficult to maneuver with about 80 pounds of cargo.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3991" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison.jpg" alt="wheel comparison" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Realistically, we wouldn’t want to transport more than 50 or 60 pounds in this wagon – except for short distances or when absolutely necessary. It will work with 100+ pounds of cargo, but it really shines at lower weights.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Mac Sports &#8211; Utility Wagon is a less expensive alternative to our top pick, the Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty Wagon.</li>
<li>The maximum useful weight capacity caps out at around 60 to 70 pounds.</li>
<li>This wagon is best suited for lighter functions, such as transporting groceries or as a garden wagon.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CTUGC5K/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Radio Flyer &#8211; 3-in-1 EZ Fold Wagon with Canopy</a> is the best wagon for big kids and littles spending a day at the park or at the mall. It doesn&#8217;t have all the rugged features of our other top picks, but the canopy and seat belts make it an easy win for parents.</p>
<p>Radio Flyer is an iconic brand in the world of wagons, so a successful new fold up wagon design needed to pass all our major tests in order to be worthy of the name. Fortunately, this is a great folding wagon for kids.</p>
<p>The 3-in-1 EZ Fold version of the folding Radio Flyer wagon comes with and without a canopy, or in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OD3EVDW/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">an &#8220;ultimate&#8221; model</a> with elevated seats to make long rides slightly more comfortable for kids older than two. The bigger seats make the bed of the wagon less versatile, though, and there&#8217;s a hefty price premium for a pretty limited improvement in comfort.</p>
<p>The lap belt restraints were just enough to keep our tester&#8217;s nine-month-old baby and three-year-old child seated on walks. It&#8217;s not a five-point harness, and if you&#8217;ve got a car seat around that will fit inside (like our top pick for <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-infant-car-seat/">best infant car seat</a>) that&#8217;s the best way to keep a curious baby from climbing out.</p>
<p>This was the only folding wagon we tested with a canopy, and it makes all the difference on a sunny summer day. When we tested during a 4th of July parade, we quickly found nearby friends scooting their folding chairs closer to take advantage of the shade.</p>

This wagon isn't quite as rugged as our top pick, but it's perfect for moving your kids and their stuff around.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CTUGC5K/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The canopy supports slide into the four corners of the wagon for folding or when you don&#8217;t want the obstruction, and the canopy itself neatly packs into a pocket on the back of the wagon. The folded size is about the same as other models we tested, quite a bit smaller and easier to pack in the car or van than a folded stroller.</p>
<p>Another unique attribute is that one side of the wagon bed unzips, turning your wagon into a bench. You wouldn&#8217;t want to pull it around with legs dangling, but if you&#8217;re parked (as we did at a parade) the bench mode is quite comfortable for three bigger kids who just need a place to sit.</p>

<p>The Radio Flyer isn&#8217;t as easy to roll around when folded as our top pick. And despite the advantages of a built-in canopy on a sunny day, we still prefer the Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty if you want to have your kids in the wagon while it&#8217;s going over surfaces that aren&#8217;t paved.</p>
<p>That said, the corner-mounted wheels on the Radio Flyer are more stable if you make a sharp turn while you&#8217;re moving quickly. That&#8217;s a safety benefit most parents will probably want to take.</p>
<p>If you really want to go all-in on a folding wagon for your kids, there are premium options available from companies like Keenz and Veer, but at prices around $400 or $600 these wagons aren&#8217;t offering much more than the Radio Flyer or the Mac Sports wagons. We&#8217;ve also tested the best double strollers, and they&#8217;re more economical and far more comfortable for everyone involved, though it is wider.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Radio Flyer lives up to the legacy of classic kid wagons with the two-seater <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CTUGC5K/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EZ Fold 3-in-1 with Canopy</a>.</li>
<li>A built-in canopy is quick to attach and provides great shade for summertime walks.</li>
<li>Maneuverability under load isn&#8217;t as good as the Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty.</li>
<li>The price is about the same as our beach wagon pick, so you&#8217;re trading big wheels for seatbelts and shade.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-others">Other finalists we tested</h2>
<p>The other three wagons performed the basic functions reasonable well. However, all three were the same price or more when compared to the Mac Sports duo – while also being less effective.</p>
<h3>Seina &#8211; Collapsible Folding Utility Wagon</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3989 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Nonwinner-01.jpg" alt="Seina" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Nonwinner-01.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Nonwinner-01-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Nonwinner-01-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Nonwinner-01-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Nonwinner-01-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Nonwinner-01-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Nonwinner-01-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Nonwinner-01-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Nonwinner-01-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VPJLKXQ/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Seina</a> wagon is more or less comparable to the Mac Sports Utility Wagon, both in terms of size and wheel type. However, we found the material to feel notably less “premium”, and in fact the material started to fray a bit towards the end of our testing period.</p>
<p>At the time this article was published, the price of the Seina was about the same as the Mac Sports Utility Wagon, so if that’s your budget we think you’re better off with the Mac Sports wagon.</p>
<h3>Creative Outdoor Distributors &#8211; Folding Wagon</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B011Q0CN48/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Creative Outdoors Wagon</a> is made from a durable fabric that is comparable to both versions of the Mac Sports Wagon. In addition, the heavy duty wheels were able to traverse sand and other rough terrain easily.</p>
<p>However, the maneuverability of this wagon was challenging, particularly when going up and down hills. At the time this article was published, the Creative Outdoor wagon was slightly more expensive than the Heavy Duty Mac Sports wagon. For the price, you’re much better off going with the Mac Sports version.</p>
<h3>EasyGoWagon &#8211; Folding Collapsible Utility Wagon</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3988 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-EasyGo.jpg" alt="easygowagon" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-EasyGo.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-EasyGo-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-EasyGo-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-EasyGo-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-EasyGo-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-EasyGo-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-EasyGo-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-EasyGo-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-EasyGo-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-EasyGo-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Since publishing our post, EasyGoProducts has released the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LR6G9KK/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EasyGoWagon 2.0</a> (which we did not test) and completely removed traces of their old wagon we tested from Amazon, but we&#8217;ll leave our notes below so you have an idea of our test results on version 1.0.</p>
<p>The EasyGoWagon 1.0 was the most expensive wagon we tested, and the most disappointing. The wheels on the EasyGoWagon made it difficult to traverse any terrain other than sidewalks and streets, and the material started to wear out about halfway through our testing period.</p>
<p>This wagon is stable, and the metal frame is certainly durable, but the overall experience of using this wagon simply did not justify the price – especially when there are better options for less money.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3986 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-01.jpg" alt="mac sports dirt road" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-01.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-01-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-01-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-01-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-01-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-01-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-01-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-01-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-01-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-01-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Folding wagons are incredibly useful in a number of situations (they&#8217;re perfect for nearly all outdoor activities — some even like to use them as garden carts!), most will fit in the trunk of your car, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KQH575E/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty Wagon</a> is the best we tested. The durable materials used and the wide range of situations this wagon is capable of taking on makes its price point well-worth it in our opinion.</p>
<p>However, if you only need a lighter-duty wagon, the less expensive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BUUUIGK/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac Sports &#8211; Utility Wagon</a> can save you some money for a quick beach trip or picnic.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re a parent, the best wagon for kids (or pets!) is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CTUGC5K/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Radio Flyer – 3-in-1 EZ Fold Wagon with Canopy</a>.

				<description><![CDATA[Multiple weeks of testing informed our selection of the best pet gates, including usability evaluations, setup assessments, and more.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e researched and tested the best pet gates on the market for dogs and cats. The<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001PYQWXY/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Safety 1st &#8211; Nature Next Bamboo Gate</a> was our favorite dog gate for its portability, ease of use and good looks. For more semi-permanent setups, the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XT30G4/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Summer Infant</a> is a well-built runner-up. We also really enjoyed using the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JJFNJK/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Carlson</a> because of its tall framework and small pet door that’s perfect for cats.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-chose">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We started our research by gathering information through online forums, review sites and retailers such as Amazon, to get a baseline for the most popular pet gates on the market. After careful consideration, we narrowed down our results to eight qualifying models to advance to our in-home test.</p>
<p>Having spent several weeks with each of the gates and testing them daily, we were able to simulate real world testing environments to produce reliable results. We recruited our 100-pound golden retriever as the feature pet for our tests. To help assess the gates, we identified four categories we found most important for pet owners to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ease of installation and breakdown</li>
<li>Locking mechanism effectiveness</li>
<li>Ease of walking through</li>
<li>Build quality</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-eight-best">Compare the best pet gates</h2>
[table id=13 /]
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>With our selection narrowed down to eight finalists, we began our testing by installing them throughout our two-story home. All of the pet gates were placed in high traffic areas to allow for frequent interaction. Over two weeks, we critiqued each product by installation times, locking mechanics, walkthrough accessibility and build quality.</p>
<h3>Ease of installation and breakdown</h3>

<p>There are two main styles of gates: pressure mounted and wall mounted. To avoid drilling holes in the walls, pressure mounted gates offer a great solution that utilizes tension between the walls to hold up the gate. Areas with woodwork like doorways or stairway posts are typically more sensitive to drilling.</p>
<p>Pressure mounted gates have a no-hassle installation process, taking approximately five minutes to put up. Place the four tension screws in each corner of the gate, extend them to the screws to the wall, then turn the tension wheels to secure the gate into place.</p>
<p>Wall-mounted gates, like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JN6304/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">North States</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004AUEJTE/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Evenflo</a>, are fixed to the wall with screws and drywall anchors (anchors not included) for full support. They offer full clearance from top to bottom when open. The absence of a bottom bar leaves us without worry of accidental tripping. Installation will require more precision work, taking approximately 5-10 minutes per gate. This also means removing them will be more time-consuming and require patching holes in the walls.</p>
<p>Extension panels are easy to install on all of the models. Each one connects to the main frame by a metal pin. The hole in each of the corners make it breeze for the pins to slide into. They do not require any other pieces and are held together by the tension.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001PYQWXY/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Safety 1st</a> gate is a pressure-mounted gate featuring a classic design without a swinging door. Its simplistic format requires no setup out of the box. Simply extend the length of the gate and lock the tension by pressing down the bars. When installing the Safety 1st gate against base molding, the bottom part of the frame is no longer flush with the top. This creates a slight bow and will slightly affect its tension, but still remains adequate for most applications. Fortunately the gate’s tensioning rods allow for ¼-inch micro adjustments to refine the tension.</p>
<h3>Locking mechanisms</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3852" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/auto-closing-pet-gate.gif" alt="GIF of auto-closing pet gate" width="900" height="507" /></p>
<p>Unless your dog has a thumb, all of the locking modules should fare well against your four-legged friends. In this category, we evaluated how well these components operate for humans. Each of the locking mechanisms should reliably open and lock without stutter.</p>
<p>To measure, we opened and closed each gate 30 times in succession to see how well they performed with exaggerated repetition. In addition, we kept the gates mounted in our house for several weeks to test normal day-to-day usage.</p>
<h3>Ease of walking through</h3>

<p>Gates are great for partitioning your pet from unwanted spaces, but owners should not feel confined by them. We should be able to walk freely through the gates when needed. For this test we measured the doorway opening on each of the gates. Simply put &#8212; the wider the gate is, the better it is, allowing for natural motion through the gate. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DCR5EKE/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin</a> gate shown above had an impressive door width of 22 inches for a pressure mounted model.</p>
<p>The wall mounted models, such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JN6304/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">North States</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004AUEJTE/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Evenflo</a> gates, offer the widest openings by design. Many of the pressure-mounted models require extra framing on either side of the door to keep its rigidity.</p>
<p>Even though the Safety 1st gate does not have a swinging door feature, the unit is able to disassemble and fold up quite easily. It is also lower to the ground with a gate height of 24 inches so stepping over the gate as needed is doable without requiring yoga moves. Even without a door, this gate remains quite accessible with the lower height.</p>
<h3>Build quality</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3854" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/build-quality-close-up.jpg" alt="build quality close up of Summer Infant gate" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/build-quality-close-up.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/build-quality-close-up-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/build-quality-close-up-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/build-quality-close-up-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/build-quality-close-up-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/build-quality-close-up-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/build-quality-close-up-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/build-quality-close-up-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/build-quality-close-up-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/build-quality-close-up-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>All of the gates we tested had metal framework with a few plastic components. Overall, we were pleased with construction quality out of the box.</p>
<p>Weight is a good indication of structural integrity, since the mounting screws are nearly identical with the pressure mounted gates. The added weight helps secure the framework against the floor. Most of the other pet gates ranged anywhere from 4-15 pounds.</p>
<p>If you have a large dog that likes to lean up on the gate, you may want to lean towards one of these heavier models. Wall-mounted gates do not have three points of contact (two walls and floor) when mounted, so large amounts of downward pressure should be avoided.</p>
<p>We also measured build quality based on the gates&#8217; susceptibility to scratches or biting. Our dog didn’t want to jump on our gates for this test nor would he feast on the metal bars, so we had to improvise. We used the tip of a screwdriver to simulate dog nails or teeth for this stress test. All of the models performed fairly well to light and moderate amounts of pressure, any more force would show a visible line in the paint. We didn’t find these marks to be distracting at all and no physical marks were left from the scratch test.</p>
<p>Over the course of several weeks we also made observations of normal wear and tear. We looked for scuff marks and discoloration on the framing and on the locking module. The same story was pretty consistent with all of the gates. Any plastic components were most susceptible to scuffs, but can usually be wiped down.</p>
<p>Finally we tested the rigidity of the frame bars by squeezing them as hard as we could, to see how easily they&#8217;d bend. Some larger and more eager pets have been known to weasel their way through poorly constructed metal bars. Most of the gates had no issues in our stress test, but the Carlson Extra Tall and Regalo flexed a little more than the rest. The added height on this gate may be the cause of the weaker frames.</p>

<p>Our top dog gate pick goes to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001PYQWXY/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Safety 1st</a> model because its features an extremely quick setup and excellent portability. The bamboo framing also allows for this dog gate to be extremely light at just over four pounds. Easily tuck away the gate in a closet or lean it against a wall when it is not needed. Not everybody wants a gate attached to a doorway at all times.</p>
<p>This dog gate has an impressive span of 28-42 inches, so it should have no problems covering hallways, doorways or openings in the kitchen. Its versatility makes it stand out from the rest and should be have a place in every dog owner&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>Not only does this gate provide solid functionality, but the contrast in dark panels and light frame make for a very charming look. The frame is constructed of bamboo and the panels are made from 100% recycled plastic! The Safety 1st gate takes on a “less is more” approach on this model and we absolutely agree. Even though this gate does not have a built in door or metal framework, its simplicity is a welcome contrast to many other pet gates.</p>

<p>The tension bars do not require complicated mechanics like a spring loaded trigger system, so we wouldn’t be surprised if this gate keeps its structural integrity for many years to come. Simply lift the tension bars to provide slack, line up the metal clip with the appropriate groove to create tension, and push down to lock in place.</p>
<p>With the right amount of pressure, the gate should stand firmly on its own with the rubber pads gripping the wall. The gate can be adjusted in ¼-inch increments to ensure a snug fit. One of the attractive features of this gate is that the setup and breakdown can be accomplished within a few seconds.</p>
<p>Of course there are a few considerations with this gate. Standing at only two feet tall, the Safety 1st gate is not ideal for cats or dogs that are eager enough to jump over this short partition. If a gate is needed for a high traffic area, a model with a swinging door may be more ideal to allow for a clear path. This gate is intended to be a quick and temporary solution and it does this very well.</p>

<p>For its reliable locking module, small pet door and extra tall framework, we easily recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JJFNJK/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carlson Extra Tall</a> gate for cat owners, but it can surely work for dogs as well. If you have both, then perfect! This gate towers over the rest &#8212; measuring 41 inches tall and includes a small pet door at the bottom. Many consumers report that the extended height deters many cats from jumping over the gate. If you need to provide access for your small pet to travel through freely, the small pet door offers that option.</p>
<p>The Carlson Extra Tall gate can fit in hallways and doorways from 29-34 inches, but can be extended by purchasing additional panels to cover larger openings. The door can only be swung in one direction, which is an important feature when using it at the top of the stairs for added safety. The doorway opening only measure 16&#8243; wide, which is on the smaller end especially for such a large gate.</p>

<p>The locking system requires two hands to operate when the red clip is fully engaged. This may not be of concern if the gate is used in an area with less traffic. If you plan on traveling through this gate frequently, we recommend not using the red clip so one-handed usability is still an option.</p>
<p>The Carlson Extra Tall gate locks and unlocks very consistently without issue. When engaging the lock, a large u-shaped component extends to nestle around another piece to hold it into place. Some of the other gates have much smaller latches that rely on spring systems to lock into place.</p>
<p>We would have liked to see the Carlson Extra Tall with thicker bars within the frame. Our stressed showed more bowing on this model than the others, but not to the point of major concern. The most eager pets may be able to bend the bars with enough force and will, but this should be a non-issue for most pet owners. Our 100-pound golden retriever didn’t think twice about maneuvering through the gate.</p>
<p>You’ll notice that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JJFNJK/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carlson Extra Tall</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001OC5UNA/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Regalo</a> pet gates are nearly identical and share the same design and building components. We could not find definitive information online that these companies are related, but the similarities in their products are too hard to ignore. However, we can distinguish that the Carlson brand is marketed towards pet owners, while the Regalo brand is intended for babies. We chose the Carlson Extra Tall over the Regalo for our favorite selection because of the addition of the small pet door.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AX0LG64/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carlson Design Studio</a> gate’s locking mechanism was the easiest to use out of all the gates. The button release felt substantial and the lever only required a short pull to disengage the lock. With such a fluid locking system, the one-handed usability is great on this model.</p>
<p>We do not recommend the Carlson Design Studio pet gate for families with small children. After 48 hours with this gate installed, our one-year-old adventure-seeking son was able to open the gate on his own. He then repeated this action the next morning. We aren’t sure if this a measure of his intelligence or if the gate simply too easy to open.</p>
<p>The Carlson Design Studio gate is marketed as a pet gate, but we should clarify that it does not double as a baby gate. We are a bit disappointed that the gate is not safe enough to both purposes. The other gates that were tested in this series were all reliable enough to use for pets and small children.</p>
<p>Aside from not being suitable for use with children, the Carlson Design Studio&#8217;s metal construction feels rigid and does not flex when pulled. With all-steel construction, this gate is very durable against scratches and even teeth markings. This gate fits doorways 37.5 inches wide to fit most standard doorways, but a 4-inch extension is included.</p>
<p>The auto-closing door feature didn’t have enough tension to close consistently on its own. However, a gentle push would usually be enough to make sure the door is shut all the way. This is something to be mindful of so that you don’t simply assume the door will close every time.</p>
<p>Finally, the elephant in the room is the cherry wood finish at the top of the gate. This might not be for everyone, it certainly wasn’t the style we were looking for, but we can’t speak for everyone.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more semi-permanent gate with a swinging door, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XT30G4/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Summer Infant</a> model impressed us all with its build quality, easy one-handed use and auto-locking feature. Its heavy construction and bronze metal finish made for an impressive design. The bars within the frame are arranged tightly and are not vulnerable to bending when force is applied.</p>
<p>The only thing we would have liked to see on this gate would be a wider door opening: 17.5 inches is one of the most narrow doorways we’ve measured on a gate. This makes it a harder to maneuver, especially when carrying a child and/or bags. If it was marketed exclusively as pet gate, we may have a had a different perspective. Unfortunately the brand name carries the added expectations.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JN6304/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">North States</a> gate has an elegant bronze matte finish, lightweight swing and wide opening. This wall mounted gate looks and feels like an extension of the home rather than an afterthought. If you have a mildly tempered dog and don’t require a gate that supports a lot of weight, this could be a great model. Dogs who like to jump up on gates, might give the wall mounts a run for their money. For this reason we can’t fully recommend this gate to all dog owners.</p>
<p>For a simple pressure mounted gate with a door, look no further than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DCR5EKE/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin</a> gate. The main feature is the doorway opening at 22 inches, much wider than the other gates in its class. This allows for pass through without affecting normal stride. The metal framing is quite nice, but you can find more substantial models for the more ambitious pets. In many cases the Munchkin will perform very well and is also great for young children.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004AUEJTE/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Evenflo</a> gate’s locking module felt sticky and did not pull easily. It was also inconsistent in how much force was required to pull the door shut. This is unfortunate because we really liked the design language on this model. The door has a fluid swing and the frame bars felt more substantial than most of the other models. Coincidently the taupe paint color on the gate perfectly matched our walls, but it wasn’t quite enough to win us over.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001OC5UNA/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Regalo</a> gate shares many similarities with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JJFNJK/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carlson Extra Tall</a> because they stem from the same parent company. We will also note that the lever-locking module is not good for one-handed use. For that reason we cannot recommend this gate if you have small children.</p>

<p>We can easily recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001PYQWXY/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Safety 1st</a> gate as the best option for your pet gating needs. The design aesthetics are charming with the light bamboo frame and contrasting dark panels. When not being used it can be easily tucked away because of its small form factor. It doesn’t offer an intricate locking mechanism and it doesn’t stand as tall as some of the other gates, but it was enough to keep our 100-pound dog on one side.</p>

<p>If you need something more substantial, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XT30G4/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Summer Infant</a> has the toughest frame we’ve tested. The frame bars are incredibly rigid and will not bow or bend for any pet. Unfortunately the doorway opening was the narrowest at 17.5 inches, making it more of an obstacle if used in high traffic areas. The auto-close feature may also be sought after by some, but disliked by others. In the end, it comes down to personal preference, but we admire the build quality nonetheless.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JJFNJK/?tag=ybdgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carlson Extra Tall</a> gate remains to be the best option for cats because of its towering stature. Cats will require a ladder to get over this gate. The locking system performs reliably without hitch and the small pet door is a welcomed feature. Its simple, all-white design makes it easy to integrate into any home.</p>
<p>Each household is different and finding the right gate can make a difference in the quality of life for you and your pet. Assess your specific needs for you and your pet and hopefully one of our pet gate favorites will make your house a little more manageable with your furry friends.

				<description><![CDATA[We tested six of the best baby gates available on the market every day over multiple weeks to discover the North States baby gate was the best available.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter comparing thirty baby gates, we narrowed down the results to six finalists, which we tested daily over multiple weeks with the help of our adventure-seeking one-year-old son. We found that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JN6304/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">North States &#8211; Easy Swing and Lock Gate</a> is the best baby gate due to its build quality, ease of use and elegant aesthetics. With refined construction and a dependable locking mechanism, this gate is easily worth the five extra minutes for installation. Our runner-up is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DCR5EKE/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin &#8211; Easy-Close Safety Gate</a>, a great option if you want to avoid drilling holes in your walls.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-chose">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>There are absolutely no compromises when it comes to the safety of our children. This is why we spent several hours on forums, review sites and retailer sites including Amazon, researching baby gates. Amazon had an overwhelming selection of baby gates with four out of five stars and above, which we favored when making a selection. With so many great options we defined four categories we found most important when shopping for safety gates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ease of installation and breakdown</li>
<li>Locking mechanism effectiveness</li>
<li>Ease of walking through</li>
<li>Build quality</li>
</ul>
<p>We combed through both good and bad online reviews, polled parents and created an in-home labyrinth of gates for a full hands-on review, to find the best baby gate for your home. All in all, the gates we tested worked as advertised and we felt comfortable using them in our own home. However, a few gates inched ahead in build quality and ease of use, leaving us with clear favorites.</p>
<h2 id="the-six-best">Compare the best baby gates</h2>
[table id=12 /]
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Now that we have our six finalists, we paid careful attention to each gate from setup to breakdown. Over two weeks we logged installation times, stress tested the lock mechanics, measured the doorway opening, and carefully examined the build materials of each gate. The gates were set up in high traffic areas for two weeks so we could become fully familiar with each product.</p>
<h3>Ease of installation/breakdown</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gate-installation-logo.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>All of the gates come pre-assembled with the exception of the North States and Evenflo, which required wall mounting components. Of the ones we tested, there were two main styles of installation: pressure mount and wall mount — each offering varying levels of permanence.</p>
<p>Pressure-mounted gates (sometimes called tension gates) are easier to install because you simply extend the screws and twist the tightening ring to create enough pressure to hold the gates in place. Wall mounted gates require you to screw the brackets into studs in your wall. Installation and breakdown is a relatively quick process for both mount styles, ranging from five to ten minutes, but railings or molding sometimes makes finding a suitable location tricky.</p>
<p>Adding length to the pressure mounted models with the panel extenders was easy. The only concern with the extension panels is that they can potentially extend more than you&#8217;d want, leaving you awkwardly in between sizes — the adjustable pressure screws can only be extended so much to compensate for the gap before it starts to affect the integrity of the gate. We also found that the fully extended pressure screws also give an undesirable look.</p>
<h3>Locking mechanism</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3376" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanisms.jpg" alt="baby gate locking mechanisms" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanisms.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanisms-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanisms-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanisms-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanisms-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanisms-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanisms-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanisms-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanisms-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanisms-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><strong>The locking mechanism may be the most important feature when looking for the best baby gate.</strong> We require this component to be reliable in both locking and opening, to keep our children safe while still allowing adults to travel freely. The gate should also have good one-handed usability for when the baby is in tow.</p>
<p>We tested each gate by opening and closing them 30 times in one sitting, then with normal usage over the course of the weeks of testing. In addition, we let our one-year-old son play with each of the gates to see if he could open them on his own.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JN6304/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">North States gate</a> was one of the top performers with a perfect score in our test. We appreciate its simplicity and fluidity, while still maintaining rigidness. This locking module requires pressing down on the locking wedge with a thumb and lifting up on the gate simultaneously. The gate easily slides back into the locking position by pulling or pushing against the brackets.</p>
<p>If you’re in the market for a pressure gate, we give praise to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DCR5EKE/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001PYQWXY/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Safety 1st</a> gates. The Munchkin&#8217;s locking module is a double trigger system that pulls back the locking pin when squeezed. It also performed with a perfect score in our test. The door easily snaps back into place with a gentle push or pull and no lifting is required.</p>
<p>The Safety 1st gate strictly relies on the pressure from the gates length, which can be adjusted in increments of ¼” to ensure a snug fit.</p>
<h3>Ease of walking through</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3367" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ease-of-walking-through.jpg" alt="open baby gate" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ease-of-walking-through.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ease-of-walking-through-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ease-of-walking-through-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ease-of-walking-through-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ease-of-walking-through-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ease-of-walking-through-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ease-of-walking-through-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ease-of-walking-through-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ease-of-walking-through-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ease-of-walking-through-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We should distinguish that <strong>all swing-open pressure-mounted gates require a bar running across at floor level</strong>. This is a structural piece to hold the gate in place when you open the gate. This is the only way these gates can work without drilling screws into the wall, which is a good thing, but the bar is a potential trip hazard.</p>
<p>Wall-mounted gates provide full clearance, but the walls will eventually require a patchwork of the drilled holes when the gates are no longer needed. These gates generally have wider doorway openings because it does not require the same amount of support framing as pressure mounted gates. We prefer not having to worry about tripping when carrying a child, but pressure-mount gates have their place.</p>
<p>Gates make great partitions, but the ability to walk through the gate is just as important. The last thing you want is to fight with a gate when you have a baby on one arm and a bag in the other. For this evaluation, we looked to see which gate has the widest openings.</p>
<p>The wall mounted NorthStates and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004AUEJTE/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Evenflo</a> don’t require a substantial amount of framing on either side of the door, making them the easy winners in this category, each gate spanning up to 42” and 48” respectively. The Munchkin gate has the widest opening at 22” for the pressure gates. It also features a door that swings both directions for convenience. If you plan on placing this gate the top of the stairs, there is a third lock that can be installed at the base.</p>
<p>Some gates on the market feature a door that will shut behind you as you walk through it, as seen on the Summer Infant model. To some, this may seem like a great safety benefit, while others may find that it gets in the way when you need the door left open to travel through with large items.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XT30G4/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Summer Infant</a> has a narrow door opening at 17.5”, as opposed to 19” and up on most other models. We often have to walk through the gate at an angle, especially when carrying a child. The resistance from the auto-closing door seems to get in the way more than it helps. The door makes a loud noise when it swings shut, so we recommend using this gate away from the baby’s room.</p>
<h3>Build quality</h3>

<p>In this category, we looked at build materials and rigidity. We began by comparing weights, observing build materials and performing stress tests on the frame bars to see if they would bow.</p>
<p>Once again the North States baby gate takes claim in another category. Even with its all metal construction, it feels very lightweight and fluid in its swing. Even though the vertical bars were thinner than the other gates, they did not bend when pressure was applied against them. The matte bronze finish is elegant and looks great against hardwood flooring and neutral colored walls. The locking mechanism doesn’t rely on a cheap plastic module like some of the other gates.</p>
<p>The Summer Infant baby gate also gets high marks and for its heavy metal construction, weighing in at 21 lbs. Its framework is thicker than the other gates and will not bow or bend for anyone. Its extension panels also feel exceptionally sturdy.</p>
<p>The Evenflo model could have been on the top of our list as well with its clean lines and metal construction, but the build quality of the locking mechanism is too large and cheap feeling. To unlock the gate, you must squeeze the trigger and pull the locking module away from the wall. We found this motion to stick more often than we would like.</p>
<p>The dark horse of this group is the Safety 1st baby gate, made from durable bamboo and recycled plastics. We love that is made from eco-conscious materials while maintaining a clean and attractive look. Even though the Safety 1st gate is incredibly lightweight at 4.1 pounds, we were impressed with how tightly the pressure mechanics were able to grab onto the wall. We pushed and pulled on the gate to simulate a little more forceful than the strength of a toddler and the gate stood strong.</p>

<p>Our research and tests indicates that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JN6304/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">North States baby gate</a> is the superior choice, providing value in both aesthetics and functionality. <strong>The North States gate had good marks in almost all the categories we tested with no major shortcomings.</strong> The refined build quality, light swing and dependable locking mechanism made for a very convincing argument.</p>
<p>The North States has a unique design with four independent mounting brackets anchored to the wall. With the hinge nestled along the wall, the gate is able to swing completely open, letting open the full width of the hallway. This especially comes in handy when carrying large items through this area. Even though it&#8217;s a permanent set up, the North States gate never gets in the way of our everyday routine. In contrast, pressure gates require tightening screws in the four corners, which can look quite jarring when they are bright silver and your gate is dark.</p>

<p>The Evenflo is also a wall mounted gate, but does not have the same minimalistic approach as the North States. It has additional framework on both sides of the door instead of independent mounting brackets, which doesn’t allow for a full wide opening.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3373 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanism-north-states.jpg" alt="locking mechanism on North States baby gate" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanism-north-states.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanism-north-states-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanism-north-states-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanism-north-states-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanism-north-states-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanism-north-states-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanism-north-states-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanism-north-states-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanism-north-states-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locking-mechanism-north-states-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The two-part locking mechanism on the North States gate is one of our favorites to use. The button feels just as rigid as the first day we installed it. It performed very well in our stress test and have had no problems ever since. The gate makes a pleasant clicking sound when the components are locked into place.</p>
<p>The only weakness we found was the installation time. It took approximately ten minutes to install as opposed to five minutes with the pressure-style gates. We highly recommend using a measuring tape, pencil to accurately mount the wall brackets, and drywall anchors to securely mount the brackets. Take your time here, because this could turn a great gate into a less than average one. This gate ended up feeling like an extension of our home and have been using it exclusively in our own house since we finished testing.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The gate’s metal construction is strong but feels very lightweight in its swing.</li>
<li>Minimal wall mounts and extendable gate allows for a tailored design.</li>
<li>Reliable and snappy locking system.</li>
<li>Gate allows maximum doorway opening for easier passthrough.</li>
</ul>

<p>If drilling holes into the wall is absolutely not an option, we’d gladly recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DCR5EKE/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin</a> baby gate. The locking mechanism is reliable and clicks into place every time. We also appreciate the larger door opening on this model compared to the other pressure gates. While carrying our son, we never worried about accidentally hitting his legs against the gate because the opening was too narrow.</p>
<p>The Munchkin gate took approximately five minutes to get set up, like all of the other pressure-mount models with a swinging door. They all come with four large screws to be placed in each of the corners. The padded end goes against the wall and the tightening screw can be turned to increase the pressure against the wall holding it up. This is a great solution for semi-permanent setups or areas where drilling into the wall is not ideal, such as doorways with woodwork.</p>

Of the gates we tested, it offers the widest clear opening. This gate also swings in both directions for maximum flexibility.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DCR5EKE/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The two-trigger locking module works very reliably, engaging fluidly every time we used it. When pulling or pushing the door into the locked position, it snapped into place every time with a satisfying click. The ability to swing the door both ways was convenient in frequently traveled areas. If you are planning to use this gate at the stop of the stairs, there is a stopper that is included to force the gate to swing only one way for safety.</p>
<p>In our extensive tests the Munchkin gate impressed, but it didn’t take the top pick for a couple reasons. First, we would have preferred the locking mechanism to be constructed with less plastic. Even though it functions well, it does not feel high quality. Second, the North States has the advantage of tailor-fitting many different sized halls and doorways. Extension panels can be added to the Munchkin gate, but it will not look as seamless.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This gate has the widest door opening out of all the pressure mounted gates we tested.</li>
<li>Reliable and easy to use two-trigger lock system.</li>
<li>Does not require screws for installation, but has a bar at the floor level like all other pressure mounted gates.</li>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001OC5UNA/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Regalo</a> baby gate didn’t score as highly because the locking mechanism requires two hands to operate if the lock is fully engaged. If one handed usability isn’t an important feature for you, then you may consider going with this model.</p>
<p>It’s possible that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004AUEJTE/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Evenflo</a> gate required a little more breaking in, but in our experience, the locking mechanism was not as fluid as we would have hoped. Without drywall anchors, this gate was visibly unstable. The tiny screws that lock the width of the gate could have been better constructed as well.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XT30G4/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Summer Infant</a> gate was well constructed with a heavy frame. It also looks quite nice with the arch above the swinging door. Unfortunately, we never got used to the narrow doorway. Otherwise, it was very sturdy and had a well functioning locking module.</p>
<p>We can’t go without mentioning the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001PYQWXY/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Safety 1st</a> gate, an excellent solution for your temporary gate needs. Its parts are constructed well and provide a secure partition. <strong>This gate was ready to go out of the box with no setup required.</strong> Being the simplest gate without a swinging door, it can be placed anywhere with an opening between 28” to 42”. Extend the gate long enough for the pressure to hold and lock it in place. We appreciate its versatility to fit anywhere in the house as needed. It is also collapsible and can be tucked away when not being used.</p>
<p>If you have base molding, note that the Safety 1st gate will slightly bow because it will hit the wall at different lengths. Placing the gate above the base molding to avoid the bow isn’t recommended because the floor cannot provide extra support. We didn’t find this to be a huge problem since the support was still adequate.</p>

<p>Overall we were impressed with many of the finalist gates we tested. The wall mounted <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JN6304/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">North States</a> gate was our favorite for most applications, with its simple but high-quality components. The lightweight metal design made this gate feel the least intrusive out of all the gates, while still maintaining toughness. By utilizing the wall as an anchor, the gate is able to pivot from the edge of the wall, allowing for more free space.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DCR5EKE/?tag=ybdbgate-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin</a> gate gives a solid performance for the pressure gates. Its wide walk-through opening and reliable double-lock mechanism make this an easy choice. We liked that the door was able to swing both ways for added convenience. The metal and plastic build quality doesn’t feel quite as luxurious as some of the other models, but it was never meant to be. The plain white design and fluid functionality are what made it to the top of the list.</p>
