				<description><![CDATA[After weeks spent comparing 10 towels for softness, durability, absorbency, and everything in between, we've found that Lauren Home makes the best bath towel. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter extensive research followed by several weeks of comparing 10 sets of towels side by side, we recommend the <a href="https://www.macys.com/shop/product/price-break-lauren-ralph-lauren-wescott-bath-towel-collection-100-cotton?ID=1902537" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren Home &#8211; Wescott Bath Towel</a> as our top pick for best bath towel. Middle-range plush, thick and posh-looking, it’s a towel you would be proud to hang in your guest bathroom. Priced on the higher end for a single towel, we think the Lauren Home has enough value in terms of luxury and longevity to make it worth the investment. The somewhat heavier <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005TOX7F2/?tag=ybdtowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superior &#8211; 900 GSM Bathroom Towel</a> came in a close second as our runner-up.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Since the debate on soft versus scratchy towels will forever be an ongoing discussion, we know that purchasing towels can be a highly subjective and personal process. On the other hand, criteria such as quality and absorbency are factors nearly everyone looks for.</p>
<p>To this end, we looked at towel-buying guides in Good Housekeeping, Consumer Reports and the Home Shopping Network to learn how to best determine these qualities before purchasing. From this research phase, we narrowed down our finalists to those with 100 percent cotton and focused on towels with a higher weight.</p>
<p>Once we had our criteria in mind, we looked closely at reputable reviews on sites like Wirecutter and Business Insider. The information we found on these sites gave us some additional parameters for our selections, focusing our attention on towels with longer yarn loops with more surface area and a denser weave.</p>
<p>Once we had a good grasp on fabric technology and picked up a few tips from textile experts, we considered customer testimonials on Reddit &#8211; Buy It for Life and big-box retailers like Target and Amazon. This helped us cull our list and narrow our finalists down to the top ten. Once we had our finalists in hand, we conducted additional research on how to care for towels and dove into some real-world testing.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-pick">How to pick the best towel</h2>
<p>Manufacturers often coat towels with a fabric softening finish that makes them feel soft in the store, but this finish wears off after two to three washes. So instead of going by feel, you may be better off looking at the fabric and visually inspecting it for durability and quality craftsmanship. Durable towels will of course have strong fabric, but you should also look for a towel with double-turned edges and double stitching — these are more likely to stand the test of time.</p>
<p>If you choose a towel that is made of quality fibers and is well-constructed, other factors such as size, softness and weight come down to personal preference.</p>
<h3>Fabric terminology</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SuperiorWipe-sm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Fabric terminology can be tricky, but you don’t need a degree in textiles to read the labels with our breakdown on fabrics. Here are some examples of lingo you may see when searching for the best towel.</p>
<p><strong>Long staple cotton</strong>: Long staple or extra-long staple (ELS) cotton has fibers that are 1 ⅛ inches and longer. This equates to smoother, stronger and more flexible yarn. Shorter fibers produce yarns that are rougher and tend to pill or attract lint, while longer fibers make for stronger and softer towels that can stand up to repeated washes and retain color longer.</p>
<p><strong>Pima or Egyptian cotton:</strong> Pima, Supima (the trademark for American-grown, ELS cotton) or Egyptian cotton are a different species of cotton plant with longer fibers. The yarn is silkier, smoother and towels made of Pima cotton are more absorbent and softer. However, the Cotton Egypt Association (CEA) reports that <a href="https://associationsnow.com/2016/11/scandal-egyptian-cotton-group-tightens-linen-scrutiny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not all Egyptian cotton is labeled accurately</a>, so you may want to look for the CEA’s Gold Seal certification to make sure you’re getting the real thing.</p>
<p><strong>Turkish cotton:</strong> Similar to Egyptian cotton, Turkish cotton produces extra-long fibers. The cotton grown in the Aegean region is soft, strong and absorbent. While towels made with Turkish cotton aren’t as absorbent as Egyptian cotton, they are lightweight and dry more quickly, making them ideal for humid climates. Quality varies depending on the weaver, and you’ll still need to be wary of manufacturers making false claims to authentic Turkish cotton.</p>
<p><strong>Combed cotton:</strong> This means that the cotton has been combed to remove shorter fibers and impurities, leaving only the strongest and longest threads.</p>
<p><strong>Ring spun cotton:</strong> The short and long fibers of ring spun cotton are twisted together to create a smoother, finer yarn. The process requires long staple cotton, so you know you’re already starting with a quality base.</p>
<p><strong>Twist:</strong> This refers to how much of the yarn loop is twisted. A high twist makes for a more durable towel, while a low or zero twist makes for a plusher, more absorbent towel.</p>
<p><strong>GSM:</strong> This stands for grams per square meter, or the weight of the towel. Under 400 GSM is considered a lightweight towel, 400-600 GSM is medium weight, and above 600 GSM is the heaviest.</p>
<p><strong>OEKO-TEX Standard 100:</strong> The <a href="https://www.oeko-tex.com/en/business/certifications_and_services/ots_100/ots_100_start.xhtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OEKO-TEX Standard 100</a> is a worldwide certification system of raw and finished textile products. Articles such as yarns, fabrics and towels undergo independent testing to ensure they are free from harmful substances such as banned Azo colorants, formaldehyde and pentachlorophenol. Certification also means they must be free of chemicals that are known to be harmful to human health, but are not yet legally controlled. Textiles used close to the skin, such as towels, are more closely regulated than articles not in direct contact with skin.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-wash">How to wash bath towels</h2>
<p>You should clean your towels when you first purchase them. Doing so will remove the silicones and other finishes they are coated with to make them feel softer in the store. (While these finishes may feel nice, they block absorbency.)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 – Use vinegar for first wash:</strong><br />
For the first wash, <a href="https://www.bhg.com/homekeeping/laundry-linens/linens/washing-and-caring-for-towels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Better Homes &amp; Gardens</a> recommends you use white vinegar, which helps to both set the colors and remove excess detergent residue. Since vinegar doubles as a cleaning agent, you can use half the recommended amount of detergent plus a half to one cup of white vinegar. We washed the colored towels and white towels separately.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 – Check manufacturer instructions:</strong><br />
You should check the manufacturer’s washing and drying instructions to get the most longevity out of your towels. Washing them separately from other clothes is the most hygienic method and makes it easier to follow the care instructions for your towels. Liquid fabric softeners can decrease absorbency and increase flammability, so skip the fabric softener completely or use dryer sheets instead.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 – Wash often:</strong><br />
Since towels absorb body oils and collect dead skin cells, and a moist towel is a breeding ground for bacteria, your towels should dry thoroughly in between uses and be washed frequently.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 – Avoid overdrying:</strong><br />
Shaking your towels out before placing them into the dryer can fluff the yarn loops to aid absorbency and reduce drying time. While you don’t want to overdry, which can wreck the cotton fibers, you want to make sure that they are dry enough to prevent mildew. With proper care, high-quality towels can last you a decade.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/lauren-towel-fluffing-sm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p><strong>Density:</strong> If you want a denser, plusher, more absorbent towel, you’ll typically want to look for a towel above 500 GSM. Keep in mind that heaviness does not always equal quality, so you’ll want to consider the fabric as well as the GSM.</p>
<p><strong>Softness:</strong> Not everyone wants a super plush towel; some people prefer a scratchier towel with a more exfoliating surface. If you do prize softness above all else, you may want to look for a towel made of long staple or extra-long staple yarn.t</p>
<p><strong>Durability:</strong> A towel with double-turned edges with double stitching will prevent fraying and have a longer life span.</p>
<p><strong>Weaving technique:</strong> This determines the durability of your towels. A poorly woven towel can stretch or even tear and the thread loops can fray.</p>
<p><strong>Fabric:</strong> According to <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home-products/towel-reviews/a25466/how-to-buy-towels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Good Housekeeping</a>, 100 percent cotton is the softest and most absorbent. If you want a faster-drying and more economical option, a cotton/polyester blend is a good choice.</p>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> Bath towels typically range between 27-30 by 52-58 inches. Some towels are available oversized for more coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Bleach or benzoyl/peroxide resistant:</strong> Some acne treatments use benzoyl peroxide, which can leave bleach spots on your towels. If you use acne cleansers or creams, you may want to consider purchasing white towels, or a product that claims to be benzoyl peroxide safe.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/hand-drying-sm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>In addition to real-life testing where we used these towels as you would at home, we conducted specific tests to determine softness, absorbency and durability.</p>
<p>In all our testing, we washed the colored towels in warm water and the white towels in hot water since <a href="https://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/cleaning/laundry/how-to-wash-bath-towels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Real Simple</a> reports that hot water can fade colors and make the texture more scratchy. On the other hand, white towels keep their brightness better in hot wash. All the towels were washed with Tide Regular on a 10-minute normal/casual cycle and dried on the low heat, economy setting. (Read our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-laundry-detergent/" rel="noopener">review of the best laundry detergent</a> here.)</p>
<h3>Softness and thickness</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">[table id=135 /]
<p style="text-align: center;">Towels are rated on a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 is the softest and thickest.</p>
<p>Before we started washing or using the towels, we used our non-dominant hands to feel the softness of the fabric when first out of the package. According to Wirecutter, our dominant hands are more rough and therefore we can get a better sense of softness by using our nondominant hand. Then we gripped it to determine how thick the towel felt in our hands. We rated each towel on a scale of one to five, with five being the softest and thickest.</p>
<p>The fabric softener finishes used by the manufacturers make the towels soft to the touch, but also make them less absorbent. Just to put this to the test, we used each of the towels without washing them first.</p>
<p>While a majority of the towels felt softer than they did after the first wash, we didn’t note a major difference in absorbency. The one exception was the AmazonBasics &#8211; Quick-Dry Towel. It was super soft, but had zero absorbency and felt like we were drying off with a fleece blanket. Subsequent washes greatly improved the absorbency, although this was one of our less absorbent towels in the final results.</p>
<p>For the first wash, we used detergent and white vinegar to set colors and remove any finishes the manufacturers might have coated the towels with. After the first wash with vinegar, we compared each towel to a duplicate fresh from the package that had never been washed. Once most or all of the manufacturer’s finishing was removed, we again rated each towel on a scale of one to five for softness and thickness.</p>
<p>Our softest and thickest towels were the Lauren Home and Superior, both fresh out of the package and after five rounds of washing and drying. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HFFJZ7Q/?tag=ybdtowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AmazonBasics</a> also rated among the winners in the softness scale, making it a good option if you prefer a soft towel that is on the thinner side. If you prefer a scratchier towel, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O2QJX7E/?tag=ybdtowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chakir &#8211; Luxury Hotel &amp; Spa Bath Towel</a> is on the coarser side, while still nice and thick.</p>
<h3>Durability and color retention</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">[table id=136 /]
<p style="text-align: center;">Towels are rated on a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 is the most durable, least linting and best color retention.</p>
<p>Pulled threads can occur if they are caught on sharp objects, so for durability we looked more at hem fraying. A visual inspection of the hems, with an eye on neatly folded edges and secure stitching, can give you a good indicator of durability even before you purchase a towel. To test durability of hems over time, we washed and dried each towel five times on the cycles mentioned above.</p>
<p>We inspected the hems again after five rounds in the washer and dryer. We examined each towel to see if the stitching held up, if there were any worn spots, and whether the hems were frayed, then rated it on a scale of one to five.</p>
<p>After washing for five cycles, we once again rated the towels on a scale from one to five for softness and thickness. We also looked at whether they began to collect lint (not to be confused with the <a href="https://dengarden.com/interior-design/How-To-Stop-New-Towels-From-Moulting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moulting</a> process of new towels) and rated how much lint each towel accrued on a scale from one to five.</p>
<p>In terms of durability and linting, the Lauren Home, Superior and Cotton Craft appeared practically new despite multiple washes. Their seams were intact and there was very little to no wear on the yarn loops. The AmazonBasics showed the most overall wear, and the Pinzon had collected a large amount of lint that we would need a fabric shaver to remove.</p>
<p>We also compared the towels for a color match and rated them on a scale of one to five (five being best) for how true they stayed to their original colors after washing and drying five times. For the white towels, we considered brightness and whiteness versus fading.</p>
<p>All of our colored towels matched their original color perfectly, even after five cycles in the washer and dryer. Of the towels we purchased in white, the Lauren Home and Utopia fared less well. We washed them in a separate load from the colored towels. After five rounds in the washer and dryer, they both looked white when viewed alone or next to each other. However, they appeared slightly gray when viewed next to their unwashed match.</p>
<h3>Absorbency</h3>
[table id=137 /]
<p style="text-align: center;">Towels are rated on a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 is the most absorbent.</p>
<p>Since you want a towel that stands the test of time, we considered absorbency after the five wash-and-dry cycles. As we tested, we kept in mind that fiber loops should brush water off the body and that absorbency is impacted by a number of factors such as: the number of loops, length of the loops, thickness or coarseness of the yarn and how tightly the loops are packed together.</p>
<p>The most absorbent towels will have the most surface area, which means you should look for longer and thinner loops in a deep pile. We took two showers with each towel, then rated them on a scale of one to five for for absorbency based on how well they dried the entire body.</p>
<p>The majority of our finalists rated a four or five in absorbency. The thicker, plusher towels like Lauren Home and Superior wicked away moisture. A thinner, coarser towel like Cotton Craft was still effective thanks to the scratchier yarn that brushed water off the body and absorbed the remainder. The AmazonBasics was the only towel that left us feeling less than dry.</p>
<h3>Dry time</h3>
[table id=138 /]
<p>To begin with, we cleaned our dryer air exhaust vent to avoid clogging (which could make the towels tested at the end take longer to dry and skew the results) and cleaned it again halfway through testing. We changed the dryer lint trap after each use for the same reason. Then we washed towels and dried them in the dryer on the low-economy setting.</p>
<p>Towels were split up into two groups of five, in order to give them an appropriate amount of space in the dryer. We checked the dryer every 10 minutes and pulled out the towels that were fully dry. We recorded how long each towel took to be dry to the touch. Since we didn’t want to overdry our towels, we pulled them out at 97 percent dry. While not an exact science, we gripped each towel with our hand to see if they were dry to the touch, without being bone dry (which might harm the fabric).</p>
<p>We also tested how long each towel took to dry in the bathroom. We used each towel to dry off after a shower and then hung it in the same bathroom to dry. We hung the towels to dry over the shower curtain rod (sans the curtain), with a window and door open to ensure air flow. Then we checked hourly and recorded how long it took the towels to be fully dry to the touch.</p>
<p>To account for temperature and humidity in the bathroom, we tested each morning at the same time and used an analog hygrometer to measure the amount of moisture in the air. Our tests were conducted over a period of days (between 8 to 9 am each morning), with the internal room temperature at 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 50 percent humidity after the first hour (80 degrees and 70 percent humidity immediately post-shower). We conducted our dryer and hang-dry tests five times to ensure consistency in our recorded results.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, all of our finalists were dry to the touch in 11 hours and under. Our fastest drying towel was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002S52ZEY/?tag=ybdtowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pinzon</a>, a scratchier, thinner towel with high absorbency. Perhaps because it absorbed less moisture in the first place, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HFFJZ7Q/?tag=ybdtowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AmazonBasics</a> lived up to its name. It dried in 30 minutes in the dryer and in eight hours when hung to dry in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, some of the plusher and denser towels like the Chakir, Superior and Lauren Home took longer to dry, especially when hung. In the end, we found the difference in dry time in the dryer to be minimal (a difference of ten minutes max). Since all the towels we hung dry in the morning were dry before night, it didn’t weigh heavily on our final choices. However, if you live in a humid climate, this may have more impact on which towels you choose to purchase.</p>

<p>The plushness and softness of the <a href="https://www.macys.com/shop/product/price-break-lauren-ralph-lauren-wescott-bath-towel-collection-100-cotton?ID=1902537" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren Home &#8211; Wescott Bath Towel</a> earned it our highest recommendation, especially since it was just as plush and soft over time as when it was first purchased. Made of low twist cotton, it was one of our most absorbent towels and gathered no lint after multiple washes. The Lauren Home is available in a wide array of colors, so you can match nearly any color scheme in your bathroom.</p>
<p>Not only does the Lauren Home have a sumptuous feel, it has a quality look and understated design that made it stand out from the other finalists when simply hanging over the towel rack. It is more than just a display towel, however. Its softness, fluffiness and durability after multiples uses and washes was unparalleled by the other finalists we tested. While priced slightly higher than our other finalists, we felt it provided enough value to recommend the investment.</p>

While more expensive than our other finalists, the Lauren Home holds its value after repeated washes.</p><a href="https://www.macys.com/shop/product/price-break-lauren-ralph-lauren-wescott-bath-towel-collection-100-cotton?ID=1902537" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Macys</button></a></div></div>
<p>Despite how much we loved this towel, there are a few things we would change. As a dense towel with a 578 GSM, it was one of the slowest to dry when we hung it in the bathroom. Since this was also the case with our other plush towels, we didn’t consider it a deal breaker. However, it may be something to think twice about depending on the climate in which you live.</p>
<p>Secondly, we tested this towel in white and it had already become less bright. You can <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/laundry/how-to-keep-white-clothes-white/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prevent white laundry from turning gray</a> by using a detergent with a bleaching component, a mild oxidizing agent or even by simply line drying it in the sun. As we didn’t want to compromise our tests, we didn’t take any of these steps at home, but they are an easy solution to keeping white laundry white.</p>
<p>Other than these two considerations, the Lauren Home is a high-quality towel that feels as good on your skin as it looks good hanging on the towel rack.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Lauren Home is an ultra-soft towel with a 578 GSM, making it dense, plush and absorbent without being too heavy.</li>
<li>It is made from 100 percent cotton with a low twist loop construction, which adds to the plushness and absorbency.</li>
<li>This towel outperformed all of our other finalists in terms of softness and thickness over multiple rounds in the washer and dryer.</li>
<li>It comes in 20 vibrant color options and has a slightly textured band for subtle design.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="runner-up">The runner-up: Superior &#8211; 900 gsm</h2>

<p>A higher GSM makes for a denser and plusher towel, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005TOX7F2/?tag=ybdtowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superior &#8211; 900 GSM Bathroom Towel</a> was the heaviest towel we tested. The drying power was remarkable thanks to a high GSM and double-ply construction, and 100 percent long staple, combed cotton made it a luxurious experience. It comes in a coordinating six piece set of washcloths, hand towels and bath towels and is available in a wide range of colors. Because of the style of its fibers, the supeior was more absorbent than a lot of the other towels.</p>

It was the most absorbent of the towels we tested; the downside is that this means it takes longer to dry than a thinner towel.</p><a href="" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>While we tested in summer, we imagine this towel would be ideal for keeping away a winter chill. No one wants to step out of a warm shower into a cold bathroom, and the Superior’s ability to absorb moisture in an instant, combined with a heavy drape, would help you retain the heat from the shower.</p>
<p>We loved how pampered we felt using this towel, which is a big reason it was our runner up pick. It narrowly missed being chosen as our overall winner, because some testers found the heaviness to be overwhelming. It could almost double as a bath mat. Since it is so thick, it also takes a long time to dry. It took 50 minutes to dry to the touch in our dryer, ten minutes longer than any of the other towels we tested. That being said, it also excelled at retaining its color and texture after the drying process was complete.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Long staple, combed cotton leaves only the finest and longest fibers, so it was no surprise that the Superior was among the coziest and most absorbent towels we tested.</li>
<li>It has a 900 GSM and double-ply construction, so if you prefer a heavier towel, this is your best option.</li>
<li>The Superior retained is softness, thickness and color in our tests, making it one of the best towels we tested.</li>
<li>While it takes a long time to dry, we can easily say it was the most absorbent towel of our finalists.</li>

<p>Just because you’re on a tight budget doesn’t mean you need to sacrifice quality. Priced well below our other finalists (per towel when you order the set), the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00267ILYC/?tag=ybdtowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cotton Craft &#8211; Ultra Soft</a> is an inexpensive towel that still looks and feels good after multiple uses and washes. In fact, it rated right up there with our number one and luxury pick in terms of color retention, linting and durability.</p>

It is a great option for stocking up a rental, or for a new college student headed to the dorms.</p><a href="" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>It is made with 100 percent cotton, a ring spun loop construction and a rayon band. Since ring spun yarn requires a long staple cotton that is smoother and less likely to lint, you can be confident you’re getting a good value for your money. After repeated washes, the Cotton Craft had attracted no lint or fuzz, nor did it appear frayed or faded.</p>
<p>The Cotton Craft is a good choice for those who prefer a thinner, textured towel that is durable and functional. It’s not as ultra-soft as advertised, but it’s not uncomfortably rough either. Since it is so affordable and easy to care for, it’s also a good option for a student headed off to college or for stocking a summer rental.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>For such an economical towel, the Cotton Craft remained attractive after multiple uses.</li>
<li>It experienced no fading or fraying after repeat washes.</li>
<li>Made with ring spun cotton, the yarn loops remained smooth and attracted no lint even after extended testing.</li>
<li>The Cotton Craft is thinner, has a soft yet textured feel and rated well for absorbency.</li>

<h3>Chakir &#8211; Luxury Hotel &amp; Spa</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O2QJX7E/?tag=ybdtowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chakir &#8211; Luxury Hotel &amp; Spa Bath Towel</a> had the best balance between softness/scratchiness and heaviness/thinness of all our finalists. With a 750 GSM, it was dense but not too heavy. While plush and soft, the fabric loops also had a nubby texture that would please those on team scratchy. If you live with a significant other or roommate who doesn’t agree with your towel preferences, the Chakir is likely to make both of you happy.</p>

It's not the widest towel among our contenders, but it's luxurious feel will likely win you over anyway.</p><a href="" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>Despite being labeled as Turkish cotton (typically a faster-drying towel), the Chakir &#8211; Luxury Hotel &amp; Spa towel was one of the slowest-drying towels we tested. It also had the smallest width (by a few inches). Despite these few drawbacks, which prevented it from becoming our number one pick, the Chakir is a luxurious towel that we confidently recommend.</p>
<p>The deep hue held true after multiple washes, the seams stayed intact and there was very little linting.</p>
<h3>Fieldcrest &#8211; Luxury Solid</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.target.com/p/luxury-solid-bath-towels-fieldcrest-153/-/A-13660400" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fieldcrest &#8211; Luxury Solid Towel</a> is a solid option (no pun intended) in terms of softness, absorbency and durability. It is OEKO-TEX certified and designed to resist color fading (it still looks brand new after all our testing) and benzoyl peroxide stains. If anyone in your household has sensitive skin and/or uses acne treatments, this is an excellent option for you.</p>
<p>It offers high absorbency and hang dries quickly, so it’s also a good choice if you live in a humid climate. The Fieldcrest is exceptionally soft, a medium weight and thickened up after washing. We really don’t have anything bad to say about this towel, but our top picks were just a little plusher and denser than the Fieldcrest.</p>
<h3>Threshold &#8211; Performance Solid</h3>
<p>Right out of the package, the <a href="https://www.target.com/p/performance-solid-bath-towel-sets-threshold-153/-/A-52381871" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Threshold &#8211; Performance Solid Bath Towel</a> was one of the softest towels we tested, and it retained most of its softness after washing and drying five times. Multiple washes made it feel thicker, and it didn’t accumulate any lint.</p>
<p>If softness is high on your priority list, this towel is a good choice. However, we didn’t choose it as our top pick since it had already begun to show wear after washing and drying five times. Its seams held up well, but the edges started to look somewhat fuzzy and worn. The color faded slightly, as well.</p>
<h3>AmazonBasics &#8211; Quick-Dry</h3>
<p>If you’re looking for a cozy feeling and lightweight towel at a reasonable price, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HFFJZ7Q/?tag=ybdtowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AmazonBasics &#8211; Quick-Dry Towel</a> is a good option. However, if you don’t want your towels to show their age, you may want to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>The AmazonBasics is made of 100 percent cotton and meets OEKO-TEX standards so you can feel confident that it is free from regulated and not-yet-regulated (but known to be harmful) substances. It was the least absorbent of our finalists, since the loops were too soft to brush water off our body.</p>
<p>It kept its color well, but overall appeared fuzzy after repeated washing and drying. Both the cotton loops and the trim suffered wear. This fact took it out of the running as the best towel. For a mid-range price, we expected this towel to hold up better.</p>
<h3>Martex &#8211; Commercial</h3>
<p>Pleasantly scratchy and thin, multiple washes improved the thickness of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VA13WP8/?tag=ybdtowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Martex &#8211; Commercial Bath Towel</a> without changing the texture. Advertised as a commercial quality towel, we could easily see how this could be a good choice for a public pool or gym as it retained a like-new appearance after many washes. Despite its thinness, the Martex has high absorbency and dries in a moderate amount of time.</p>
<p>While extremely durable, the course texture and thinness of the towel gave it a dormitory or beach rental vibe. It didn’t have the feel of a towel you might invest in at home, which prevented it from being our top choice. However, if you’re sending a student off to school with the basic necessities or need to stock the bathroom your AirBnB guests use, the Martex is easy to care for and will likely stand the test of time.</p>
<h3>Utopia Towels &#8211; Extra Large</h3>
<p>If you’re looking for a bath towel that can double as a beach towel, you’ll appreciate the oversized width and length of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009SZ2RCM/?tag=ybdtowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Utopia Towels &#8211; Extra Large Bath Towel</a>. Made with ring spun cotton, the Utopia was absorbent and dried relatively quickly for its large size. Despite the extra yardage, we found the price to be high for its middle-of-the-road performance.</p>
<p>While it offers a good compromise in terms of softness/scratchiness and weight, it had already begun to look discolored and linty after a few washes. The seams stayed intact, and while it may not keep its original beauty, it didn’t appear as if it would fall apart or tear any time soon.</p>
<h3>Pinzon</h3>
<p>After the first wash, we thought the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002S52ZEY/?tag=ybdtowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pinzon &#8211; Bath Towel Set</a> would be a great budget choice. There’s the fact that it meets stringent safety and environmental standards with OEKO-TEX certification. It leans toward the scratchier side, a bonus for some people, and has a nice medium weight with 600 GSM that would please most. The Pinzon was also absorbent and the fastest drying towel in our staged tests.</p>
<p>The downside, and the deal breaker on naming it a top pick, was the lint. It started to collect after the second wash and became progressively worse. By the sixth wash, the ring spun yarn that originally gave it a sleek appearance was nearly unrecognizable.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>In the end, quality and durability were metrics that reigned supreme in our decision-making process. Factors like softness, weight and size can all depend on personal preference, so we weighted our decision toward longevity. However, we don’t think it hurt our top picks that they were lush and comfortable to use.</p>
<p>On the downside, their high absorbency and plush nature meant that they took longer to dry. If you live in a region where that could be an issue, you may want to take a look at our other finalists. That said, the affordable luxury of the <a href="https://www.macys.com/shop/product/price-break-lauren-ralph-lauren-wescott-bath-towel-collection-100-cotton?ID=1902537" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren Home &#8211; Wescott Bath Towel</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005TOX7F2/?tag=ybdtowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superior &#8211; 900 GSM Bathroom Towel</a> make them well worth a try. We feel confident recommending the Lauren Home as an ideal choice for most households, and we suggest the Superior if you don’t mind a heavy drape.</p>
<p>For those on a tighter budget, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00267ILYC/?tag=ybdtowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cotton Craft &#8211; Ultra Soft</a> provides excellent value with ring spun cotton that retains a smooth feel after multiple washes.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter two months of immersive testing with 13 finalists, we&#8217;ve picked the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DVS40TE/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Moen &#8211; Magnetix Attract Handheld</a> as our top recommendation for best shower head. Its magnetic dock is a handy feature, and this head delivers a good showering experience even while meeting the EPA’s strict WaterSense two-gallon-per-minute standard. For those who want a little bit more elegance in the bathroom, the best “rainfall” shower head is definitely the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004ZP97BO/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Moen &#8211; Velocity Rainshower</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>A shower head is a simple thing. This is the kind of household fixture that’s usually only replaced in time of need. Sometimes they break, sometimes they get clogged with scale to a point where you can’t clean them anymore. Despite how frequently we use them, most people don&#8217;t spend much time thinking about their shower head.</p>
<p>If you’re like us, though, you’ve probably stood under your aging-but-functional shower and wondered “is there a better shower head out there?”</p>
<p>We looked hard at the long list of bathroom fixtures on the market, and after spending some time in <a href="http://www.fergusonshowrooms.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ferguson’s showroom</a> full of large, designer-focused options, we found that the broadest differences in shower heads comes down to aesthetics.</p>
<p>If you’re working with an interior designer or contractor to set up a new or remodeled bathroom, you can pay a few hundred dollars for a basic bathroom fixture setup (matching sink, tub and shower included), a few more hundred for a premium set in a designer finish, or thousands if you want a look from European design houses like <a href="https://www.grohe.us/en_us/bathroom/shower-collections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grohe</a>.</p>
<p>What we didn’t find was a lot of differentiation in function. Even the top-end shower fixtures tend to use familiar design considerations. Shower heads are generally round and spray as much water as they’re allowed by water-conservation regulations. Handheld shower sprayers mostly sit in cradles. Nozzles are now made of silicone or other clog-resistant materials.</p>
<p><strong>So, while you may want to call a plumbing distributor if you want a very particular look (or especially if you need a replacement shower head that matches an existing tub set) we payed more attention to customer feedback for popular and economical options that you’d find in a home improvement store.</strong></p>
<p>We looked at handheld shower heads, fixed shower heads, variable-pattern and even a ones with a flexible gooseneck.</p>
<p>Amazon ratings were, as always, important guides for our choices. We looked at fixtures recommended by <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/products/showerhead/recommendations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Reports</a> and online review sites like <a href="http://thesweethome.com/reviews/the-best-shower-head/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sweet Home</a>, and we payed attention to brands referenced in plumbing discussion boards and places like the subreddit /r/HomeImprovement. Our focus was on hardware from established manufacturers, but we did try some well-reviewed budget brands as well.</p>

<p>A standard shower head is a relatively simple affair: it attaches to a shower arm (the water pipe that comes out from your wall, always with a ½” male pipe thread on the end) and directs water with some combination of spray nozzles into an efficient, cleansing stream.</p>
<p>There are a multitude of shower head styles and finishes available for a multitude of tastes, but in our research and testing we narrowed our picks down to two categories: shower heads for people who want a detachable hand-sprayer, and shower heads for people who don’t. Since the best fixed shower head is pretty pricey, we also included a recommendation for the best budget-friendly fixture.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Handheld sprayer</h3>
<p>Shower heads with a handheld sprayer will be especially appealing to anyone with small children or pets: rinsing a toddler’s hair or washing a dog is far, far easier with the extra control. The flexibility also makes rinsing your shower walls quick and easy, and you’ll probably find even more uses (like washing your feet or hand-washing clothes). Even if this is a feature you’ve never considered, once you try it you might not be able to go back.</p>
<h3>Adjustable spray patterns</h3>
<p>Multi-pattern shower heads add a twist to the spout-on-the-wall design. If you want a tighter high-pressure stream, a pulsating massage stream or a rainfall-like laminar flow, many shower heads aim to offer variety in your showering experience.</p>
<p>This becomes an especially important feature in water-conserving heads that put out less than 2.5 gallons per minute. If you have long or thick hair you might find a higher-pressure burst helps you rinse more thoroughly. <strong>Most of the variable-spray-pattern fixed shower heads we tested offer just those two patterns (wide coverage and concentrated blast) but the handhelds offer more options. </strong></p>
<h3>Style options</h3>
<p>Shiny, easy-to-clean chrome is by far the most popular finish in American bathrooms, but some have brushed, bronze, or other finishes and you will need to find a new head in something that matches. If your tub spout and valve handle aren’t mirror-finished, check out our chart to see which shower heads come with other finish options.</p>
<h3>WaterSense water conserving design</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.epa.gov/watersense/how-we-use-water" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The EPA says</a> that in 2016, American households used an average of 60 gallons of water every day in their showers.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of water, and it used to be even more. “Water conserving” shower heads are broadly defined as consuming two and a half gallons per minute; that’s been a national requirement since 1994, but the new <a href="https://www.epa.gov/watersense" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WaterSense recommendation</a> is 20% less, just two gallons-per-minute with 80 PSI water supply pressure. WaterSense is a voluntary EPA standard that encourages everyone to save water, but <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/water-efficient-plumbing-fixtures635433474.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California, Georgia, Texas and Colorado have passed laws that require those savings</a>.</p>
<h3>A note about water pressure</h3>
<p>WaterSense is a standard that’s supposed to save water “without sacrificing performance”, so theoretically manufacturers can’t just put flow restrictors in old heads… but for all intents and purposes, that’s what many of them do. 80 PSI is plenty of pressure, so it’s easy to get some force behind a spray that will compensate for the reduced overall flow.</p>
<p>One of the confusing parts of the regulation, then, is how it impacts those with supply lower than what’s given in the standard. 80 PSI isn’t crazy-high, but pressure in the real world of plumbing is variable. Plumbers we talked to say that 40-70 PSI is typical, but if you’re in an apartment on a top floor you might be on the lower end (it’ll also be even less if everyone in your building showers at the same time). Low pressure means less flow than even the water conservation engineers intended.</p>
<p>Many who live with low water pressure will look for shower heads that use a rubber or plastic flow restrictor sitting in the neck of the shower and remove it to increase flow. (It seems to be an often-searched “feature” among Amazon reviews.) Obviously, that’s not what was intended by the design, and we can’t say we recommend it.</p>
<p>Instead, <strong>we looked at shower heads that would still perform well with only mediocre supply pressure.</strong> We can’t say precisely what our testing pressure was for each head because, like many, we suffered from pressure fluctuations. Both bathrooms we tested in were within the “normal” 40-70 range most of the time.</p>
<p>We tried some force-measuring jigs and other methods of deriving a definitive set of measurements for shower performance, but at the end of our testing we decided that the most important qualities came from the way the water is shaped and spread, and those qualities are difficult to assign a number to.</p>
<p>We are well aware that many people will pick a gallon-guzzler over a modern water-saving design, but if you’re buying locally in an area that requires a 2.0 GPM flow rate then it won’t help you much if we’re favoring high-flow shower heads on our chart. We included shower heads from both groups in our testing to get a sense of what’s available, but our picks are either WaterSense compliant or, in the case of the Moen Velocity, at least available in a compliant model.</p>

<p>We used each of these shower heads in an alternating cycle for two months across two test bathrooms. Testers gave us feedback on how much they liked the spray pattern and the construction of each shower head. We also looked at ease of use, including installation and cleaning.</p>
<h3>Spray and coverage</h3>
<p>This is our rating of what the shower head does and how well it does it, but there are a number of different factors involved.</p>
<p>Coverage isn’t the strictest requirement in rinsing performance, but most people will prefer a full-coverage spray to a narrow-coverage stream. All of the adjustable-pattern heads feature at least one wide-coverage pattern.</p>
<p>Sometimes this is accomplished with a cone-shaped pattern, other times the head itself is made extra-wide to get more coverage. Generally, a cone-shaped spray will use water more efficiently, while the wide head designs will need to divide the available water pressure among more nozzles (and thus seem weak when the designer has to restrict the flow to meet efficiency standards). If you can mount your shower head up high, though, the wide-coverage heads can provide a pleasant “rainfall” effect that some people prefer.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p><strong>The factors that distinguish the good design from bad are often difficult to reduce to numbers, but one way to think about good design is to ask “how much do I have to think about this object in order to use it?”</strong></p>
<p>Some examples of good design that we saw include: a magnetic dock that basically attaches itself, a lever that intuitively and smoothly adjust pressure and a simple slotted plastic faceplate that creates a great spray pattern with far fewer parts than any of the other shower heads.</p>
<p>Easy cleaning is another attribute of good design. Silicone nozzles are a wonderful advancement that help prevent scale buildup; however you may find that the simple silicone-nozzle designs (like the AKADY and WantBa fixtures) force you to use a bristle or other small scrubber to get between all of those tiny nozzles.</p>
<p>The good designs, like the Moen heads, at least sink the nozzles behind the chrome faceplate so you can easily wipe it off when you’re cleaning. The flat face of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LGHPMF4/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Speakman Reaction</a> really is marvellously simple to clean, no nozzles to maneuver around, just wipe with a towel or sponge.</p>
<h3>Quality</h3>
<p>Materials, well-fitting parts and refined finishes are all attributes we considered when ranking these shower heads. A plastic shower head may do the job, but nobody disputes that a metal body looks better and inspires confidence about longevity.</p>
<p>Mirror-plated fixtures shouldn’t be cleaned with abrasives the way brushed stainless can be, so we didn’t deliberately try to scratch any of these finishes. We did try to assess how long we think the plating will stand up to regular cleaning, though.</p>
<h3>Easy installation/removal</h3>

<p>There’s typically only one threaded joint involved in a shower-head installation, but not every threaded fitting is made equal. Some heads leaked, even with the normal amount of thread-sealing tape.</p>
<p><strong>We prefer fixtures that are designed to be installed or removed with a wrench: two (or more) flat sides on the coupler allow you to get a wrench on securely, especially important if you have to take a fixture off a few years after someone’s made it too tight.</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t have a wrench handy when you’re installing a shower head then you might complain about user-hostile design, but if there’s no way to get a wrench on, you might have no way to tighten or loosen the shower head without tearing into the coupler with pliers or a scary pipe wrench.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-handheld">Best handheld: Moen &#8211; Magnetix Attract</h2>

<p>This is a great showerhead on all counts. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DVS40TE/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Moen &#8211; Magnetix Attract</a> handheld shower head has a good spray pattern, is easy to use and comes at a great price.</p>
<p>With good coverage and enough variety in the adjustable patterns to give the essentials (without getting into anything like pulsating jets) the Magnetix Attract made the most of its water-conserving 2.0 GPM flow rate. The rotary selector works reliably even with wet hands and better than the other shower heads in this category.</p>
<p>Aside from being a great shower head, the magnetic dock really made this handheld a pleasure to use. The magnet holds everything in place with just the right amount of force; engagement is satisfying and positive but without enough impact that you’re worried about something breaking. Removing the head is easy, but it won’t fall off accidentally.</p>

<p>The magnet may seem like a gimmick at first, but if you’re kneeling next to your tub bathing a child you might be able to detach and re-attach the hand sprayer from the magnetic dock without standing up — something that’s just not possible with the cradle-style retaining clips used by most handheld sprayers.</p>
<p>We looked at a number of other magnetic-docking shower heads, and the Moen was the most economical while also being the easiest to use.</p>
<p>Installation was easy, with rubber gaskets provided by the manufacturer that made all the joints leak-free when tightened by hand. (Even without thread tape!) As mentioned above, we prefer using a wrench for installation, but the Moen system worked well.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Moen’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DVS40TE/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Magnetix Attract shower head</a> is everything you need in an affordable shower head: good spray patterns, easy to install and WaterSense-compliant.</li>
<li>The magnetic dock feature is remarkable. Once you try it, it’s hard to go back to cradle-style hangers.</li>
<li>Even if you don’t think you need a handheld shower sprayer, at less than $50 this is probably your best buy.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004ZP97BO/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Moen &#8211; Velocity Rainshower</a> is a premium bathroom fixture that happened to sneak into our testing lineup. Consumer Reports picked this fixture as their favorite, and we agree that it’s a great piece of hardware.</p>
<p>Often there isn’t much difference between a designer shower head and one you might find for cheap a home improvement store. In this case, we felt that the design quality really merits some consideration.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004ZP97BO/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/moen-velocity-rainshower-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/moen-velocity-rainshower-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/moen-velocity-rainshower-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/moen-velocity-rainshower-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/moen-velocity-rainshower-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/moen-velocity-rainshower-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/moen-velocity-rainshower-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/moen-velocity-rainshower-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/moen-velocity-rainshower.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Luxury Pick: Moen - Velocity Rainshower</h3><p>Solid. Luxurious. Elegant. The shower head of everyone's dreams.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004ZP97BO/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Many people have owned adjustable-pattern shower heads and never used the optional spray patterns, and they probably couldn’t tell you if it was easy or difficult to change. Today, with increasing demand for water conservation, adjustable spray patterns are becoming a more important feature, and that also means you could be using the adjustment lever every single time you shower.</p>
<p>The Velocity shower head gives great coverage with the spray set to wide-open: compared to the other “rainfall” style heads, this one actually felt like it was designed to maximize the area it’s covering and give you a gentle, steady flow. When you crank it down with the lever, the water concentrates into a narrow stream that rinses very effectively.</p>
<p>And that’s what set this head apart — not the stream, but the lever.<strong> The adjustment lever system Moen uses on the Velocity is so much smoother and easier to use than the other products in our tests, it’s hard to overstate the difference.</strong></p>
<p>We spent some time in a high-end bathroom fixture showroom to see what was available at the top end. Moen has really brought a top-quality look and feel to a (relatively) affordable price bracket. Yes, it costs almost four times more than our top pick; this isn’t for everyone. But, you might not even find comparable quality in an adjustment system until you’re spending four or five hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Everything else about this shower head is great, too. Installation is easy and leak-free: this coupler is designed for installation with a wrench, which is our preference. The nozzles are easy to clean, and the metal body looks and feels great. (It’s also available in a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019KAIYCG/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">square-corner shape</a> as well as four different colors and finishes.)</p>
<p>Speaking of installation: you can install the Velocity into nearly any shower, but the styling and gentle-rainfall spray pattern are even better when mounted overhead. If you don&#8217;t have a custom overhead shower mount, you can install a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0012C5136/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">solid</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0064TYE9Y/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">adjustable arm</a> that will maximize your rainfall bliss.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Moen &#8211; Velocity Rainshower is elegance and refinement epitomized. It’s a bit pricey compared to our other picks, but with an entirely different class of build and design quality.</li>
<li>If you want to endure the extra work of adding a height-adjustable arm to get your shower head directly above you instead of at an angle, this is the fixture to get.</li>
<li>This is the kind of shower head you don’t have to ask questions about or second-guess: everything works smoothly and perfectly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Speakman is a line better known among contractors and installers than among the big-box-store DIYers, but their products have a good reputation for reliability and performance within a very reasonable pricetag: the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LGHPMF4/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Reaction shower head</a> is a great example.</p>
<p><strong>This is the only single-pattern shower head we tested that complies with the strict two-gallon-per-minute WaterSense standard, and it was better than all the rest.</strong> The flow gives a good compromise between efficiency, comfort and effective rinsing. If you’re looking for a simple shower fixture that will cut back on your water use, this is a great choice on a budget.</p>

The Reaction has only one spray pattern, but it's probably the best we've used.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LGHPMF4/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Installation and cleaning were simple tasks without problems, and the nozzle design looks relatively immune to scale buildup.</p>
<p>The build of this fixture relies on plastic parts (as do most of the shower heads in the under-$100 price range). Instead of hiding the plastic behind a cheap fake-metallic plating, Speakman features the material proudly with a disc of transparent colored plastic. (Available in three colors.)</p>
[Note: We bought this shower head for $19.49, and at time of publication it’s listing at most online retailers for $25.99. If you can’t find it at that price or lower, its value starts to slip relative to some of the other heads we tested. We like this shower head for what it is, but if you want to spend more than $30, an adjustable-pattern head might make more sense.]
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Speakman’s Reaction fixed shower head delivers the essentials: one pattern that does it all, without wasting water, every time.</li>
<li>A unique design that uses slotted plastic instead of nozzles, available in three tasteful colors.</li>
<li>If you can get it for less than $25, this is a real bargain.</li>
</ul>

<h3>AKDY &#8211; AZ-6021</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003064FXY/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AKDY &#8211; AZ-6021</a> offers an avant-garde style that might look great in your shower, but otherwise it was fairly unremarkable. If your water pressure is good, it will allow plenty of water to flow through, but not with any pressurization or rinse-assisting pattern.</p>
<p>With the optional extension arm this eight inch square head would give you a basic “rainfall” experience, but in our testing that’s actually not as amazing or luxurious as it sounds. The price is good, though.</p>
<h3>WantBa &#8211; Rainfall shower head</h3>
<p>Like the AKDY head, but round. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00W0QH1L8/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wantba&#8217;s Rainfall Shower Head</a> is a shower fixture you’d probably want if you’re going for a specific look on a budget, rather than performance requirements. At 2.5 GPM it’s not exactly drenching you with water, but with normal or high supply pressure it&#8217;s sufficient flow.</p>
<h3>American Standard &#8211; Easy Clean Shower Head</h3>
<p>The best thing about the single-function <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002JOR0EO/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">American Standard Easy Clean Shower Head</a> is definitely the price. If you don’t need any special features or have any aesthetic concerns, this is a solidly-built shower head that will keep doing its job for a very long time. Undoubtedly, this is a product aimed at apartment complex owners and institutional maintenance departments that want something simple, reliable and without any fancy features to troubleshoot.</p>
<p>For about twelve dollars more, though, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LGHPMF4/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Speakman Reaction shower head</a> is superior in every way.</p>
<h3>Waterpik &#8211; Aquascape AST-233E</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SRSXJYG/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Waterpik Aquascape</a> is a fixed shower head with adjustable flow that’s aimed at DIYers more than professional installers, and the design definitely makes a statement.</p>
<p>Waterpik optimizes the wide-head experience by lengthening the circle into a vertical oval, since most people will be installing this head on a 45° angle instead of directly overhead with a custom installation or extension arm. This means that the spray is actually aimed at the body of the shower user, instead of spraying in an arbitrary circle or square pattern like the other “rainfall” heads.</p>
<p>If you move a slide-through selector in the neck you can switch the spray from maximum coverage to maximum pressure for more effective rinsing. The selector seems durable and reliable, but it’s not as nice to use as some of the other selector mechanisms we tested. In a guest shower there’s little chance anyone would even realize it’s there. That said, if you want a water-saving shower head, but need extra rinsing power for long or thick hair, the feature works.</p>
<p>We were happy with the Aquascape, but for the money it’s not doing anything more than it needs to. If the flow-selector switch were a little more intuitive, this probably would have been a recommended fixture. As it is, we’d rather put the Magnetix in every shower.</p>
<h3>Delta &#8211; 75152 shower head with H2Okinetic</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000LV7W4K/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Delta&#8217;s 75152 is called a “single-function” shower head</a>, but it lets you adjust (restrict) the flow from a 2.5-GPM sprinkle to a focused 1.8-GPM blast. Adjustment is via a rotating ‘paddle’ adjuster on the side of the head.</p>
<p>The adjustment is handy if you need some extra force for rinsing, but unlike the WaterSense-compliant shower heads this one is using an extra half-gallon of water every minute when it&#8217;s on full-coverage mode, and still not really providing a really satisfying flow.</p>
<h3>Speakman &#8211; S-2005-HB-#2 Hotel Anystream</h3>
<p>Speakman makes good shower heads, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018LGZ04/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hotel Anystream</a> has a lot going for it: a nice look that will work in any bathroom, good build quality and features that make sense. Like the other water-conserving fixed shower heads, this one offers adjustment between wider coverage and a more concentrated stream.</p>
<p>The Hotel Anystream isn’t a bad shower head, but it’s not our first pick for anything in particular.</p>
<h3>Waterpik &#8211; PowerSpray+ FlexNeck</h3>
<p>This was, without a doubt, the most unusual shower head we tested.</p>
<p>Halfway between a fixed head and a handheld sprayer, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IPC1FVW/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Powerspray + FlexNeck</a> allows for fairly easy repositioning to direct water where you need it. This seems like an ideal feature for certain people, like those sharing a shower who are of dramatically different height. The flexible neck is definitely less fiddly than the wingnuts on double-elbow adjustable extension arms typically used to offer the same function.</p>

<p>If you’re currently using an adjustable extension arm, but you hate having to loosen and tighten the joints on that arm, the FlexNeck might be worth checking out as a replacement. On the whole, though, it’s just not as good a shower head as most of the others we tested.</p>
<p>The “Powerspray” pattern wasn’t as nice as anything from our recommended fixtures, and adjusting the pattern you can feel how lightweight and flimsy the head has to be to allow the gooseneck to support it.</p>
<h3>Niagara &#8211; Conservation</h3>
<p>If you need to have a handheld shower head with reasonable build quality for the lowest possible price, Niagara delivers the essentials with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002OSMVE4/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conservation Handheld</a>.</p>
<p>While nothing about this shower head failed or broke when we were using it, it’s definitely on the flimsy side of the build quality spectrum. Plastic body, plastic hose, plastic retaining clip. The threads on the mount-side of this fixture are the right size to screw onto our shower arm, but we needed some generous over-winding with Teflon tape to stop the joint from leaking. The knurled grip on the fitting is tricky to get tight, too, unless you commit to biting into it with channel-lock pliers.</p>
<p>The spray pattern provided by this head is sufficient to get clean, but it has relatively narrow coverage, and a disappointing lack of flow. Like most water-conserving heads, you can switch to a high-pressure stream for better rinsing, but this head shoots six needle-like streams that don’t really blast away shampoo lather the way other shower heads can.</p>
<h3>Ana Bath &#8211; SS5450 Handheld Shower</h3>
<p>Ana Bath has a good shower fixture in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0043BEUXK/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SS5450 Handheld</a>. We were impressed by the attention to detail in the packaging, with plugs and caps for each fitting to protect threads and plating during shipping. There was also detailed accounting of all the gaskets and where they need to be installed.</p>
<p>The Ana Bath fixture provides a good spray pattern and relatively easy-to-use control of all functions. The handheld spray head feels well-built, and the nozzles are easy to clean.</p>
<p>We didn’t pick this shower fixture for two reasons. First, we found the fixed wall-mount head entirely redundant. If you need both heads to go at once (if you’re doubling up your showers and don’t want to share your water, maybe,) you might prefer this design.</p>
<p>Second, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DVS40TE/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Magnetix docking system on our top pick</a> is just <em>so much better</em>. Once you go magnetic it’s hard to go back (especially since the Ana Bath fixture costs 25% more, and we didn’t find an Ana Bath model that conforms to the WaterSense standard.)</p>
<h3>Hydroluxe &#8211; Full-Chrome 24 Function Ultra-Luxury</h3>
<p>Hydroluxe&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JUZTG4M/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">24-function Ultra-Luxury Handheld</a> achieves a good balance of features, build quality and price. Like the Ana Bath model, we found that this 2.5 GPM fixture provided good flow patterns that make for a refreshing shower.</p>
<p>While this shower head represents a reasonable compromise of features and price, it can’t really compete with the build quality and ease of use of our top pick, Moen’s Magnetix Attract.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The best shower head we tested is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DVS40TE/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Moen’s Magnetix Attract Six-Function Handheld Shower Head</a>. With a great water-saving spray pattern, this shower head can easily handle most users’ daily needs, and a high-pressure spray pattern fills in for more forceful rinsing requirements.</p>
<p>Not everyone will be considering a handheld shower, but for the price it’s better than all the other shower heads we tested. The removeable head is a game-changer if you ever bathe a child or pet. <strong>The magnetic dock might seem like a luxury perk, but it really does make using the shower much easier.</strong></p>
<p>For those whose bathroom decor clashes with hoses and magnetic docks, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004ZP97BO/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Velocity shower head</a> (also from Moen) is a classy upgrade in looks as well as build quality. Just turning the adjustment lever tells you all you need to know. This shower head is masterfully designed and a pleasure to use. With adjustment between a full-coverage sprinkle and a high-pressure blast, we didn’t feel like the Velocity shower head was sacrificing shower performance for water conservation.</p>
<p>And for those who don’t want to spend a lot of money or worry about extraneous features, we really have to give full marks to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LGHPMF4/?tag=ybdshwr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Speakman Reaction fixed shower head</a>. If you only have one pattern to work with, it needs to be a good one, and we think Speakman has come up with a near-perfect balance of coverage, force and water conservation.</p>
