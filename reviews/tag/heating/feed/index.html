								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter many hours of research and two months of testing, our recommendation for the best heating pad is the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000ZHJS0G/?tag=ybdheatp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Thermophore &#8211; MaxHEAT.</a> It pulls moisture from the atmosphere for a deeper penetrating heat without your needing to wet the pad before use. Combined with a large coverage area, evenly weighted pad and the ability to reach high heat levels, the Thermophore was the clear winner. Our runner-up is the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003DQGKFM/?tag=ybdheatp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Chattanooga &#8211; Theratherm</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-found">How we found the winner</h2>
<p>We found a surprising lack of heating pad reviews conducted on review sites, so we first delved into articles on heat therapy at Consumer Reports and Doctor Oz. Once we felt confident in the science behind heat therapy and how to use it best, we headed over to Reddit forums like /r/fitness/ and /r/chronicpain/ to see which heating pad features are most important to consumers.</p>
<p>Finally, we read through customer reviews on Amazon to get the perspective of actual users. Each of our finalists has more than 500 reviews and some run into the thousands, so we had an abundance of input from consumers.</p>

<h2 id="why-use">Why use a heating pad?</h2>
<p>A heating pad provides palliative therapy without the need for messy creams or uncomfortable patches. Palliative care is a holistic approach to managing chronic pain, often caused by serious illness. Heat therapy is one way to manage pain, chronic or otherwise.</p>
<p>Heating pads are recommended for aches and pains and can help relieve pain in those suffering from arthritis, a sore back or menstrual cramps. Heat can also help an injury heal faster. It dilates blood vessels so that tissues receive increased blood flow, oxygen and nutrients. Heating pads can also be used purely for comfort.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Fast heating: </strong>The faster the heating pad reaches your desired temperature, the sooner you’ll experience relief.</p>
<p><strong>Machine washable:</strong> The last thing you want (especially if you’re injured) is a complicated wash routine to care for your heating pad.</p>
<p><strong>Number of settings:</strong> When choosing a heating pad, consider whether your purpose calls for a simple or more complicated setting. For example, if you are treating an injury, you may wish to set the exact amount of time and level of heat. Some people only need high and low settings, while others require more precise settings.</p>
<p><strong>Controller style:</strong> Those suffering from arthritis may prefer a slide controller. If you are looking to control the exact level of heat, a digital type can do just that.</p>
<p><strong>Moist heat:</strong> Moist heat allows for deeper heat penetration to aid healing.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort/soft material:</strong> When cozying up with a heating pad for comfort, you want a soft material that feels nice against your skin.</p>
<p><strong>Auto-off/timer function/options:</strong> Heat treatments can range from 15 minutes to two hours. Heating pads with a timer function are best for those using intense heat levels. For comfort measures that include sitting with a pad for a longer period of time, automatic shut-off features become important.</p>
<p><strong>Ease of use:</strong> Regardless of why you&#8217;re using it, a heating pad should be easy to use.</p>

<h3>Comfort/Heat transfer</h3>
<p>One of the first things we learned during our research phase is that you should never sit on or against the heating pad (all these years, we’ve been doing it wrong). It&#8217;s dangerous, because you could crush the pad and damage the wires. Thus, a heating pad&#8217;s design is extremely important.</p>
<p>The heating pad should have enough weight and flexibility to drape over your body in order to provide the most pain relief. The weight allows for more direct contact with the heating pad and therefore more effective heat transfer.</p>
<p>The Thermophore has evenly distributed weights for effective heat transfer without your sitting against the pad. The Chattanooga is also weighted, although the weights are distributed in a thick coil that did not contour to body shape as well as the Thermophore.</p>
<p>The other electric heating pads we tested only had the weight of a throw blanket; they were comfortable but did not have the impact of the weighted Thermophore and Chattanooga. The Sunbeam &#8211; Moist/Dry Heat was stiff and inflexible, so the heat transfer was lower than the other models. The Carex &#8211; Bed Buddy and Sunny Bay &#8211; Neck Heating Wrap were naturally heavy since they&#8217;re filled with flax seeds and/or rice, so they both draped nicely and effectively transferred heat.</p>
<p>A soft, plush fabric makes for the most comforting heating pad. We found the Sunbeam &#8211; XpressHeat and Pure Enrichment &#8211; PureRelief XL were the nicest to curl up with, thanks to their super soft microplush fabric.</p>
<p>During the course of writing this article, we reached out to someone with a recent back injury. We had him try out the eight finalists and asked his opinion on which heating pad provided the most relief. His answer was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000ZHJS0G/?tag=ybdheatp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermophore,</a> because of its moist heat, contoured drape and just the right amount of weight.</p>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7291" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/usability-chart.png" alt="usability comparison chart" width="1801" height="1467" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/usability-chart.png 1801w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/usability-chart-610x497.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/usability-chart-1500x1222.png 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/usability-chart-768x626.png 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/usability-chart-885x721.png 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/usability-chart-300x244.png 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/usability-chart-295x240.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/usability-chart-1000x815.png 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/usability-chart-360x293.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/usability-chart-375x305.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/usability-chart-414x337.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/usability-chart-320x261.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/usability-chart-768x626@2x.png 1536w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/usability-chart-300x244@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Factors that determine the usability of a heating pad are size, cord length and controller style. You also want a controller that’s simple to use and easy to set, especially if you have pain in your hands. Cord length is an important factor, because a longer cord means you can reach electric sockets more easily.</p>
<p>Since the most usable products are easy to clean, we looked at the care, construction and washability of the heating-pad finalists. All of the electric heating pads were easy to clean. The Thermophore, Chattanooga and Sunbeam &#8211; Moist/Dry Heat all have a removable, machine-washable cover and heating unit that can be wiped clean if necessary. The one-piece models like the Sunbeam &#8211; XpressHeat, Pure Enrichment and SoftHeat are also machine washable. You just throw the entire heating unit in the washer. The Carex &#8211; Bed Buddy and Sunny Bay &#8211; Neck Heating Wrap are wipe-clean only.</p>
<p>At first, we thought that the large size of the Thermophore would mean that you could share it with a partner. Consumers do mention sharing (often with pets, surprisingly) a heating pad in their reviews, although it&#8217;s hard to tell whether they are talking about taking turns or using it together. We quickly found that even 14 by 24 inches isn’t large enough to share. For sharing, we recommend an electric throw blanket like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0088AHJ8A/?tag=ybdheatp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sunbeam &#8211; Heated Throw</a> which we tested while searching for the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-electric-blanket/#the-best-throw" rel="noopener">best electric blanket</a>.</p>
<h3>Heating capabilities &amp; safety features</h3>

<p>In order to test the heating capabilities of the pads, we first used an infrared thermometer to measure the temperature of each heating pad at its highest setting. We let the heating pad warm up for 10 minutes and then took several readings, recording the highest one. Then we let the pad cool off before the timed test, where we recorded how many seconds it took to reach its highest temperature.</p>
<p>For the microwavable heating pads, we warmed them per the manufacturer’s instructions and then measured the temperature immediately after removing it from the microwave.</p>
<p>The Thermophore and Chattanooga both reached the highest temperatures, but it took significantly longer (nearly four minutes) for the Chattanooga to heat up. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KVYTV86/?tag=ybdheatp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pure Enrichment</a> was the fastest to heat up, but it also had one of the lowest maximum-temperature thresholds.</p>
<p>We also checked to see how much surface area heats up by seeing if all four corners and the middle of the pad were warm to the touch after reaching its high temperature. Then we used each finalist as directed to see whether they felt warm enough to be comforting and to make sure they weren’t uncomfortably warm. At its highest setting of 166 °F, the Chattanooga was too hot to handle, but you could lower it incrementally by degrees until it reached a more reasonable level.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.healthline.com/health/pain-relief/how-to-make-a-homemade-heating-pad#1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Nathan Wei</a>, head of the Arthritis Treatment Center, “moist heat penetrates better than dry heat.” The majority of our heating pad finalists featured moist heat therapy, but we weren’t fans until we tried the moist heat feature on the the Thermophore and Chattanooga heating pads. Both of these models pull moisture from the air and direct it toward your skin without an additional step. While we could feel the deeper heat, we were at first leery of this claim.</p>
<p>However, we found the most humid spot in the house (the bathroom) and placed the Thermophore and Chattanooga on a porcelain surface to see if any moisture was visible on the pad or the counter. In this test, the surface under the pad was visibly wet after a few minutes with a hot shower running, so we knew that the pads had in fact pulled moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Consumers have reported that the Thermophore can draw in moisture even in an arid climate with humidity at five percent or less. The same is true of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KBNPQ0/?tag=ybdheatp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carex</a>, which delivers moist heat without adding water. (All of the other finalists required us to add water for moist heat therapy.)</p>
<p>The Sunbeam &#8211; Moist/Dry Heat has a foam pad that you moisten and place inside the cover. The Sunbeam &#8211; XpressHeat, Pure Enrichment, Sunny Bay and SoftHeat can be sprayed with water until damp. With these type of products, we came away with damp clothing and furniture which was less than desirable, mitigating the benefits of moist heat.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we tested the safety features to see if each pad automatically shut off as advertised. We found that the Sunbeam &#8211; Moist/Dry Heat did not turn off after two hours, although it supposedly has an automatic shut-off feature. All the others’ safety features worked as advertised and shut off at the specified time.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://burncentrecare.co.uk/about_burned_skin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Burn Centre Care</a>, temperatures as low as 43º C (109.4ºF) can cause burns if exposure lasts for five or six hours. Nearly all of our models tested above 109.4ºF, so the automatic shut off feature is extremely important. As always, you should follow all the instructions in the manual to be safe.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000ZHJS0G/?tag=ybdheatp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermophore &#8211; MaxHEAT</a> was our top choice in heating pads. This heating pad reaches intense heat levels and automatically turns off after 25 minutes of continuous use, so it’s a better option for palliative therapy rather than for a simple comfort measure. It reaches its peak temperature in under three minutes and reaches intense heat levels without getting uncomfortably warm.</p>

<p>It has a two-piece construction, with a removable and machine washable cover. The cover features their patented Moist-Sure technology for enhanced heat penetration. With a six-foot cord, it comfortably reached several different spots in our test living room. The slide control is easy to operate and would be especially convenient if you have arthritis. It has three settings for flexibility.</p>
<p>This heating pad was also the best heating pad for for back pain. The large size covers the entire back or abdomen, so you can treat your whole back without needing to adjust the position of the heating pad. It also extends from the hip to knee if you wish to relieve IT band pain. The rugged construction combined with flexibility and weight really makes this heating pad stand out from the competition.</p>
<p>The Thermophire is designed with weights that are evenly distributed throughout the heating pad for the right amount of heft to contour to your body shape and maximize heat transfer. At the same time, the weights were small enough that you can’t feel them when the heating pad is draped over your body and the fleece cover is comfortably soft.</p>

<p>If you are looking for precise control over your heat therapy, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003DQGKFM/?tag=ybdheatp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chattanooga &#8211; Theratherm</a> is the heating pad for you. You can set the temperature to the exact degree that works best and the exact amount of time that you want heat within given ranges. The heat settings range from 113 degrees Fahrenheit at the lowest setting to 166 °F at the highest.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003DQGKFM/?tag=ybdheatp-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chattanooga-theratherm-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chattanooga-theratherm-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chattanooga-theratherm-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chattanooga-theratherm-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chattanooga-theratherm-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chattanooga-theratherm-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chattanooga-theratherm-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chattanooga-theratherm-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chattanooga-theratherm.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Runner-up: Chattanooga - Theratherm</h3><p>Control is at your fingertips with a unique digital control pad and precise settings.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003DQGKFM/?tag=ybdheatp-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>You can also toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius settings. Plus, you can set the amount of heating time from one to 60 minutes. Some users found the minimum setting to still be too hot for their needs. We disagreed, finding instead that the lower end of the temperature range was relaxing and comforting, but the higher end of the range was uncomfortably hot.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve achieve your desired settings, you can enter lock-out mode so you don’t accidentally change anything while using the pad. Although the number of options aren’t infinite, it certainly gave us more flexibility and precise control than any other heating pad we tested. On the other hand, the controller was less intuitive than the others, and we found we had to consult the manual for step-by-step instructions.</p>
<p>The Chattanooga automatically gathers moisture from the air, which feels similar to fabric that is damp from the dryer. It didn’t transfer to our clothes or upholstery, but we&#8217;re glad the cover is also removable and washable. This model is also weighted, although the weights are focused mainly through the center of the pad. While it does provide effective heat transfer, it isn’t contoured to your body. We tested the medium size, but it&#8217;s also available in small and large sizes.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>

<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003DQGKFM/?tag=ybdheatp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chattanooga &#8211; Theratherm</a> extracts moisture from the air and retains it in a soft flannel cover for simple and convenient moist heating therapy.</li>
<li>Incredibly precise digital controls allow you to set the heating pad anywhere from 113 °F to 166 °F and the time for anywhere from one to 60 minutes.</li>
<li>The lock-out feature of the control pad prevents you from accidentally changing your preferred settings during a session.</li>

<p>If you’re looking for a heating pad that doesn’t require electricity, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KBNPQ0/?tag=ybdheatp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carex &#8211; Bed Buddy</a> for its design, drape and moist heat. Weighing two pounds, the Carex was just the right weight: heavy enough to transfer heat, but not so heavy that it became uncomfortable after several minutes of use. Priced at around eight dollars (at the time of publishing), it is by far the least expensive of our finalists.</p>
<p>Over 1,000 Amazon reviewers rate this model 4.4 stars on average, and we agree that it offers a lot of bang for your buck. It is filled with 100% organic materials: natural grains, herbs and flowers. The Carex provides moist heating without adding additional water or getting too wet. If you’re alternating hot and cold treatments, this is a great option, because it’s both microwavable and freezable.</p>
<p>We weren’t really sure how the rope handles added to the design; we would have preferred the extra length over the seemingly unnecessary handles. Another downside (to both our non-electric finalists) is that it has a cooked, popcorn-like odor when heated. We didn’t feel it detracted too much from the benefits, but if you have sensitivity to smell, these models may not be for you.</p>
<h3>Sunbeam &#8211; XpressHeat</h3>

<p>When you need relief fast, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005NZ66KU/?tag=ybdheatp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sunbeam &#8211; XpressHeat</a> provides heat you can feel in 30 seconds. In our testing, we found that while it takes nearly five minutes to reach its peak temperature, it is warm to the touch almost immediately. The king size is convenient for covering large areas like spine or shoulders.</p>
<p>With six heat settings and a digital display, you can get a precise temperature that best fits your needs and comfort zone. At the same time, it’s simple enough to figure out without consulting the user’s guide. It has a heat meter that lights up the controller as the pad heats up, so you know when it’s ready. You can toggle between automatic shut off at two hours or the stay on option, which is a neat feature.</p>
<p>In general, heating pads tend to be utilitarian-looking, but the reversible olive green and camel colors of this heating pad are actually pleasing to the eye. The microplush fabric of the integrated cover is both comforting and gentle on sensitive areas. It’s flexible but very light, so it’s a better option for comfort than heat therapy. Overall, it looks and feels more like a miniature throw blanket than a heating pad.</p>

<p>A comparable heating pad is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HYBPFCG/?tag=ybdheatp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pure Enrichment &#8211; PureRelief XL</a>, with soft microplush fabric for comfort and a large size for maximum coverage. It is fast-heating, reaching its peak temperature in just over two minutes (although at 112ºF, its high temperature is on the low end compared to our other finalists). You can use a spray bottle to dampen the pad for moist heating therapy.</p>
<p>The digital LCD controller has six settings and the option to choose whether you want it to stay on or to shut off automatically after two hours. With a nine-foot power cord, you don’t have to worry about awkwardly reaching around furniture. It also comes with a storage pad to keep it clean and safe in between uses.</p>

<p>As the maker of our top choice for an electric blanket, we were excited to try another one of their products. Unfortunately, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FFSD1S/?tag=ybdheatp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SoftHeat &#8211; MaxHeat</a> isn’t designed with the features that make their electric blanket a winner: <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-electric-blanket/#AC-vs-conversion" rel="noopener">DC power</a>, invisible wires and plush fabric.</p>
<p>What we do like about this model is the SmartHeat technology, which provides consistent heat (rather than the typical spikes and valleys) for maximum therapeutic heat. We verified this when testing wattage with an electricity usage monitor. With the other models, the wattage would rise and fall, but it was the same wattage across the board with the SoftHeat.</p>
<p>The SoftHeat is specifically designed to wrap around the lower back. A nice feature to this model is that it secures with velcro, so it’s the only electric heating pad finalist we tested that can be worn rather than draped. It’s simple to unplug and plug back in while fastened around you, although the heat doesn’t last more than a few minutes.</p>
<h3>Sunny Bay &#8211; Neck Heating Wrap</h3>

<p>Ergonomically designed for the neck and shoulders, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NOW8T1I/?tag=ybdheatp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sunny Bay &#8211; Neck Heating Wrap</a> can also be used on the arms, legs or other areas. It&#8217;s a soft, comfortable and portable option for applying heat without electricity. The Sunny Bay is made of non-pill fleece and rice, so you don’t have to worry about cords or controllers. The thick fleece retains the heat, but it can also prevent you from feeling how hot it gets, so you’ll want to exercise caution. We microwaved it at the lowest option and found it comforting but not too hot.</p>
<p>The Sunny Bay is slightly heavy and not broad enough in terms of usage. Acknowledging that this model can be heavy for some, the manufacturer also makes a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B5DW54E/?tag=ybdheatp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">wider and lighter version</a> filled with flax seeds and weighing only two pounds (as opposed to two and a half).</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a simple, budget-friendly heating pad, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00075M1T6/?tag=ybdheatp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sunbeam &#8211; Moist/Dry Heat</a> gets the job done without a lot of extra bells and whistles. It provides moist heat when you wet the removable sponge insert and it features Sunbeam’s patented UltraHeat technology for even, consistent heat.</p>
<p>The heating pad comes with a simple-to-use slide controller that&#8217;s great for arthritis sufferers and has a convenient extra-long power cord . The 12 x 15-inch size is on the small side for treating the whole back, and the plastic heating construction is not as flexible as all of our other finalists.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After using moist heat, it was hard to go back to dry heat only. Our recommended heating pads both feature moist heat therapy without adding water. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000ZHJS0G/?tag=ybdheatp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermophore &#8211; MaxHEAT</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003DQGKFM/?tag=ybdheatp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chattanooga &#8211; Theratherm</a> pull moisture from the air and direct it to where you need it most. While we feel confident recommending either product, the Thermophore pulled ahead with its evenly distributed weights and ability to reach its peak temperature quickly.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e put nine of the top portable heaters to the test and found that the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SVIOFNG/?tag=ybdheat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Vornado &#8211; Vortex Heater</a> is the best space heater out there. The Vornado spreads heat evenly using its patented Whole Room Vortex Heat Circulation system. On top of that, it’s equipped with the most up-to-date safety features — a great precaution, considering over 30% of home heating fires are caused by space heaters. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J8I7472/?tag=ybdheat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Holmes &#8211; Quartz Tower Heater</a> is our cost-effective pick.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>After nine hours of researching top products on Amazon, going through the depths of Reddit and checking out multiple other review sites, it became clear what to look for. We knew that safety was key, so tip-over protection and auto shut-off settings were high on the list (but we know there are some daredevils out there so we threw in a couple dangerous and very affordable heaters).</p>
<p>Then, with both consumer and professional advice in mind, we selected a variety of space heaters under $100 (because who wants to spend more than that on a space heater, we’re trying to save money right?).</p>
<p>Knowing there are different purposes for the heaters, like direct heat or whole-room heat, we put them through a multitude of tests and rating systems. These ranged from heat efficiency to thermostat reliability, mobility to safety precautions. The nine top space heaters were then judged on their performances with an appropriate value attached to each category.</p>

<h2 id="why-a-space-heater?">Why a space heater?</h2>
<p>Ever feel the cold creep up on you no matter how many blankets you put on? And maybe you want to heat the room for more folks than an <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-electric-blanket/" rel="noopener">electric blanket</a> can cover. Or get that unwanted post-shower chill? Well, space heater to the rescue! If you don’t want to spend the average annual cost to heat up your whole house in the U.S. &#8212; <a href="https://energy.gov/articles/energy-saver-101-infographic-home-heating" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$700 using natural gas</a> &#8212; or want to keep your room warm during the night or simply feel some direct heat to get rid of that internal shiver then a space heater is what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>It is pretty well known that keeping your thermostat lower saves you money (they say roughly one to three percent of your heating bill is saved per degree lowered). That said, natural gas is a very low cost energy and a good way to heat up your whole house in general. But if you don’t need to heat your whole house then a space heater for a single room ends up being the cheapest option.</p>
<p>Electric space heaters are nearly 100% energy efficient and very cost-effective forms of heat but will lose their cost-effectiveness if you try to heat more than one or two rooms. To make a comparison using the $700 annual average for home heating, you can heat a living room of around 150 square feet for five months around the clock on full blast using the most cost-effective space heater, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J8I7472/?tag=ybdheat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Holmes Quartz Tower</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s the easy rule of thumb, if you only need one or two rooms heated, then a space heater will be best. But if you need more, stick with central heating. If you are willing to lower your thermostat, only keep the rooms warm you really want and would like to save money by doing so, read on.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-space-heaters">Types of space heaters</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5840" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/four-different-types-1.jpg" alt="The Four Types" width="900" height="596" /></p>
<p><strong>Fan</strong>: Typically used for smaller rooms. They use electricity to heat up a wire element and then use a fan to spread the hot air evenly throughout the room. They provide quick and even heat.</p>
<p><strong>Infrared</strong>: Typically used for larger rooms. They use infrared heating to heat up objects in the room so as to keep the heat from rising to the ceiling and maintain a nice temperature where it will be felt. They provide quick and sustainable heat.</p>
<p><strong>Gas</strong>: Typically used for outdoors or ventilated rooms. It uses natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, butane or propane as the energy source. They usually provide quick, intense heat.</p>
<p><strong>Radiator</strong>: Typically used for larger rooms. They use electricity to heat the oil which causes the hotter oil to run through the cavities &#8212; this process is called convection. Once the oil is heated up it then heats the metal, which in turn heats up the room. They provide slow and sustainable heat.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-look-for">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> With out-of-date space heaters being such a liability when it comes to house fires, you should look for space heaters that have both tip-over protection and overheating auto shut-off mechanisms.</p>
<p>Most space heaters have the overheating precautions but only a select few have tip-over protection &#8212; and that’s the important one. Imagine the heater’s been on for an hour and your dog knocks it over on the carpet unbeknownst to you. With tip-over protection, everything’s fine. Without it, not so fine. You should also pay attention to whether the actual heater gets hot to the touch or the outlet or plug overheat.</p>
<p><strong>Reliable and precise thermostat</strong>: A machine that holds true and remains consistent is nice, but being able to measure the temperature in the room is even nicer. Check if the temperature gauge’s precision is to the degree, five degrees or lacks numerical values entirely.</p>
<p><strong>Heat output</strong>: You’re most likely going to want to use this heater for whole-room heating and direct heating so the ratio will help you decide what matters most. It’s odd to think, but there are different types of heat, some space heaters are better at heating specific areas and some are better at creating an even spreading temperature. It’s also worth considering the lingering heat, which most fan heaters lack but oil-filled and ceramic heaters hold.</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Of course you want to have a high price-to-performance ratio. So, the lower the wattage and the higher the heat output for the same price is where we’re looking. (Spoiler: propane costs a lot more than electricity but is more effective at both direct and room heating.)</p>

<p><strong>Noise</strong>: If a space heater is annoyingly loud, nobody is going to want to use it. Then again, some people enjoy the low white noise certain fans can give off so that’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>Size and portability</strong>: If you want something easily portable, then smaller is obviously better. If you want it to stay put, then you may not mind the 25lbs (though most all heavier models have wheels which allow for easy mobility).</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetic</strong>: If nobody’s going to see it, you may not care. But if you want the space heater to stay put and not stick out like a sore thumb, then you’re going to want something that doesn’t even look like a space heater, but more like a piece of art. And we’ve got a couple that fit the bill (the Lasko 6435 and Dr. Infrared).</p>

<h3>Safety</h3>
<p>Almost all the items we chose claimed to have both tip-over protection and overheating automatic shut-off. So, for all the space heaters that had tip-over protection, we checked the point at which each one was considered “tipping over”, most of them were past a 45-degree angle.</p>

<p>We used a surface thermometer to determine both the surface temperatures after 15 minutes and the temperatures of the plugs after 30 minutes and an hour. We also checked for any smell of burning throughout all the testing (there was none!).</p>
<h3>Heating times</h3>
<p>Our heating tests were divided into three categories. Well, really two categories and one of those had two sub-categories. We tested both localized heat and whole-room heat. For the room sizes we used 400 cubic feet to mimic a bathroom and 900 cubic feet for a bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>Localized heat</strong>: To simulate someone trying to get warm quickly, we used a standard 100% cotton t-shirt and recorded its heat over the course of five minutes with the space heaters three feet away on full blast. We used a closed environment with no drafts or cracks for heat to easily escape or enter through. And with a starting temperature of about 69 degrees Fahrenheit we placed each space heater exactly three feet away and aimed them right at the target.</p>

<p>We then took the temperature of the specified location every minute so you could see the progress. Once the data was recorded the initial settings of the room temperature and the shirt temperature were restored.</p>
<p><strong>400 cubic feet</strong>: For this test we placed four heat sensors evenly around the bathroom with differing heights and distances from the space heater. We also used the Vornado’s thermostat because it is incredibly precise and easy to move. We placed the space heaters on a countertop three feet off the ground in one corner of the bathroom (with a standard eight foot ceiling height). This was to replicate how it would be placed if you were about to shower.</p>
<p>We used a starting bathroom temperature of about 70 degrees and then took temperature readings of the room for 10 minutes in order to depict the trends of the heat. Because the starting temperatures were not exactly the same, we recorded all the sensors’ temperatures and created multiple data points and averaged out the readings. This both reveals the trajectories and show us the beginning and end points which can be easily compared to the others.</p>
<p><strong>900 cubic feet</strong>: This was conducted in a very similar manner to the bathroom test. Only this time we used five heat sensors in the room (again with varying heights and distances from the space heater being tested) as well as the thermostat readings from both the Vornado and Dr. Infrared, which were at opposing areas on the floor of the room.</p>
<p>The space heater being tested was put on the ground at the same spot near the corner of the room. Once the room’s average temperature was around 67 degrees, data was collected for an entire hour. Again the room temperature was taken intermittently so we could evaluate the heat trends of each space heater.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>We checked the wattage for the space heaters to see if the company claims were accurate. They weren’t spot on but this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The heat output was still fairly good even with less than the 1500 watts most of them claimed. We tested the watts on all settings using a Kill A Watt monitor.</p>
<p>Using the amount of watts and a combination of the data from the heat output tests, we calculated which space heater was the most effective at turning your money into heat. Which essentially tells us the most efficient space heater (it’s the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J8I7472/?tag=ybdheat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Holmes &#8211; Quartz Tower Heater</a>).</p>
<p>We also tested the sound output of all the heaters. For this we used a sound decibel meter and recorded the amount of decibels, with a baseline of around 36.5 decibels, so we had something to compare to. We’ve categorized and ranked all the heaters in terms of their sizes, weights, cord lengths (if applicable), ease of use and even reliability and precision of their thermostats. See tables for easier information.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Vornado &#8211; Vortex AVH10</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5867 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/vornado-hero-1-1.jpg" alt="Vornado Vortex" width="900" height="596" /></p>
<p>In determining the best overall space heater, we mainly looked at how well it heated the room. Because space heaters are highly associated with house fires, we also focused on its safety functions. Safety is vital so we gave it much weight when determining the best space heater.</p>
<p>When it came down to it, there was only one space heater that had it all: the best safety functions, a reliable thermostat, could be used for bedrooms, small rooms like bathrooms and large rooms&#8230;and heat them up quickly! It was none other than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SVIOFNG/?tag=ybdheat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vornado &#8211; Vortex Heater</a>.</p>

In our testing, the Vornado proved it can heat up a 900 cubic-foot bedroom over eight degrees Fahrenheit in an hour.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SVIOFNG/?tag=ybdheat-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>We like safe space heaters, especially the tip-over protection feature. The Vornado has a spring-loaded sensor that will turn it off completely if any edge is lifted less than an inch. So if you have kids, pets or are otherwise super busy, the last thing you want to have to worry about is your space heater causing a fire.</p>
<p>The higher price of the Vornado is worth the added safety in our minds. It is worry free and is backed with the longest warranty of the machines we tested &#8212; a five year warranty. Even more, it can be touched or held anywhere even after having been on for an hour on full blast without burning you.</p>
<p>In terms of heating capability, it was the quickest at heating rooms, small and large, of any electric space heater, coming in second in the 900 cubic feet heat only behind the propane-fueled Mr. Heater.</p>
<p><strong>The Vornado came in first in the bathroom test, but</strong> <strong>unfortunately did not perform the best with giving immediate direct heat (it came in fifth)</strong>. That’s because it’s specialty is not in how hot it gets directly in front of the heater, but in the way it spirals the air to generate an even spread of heat throughout the room &#8212; they call it the ‘Whole Room Vortex Heat Circulation’. This heater epitomizes the work smart not hard notion.</p>
<p>As far as looks go, this is the best looking space heater that actually looks like a space heater. The others that scored higher on the aesthetic tests (like Dr. Infrared and the Lasko 6435) only did so because they look more like pieces of art or furniture.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5866" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/vornado-detail-1.jpg" alt="Vornado - Vortex Thermometer" width="900" height="596" /></p>
<p>The Vornado looks like a high-tech and futuristic heater, clean and sleek. And it is easily mobile so it becomes no burden to place away in the closet during the day or move to the bathroom for a shower. The Vornado is almost unbeatable in every category, and in the categories in which it really counts, it blows the others out of the water &#8212; or, if you prefer, it heats the others out of the room!</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SVIOFNG/?tag=ybdheat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vornado &#8211; Vortex AVH10</a> has state of the art safety precautions &#8212; very acute tip-over protection and overheating protection &#8212; that allow you to enjoy the heat instead of worry about it.</li>
<li>It’s precise digital thermostat is top of its class and provides the easiest room-temperature control.</li>
<li>It spreads the heat better than any other electric room heater and is the second most efficient (though the difference is pennies on the hour).</li>
<li>The direct heat output is not incredible, but definitely still feels good on a cold body.</li>

<p>Everybody is for saving a buck or two whether it’s on the initial purchase or over time. Fortunately, electric space heaters don’t cost a lot to run &#8212; right around 20 cents per hour. That said, where you can really save is on the initial purchase, and if you don’t feel like spending a hundred bucks for the Vornado then keep reading.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J8I7472/?tag=ybdheat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Holmes &#8211; Quartz Tower Heater</a> is one of the more affordable options at $40 even. As far as efficiency, it just barely beat the number one space heater in cost-effectiveness for room heating but blew away the electric competition in the three-feet direct heat test &#8212; it was over 30 percent more efficient in direct heat when compared to the next best, Dr. Infrared, and was twice as efficient when compared to the Vornado.</p>

<p>The term “tower” heater may be a bit misleading. Though it is one of the tallest ones we tested, it’s still less than two feet tall. It is incredibly lightweight for its size too &#8212; only seven pounds &#8212; so you can easily transport it from room to room. And if you happen to knock it over forward it will shut off automatically. It has a safety bar on the top end of the grill so that when it falls over the hot grill won’t come in contact with the floor.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even though it has tip-over protection, the protection only works if the space heater falls straight forward, which is why they have the bar. So it’s not the safest, but it is still safer than most.</p>

<p>The heater settings have a low and high with a gradual thermostat that doesn’t show you degree estimates or anything. This is pretty standard because most people don’t need an exact degree, you can just remember if you like it three quarters of the way and so forth. This is the perfect garage heater because it looks rugged and powerful but won’t necessarily fit the family room decor.</p>

<p>Sometimes we don’t want to work indoors. It’s also nice to be able to feel the fiery warmth of heat right after that chill. And for this type of heat, that is both direct and permeating, you need propane power.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002QUZGS8/?tag=ybdheat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mr. Heater &#8211; Portable Buddy</a> is propane-fueled and it brings the heat. This cordless space heater beat its competitors flat out in our heating competition. When we conducted the three-foot direct heat test, it increased the temperature by 35 degrees in five minutes! That’s almost ten degrees higher than the next best (the Holmes &#8211; Quartz Tower Heater did 26 degrees). This type of raw power heat is needed when you’re working outdoors or on a camping trip.</p>

<p>It is very easy to use, no special tools or knowledge required. It’s very similar to lighting a barbecue, just screw in the propane tank, press the knob halfway down on “pilot” and hold for 30 seconds, then press all the way down and it will light. Viola. Heat by the push of a button.</p>

<p>And if you’re wondering, it is indoor-safe but because it uses oxygen you’ll want to use it in an area with airflow or for short periods of time inside. It does, however, have a built-in oxygen depletion sensor that will shut off the gas upon detection. The gas will also turn off automatically if the pilot flame goes out or if the space heater falls forward or backward. So you can rest assured its power is tamed, so if you want to use it in your RV or similar space, this works great.</p>
<p>The downside to this heater, of course, is the extra danger involved. Whenever you have flammable gas and open flame in the picture, things tend to be more dangerous. But if they are handled with care, and you can handle the heat, feel free to take on the Mr. Heater.</p>

<li>It uses propane which means the area needs ventilation, but there is no cord to trip over.</li>
<li>The Mr. Heater is unfortunately very expensive to use when compared to its electric competitors. It costs about two dollars an hour on full blast as opposed to about twenty cents.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-for-small">Best for small rooms: Honeywell &#8211; HCE200B</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5862" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/honeywell-ceramic-1.jpg" alt="Honeywell Ceramic " width="900" height="596" /></p>
<p>When you get out of the shower in the morning there are really only a couple things you would like: a warm bathroom and a mirror that you can see yourself in (not including that cup of coffee you wish was already made). Without a space heater you can usually only have one of these two things, heat or mirror.</p>
<p>As many of you may be looking for something cheap and cheerful that will give you both heat and a useful mirror, we’ve compared three smaller heaters that were chosen specifically for bathroom heating and for small rooms. They all differ in their abilities &#8212; fan or no fan, low and/or high heat output &#8212; but all three give off a similar maximum heat.</p>
<p>Although we would suggest the Vornado, due to its air circulation ability and temperature precision, we know that may be a bit excessive in cost and perhaps a bit larger than most folks might want for a small room heater. So the three small options we chose are all under $30. The best small space heater is the <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Honeywell-UberHeater-Ceramic-Heater-HCE200B-Black/55091913" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Honeywell &#8211; Ceramic Heater</a> as its tip-over protection is on par with that of the Vornado and has multiple heat settings.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Honeywell Heater doesn’t have a fan, which many people would like in a bathroom heater &#8212; if that’s the case for you the Lasko 754200 has a fan, but no tip-over protection. So in the end we want you and your family to be safe and worry-free when enjoying a bath or shower.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Honeywell-UberHeater-Ceramic-Heater-HCE200B-Black/55091913" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Honeywell &#8211; HCE200B Ceramic Heater</a> has an incredible tip-over protection function.</li>
<li>It provides enough heat for a bathroom or small bedroom.</li>
<li>There are two different heat settings but no fan.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other">The other finalists</h2>

<h3>Dr. Infrared</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002QZ11J6/?tag=ybdheat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dr. Infrared</a> is a high-end heater that looks like a small piece of furniture. At 24 lbs it has the tip-over protection we’re looking for, it stops after a 45 degree angle is reached and has no exposed hot-spots. It provided great direct heat and pretty good room heat although that is most likely because there was no furniture in the room for it to heat up, which is how infrared heaters are designed to work. It’s a tough asterisk for this one to take.</p>
<p>One of our favorite parts of this heater is that it has so many settings and modes &#8212; and a very reliable thermostat &#8212; so it was customizable heat, and you don’t even have to leave the couch to change it because it comes with a remote. This is luxury heating, perfect for a larger room where it would have a semi-permanent spot. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002QZ11J6/?tag=ybdheat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dr. Infrared</a> does have wheels so you can easily move it if you wish.</p>
<h3>Lasko &#8211; 6435 Oscillating Heater</h3>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000N22JX6/?tag=ybdheat-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Lasko-Oscillating-Heater-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Lasko-Oscillating-Heater-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Lasko-Oscillating-Heater-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Lasko-Oscillating-Heater-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Lasko-Oscillating-Heater-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Lasko-Oscillating-Heater-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Lasko-Oscillating-Heater-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Lasko-Oscillating-Heater-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Lasko-Oscillating-Heater.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Also Great: Lasko - Oscillating Heater</h3><p>The Lasko 6435 looks like artwork, heats up a room quickly with its unique oscillation technique and has a price that is tough to beat.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000N22JX6/?tag=ybdheat-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000N22JX6/?tag=ybdheat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">This space heater</a> is like a miniature Athenian ceramic fountain masterpiece and it is a great room heater. Due to the oscillation technique it was almost as effective as the Vornado at dispersing heat throughout the room and it’s even small enough to put in a bathroom. It too comes with a remote and has the ability to be put on a timer of up to eight hours.</p>
<p>The thermostat options range from 60 to 85 degrees in increments of five. And although it doesn’t have any tip-over protection, this heater is on a stand that is very sturdy and the temperature of the grill doesn’t get hot to the touch. So it’s about as safe as it can be without tip-over protection.</p>
<h3>DeLonghi &#8211; TRH0715 Oil Filled Radiator</h3>
<p>Classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FT1XZW/?tag=ybdheat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">oil-filled radiator</a>, it’s old-school. And it is definitely not good at heating up a room quickly. But once it achieves the heat desired it can hold it steady very nicely. Also, because it’s not a fan it doesn’t have that warm air feel, it was one of the coziest feeling heats experienced and would surely keep your room toasty during the winter months.</p>
<p>This would be a nice choice for a bigger room or garage as the type of heat if provides is slow and steady which is exactly what you need if you’re curing things in the shop. So if you want complete silence and have the patience to wait, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FT1XZW/?tag=ybdheat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DeLonghi Radiator</a> is a fine choice.</p>
<h3>Holmes &#8211; Compact Heater HFH131-N-TG</h3>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AIAMS7A/?tag=ybdheat-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/holmes-compact-heater-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/holmes-compact-heater-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/holmes-compact-heater-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/holmes-compact-heater-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/holmes-compact-heater-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/holmes-compact-heater-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/holmes-compact-heater-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/holmes-compact-heater-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/holmes-compact-heater.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Good for Bathrooms: Holmes - Compact Heater</h3><p>The Holmes Compact Heater HFH131-N-TG is a classic simple, work-hard little heater that provides the body and bathroom with ample heat.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AIAMS7A/?tag=ybdheat-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>In terms of heating, the $20 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AIAMS7A/?tag=ybdheat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Holmes Compact Heater</a> powerhouse was better than the other two bathroom heaters at room heating and absolutely crushed them in direct heating. Unfortunately there is just one setting and only a gradual thermostat. So there are not too many choices with this one, but if you care about a fancy fan space heater then this small space heater is a steal.</p>
<h3>Lasko &#8211; 754200 Ceramic Heater</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000TKDQ5C/?tag=ybdheat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lasko 754200</a> Ceramic Heater almost won the top spot for a bathroom heater because it was the only one with a fan and multiple heat settings. It is also an Amazon bestseller for around 25 bucks. But because it is not equipped with up-to-date safety precautions and because the heat it provided was the worst of the three it did not deserve the top spot.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>When we look at what matters it comes down to effectiveness, efficiency and safety. The Vornado &#8211; Vortex Heater is our top pick because it has the best safety precautions: both overheating automatic shut off and stellar tip-over protection &#8212; plus the best heat-distributing technology for overall room heatin. Other electric heaters like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002QZ11J6/?tag=ybdheat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dr. Infrared</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J8I7472/?tag=ybdheat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Holmes &#8211; Quartz Tower</a> paralleled the Vornado in a particular area or two, but when the product was looked at in total, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SVIOFNG/?tag=ybdheat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vornado &#8211; Vortex Heater</a> was the clear choice.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-found">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We started out our testing process with market research, combing through articles and blogs on the topic of electric blankets. Our research phase involved finding out the features and benefits of using an electric blanket, the safety and care of electric blankets, and the principles of AC and DC power (two options when choosing an electric blanket).</p>
<p>Then we used sources such as subreddits like r/frugal and YouTube video reviews to gather input from consumers on which are the most popular choices for electric blankets, and which features are the most important to users when choosing an electric blanket. This allowed us to narrow the field down to our five finalists.</p>
<p>Finally, we busted out our ruler, scale, infrared thermometer and Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitor to dive into the nitty-gritty details of our electric-blanket finalists to see which would emerge as the best electric blanket.</p>

<h2 id="why-use-an">Why use an electric blanket</h2>
<p>When the temperature drops, you may find yourself reaching to adjust the thermostat. But is that really your best option? According to the <a href="http://www.energy.gov/public-services/homes/heating-cooling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Department of Energy</a>, heating and cooling are the largest expenses for most homes, accounting for more than half of the energy use in a typical household. In the winter months, this can cause your electric or fuel bills to skyrocket, especially if your home is more than 20-years old.</p>
<p>Making smarter and more informed decisions about how you heat your home can save you a significant amount of money.</p>
<p>At night, you spend an average of eight hours in a single room sleeping. If you can avoid heating the whole house during this time, or even lower your thermostat by a few degrees, you can appreciably lower your heating bill.</p>
<p>A space heater is one way to heat a small area like a bedroom, but an electric blanket is the best way to both conserve resources and save money. In a comparison between space heaters and electric blankets completed by the U.S. Department of Energy, the electric blanket was the most energy-efficient choice.</p>
<p>The cost to run a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-space-heater/">space heater</a> for eight hours a day, 50 days a year, is approximately $66 a year, while our tests estimate our top electric blanket finalists to cost three to seven dollars annually to use for the same period of time.</p>
<p>You can save as much as three-percent in energy for every degree you drop by lowering the thermostat at night. Think about it this way: With the money you save on your energy bill, an electric blanket will pay for itself in a matter of months.</p>
<p>If your energy bill costs $300, you can save $24 a month if you turn down your thermostat by eight degrees each night. With the savings, even the most expensive blanket we reviewed (the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0091BU68A/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Serta Luxe Plush</a>) will pay for itself within six months and less expensive blankets much sooner.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-look">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>After sorting through user reviews and expert opinions, we’ve come up a list of key metrics to use when determining the value of an electric blanket:</p>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> A heavier blanket will keep you warmer, with or without its electrical heating element turned on.</p>
<p><strong>Number of settings:</strong> The greater the number of settings, the more likely you are to strike that perfect balance between staying warm and using the least amount of wattage.</p>
<p><strong>Warranty:</strong> In the event that the cords, controller, or blanket malfunction, a warranty will replace the blanket or parts at no cost to you (usually up to five years). Keep in mind that it won’t cover accidents or damage.</p>
<p><strong>Thin wires:</strong> The thinner the wire, the easier it is to wrap the blanket around yourself and relax or sleep more comfortably. Thinner, more flexible wires add to your comfort and make the blanket easier to store in summer months (since it folds up smaller).</p>
<p><strong>General ease of use:</strong> Lighted dials for use at night, uncomplicated settings, and cords that actually reach to your sockets are important considerations when choosing an electric blanket.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort:</strong> Luxurious materials like soft micro-fleece and plush sherpa make today’s electric blankets more comfortable than ever.</p>
<p><strong>Auto-shutoff:</strong> Never worry about leaving your electric blanket on when you leave for work; auto-shutoff gives you peace of mind and makes for safer use.</p>
<p><strong>Preheat feature:</strong> Preheat settings mean that for the first 15 to 20 minutes, a blanket turns on at its highest temperature, then drops to the setting you select.</p>
<h2 id="AC-vs-conversion">AC vs conversion to DC power</h2>
<p>Two of the electric blankets we tested, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041RQXOK/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Soft Heat electric blanket</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0091BU68A/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Serta Luxe low voltage</a> use the the patented Safe and Warm low-voltage technology. This means it converts the AC power used by most electric blankets to a safer low-voltage DC power.</p>
<p>Both Serta and SoftHeat are made by Perfect Fit Industries, and its products are currently the only ones in the U.S. market that meet <a href="http://ulstandards.ul.com/standard/?id=964_12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Underwriters Laboratories standards</a> for “non-hazardous low voltage”. Although it takes longer to heat up, it is safer and offers a “soft warmth”. This means that while the blanket itself is not hot to the touch, the experience of using the blanket is warm and cozy.</p>
<p>You might be wondering what exactly is the difference between AC and DC power, so let’s talk about that. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology School of Engineering gives <a href="http://engineering.mit.edu/ask/what%E2%80%99s-difference-between-ac-and-dc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a thorough explanation</a>, which we’ll summarize here. Alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) are different types of voltage or current used for the conduction and transmission of electrical energy. AC is the dominant power source you’ll find in daily-use items like lamps, whereas a battery uses DC power.</p>
<p>The fundamental difference between AC and DC is the direction of flow. DC is constant and moves in one direction, while AC changes over time in a back and forth repetition. This oscillation is the reason AC power can be more dangerous; since the voltage alternates, it can cause current to enter and exit your body even without a closed loop, since your body can store an electrical charge. The higher the voltage, the greater the risk of electrical shock.</p>
<h2 id="are-electric-blankets">Are electric blankets safe?</h2>
<p>Safety concerns about malfunction, overheating, and electromagnetic frequency waves (EMFs) are among the top questions the <a href="http://www.electricblanketinstitute.com/safety-care.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Electric Blanket Institute</a> receives. Even though the U.S. government has spent $65 million on research and studied over 500 peer-reviewed papers to conclude that EMFs aren’t a problem, in 1992, Sunbeam started making blankets in 1992 with much weaker EMFs. Each of the blankets we looked at met the latest Underwriters Laboratories electric bedding standards.</p>
<p>There is also the newer option of buying electric blankets, such as the SoftHeat or Serta finalists, that convert AC power to DC power.</p>
<p>For very small children, pregnant women or anyone who is prone to heat insensitivity (such as those with diabetes) or incapable of operating the controls, the safest bet is to use an electric blanket to pre-warm your bed sheets and then turn it off prior to retiring for the night.</p>

<h3>Test #1: Cost efficiency</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4610 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/temp-measurement.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/temp-measurement.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/temp-measurement-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/temp-measurement-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/temp-measurement-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/temp-measurement-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/temp-measurement-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/temp-measurement-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/temp-measurement-180x119.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/temp-measurement-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Since one of the major reasons to purchase an electric blanket is to reduce energy use and save money, let’s take a look at the cost breakdown to use each of these electric blanket finalists annually. We tested the energy consumption of each finalist by first testing the wattage with the Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitor. It connects to household appliances to assess its energy use in voltage, watts, and kilowatt hours.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4689 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified.png" alt="electric blanket cost efficiency" width="855" height="768" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified.png 855w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-610x548.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-360x323.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-375x337.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-414x372.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-295x265.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-180x162.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-320x287.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>For this test, we looked at the costs of using each electric blanket on a medium setting for eight hours a night for a period of 50 days. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average national cost of electricity is about 12 cents per kilowatt hour for residential use, which is the number we used to tally our total costs.</p>
<p>We found that any electric blanket is the least expensive method of heating, with the most expensive blanket to operate (the Sunbeam Olive Sherpa Mink) costing only $7.82 per year. The other AC-powered ranges were also in the seven dollar range.</p>
<p>However, the SoftHeat and Serta blankets, which convert to DC power, cost less than four dollars a year to operate. When you think of the high energy and fuel costs to heat an entire home, and how much you could reduce your energy bill by using an electric blanket at night for part of the year, that’s a huge incentive.</p>
<h3>Test #2: Heating capabilities</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/infrared-thermometer-measurement.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>If you’re using an electric blanket to reduce your heating bill, you want to know that it will keep you warm at night while the thermostat is set at a lower temperature. Of course, how warm an electric blanket gets can be subjective when reviewed by consumers.</p>
<p>When the temperature is chilly outside (or inside), the blanket may not feel as hot as it would on a warmer day. This is especially true if the user has a lowered body temperature for any reason, or is prone to feeling cold.</p>
<p>To counteract this objectivity, we used our infrared thermometer as a diagnostic tool. Because it measures temperature within a two-percent plus or two-degree minus range, we felt confident our reading would accurately reflect a true comparison between electric blankets. We checked the exact temperature at high, medium, and low settings. For blankets with ten settings, we checked the temperature at settings one, five, and ten.</p>
<p>Many electric blanket consumers use the preheating feature when available, or manually preheat the blanket before retiring to bed. However, it’s nice to know that you can warm yourself up quickly when necessary. We looked at the number of minutes each finalist took to heat up, using a timer and the infrared thermometer. We tested at five, ten, and fifteen minutes to determine how long each blanket took to reach its maximum temperature.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4690 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-2.png" alt="electric blanket temperature time" width="880" height="748" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-2.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-2-610x519.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-2-360x306.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-2-375x319.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-2-414x352.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-2-295x251.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-2-180x153.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-2-320x272.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Each of our finalists averaged the same amount of time to heat up, taking five minutes to reach the temperature we measured at the lowest setting, and a total of fifteen minutes to reach its highest temperature.</p>
<p>The Biddeford Micro Mink &amp; Sherpa blanket reached the highest temperature of all the blankets, at 107.1 degrees Fahrenheit. It also had the widest range of temperatures, with a low setting of 81.7 degrees. Close behind in ranking for the highest temperature were the Serta and SoftHeat blankets, at 105.8 and 105.7 degrees respectively. The Sunbeam Olive Sherpa &amp; Mink blanket ran at the lowest temperature setting, with a high of 85.4 degrees.</p>
<h3>Test #3: Evenness</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4592 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wire-spacing.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wire-spacing.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wire-spacing-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wire-spacing-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wire-spacing-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wire-spacing-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wire-spacing-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wire-spacing-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wire-spacing-180x119.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wire-spacing-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>According to the many consumer reviews we read, a heating product with hot or cold spots is the bane of electric blanket users. In order to get the maximum benefit of an electric blanket, it’s important for the heat to be distributed evenly.</p>
<p>First, we measured the spacing of the wires. We looked at the distance between the wires, and how close the wires ran to the edges. The more evenly the heating element is distributed, the more likely it is that the blanket will give off a uniform heat.</p>
<p>We then checked all four corners and the center of each blanket, testing by hand to make sure there were no hot or cold spots. Then we double checked with the infrared thermometer, again testing all four corners and the center to make sure the heat was distributed evenly.</p>
<p>Each of our finalist blankets did a great job of heating evenly, with no discernable hot or cold spots. However, in terms of overall heat distribution, the SoftHeat and Serta blankets were both clear winners, with the most uniform feel of warmth when under the blanket.</p>
<p>While the “invisible” wires were undetectable, and we were therefore unable to take measurements, the manufacturer for each of these blankets states the width at three inches apart, much closer than traditional electric blankets.</p>
<p>Although the wires of the Sunbeam Microplush were centered towards the middle of the blanket, it had the closest distance between wires, at only one and a half inches apart.</p>
<h3>Test #4: Comfort</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4587 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/measuring-thickness.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/measuring-thickness.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/measuring-thickness-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/measuring-thickness-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/measuring-thickness-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/measuring-thickness-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/measuring-thickness-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/measuring-thickness-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/measuring-thickness-180x119.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/measuring-thickness-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>You may be influenced to purchase an electric blanket for the cost savings, but when it comes to picking out the brand and style, it all comes down to comfort. Is it soft and cozy? Is it easy to use? Will it be your go-to blanket for curling up in front of the television or getting into bed at night? After all, if an electric blanket doesn’t get used, it won’t benefit your energy bill.</p>
<p>We looked at four benchmarks for this test: plushness, weight, cord length, and wire thickness. First, we used a ruler to measure the thickness of each blanket to determine the plushness. The fleece-lined blankets (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0088AHJ8A?th=1/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sunbeam Royal Mink Sherpa</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DN6SM12/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Biddeford Micro Mink Sherpa</a>) were both noticeably more plush to the hand, as well as half a centimeter thicker than the other blankets.</p>
<p>Next, we weighed the blankets. After all, a heavier blanket is warmer in the winter, even before you reach for the controller. The Serta Luxe Plush was the heaviest blanket at 7.8 pounds, and the SoftHeat Ultra Micro-Plush was the next heaviest at 6.8 pounds. Of course, the throw blankets were both lighter due to size, with the Sunbeam Royal Mink Sherpa weighing 3.5 pounds and the Sunbeam Camelot Cuddler weighing just three pounds.</p>
<p>Because a longer cord allows for easier reach to electric sockets without pulling the blanket, we measured the length of each cord. The throw blankets both had a short reach of nine feet, which correlates to use on a couch or recliner. The Serta and SoftHeat had the longest cords, reaching 23 feet and comfortably stretching to any outlet in the room.</p>
<p>Finally, we looked at wire thickness. Being covered up by fabric, this was difficult to measure with a ruler, so we used a flat palm to run our hand across the surface of the fabric. With all but the Serta and SoftHeat blankets, which have “invisible wires”, we could easily detect the wires running through the blankets.</p>
<p>However, the Sunbeam Royal Sherpa Mink and Biddeford Micro Mink Sherpa blankets were lined with fleece, meaning that once we had the blanket covering our lap, the wires were undetectable from the side closest to our body.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: SoftHeat &#8211; Ultra Micro-Plush</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4590 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/softheat.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/softheat.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/softheat-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/softheat-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/softheat-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/softheat-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/softheat-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/softheat-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/softheat-180x119.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/softheat-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Safety is a major concern for most electric blanket users, so it’s no surprise that the low-voltage <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041RQXOK/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SoftHeat Ultra Micro-Plush Low-Voltage Electric Blanket</a> is one of the most-reviewed heated blankets on Amazon.com.</p>
<p>It uses low-voltage technology, with a small power supply box that changes 115 volt AC power into non-hazardous DC power for added protection and safety (even if the blanket becomes wet). It operates on less than 25 volts, about the same amount of current it takes to operate a light bulb.</p>
<p>Some users report that SoftHeat takes longer to heat up than a traditional heating blanket, due to its use of DC power, but we found that its unique preheat feature put it on par with the other blankets we tested. The indulgent and incredibly soft microplush fabric exudes a soft warmth.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering what soft heat feels like, we’d compare it to cuddling up with warm towels fresh from the dryer. It does not feel hot to the touch nor does it heat up surrounding fabric such as sheets (even though it registers on the infrared thermometer at 104.1 degrees on its highest setting), but you do experience warmth once you are wrapped up in its cozy softness.</p>

The Soft Heat Ultra Micro-Plush electric blanket tied with the Serta brand in all three categories, at a lower price.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041RQXOK/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If you’re using an electric product merely to warm up a bed and plan to turn it off before getting in, you may want to consider an AC-powered blanket that does heat up surrounding fabric.</p>
<p>One of the aspects we truly appreciated about SoftHeat were the “invisible wires.” Because each wire is wrapped in a layer of fiberfill that directs the heat downward towards you, you feel warm, but you definitely do not feel the wires. As flexible as they are undetectable, the ultra-thin wires allow you to bend, mold, or shape the blanket as you desire.</p>
<p>We loved how easily we could wrap it around ourselves and how it was less bulky on the bed. It also folds up as neat and small as a regular blanket, which allows for easier storage when the blanket isn’t in use.</p>
<p>The non-slip digital controller is easy to read and adjust, with a lighted dial and an extra long cord that was useful to reach outlets in any part of the room. While we tested a full size blanket, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041RQXOK/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">king size</a> is divided in two separate zones and comes with two controllers to adjust the temperature of each side of the bed, allowing for individual comfort and control.</p>
<p>We appreciated the fact that SoftHeat is both machine washable and dryable (be sure to read the manufacturer’s instructions for settings). Since you’re most likely to use an electric blanket during the winter, finding a place to hang-dry a full size or larger blanket could be a bit cumbersome. The other finalists we reviewed allowed for partial machine drying, but only SoftHeat and Serta were able to machine dry from start to finish.</p>
<p>With home heating costs on the rise and a move toward preserving natural resources, the low wattage of SoftHeat is an incredible boon to those looking to save money and energy. The Department of Energy estimates the average electric blanket to use 400 watts (although our five finalists used far less), and the low voltage SoftHeat blanket uses only 73 watts according to our test.</p>
<p>While priced slightly higher than other electric blankets of the same size, you can clearly see that it would quickly pay for itself. It’s also about $40 cheaper than the comparably featured Serta Luxe Plush when this review was initially published, making it our clear winner.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The low voltage technology of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041RQXOK/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SoftHeat</a> is similar to a battery and uses the same amount of voltage as a light bulb. You can rest assured that you’re using one of the safest electric blankets on the market.</li>
<li>Ultra thin and flexible wires wrapped in fiberfill make SoftHeat more like a traditional blanket than an electric blanket.</li>
<li>Costing less than $4 a year to use throughout the night during the cold months, SoftHeat will pay for itself in energy bill savings.</li>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0091BU68A/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Serta &#8211; Luxe Plush Low-Voltage Electric Heated Micro-Fleece Blanket</a> has similar features to the Soft Heat blanket, at a higher price. Serta is a well-recognized name in the mattress and bedding world, so this electric blanket comes with the reassurance of a leading brand dedicated to quality and consumer satisfaction. There’s also the option to purchase coordinating Serta products, such as low-voltage micro-fleece throws.</p>
<p>The Serta Luxe Plush is made by Perfect Fit Industries, so it uses the same patented Safe &amp; Warm low voltage technology as the SoftHeat Ultra Micro-plush and has many of the same features, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Innovative, energy saving, and extremely safe low-voltage technology.</li>
<li>An additional inner layer of fiberfill and soft fabric that covers each thin wire, making it undetectable and distributing the heat evenly without the bulkiness of traditional electric blankets.</li>
<li>A pre-heat feature that allows you to warm your entire bed before getting in.</li>
<li>Independently zoned heating and dual controllers with the king and queen size blankets.</li>
<li>A completely machine washable and dryable blanket is convenient during winter.</li>
</ul>
<p>The areas where the Serta Luxe Plush excels are in weight and cost-efficiency. At 7.4 pounds, it is the heaviest blanket we reviewed. With super soft micro-fleece fabric, the Serta Luxe Plush is one of the most soft, flexible, and comfortable electric blankets on the market. Of the five finalists we tested, it’s also the least expensive product to operate. With a wattage of 68, it only costs $3.25 annually to use nightly in the winter months.</p>

<p>Users credit the Serta Luxe for its longevity, quality, and performance, and after thorough testing, we are inclined to agree.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The heaviest and softest electric blanket we reviewed, the Serta &#8211; Luxe Plush is the thickest and warmest option for those who are always cold.</li>
<li>Costing only $.06 for eight hours of use, this is the most cost-efficient electric blanket we reviewed (and on the market).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-best-throw">Best throw: Sunbeam &#8211; Sherpa-Mink</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4591 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sunbeam.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sunbeam.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sunbeam-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sunbeam-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sunbeam-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sunbeam-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sunbeam-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sunbeam-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sunbeam-180x119.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sunbeam-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>With its snuggly soft texture and cozy fleece side, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0088AHJ8A?th=1/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sunbeam’s &#8211; Sherpa-Mink Throw Blanket</a> is perfect to curl up with even before you turn the heat on. In fact, the premium soft material and plush thickness of the sherpa means you don’t even feel the wires when the blanket is resting against your body.</p>
<p>It comes with Sunbeam’s proprietary Thermofine warming system, which senses both your body temperature and room temperature, and adjusts to deliver consistent warmth. We love this feature, because if your feet are cold, Sunbeam’s warming system automatically senses this change and directs additional heat to your feet. The system also employs patented carbon-based polymer Positive Temperature Coefficient sensing capability to provide more uniform heat.</p>
<p>We highly recommend this blanket when for cozying up on a couch or recliner. At 50&#215;60”, it’s perfectly sized for when you want to spend the evening hours in your living room reading or watching television. (Using an electric blanket in the evening as well as night allows you to lower your thermostat for even more hours of the day and adds up to a greater cost savings.)</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0088AHJ8A?th=1/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sunbeam-sherpa-mink-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sunbeam-sherpa-mink-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sunbeam-sherpa-mink-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sunbeam-sherpa-mink-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sunbeam-sherpa-mink-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sunbeam-sherpa-mink-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sunbeam-sherpa-mink-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sunbeam-sherpa-mink-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sunbeam-sherpa-mink.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Throw: Sunbeam - Sherpa-Mink</h3><p>The ultimate in cozy warmth in a petite package, this luxury throw is as beautiful as it is functional and comfortable.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0088AHJ8A?th=1/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The three-hour auto-shutoff convenient for evening use, because if you forget to turn it off before going to bed, you won’t have to worry. However, if you’re planning on using this blanket to keep you warm all night, the short time frame for the auto shutoff may mean you wake up with no heat source.</p>
<p>The cord has only three settings and is lighted for easy use in the dark. With a shorter power cord at six feet, this is again designed for use in a couch or reclining chair close to an outlet. In a bedroom, the shorter power cord may be slightly inconvenient. But for use in a living room, it’s hard to beat the luxurious feel of sherpa and royal mink.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Thermofine Warming System used by Sunbeam in the Olive Sherpa Mink Throw senses changes in body and room temperatures, and adjusts accordingly for better sleep.</li>
<li>Whether you prefer ultra soft RoyalMink fabric or snuggly sherpa against your skin, this reversible throw is the ultimate in cuddly softness on either side.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DN6SM12/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Biddeford Heated Micro mink &amp; Sherpa blanket</strong></a><br />
We couldn’t get enough of the high-quality Sherpa and Micro Mink fabric, which makes the Biddeford Heated Micro Mink &amp; Sherpa blanket an exceptionally cozy and snuggly soft blanket. It features ten heat settings, a ten hour auto shut off system, and an ultra thin wire that is undetectable through the sherpa side.</p>
<p>We tested the full size, but the queen and king sizes also have the additional feature of dual temp control. The dual temp control has two entirely separate heating mechanisms, with separate cords and separate controllers for total warmth independence. Users appreciate its luxurious feel, therapeutic warmth, and ability to stand the test of time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001VMFI3K/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Sunbeam Microplush Throw Camelot Cuddler Warming Blanket</strong></a><br />
The Sunbeam Camelot Cuddler wins praise for its ultra soft material, exclusive Thermofine warming system and heavier PrimeStyle controller. It’s another good option for those desiring a throw blanket to use during the evening hours. The Sunbeam Microplush heats hotter than the Sunbeam Sherpa Mink, ranging from 93.1 at its lowest setting to 104.1 at its highest. If a warmer blanket is important to you, this makes the Sunbeam Microplush a good choice.</p>
<p>For those that are budget-conscious, it’s also the least expensive blanket that we reviewed. Since it has many of the same options as the Sunbeam Sherpa Mink throw, such as an easy-to-use controller and three hour auto-shut off, it offers plenty of bang for your buck.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Tied neck and neck throughout the comparison process, both the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041RQXM2/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SoftHeat Ultra Micro-Plush</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0091BU68A/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Serta Luxe Plush</a> ranked the highest in peace of mind due to their low-voltage technology and built-in over-temperature protection. They also were the most cost-efficient to operate, at $3.50 annually for the SoftHeat and $3.35 annually for the Serta.</p>
<p>With their undetectable wires and incredible “soft heat” sensation throughout the blanket, each of the top two choices were leaders in the area of comfort. All in all, they were very similar choices, which is no surprise as they are both made by Perfect Fit Industries.</p>
<p>In the end, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041RQXM2/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SoftHeat Ultra Micro-Plush</a> pulled ahead with its lower price for an essentially identical blanket (a savings of ~$44) and decorative triple-rib design.</p>
