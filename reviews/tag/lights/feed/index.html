								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter weeks spent researching and reading before bed, we determined that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B076SVC7SN/?tag=ybdbook-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LuminoLite &#8211; Rechargeable LED</a> is the best book light. Its easy-on-the-eyes yellow glow, multiple light-level settings, flexible neck and high-quality construction earned it high scores from our voracious readers-turned-testers.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>First, we combed through hundreds of book light reviews on Amazon to find the lights users liked best. Then, we took to sites like Book Riot and Hooked to Books to see what the literary-minded section of the internet recommends. We also scoured the forums on Goodreads to see what passionate readers are looking for in a book light. Finally, we consulted with one of our own testers, who reads an average of four books per month. Then we used all of this information to select our top contenders.</p>
<p>We avoided book lights that exceeded $25. Why? We found that any models above this price point were similar or identical in design to their lower-priced counterparts. We also chose to only test a couple of the most highly-rated e-book lights, since many electronic reading devices are already illuminated enough on their own.</p>

<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>A book light is a pretty simple purchase, but there are still some factors to keep in mind while selecting one.</p>
<p><strong>Light and brightness:</strong> When it comes to book lights, it’s no surprise that brightness is the number one factor you should consider. You want a light that’s bright enough to prevent eye strain, but not so bright that it’s painful to read. If you’re purchasing a book light to use before bed, choose one with warm-colored bulbs. <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/09/110912092554.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cool-colored bulbs may be too stimulating</a>. (We also found this to be true in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-night-light/">night lights review.)</a></p>
<p>You may also want to look for a light with multiple brightness settings, so you can choose the one that’s most conducive to your task or the time of day. Most of the book lights on the market today use LED bulbs, which are the most energy-efficient option.</p>
<p><strong>Storage, portability and aesthetics:</strong> Some book lights are designed for travel, so they’re extra light and durable. Others are more sturdy and meant to hold firmly in place while you work.</p>
<p><strong>Style and features:</strong> There are almost as many styles of book lights as there are genres of books. Some have a flexible neck (or even two) while others wrap around your neck. Some are designed to clip onto an e-reader while others are well-suited for a flimsy paperback.</p>
<p>Some lights also come with helpful features, like a shut-off timer that prevents you from sleeping with the light on.</p>
<p><strong>Power source:</strong> While most of our book light contenders came with rechargeable batteries, one uses removable AAA batteries. Consider what’s most suitable for your situation. Equally important is how long each light holds a charge.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We divided our book lights amongst a group of three insatiable readers. Then, we asked them to use the lights to read every night over a two-week period for at least 30 minutes. After that, we had our readers answer a slew of survey questions about their experience. Some of the questions we asked included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do your eyes hurt after you use your book light to read?</li>
<li>Does the light make turning the pages of your book inconvenient?</li>
<li>Do you have to hold your arms at an awkward or tiring angle while using it?</li>
<li>Is it lightweight enough to clip onto a paperback book?</li>
</ul>
<p>We used all of these survey answers to do qualitative analysis. We also examined each light’s construction, noting any parts or materials that felt especially flimsy or durable. And finally, we tried charging the rechargeable lights (even if they didn’t need it yet), so we could see how well the process worked.</p>
<h2 id="luminolite">Best overall: LuminoLite</h2>

<p>So what is the best book light for reading in bed? After hours of before-bed reading, we’ve determined that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B076SVC7SN/?tag=ybdbook-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LuminoLite &#8211; Rechargeable LED</a> book light is the best book light. It casts a warm, buttery-colored glow that felt easier on our eyes than some of the whiter-toned lights. We also liked that it had two different light settings. The brighter setting was illuminating (but not abrasive) when reading in bed with the lights off. The dimmer setting was perfect for reading on a red-eye flight, where we didn’t want to disturb our sleeping seatmate. And speaking of flights, this light was also easy to travel with. The lightweight, flexible neck and durability of this little gadget made it easy to stuff into a coat pocket on layovers.</p>

Its yellow-toned light is easy on the eyes, and two brightness settings make it easy to read anywhere. It comes with a micro-usb cord that makes powering up a breeze.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B076SVC7SN/?tag=ybdbook-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Plus, the LuminoLite’s micro-USB charging cord made it easy to plug into our laptop while waiting at the terminal. The diffused lights on this gadget also meant our whole book was illuminated at one time.</p>
<p>The only thing we didn’t love about the LuminoLite was its clip. While it worked well on hardcover books and laptops, it was ever-so-slightly too heavy and unwieldy to use on most paperbacks. Our tester ended up holding the clip in their hand when reading anything paperback.</p>
<h2 id="ecologic-mart">Runner-up: Ecologic Mart</h2>

<p>As a runner-up, we also liked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J943WNY/?tag=ybdbook-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ecologic Mart &#8211; Eye Care Warm Booklight</a>. This one also has a warmer yellow light. More specifically, it has double the warm yellow light, since it has two heads. Our tester was skeptical about this feature at first, but ended up loving the way that it illuminated both pages at once. Our tester found that the grip worked well for every kind of book, paperbacks included. They also appreciated that this light is lightweight and easy to use in any position.</p>

<p>It comes with a rechargeable battery that held strong throughout the testing process, and it was easy to charge when we plugged it in (via USB cable) as well. The Ecologic Mart light was also the most expensive on our list, at just over $20, but we feel confident saying that it’s worth the (relatively small) investment.</p>
<p>The only downside we found to the Ecologic Mart? It has multiple settings, which is great, but you have to click through all of them to get to whichever one you want to use.</p>

<p>For those who prefer the digitized version of their daily read, we suggest the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BXX0QVQ/?tag=ybdbook-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iKross &#8211; LED clip On Light</a>. Our tester used this on their Kindle and found that it stayed gripped in place no matter how they sat with it. They also liked that it had an adjustable arm, which meant they could move the light’s focus and shadows on the Kindle screen were never an issue. The two levels of luminosity on this light also offered flexibility for reading in a variety of settings.</p>

<p>What didn’t we like about the iKross? Though it’s advertised for use on both e-readers and traditional books, our tester found that it didn’t work on the latter because it was too awkward to turn the pages. Plus, unlike the rechargeable book lights, this one required us to keep three AAA batteries on hand.</p>
<h2 id="other-lights">Other finalists we tested</h2>
<h3>CeSunlight &#8211; Rechargeable Book Light</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L6OHWDQ/?tag=ybdbook-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CeSunlight</a> was the most unique book light we tested, with a design meant to wrap around your neck rather than clip onto your novel. It’s also a multipurpose tool. Our tester used it as a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-rechargeable-flashlight/" rel="noopener">flashlight</a>, to walk the dog at night and more. Because it has multiple brightness settings (from a direct concentrated spotlight to a wider, diffused light), it can be used in almost any situation.</p>
<p>It also came with a pre-charged lithium battery that lasted throughout our entire testing period. However, we tested its battery charging feature anyway. You simply plug one end of the included cord into the light’s charging port, and the other into the USB port on your computer. We loved being able to do this, rather than keeping regular batteries on hand to power it.</p>
<p>While the CeSunlight is great for sitting up in bed and reading in just the right position, it can present a challenge if you want to relax any other way. Our tester found that laying on their side to read with this light was impossible because the book light leaned to the side along with them. They also found that they had to hold the book at a certain height so that the light emanating from around their neck could illuminate it properly. Simply put, this light will work for you, but only if you find the right reading position and stay there.</p>
<h3>Raniaco &#8211; Touch Switch Book Light</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-9196 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/book-lights_raniaco.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/book-lights_raniaco.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/book-lights_raniaco-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/book-lights_raniaco-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/book-lights_raniaco-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/book-lights_raniaco-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/book-lights_raniaco-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/book-lights_raniaco-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/book-lights_raniaco-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/book-lights_raniaco-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/book-lights_raniaco-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/book-lights_raniaco-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/book-lights_raniaco-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/book-lights_raniaco-768x512@2x.jpg 1536w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/book-lights_raniaco-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/book-lights_raniaco-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IOMH8H8/?tag=ybdbook-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Raniaco</a> is the sleekest and modern of the lights we tested, with an all-white design and buttonless touch-lamp feature. It’s USB-chargeable and has a wide clip that fits onto a desk edge for late-night work. The small details on the Raniaco, like the anti-slip silicone and frosted lampshade, make it feel a step above the rest in terms of quality. All of that being said, our tester was not a fan. In fact, though they liked the actual light, they “loathed it from the neck down.”</p>
<p>Why? They found the touch button unnecessarily difficult to use when an on/off switch could have performed the same feature. Plus, they found that the bulky clip made it difficult to turn pages. Moreover, it was awkwardly shaped and obscured the pages, making it nearly impossible to clip onto a book.</p>
<p>Long story short, if you’re looking for a modern, attractive clip-on desk lamp, the sub-$20 Raniaco still may be for you. However, if you’re looking for a compact book light for reading in bed, we don’t recommend it.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you find the time to read regularly, you should be rewarded with the best book light on the market. Luckily, even the best-functioning ones we’ve found don’t surpass the $25 mark. Our number one pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B076SVC7SN/?tag=ybdbook-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LuminoLite</a>, costs far less than that and is simple, convenient to use and easy on your eyes. For e-reader fans, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BXX0QVQ/?tag=ybdbook-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iKross</a>, which clips firmly to your e-reader and won’t cast shadows on the screen.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-chose">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Flashlights, also referred to as torches outside the U.S., perform one simple task &#8211; providing light! We explore what features distinguish one flashlight to the next by examining design and functionality. We also found it important to cover a variety of rechargeable flashlights to address different applications. There was representation from rechargeable tactical flashlights, search lights and emergency lights.</p>
<p>The hunt for the best rechargeable flashlight began on a variety of outdoor forums and online retailers such as Amazon. We combed through countless consumer reviews and visited several blogs to determine the most important qualities of flashlights. The list of needs are quite simple &#8211; quality of light, design and durability. We were able to break down these categories down into more specific categories to help determine the best rechargeable flashlight for your hard-earned buck.</p>

<p>All of the lights we tested use LED bulbs. To understand the modern day flashlight technology, let’s dive in a little deeper to explore the evolution of LED bulbs.</p>
<p>Before the mid-1990s, flashlights were made with incandescent bulbs, which rely on a filament to be heated to produce light and heat. Unfortunately, this design is highly fragile and susceptible to damage from impact. Dropping or hitting the flashlight against an object would risk breaking the filament.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s typical lifespan is about six hours before they would wear down. The appearance of LEDs in flashlights at the turn of millennium was revolutionary and would allow for manufacturers to take their flashlights above and beyond.</p>
<p>LEDs produce light electronically by changing an energy state while producing very little heat. One of the biggest improvements is their improved lifespan of around 11 years of continuous light. LEDs are also much more gracious with battery drain compared to the old technology. The LEDs are encapsulated in clear epoxy and are shockproof so you can drop them without worry. Finally, LEDs generally produce a white light, which is much more similar to daylight.</p>
<p>The emergence of LEDs was the perfect technology for the flashlight industry — small form factor, reliable bright light and low energy consumption. It allowed manufacturers to create more dependable products, which ultimately improves your quality of life.</p>

<h3>Tactical lights</h3>
<p>The word “tactical” implies actionable military grade use or careful professional planning. An example of this is our top overall pick shown in the photo above, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DR9GWX0/?tag=ybdflash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fenix PD35</a>.</p>
<p>Tactical flashlights were originally designed for military and law enforcement and are to be used alongside handheld weapons or mounted on a gun. The light is used for illuminating dark areas and blinding opponents as well. They are generally built with “aerospace grade aluminum,” which is a buzzword for “aluminum alloy.” It will hold very well against scratches, drops and other forms of impact.</p>
<p>Tactical lights have textured grips and feature an anti-roll profile, while being small enough to fit in a pocket. Their reputation has earned them a spot in the hands of a much broader audience. Now many average consumers and professionals have adopted tactical lights into their tool belt.</p>
<h3>Searchlights</h3>
<p>Historically, searchlights / spotlights were large powerful devices used in the military to assist with attacks, detect enemy ships at great distances and for defense against nighttime bomber raids.</p>
<p>The searchlights we looked at in our tests are less dramatic, but hang on to similar design cues in it&#8217;s relatively larger body and light reflector. You can see an example of one we tested, the large, yellow <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OU67Z80/?tag=ybdflash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">STANLEY FATMAX</a>.</p>
<p>If tactical flashlights were racecars, searchlights would be minivans — huskier, maybe not as cool, but might be the right one for the job! It’s large frame often include a handle for better grip. If you need a bright wide light and don’t mind the bulk, searchlights may be the best option. It would be suitable for outdoor hobbies or search parties, where light strength takes priority.</p>
<h3>Emergency lights</h3>
<p>Of course, any light can be used in the case of an emergency, but emergency lights are marketed as reliable, easy to use and easy to find. They use less elaborate materials compared to tactical flashlights and are typically plugged into a wall outlet to ensure an always-ready device. Having an emergency light fixed to a spot on the wall makes it easier to remember where it is, as opposed to losing it in a dark tool drawer.</p>
<p>An example of one that stood out to us was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XUIL1KM/?tag=ybdflash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ivation emergency light</a> which also functions as a night light. We have an <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-night-light/">in-depth review of night lights</a> too, if you&#8217;re looking for a more traditional type of those.</p>
<h3>Battery technology</h3>
<p>Rechargeable batteries come in two different formats, removable and non-removable. The tactical lights we tested all have removable batteries. The searchlights and emergency lights in our lineup all have internal battery systems.</p>
<p><strong>Removable battery design:</strong><br />
· Batteries can be replaced<br />
· Can have additional sets for backup to mitigate charging time<br />
· Non-rechargeable batteries can also be used</p>
<p><strong>Non-removable battery design:</strong><br />
· Less moving parts<br />
· Battery is designed specifically for flashlight<br />
· Faster Charging</p>
<p>Battery life is a a bit of a moving target because usage will vary tremendously between users. Almost all of the flashlights we tested offer several modes for brightness to preserve the life of the battery. Depending on your usage, this could be the difference between one hour to seven plus hours.</p>
<p>The tactical lights we tested all used similar sized 18650 batteries<img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=ybdflash-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> and lasted around one hour with strong performance on the highest setting. Over time the light gradually dims, but most users will still be able to squeeze around three more good hours before the light dips into a grey area. Leave the flashlights on for around eight hours and they will eventually peter out completely.</p>
<p>The 18650 battery takes roughly four to six hours to charge, which can be slow if you aren’t planning ahead. Luckily most flashlights have low brightness modes that can help stretch the battery. Using a flashlight on max brightness might not always be ideal neither. Overexposing a subject with a bright light tends to wash out the colors, making it harder to distinguish.</p>
<p>We should mention that the batteries that are included with the rechargeable tactical flashlights are not the bee’s knees. If you need a tactical flashlight for your profession, we highly recommend picking up a reliable third party rechargeable battery and charger. This should increase the run time by several hours at least. Some cheaper batteries do not include a protector chip, which helps keep the battery from overcharging, or charging/discharging too fast.</p>
<p>The non-removable battery rechargeable flashlights were more predictable. There were no battery options here, so whatever is included is as good as it gets. In contrast, the non-removable batteries made charging much more accessible because the unit just needed to be plugged in or placed in a charging cradle.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Flashlights were made to perform one simple task, to emit a light source. Measuring the quality of light is as important as rating a cake by its taste. When shopping for a flashlight, you’ll often see them described in lumens. This is a measurement of the total amount of light is emitted from a flashlight. More lumens usually indicate a brighter light, but most flashlights promise much higher lumens than they can achieve, so we did further investigation by measuring the lux.</p>
<h3>Lux</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4956" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/brightness-data-chart.png" alt="brightness data comparison" width="900" height="764" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/brightness-data-chart.png 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/brightness-data-chart-610x518.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/brightness-data-chart-768x652.png 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/brightness-data-chart-300x255.png 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/brightness-data-chart-295x250.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/brightness-data-chart-885x751.png 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/brightness-data-chart-360x306.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/brightness-data-chart-375x318.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/brightness-data-chart-414x351.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/brightness-data-chart-320x272.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>To make sure we are gathering real world results, we are scoring the quality of light based on its lux, a unit of light measurement where the area is also taken to account. This allows us to measure the total “amount” of visible light and the intensity of the illumination on a surface. Lux is also indicative of the light’s throw, which is how far the light will shine before it starts to drop off in illumination. In technical terms, one lux is equal to one lumen per square meter.</p>
<p>For our tests we placed all of the flashlights three feet from the wall. All batteries were fully charged to control as many variables as possible. To start, we held the light meter’s sensor in the center of the beam against the wall to capture the brightest reading. Then we moved the sensor 12” and 24” from center to see how the light diffuses when moving away from the concentrated area.</p>
<p>The zoom featured lights offered some challenges because the brightness and flood are adjustable and are affected by each other. With greater zoom comes a smaller area of light and vice versa. To quantify these variable settings, we recorded the max brightness at full zoom, which created approximately a three inch diameter flood. The zoom was then adjusted to a 30” diameter to measure the medium distance reading. Then finally it was zoomed completely to record the brightness along edges.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OU67Z80/?tag=ybdflash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">STANLEY FATMAX</a> had the most impressive results in our tests. We expected one of the searchlights to have the highest lux rating due to their large reflector design, but the STANLEY FATMAX stomped the WASING searchlight with over double the lux rating.</p>
<h3>Light size</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4955" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/light-size.png" alt="coverage chart at 3' away" width="900" height="703" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/light-size.png 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/light-size-610x476.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/light-size-768x600.png 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/light-size-300x234.png 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/light-size-295x230.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/light-size-885x691.png 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/light-size-360x281.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/light-size-375x293.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/light-size-414x323.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/light-size-320x250.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Not only did we measure the quality of light, but we also measured the size of the light, also referred to as “flood.” Some flashlights have even light distribution from edge to edge while others are stronger in the center and are less so along the edges.</p>
<p>The flashlights with the zoom mechanics have flexible yet limiting lighting profiles. Let us explain: the light intensity can be adjusted by pulling out the zoom ring to increase the throw and brightness, but the light narrows as the zoom intensifies. At the highest zoom setting, the light can be awkwardly bright and narrow for some uses. Zooming in all the way might be more ideal to snipe distant objects outdoors.</p>
<p>We ran our test in a controlled environment. All flashlights were placed three feet away from the wall in a dark room. We measured the lux with a light meter and the size of the light with a measuring tape. Of course, the size of the light would increase the further from the wall we go, but this data is more for comparison purposes. The results may appear arbitrary on their own, but see how the stack up to one another to gather context.</p>
<p>The light with the largest light size in our tests was the OxyLED at 60 inches, three feet from the wall — impressive for a relatively small device. We noticed that most of the other tactical flashlights and searchlights weren’t too far behind. The emergency lights show underwhelming results, pumping out a large enough area to watch your step in the dark. Even though the Energizer emergency light has a large light size reading, the brightness outside of dead center is very dim.</p>
<h3>Battery</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4954" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/battery-data.png" alt="battery data chart" width="900" height="785" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/battery-data.png 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/battery-data-610x532.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/battery-data-768x670.png 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/battery-data-300x262.png 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/battery-data-295x257.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/battery-data-885x772.png 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/battery-data-360x314.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/battery-data-375x327.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/battery-data-414x361.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/battery-data-320x279.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Starting off with a full charge with the stock batteries, we left all the rechargeable flashlights on with their brightest settings. We ran the same test with the lowest setting as well. Battery performance is also highly reliant on the flashlights’ ability to dial down brightness.</p>
<p>Even though the Fenix PD35 can conserve power under its “Eco” mode, this might not be a usable brightness for all users. Since these tests are highly subjective and dependent on varying usage patterns, we ranked the battery performance from one to three stars.</p>
<p>Battery performance will be subjective, but we give highest kudos to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DR9GWX0/?tag=ybdflash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fenix PD35</a> because it has the most customizable light settings. You will be able to dial down to your precise needs to stretch out the battery life. The manufacturer advertises 140 hours of light on “eco” mode.</p>
<h3>Color temperature</h3>
<p>Finally we took note of the color temperature of each light. The closer to daylight white the better. This helps retain the original color of the object(s) we are illuminating, which helps our eyes distinguish what we are seeing. Flashlights with an unnatural color tend to wash out the colors, making it slightly harder to see.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DR9GWX0/?tag=ybdflash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fenix PD35</a> had the most pleasing colors in our tests. Its light is bright with subtle warm tones emulating natural daylight, which stays consistent through its 5 brightness modes.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Fenix &#8211; PD35</h2>

<p>Some would say it was love at first light&#8230; the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DR9GWX0/?tag=ybdflash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fenix PD35</a> is a marriage of great design and performance. Its thoughtful design with a dedicated mode button on the side, small form factor and quality of light, makes the winning argument for the top rechargeable flashlight.</p>
<p>With a slim, sleek and cylindrical form factor, the Fenix PD35 looks like a metal cigar. The lean, straight, barrel design makes it easier to hold and slip into the pocket without an awkward bulge. Its anti-roll design was also much better than the four other tactical lights we tested. Fenix wastes no space and designed the metal body only wide enough to snug in the battery.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4937" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/anti-roll-design.gif" alt="the Fenix's anti-roll feature" width="900" height="506" /></p>
<p>Made from an aluminum alloy, this durable material is scratch resistant and can withstand drops and bumps without worry. It is also rated waterproof to IPX-8 standard, meaning it can be underwater up to six and a half feet for 30 minutes. Drop it on the cement or even in a wet puddle, the Fenix PD35 can handle it all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The quality of light is the Fenix PD35’s strongest feature. It has a bright wide cast with a very gradual brightness drop-off from the center. We found this more usable and convenient than the zoom feature. Even though the Fenix PD35 wasn’t the brightest performer compared to the zoom tactical flashlight at full zoom, its light was the equivalent of every other zoom length in one. The brightness is thick and rich with a natural daylight color.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4899 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/side-switch-vs-tail.jpg" alt="side switch vs. tail switch on the Fenix" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/side-switch-vs-tail.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/side-switch-vs-tail-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/side-switch-vs-tail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/side-switch-vs-tail-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/side-switch-vs-tail-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/side-switch-vs-tail-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/side-switch-vs-tail-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/side-switch-vs-tail-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/side-switch-vs-tail-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/side-switch-vs-tail-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The dedicated stainless steel side switch is a thoughtful addition. Many flashlights on the market use the tail switch to turn the device on and off and switch between modes (high, low, strobe, etc.). Accessing the different modes with the tail switch requires a half press, then to lock it in place the button must engage all the way until it clicks.</p>

<p>Separating the power and mode switches alleviated the nuances of a halfway vs. full button press. Holding the button for three seconds switches the rechargeable flashlight between outdoor mode and tactical mode. The outdoor mode features all six light settings from high all the way down to economy and strobe. Tactical mode simplifies the light into high, low and strobe, to provide quick access between modes.</p>
<p>Despite all the great things we had to say, this light does have a couple of minor faults worth mentioning. First off, if the flashlight is running on the highest setting for more than a couple minutes on a fully charged battery, it will run warm. More than 5 minutes on high, this device will start getting hot. Ironically the brand is named Fenix. Luckily there are plenty of less intensive modes that still produce great useable light. Secondly, Fenix is featured at the very top of our budget and does not include a rechargeable battery or charger. With that said, the Fenix &#8211; PD35 is still our favorite and comes highly recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Fenix PD35&#8217;s frame is constructed with durable aluminum alloy and features strong water resistance.</li>
<li>Its bright light drops off gradually from the center to allow good illumination to the outer edges.</li>
<li>A dedicated switch on the side to control light modes offers added convenience.</li>
<li>Five brightness modes to dial in to precise needs.</li>
<li>A slim barrel design easily fits into the pocket without bulk.</li>
<li>The daylight toned light is most pleasing to the eye and represents more natural colors.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="brightest-pick">The brightest: STANLEY &#8211; FATMAX</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4900 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stanley-hero.jpg" alt="Stanley pistol-grip flashlight" width="900" height="675" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stanley-hero.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stanley-hero-610x458.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stanley-hero-768x576.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stanley-hero-300x225.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stanley-hero-295x221.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stanley-hero-885x664.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stanley-hero-360x270.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stanley-hero-375x281.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stanley-hero-414x311.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stanley-hero-320x240.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>By far the brightest light we tested was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OU67Z80/?tag=ybdflash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">STANLEY &#8211; FATMAX 10W LED Lithium-Ion Rechargeable Spotlight</a>, metering at 110,000 lux at three feet. This rechargeable flashlight has a large reflector and a bright LED to throw the light far into the distance. The foldable stand placed on the top of the light can be pushed out so that the light can be placed upside down and prop against a surface.</p>
<p><strong>The STANLEY &#8211; FATMAX operates up to an hour on high and roughly seven hours on low</strong>. Curiously, the light has an auto shut-off feature at the one hour mark to help conserve battery and will only allow the user to leave it on high for several seconds. To use the light continuously, you’ll have to switch to the low mode.</p>

<p>The lithium-ion battery technology allows the flashlight to retain a charge up to 12 months without recharging. The built-in battery and AC/DC charging cords make for a hassle free charging experience. Unlike the tactical rechargeable flashlights, you don’t have to disassemble any pieces for charging. It is also possible to leave the charger plugged in and let the light run continuously.</p>
<p>Instead of including a top-side handle like most other searchlights, the STANLEY FATMAX has a pistol grip and trigger. We’re not convinced this was the best design choice, unless you like walking around with a space laser blaster. Even if the grip was comfortable enough to hold, it isn’t as ergonomic to hold a large device outward and away from your body for long periods of time. Top mounted flashlights can be carried at your side, which would be more ideal for walking around. However, the advantage of having a pistol grip searchlight is the ability to point the light exactly where it is needed.</p>
<p>If you need an unapologetically bright light source, this would be the right option for you. The piercing bright light allows it to travel further than the rest. Its rugged design language. makes it a great option for outdoor activities as well.</p>
<p>Stanley advertises their FATMAX line as innovative tools for working professionals, adding extra quality and functionality to classic designs. Even though there weren’t any unique design features in our model, the searchlight outperformed all the other lights in our brightness test.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>STANLEY &#8211; FATMAX&#8217;s pistol grip provides an ergonomic way to hold and point the light into a specific direction.</li>
<li>The light works with the AC/DC charger plugged in for extended use.</li>
<li>A foldable stand helps prop up the light to keep your hands free.</li>
<li>The bright light can travel can easily shine into the distance.</li>

<h2 id="other-lights">Other finalissts we tested</h2>
<h3>Ivation emergency light</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4945" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ivation-animation.gif" alt="Ivation GIF of auto-switching light" width="900" height="600" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XUIL1KM/?tag=ybdflash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ivation emergency light</a> was the most clever device we tested. In its basic form, the unit serves as a night light when plugged into the wall. When the light is removed from the induction charging cradle, the night light turns off and the opposite end of the light becomes a flashlight. The first time we saw the transition, our inner tech geek got excited. The technology isn’t revolutionary, but it is practical and functional.</p>
<p>The device is made of mostly of plastic with a glossy finish and rounded edges. It doesn’t stack up to any of the tactical flashlights for build quality, but it wasn’t made to bounce off rocks or roll in the dirt. The light can change between three brightness settings, but we found there differences too subtle so we left it on it&#8217;s brightest setting. Its light is bright enough for the indoors where the throw doesn’t need to be incredibly far.</p>
<p>Some consumers have reported that the unit is top heavy when placed in the charging cradle against the wall, making the unit lean slightly forward. We did not experience this with our model, but can see how this would happen on wall outlets that aren’t as snug fitting.</p>
<p>Get the most out of the Ivation Emergency light and utilize the night light feature in hallways or bedrooms. We also enjoy that the charging cradle provides a dedicated home for the flashlight, you’ll always know where to find the light when you need it.</p>
<h3>WASING searchlight</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4906 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wasing.jpg" alt="WASING light in use" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wasing.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wasing-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wasing-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wasing-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wasing-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wasing-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wasing-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wasing-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wasing-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wasing-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V5OI3KO/?tag=ybdflash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WASING spotlight</a> sports a classic searchlight design with a large reflector, husky body and top-mounted handle. There is an option to attach a shoulder strap, which could come in handy to loop around a branch or to throw around your shoulder. The two prong charging cable is attached to the device and can be tucked inside the body. No more losing chargers, hallelujah! The light also comes equipped with a foldable stand with a strip of LED’s for a floodlight option.</p>
<p>The WASING Spotlight had the second highest brightest score, but fell short to the STANLEY FATMAX. Their lighting profiles were fairly similar, but the brightness drops off much more dramatically outside of the center circle. The other main difference was build quality. Even though they were both made of plastic, the STANLEY FATMAX felt more premium with the glossy and matte design aesthetic. The WASING also weighed in 1.4 lbs less and felt more like a toy, which might not entirely be a bad thing.</p>
<p>This might not be the brightest nor the most compact light on the market, but the WASING would make a good companion for outdoor activities such as camping. The strip of LED’s on the foldable stand and the attached charging cable are two small features that make it worth a second look over it&#8217;s competitors.</p>
<h3>Energizer Weatheready emergency light</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4907 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/energizer.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/energizer.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/energizer-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/energizer-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/energizer-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/energizer-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/energizer-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/energizer-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/energizer-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/energizer-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/energizer-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000V6USJQ/?tag=ybdflash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Energizer Weatheready LED emergency light</a> is small and budget friendly. The light is designed to automatically turn on when the power goes out. The device is made of mostly plastic and has retractable prongs that can be pulled in for better grip while in use. Unfortunately this flashlight has very low light output and for that reason we have a hard time recommending it.</p>
<p>We would have liked to see this flashlight double as a night light while plugged in. With that said, the Energizer Weatheready flashlight is budget friendly and would answer the call during an emergency.</p>
<h3>The rest</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4908" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/the-others.jpg" alt="the five other tested lights" width="900" height="675" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/the-others.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/the-others-610x458.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/the-others-768x576.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/the-others-300x225.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/the-others-295x221.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/the-others-885x664.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/the-others-360x270.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/the-others-375x281.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/the-others-414x311.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/the-others-320x240.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Outside of the Fenix PD35, the remaining rechargeable tactical flashlights we tested shared many of the same design languages with one another. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JE329YO/?tag=ybdflash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OxyLED</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RT73GIU/?tag=ybdflash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Refun</a> tactical flashlights appear to use the same manufacturer for their parts. All of the metal components from the zoom shaft to the tail switch look the similar, except for subtle differences in dimensions. The same story goes for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ECVB6P0/?tag=ybdflash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PeakPlus</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VZT2WP6/?tag=ybdflash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Outlite</a> tactical flashlights. The differences are a little more apparent when examining the placement, shape and color of the reflector, which reflected in the performance.</p>
<p>With the design being so similar in these four models, we chose to only discuss the OxyLED tactical flashlight because it was the brightest and most natural looking light. The Refun, Outlite and Peakplus, all had slightly cooler tones, which became very apparent when shining against white objects. We found these hues undesirable as it makes it a slightly harder to distinguish the items being illuminated.</p>
<p>There is really nothing to gripe about when it comes to build quality. The aircraft aluminum is a proven standard for tactical flashlights and is no different in the OxyLED tactical flashlight. Every click on the tail switch is snappy and responsive. Halfway presses to switch modes are fairly accurate. The zoom mechanics pull out and retract with smooth resistance.</p>
<p>In many respects, the OxyLED tactical flashlight shines a very similar light to the Fenix PD35. The main difference is that the Fenix is able to achieve the brightness of almost all the zooms in one mode. With the zoom mechanic found in all the other flashlights we tested, users must make a decision to have a bright or wide light.</p>
<p>If size is most important to you than look no further than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V7T1YRQ/?tag=ybdflash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">J5 tactical flashlight</a>. This was the smallest light we tested in the lineup. It is 1.7 inches shorter than the Fenix PD35. Even though it was the least bright of the tactical lights, the amount of illumination is still usable in most scenarios. Build quality is on part with all of the tactical models, even in its petite size. The best part about the J5 tactical flashlight is that it takes the super accessible AA batteries.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4958" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lights-comparison-data.png" alt="overall comparison data chart" width="900" height="947" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lights-comparison-data.png 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lights-comparison-data-610x642.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lights-comparison-data-768x808.png 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lights-comparison-data-285x300.png 285w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lights-comparison-data-295x310.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lights-comparison-data-885x931.png 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lights-comparison-data-360x379.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lights-comparison-data-375x395.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lights-comparison-data-414x436.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lights-comparison-data-320x337.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Flashlights all perform the same task so design and performance go a long way. We explored several categories, each one trying to distinguish itself with it&#8217;s design. Tactical lights embrace its refined reputation with a rugged and compact build. Searchlights opt for ultimate power and hands free usage. Emergency lights are built for convenience and readiness.</p>
<p>Our pick for the best all around rechargeable flashlight is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DR9GWX0/?tag=ybdflash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fenix PD35</a> for its quality of light, solid construction, functionality and good looks. It performs with the best of them and makes a great companion as you embark in the dark edges of this earth.</p>

<h2 id="why-we-are-qualified">Why trust us</h2>
<p>In our efforts to determine which night-lights are best, we spent more than 35 hours reading studies, news articles, blog posts, forums, and Reddit threads to see what the consensus was among experts and users alike.</p>
<p>Once our research helped us determine who we needed to speak with, we contacted several experts and researchers to get our information directly from the source.</p>
<p>We spoke extensively with Tracy Bedrosian, a Ph.D in Neuroscience from Ohio State University who is also now a researcher at the <a href="http://www.salk.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Salk Institute for Biological Studies</a>. She went into detail with us about why the lights we use in the home matter, as well as the negative impacts associated with using the wrong types of light.</p>
<p>We were able to verify the information we discussed with Dr. Bedrosian through our own research, and we feel confident that the conclusions we came to with the assistance of the doctor are valid for the purposes of determining which night-lights are best for your home.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-found">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>In order to find the best night-lights available on the market, we first narrowed down the potential candidates to only those that used LED bulbs. <strong>LED bulbs are widely regarded as better than the other types of bulbs available for night-lights</strong>, for a few reasons:</p>
<p>First off, LED bulbs produce significantly less heat than incandescent bulbs. In addition to making LED bulbs safer, this also means that they are more energy-efficient, since more energy is being used to generate light instead of wasted heat.</p>

<p>LED bulbs also last much longer than other bulbs commonly used in night-lights. While some night-lights, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002VK91I4/?tag=ybdnight-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AmerTac Cool Blue light</a> claims that it will last “forever”, night-lights such as these simply don’t produce enough light to really be useful. Even more importantly, they utilize blue light, which our research indicates is the <i>worst</i> possible light for hormonal balance and your circadian rhythm.</p>
<p><strong>For night-lights that will be used in the bedroom,</strong> <b>it is strongly preferable that the lights are red, and have as close to zero white or blue light as possible</b>. The impact of blue light in particular while sleeping has been linked to numerous health problems.</p>
<p>Exceptions can be made for night-lights that are used in hallways or bathrooms. While red light is ideal, sometimes red light simply does not illuminate larger areas enough to be useful. For situations like that, white light is an acceptable — but by no means ideal — alternative.</p>
<p>It was also important that the night-lights produced sufficient light to be useful, while not creating <i>so much light</i> that they would impair sleep. We used the Pyle PLMT Light Meter to measure how much light each night-light produced, as well as how much that light decreased at specific distance intervals.</p>
<p>We discussed the use of this light sensor with Dr. Bedrosian, who said that, for our purposes, it would be a reliable measure of light emitted by the night-lights we tested.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-247" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pyle-light-meter.jpg" alt="pyle-light-meter" width="800" height="530" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pyle-light-meter.jpg 800w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pyle-light-meter-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pyle-light-meter-180x119@2x.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pyle-light-meter-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pyle-light-meter-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pyle-light-meter-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pyle-light-meter-180x119.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pyle-light-meter-320x212.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pyle-light-meter-295x195@2x.jpg 590w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><strong>Finally, night-lights should have an automatic “on/off” sensor, which turns the night-lights on when it is dark, and off when it is light.</strong> In addition to saving unnecessary energy use, this also ensures that the night-lights will be automatically lit only when you need them.</p>
<p>With these criteria in mind, we found the night-lights that were most highly-regarded among consumers and experts, then found the best products among those that also matched the specifications described directly above.</p>
<p>All of the night-lights we tested are highly-rated. While we ultimately chose what we believe to be the overall “best” product, each of the six products are useful and worth purchasing in the right context.</p>

<h2 id="really-matter">Does the night-light you use really matter?</h2>
<p>In a word: Yes.</p>
<p>While researching which night-lights are best, we spoke at length with Dr. Bedrosian, one of the two lead researchers on the 2013 study we mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>The study, which was conducted primarily by the Department of Neuroscience at Ohio State University’s Wexner Medical Center, and funded in large part by a fellowship granted to Tracy Bedrosian, provided key insights into the very real dangers that too much light — and particularly blue spectrum light — can have on both children and adults.</p>
<p>That study concluded that blue spectrum light — which is also a part of “regular” white light from a light bulb — can cause of number of severe health issues, including hormone imbalances, disrupted circadian rhythm, suppressed melatonin secretion, and even a potential increase in cancer risk.</p>
<p>Adults and children who regularly sleep near blue spectrum light are also at risk for negative mood changes, a slower metabolism, compromised immune function, decreased quality of sleep, and overall reduced energy levels.</p>
<p>The bottom line:<strong> If you’re going to have a night-light in your room, it should be limited to red spectrum light</strong>. If you have children you are buying a night-light for, this is even more imperative. If you&#8217;re reading in bed with a lamp or a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-book-light/">book light</a>, consider sticking to something warmer or more red as well.</p>
<h2 id="who-should-buy">Who should buy new night-lights?</h2>
<p>It’s understandable that the argument of “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” might be compelling for anyone who already has night-lights in their home. For those who already have night-lights and aren’t sure if it’s worth replacing them, we encourage you to take a look at the <a href="https://news.osu.edu/news/2013/08/06/lightcolor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">summary of the study</a> conducted by Doctors Randy Nelson and Tracy Bedrosian at Ohio State University.</p>
<p>The study goes into more detail about the negative effects that sleeping with white or blue light nearby can have — and there are numerous other studies that support their claims as well.</p>
<p>When deciding whether or not you want night-lights in your home, it’s worth considering if a night-light would be beneficial in your bathroom (so you can avoid turning on the main light in the middle of the night) or for a hallway (so you don’t accidentally stub your toe on the way to the bathroom).</p>
<p>A red night-light can also be useful for a child who doesn’t like sleeping in darkness. <strong>Night-lights are substantially better than leaving a television on to comfort your child — if for no other reason than the blue spectrum light that they’ll be avoiding.</strong></p>
<p>One thing worth mentioning is that night-lights are reasonably affordable, even when purchasing night-lights with LED bulbs. That, coupled with the fact that LED bulbs in most night-lights are rated to last for around a decade with regular use, along with an annual electrical cost around 25 cents, means that anyone on the fence about the benefits of a night-light in their bedroom, bathroom, or hallway can likely justify the expense.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Most of the quantitative criteria — such as bulb type, bulb life expectancy, manufacturer reputation, inclusion of an automatic on/off sensor, and color of light emitted (among others) — was determined <i>before</i> bringing any of the products in for in-house testing.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, each of the six products we tested in-house are great products, and you really can’t go wrong with any of them. That being said, we still wanted to find the best overall night-light, so we used a combination of qualitative testing along with some more quantitative comparisons to do exactly that.</p>
<p>We also looked at the overall build quality of each product. We found that, despite the relative affordability of each of the night-lights, the build quality stood out on both of the Maxxima products we tested.</p>
<p>Finally, we measured the amount of light emitted (measured in lux) by each night-light at a distance of six inches, two feet, three feet, and six feet — a reasonable amount of distance between a bed and a wall socket.</p>
<p>Ideally a night-light provides a high level of light over a short distance (for example, six inches to two or three feet away), then quickly drops off so as not to be particularly visible from bed. We visualized the results below:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8437" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/night-light-brightness-measurement-chart-1.jpg" alt="night-light Brightness Measurement Chart" width="880" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/night-light-brightness-measurement-chart-1.jpg 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/night-light-brightness-measurement-chart-1-610x416.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/night-light-brightness-measurement-chart-1-768x524.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/night-light-brightness-measurement-chart-1-300x205.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/night-light-brightness-measurement-chart-1-295x201.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/night-light-brightness-measurement-chart-1-360x245.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/night-light-brightness-measurement-chart-1-375x256.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/night-light-brightness-measurement-chart-1-414x282.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/night-light-brightness-measurement-chart-1-320x218.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/night-light-brightness-measurement-chart-1-300x205@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Measured in lux (a standard unit of brightness), all of our finalists drop off the scale long before they reach six feet. The Maxxima Swivel generates light the furthest — measuring just under one lux at three feet, while the rest all disappear entirely at two feet or less.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002SVANCY/?tag=ybdnight-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Maxxima Swivel</a> also provides <em>by far</em> the most light at short range. <strong>So t</strong><strong>he Maxxima Swivel is a great solution for hallways or bathrooms</strong>,<strong> where significant light is needed in a narrow area.</strong></p>
<p>In addition, all of the finalists we tested will have a minimal impact on sleep, since the lux they generate drops off well before six feet.</p>
<h2 id="our-best-pick">Best overall: Maxxima &#8211; LED Multi-Color</h2>
<p>While all six of the night-lights we tested serve a purpose, none of them are as multi-purpose as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00R8H0DVY/?tag=ybdnight-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Maxxima &#8211; LED Multi-Color Night Light</a>. We liked this night-light above all the others because it is affordable, has great build quality, and offers greater versatility than any other product we tested.</p>

<p>In terms of affordability, the cost for this night-light on Amazon is $5.99 for one, and $10.99 for two. In addition, the LED bulb is rated to last for 100,000 hours, which translates to approximately eleven and a half years of continuous use. The electrical cost for LED bulbs is negligible as well — with estimates around 25 cents per year with typical use.</p>
<p>The “multi” feature of the Maxxima &#8211; LED Multi-Color Night Light is easy to use as well: <strong>There is a small switch on the front of the light which can be used to quickly and easily change between red, white, and blue lighting</strong>. While we don’t have any specific use-cases for the blue setting, we are sure that the setting is appealing to some segment of consumers.</p>
<p>The red lighting is the ideal setting for most situations, particularly the bedroom, since the research we read through and discussed with Dr. Bedrosian indicated a substantially-reduced risk of any negative impact, especially when compared to blue wavelengths in white and (obviously) blue lights.</p>
<p>That being said, there are downsides to red lighting — namely, red light isn’t that bright. While that’s a good thing in the context of a bedroom night-light, as well as for those who can safely navigate to the restroom with the relative dimness of red light , it can pose a problem in situations where more light is needed.</p>

The LED bulb is rated to last for 100,000 hours and includes a doctor-approved red light.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00R8H0DVY/?tag=ybdnight-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Fortunately, the Maxxima night-light also has the capability of producing brighter light with its white LED bulb. This setting is ideal for hallways, bathrooms, and anywhere else where additional light is needed to safely navigate. Even better, we didn’t find the white light to be particularly harsh, so brief exposure shouldn’t dramatically impact sleep patterns.</p>
<p>Although a relatively minor point, we found the auto on/off sensor to be particularly effective as well. The sensor seemed to be well-tuned, quicking turning on the night-light when ambient light dimmed.</p>
<p><strong>We also appreciated that, unlike other night-lights with an ambient light sensor,</strong> <strong>the Maxxima didn’t flicker when it was on the border between turning on and turning off</strong>. Instead, the light turns on and off gradually.</p>
<p>The light from the Maxxima LED Multi-Color also strikes an effective balance between providing enough light to be useful, while also dissipating quickly enough that it is unlikely to have any substantial impact on sleep.</p>
<p>With its long lifespan, affordable pricing, and versatility, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00R8H0DVY/?tag=ybdnight-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Maxxima LED Multi-Color Night Light</a> was easily the best pick of our finalists.</p>
<h2 id="young-children">Best for children: Kinderglo &#8211; Portable</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/moon.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>While the Maxxima LED Multi-Color can be used effectively as a night-light in a young child’s room, we thought that some people would like to have a night-light that is a little more tailored to their child.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0043G5T08/?tag=ybdnight-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kinderglo &#8211; Portable Night Light</a> is widely regarded by everyone from parenting blogs to Amazon reviewers to be among the best night-lights for children, so we wanted to test it out for ourselves.</p>
<p>The build quality of this product is fantastic, especially when you consider that under $30 on Amazon. This night-light utilizes BPA and lead free plastic, and is made with soft touch materials. We tested the Moon model but it comes in a variety of animal shapes.</p>

<p>The recharging base works well, and it took about eight hours to fully charge the light. <strong>A full charge will last throughout the night without any problems, and the light can either be set to turn off automatically after 30 minutes, or simply stay on until the battery dies (or it’s turned off).</strong></p>
<p>While the Kinderglo offers red, blue, and green light, as well as an option to shift between the colors, we strongly recommend leaving it only on the red light setting (for the health reasons we went over earlier in this post).</p>
<p>If you are looking for a night-light that is well suited for infants, toddlers, and very young children, this can be a great alternative to the Maxxima LED Multi-Color, since it also adds an element of interactivity for your child.</p>
<h2 id="honorable-mention">Honorable mention: Maxxima &#8211; LED with Swivel Head</h2>

<p>Although not as versatile as Maxxima’s multi-color night-light, we were so impressed by this night-light that we had to give it an Honorable mention. The Maxxima &#8211; LED Night Light with Swivel Head is a cheap ($3.59) light that provides sufficient light for a bathroom, and to a lesser extent a hallway.</p>
<p>Just like the Maxxima LED Multi-Color, the Swivel night-light has an auto on/off switch which prevents the light from being on when it is not needed. <strong>We found the swivel to be particularly useful for the bathroom, because</strong> <strong>the light can be directed towards the sink or toilet, and not directly into your eyes</strong>.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002SVANCY/?tag=ybdnight-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/maxxima-swivel-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/maxxima-swivel-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/maxxima-swivel-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/maxxima-swivel-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/maxxima-swivel-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/maxxima-swivel-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/maxxima-swivel-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/maxxima-swivel-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/maxxima-swivel.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Also Great: Maxxima - LED with Swivel Head</h3><p>A good choice for the bathroom due to its swivel head and low cost.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002SVANCY/?tag=ybdnight-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>While this is a great night-light, we chose the Maxxima LED Multi-Color over this one for two main reasons: The light is a little too bright and directed to be an effective night-light, and more importantly, there isn’t a red light setting available.</p>
<p>That being said, for under $4, this is a great night-light for the bathroom, or a small hallway where stubbing your toe is a risk you’d like to avoid.</p>
<h2 id="other-night-lights">Other finalists we tested</h2>
<p>The other three night-lights we tested in-house were great as well. However, they were each limited, or outdone, in one way or another by our top three picks. That being said, they are worth taking a look at, as each does fulfill a specific niche.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-245" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spoka-and-gummygoods-nightlight.jpg" alt="spoka-and-gummygoods-night-light" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spoka-and-gummygoods-nightlight.jpg 800w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spoka-and-gummygoods-nightlight-610x406.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spoka-and-gummygoods-nightlight-180x120@2x.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spoka-and-gummygoods-nightlight-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spoka-and-gummygoods-nightlight-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spoka-and-gummygoods-nightlight-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spoka-and-gummygoods-nightlight-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spoka-and-gummygoods-nightlight-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spoka-and-gummygoods-nightlight-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spoka-and-gummygoods-nightlight-295x197@2x.jpg 590w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002L0VOP2/?tag=ybdnight-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gummygoods Night Light</a> works similarly to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0043G5T08/?tag=ybdnight-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kinderglo</a>. However, the fact that it uses AA batteries turned out to be a major, and negative, distinguishing factor. While the Kinderglo can be recharged on its base every day, the Gummygoods night-light needs to either be set to automatically turn off, or you need to be prepared to buy a lot of AA batteries (or spend extra money on rechargeable AA batteries).</p>
<p>On the plus side, the bear is undeniably cute, and the red light can be turned on and off just by squeezing it — something that young children would likely find fun and comforting.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003W8Z6NS/?tag=ybdnight-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SPÖKA from IKEA</a> has an undeniable “cuteness” to it, and the red light is just bright enough to see where you’re going when walking around. It also uses an internal AAA battery (which is included, along with a charger).</p>
<p><strong>Most importantly,</strong> <strong>the light only lasts for about five hours on a full charge, which means that when your child wakes up at 3am, they won’t have their night-light to comfort them.</strong> It also means you’ll be stuck choosing between turning on your bright main light or fumbling around in the darkness — which really defeats the purpose of having a night-light in the first place.</p>
<p>Finally, there isn’t really anything wrong with the Safety 1st LED Nightlight. It’s cheap ($7.99 for two <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009UQPSE8/?tag=ybdnight-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">on Amazon</a>), doesn’t get hot, and provides a decent amount of light for hallways and bathrooms. However, there is no red LED option, and the light it generates is not focused in any way.</p>
<p>In addition, Safety 1st’s selling point that their night-light is “cool to the touch” is legitimate, but is equally true for <i>every</i> LED night-light, including our Top Pick and Honorable Mention.</p>
<h2 id="long-term">Long-term testing notes</h2>
<p>We initially published this post in March of 2016, and since then we have continued to use both the Maxxima night-lights. They continue to work as well as they did the day we first tested them. They have caused no hassles of any kind and have required zero maintenance &#8212; they simply light the hallway and bathroom.</p>
<p>One of the nice things about switching to a LED night-light is the fact that the bulbs should last at least a decade or two. Unlike incandescent bulbs of the past, which might have already needed replacing, our LED night-light bulbs have only utilized a small fraction of their overall lifespan.</p>

<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Not everyone wants, or needs, a night-light in their room. However, if you do plan to have a night-light in your room or the room of your child (and a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-rechargeable-flashlight/">flashlight</a> just won&#8217;t cut it), you are <i>substantially</i> better off if you have red light instead of white or blue light.</p>
<p>White and blue light has been scientifically proven to cause a number of health problems, and in today’s busy world the last thing anyone wants to do is cause harm to themselves or their children.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00R8H0DVY/?tag=ybdnight-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Maxxima LED Multi-Color Night Light</a> provides a safe, warm light that is ideal for a night-light in your room or the room of your child (on the red setting), as a soft white light for hallways, bathrooms, kitchens, etc., and a blue light that probably has a use for someone, somewhere (just not in your bedroom!).</p>
<p>If you want a night-light more tailored to your young child, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0043G5T08/?tag=ybdnight-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kinderglo Portable Night Light</a> is easy to recharge, completely safe for young children, and lasts throughout the night.</p>
