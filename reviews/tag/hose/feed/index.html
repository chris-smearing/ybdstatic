				<description><![CDATA[After six weeks of testing, we think the best reel for efficiently spooling and storing your garden hose is the Suncast - Hose Hideaway]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter six weeks of washing cars, watering plants, hosing off toys and performing other backyard chores with five contenders, we think the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FJF8P8//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Suncast &#8211; Swivel Hose Hideaway</a> is the best hose reel. This &#8220;hose hideaway&#8221; not only keeps your hose out of sight, it also makes coiling and using your hose much easier than any other affordable reel we could find. For a more heavy-duty reel that will survive longer but doesn&#8217;t have as many features, the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00080FGME//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Liberty &#8211; 703-1</a> is hard to beat.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Research for this category was tricky, since there are so many different models and styles available, and since the flaws that kill a hose reel depend mostly on how much abuse you&#8217;re putting it through.</p>
<p>As always, we scanned the retailer pages for ratings and user reviews and found that most people were fairly forgiving of garden hose reel design; so long as a reel works and doesn&#8217;t break right away, most people are happy with what they get.</p>
<p>In the end, we tried three reels made of plastic and two made from steel. We splurged a bit on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00261PYMA//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eley &#8211; Rapid Reel</a>, if only to see how much better a really expensive model is.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVVDasQuyeU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Powerwind</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jh7iGsdrYI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aquawind</a> features on other Suncaster models looked like features that would make the reel too much of a pain to set up and use for the little benefit offered, so we skipped them.</p>
<p>We also checked into designs that are basically <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0742M8X6N?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">air hose reels</a>. They&#8217;re retractable and durable, but you&#8217;ll see <a href="https://terrylove.com/forums/index.php?threads/air-hose-reel-used-as-garden-hose-reel.20407/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a dramatic reduction in flow</a> with the tiny-diameter hoses they come with. We decided to only look at reels that will work with the hose you already have.</p>
<p>A big, heavy-duty garden hose cart with wheels sounds like a great idea, but the affordable products we found have terrible reviews. Reviews of the four-wheel carts we looked at had reports of nightmarishly difficult assembly and raised big questions about long-term durability. We bought two plastic two-wheeled carts because they’re cheap and popular; the metal two-wheel designs all seem to have stability issues and even those cost a lot more money than we expected.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>For a month of spring yard work, we used these hose reels with 50 feet of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-garden-hose/" rel="noopener">our favorite Craftsman rubber hose</a> and two 100-foot lengths of <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/WaterWorks-5-8-in-Dia-x-100-ft-Commercial-Duty-Garden-Hose-WWMFT58100/203895464" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the cheapest, stiffest hose we could find</a>.</p>
<p>Setting up each hose reel required slightly different steps, but only the most expensive hose reel actually required any setup work: The Eley came as a box of parts and fasteners. (They were very nice fasteners, though, and the custom-made giant Allen wrench is well made.)</p>
<p>We then moved through a series of specific tests to pinpoint any strengths or flaws in the designs of these reels.</p>
<h3>Build quality</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-12105 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup.jpg" alt="Close-up of hose fitting" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
We ranked the reels based on how we felt about the materials and design after testing. All the plastic reels scored a three here; we didn&#8217;t note anything that made a particular reel feel sub-standard. The Eley, naturally, scored a perfect five — it&#8217;s practically a showpiece for careful manufacturing with good materials.</p>
<h3>Coiling and uncoiling at capacity</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hose-reel-clip.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The way a reel coils and pays out hose is really the most important thing about it and we were surprised at the way our most expensive reel, the Eley, bunched up and overlapped the hose as we used it.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Smart Trak system on the Suncaster &#8211; Swivel Hose Hideaway won us over immediately with fast, even, tight coiling. It&#8217;s not perfect; if you feed a tight kink into the guide it&#8217;ll probably mess up your winding job. That said, if you lay out your hose so it has room to untwist, even a stiff vinyl hose will wind very easily.</p>
<p>We tested the capacity of the reels with the same hose to see how they compare to each other: the manufacturers rate their reel capacity based on some unknown ⅝&#8221; hose and they don&#8217;t specify how picky they were about neat winding.</p>
<h3>Leak tests</h3>

The cheap hoses we tested with only had basic gaskets and we tightened by hand.</p>
<p>The Liberty and Ames reels were the only ones that dripped. The Liberty stopped dripping after we gave the inlet fittings (where the included leader hose connects) some more torque by hand.</p>
<p>The Ames &#8211; Fold &amp; Store was leaking at the elbow-shaped outlet fitting where your <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-garden-hose/">garden hose</a> attaches to the reel and because of the side-pressure our stiff hose put on it, the Ames never stopped leaking while the hose was coiled.</p>
<h2 id="best-for-long">Top pick: Suncast &#8211; Swivel Hose Hideaway</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FJF8P8//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Suncast &#8211; CPLSSM200B Swivel Hose Hideway</a> is, all things considered, just a plastic garden hose reel. This model has a limited lifespan and reviews indicate the plastic hose fitting on the side won&#8217;t survive abuse. It&#8217;s not going to spontaneously fall apart but manage your expectations.</p>
<p>Keeping that in mind, this is an amazing reel for long hoses. We picked this model because it has a built-in winding guide (called a &#8220;level-winder unit&#8221; in industrial spooling applications for rope or cable) that keeps the hose evenly distributed so it doesn&#8217;t bunch or overlap on the reel.</p>
<p>We used two of the cheapest, stiffest 100-foot-long hoses we could find and this reel wrapped up 240 feet without any need to rewrap or correct any overlaps on the spool that could cause binding.</p>
<p>The swiveling base of this hose reel is another great feature when you&#8217;ve got a super-long hose that you&#8217;re dragging all over the yard. The swivel means the hose can roll or unroll easily no matter what side of your lawn you go to, even if you stake down the base.</p>
<p>Note that no stakes came with ours, thought the parts list says they should be included. We really do recommend staking down a reel with an extra-long hose. If you don&#8217;t, this box is light enough to drag across the grass or concrete when you&#8217;re struggling with a long hose.</p>

It's the only reel we found for less than $100 with this feature, and the swiveling base also makes working with a long hose much easier.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FJF8P8//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Suncaster has a version of this reel with <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Suncast-225-ft-Smart-Trak-Wicker-Hideaway-Hose-Reel-with-Brass-In-Out-Tube-CPLSMW212/206093654" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">upgraded brass fittings</a> (though without the swiveling base) that we considered, but on the whole, the parts upgraded (internal tubes and threads) don&#8217;t seem to be the first to wear out. It&#8217;s the retaining clips that keep the inlet assembly together that give up first if you put a strain on the inlet hose, so we wish they would reinforce that part instead.</p>
<p>The biggest beef we have with this design is that the inlet hose fitting doesn&#8217;t have a spinning coupler: attach the hose to the reel side before you attach to your supply, or you&#8217;ll find yourself trying to figure out how to spin the entire box around to get the hose screwed in.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Suncast &#8211; Swivel Hose Hideaway easily wraps even 200-foot-long hoses in a neat, even spool.</li>
<li>This model effectively turns a giant pile of hose into an innocuous piece of yard furniture.</li>
<li>The swiveling base makes using and coiling a long hose that much easier.</li>
<li>You can usually find this for less than $70, so it&#8217;s a bargain for its size and features.</li>
<li>Long-term durability concerns are our only real pause.</li>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00080FGME//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> 703-1 is an entry-level steel reel from Liberty</a> and it represents a great value for someone who&#8217;s tired of plastic garden tools.</p>
<p>Compared to the plastic reels, this is a bit heavier and inspires a lot more confidence. It isn&#8217;t that attractive — the beige powder-coating is fine, but the mixed zinc-plated and cast-brass fittings on the side are kind of hideous. You could mount this on your wall, but if that&#8217;s your plan you should know that Liberty makes more <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GUJT7CC/?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">decorative options</a> that aren&#8217;t available in a freestanding style.</p>

<p>Compared to the Eley (which will set you back $100 more) this isn&#8217;t as nice, but the parallel side flanges on this reel caused fewer problems when winding. It&#8217;s also balanced lower to the ground, so it&#8217;s less likely to tip over if you yank hard on the hose.</p>
<p>The fittings all appear to be off-the-shelf plumbing parts, which means long-term maintenance should be simple. Everything about this reel is a noticeable step down in look and feel from the Eley, but functionally it&#8217;s a better reel.</p>
<p>If you want metal construction and a level-winder guide like our top pick, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N4R6LZH?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Liberty sells one, model 707</a>, but it&#8217;s wall-mount-only and a lot more expensive.</p>
<p>This 703-1 reel is wide and sturdy and only minimal assembly was required. (A couple of wrenches are required for the lock-nuts on the handle.) It leaked around the inlet when we first assembled it, but after we tightened the fitting a bit more it never so much as dripped.</p>
<p>The most frustrating thing about this reel is pushing the rubber feet through the holes in the base; you&#8217;ll almost certainly need pliers to get them through. There are four cheap lawn stakes included if you want to keep this on grass instead of concrete.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Liberty &#8211; 703-1 is well-built but still affordable.</li>
<li>Steel components with a powder-coat finish should survive decades of gardening.</li>
<li>Can be wall-mounted or free-standing.</li>
<li>Capacity for almost 200 feet of hose.</li>
<li>Doesn&#8217;t help you wind neatly, but doesn&#8217;t get in the way.</li>
</ul>

Also from Suncast, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00023BHRA//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hosemobile</a> is a clever little hose cart that fits in any budget, but doesn&#8217;t disappoint when you use it.</p>

<p>Compared with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FL1KBC/?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ames &#8211; Fold &amp; Store</a>, it&#8217;s actually pretty shocking how much better this is. The fixes are little things, like the angle of the outlet fitting where your hose connects: it&#8217;s made from the same cheap plastic, but the angle Suncast chose means it doesn&#8217;t force your hose sideways and cause leaks the way the Ames does.</p>
<p>This wheeled design doesn&#8217;t fold up and won&#8217;t take much abuse, but since the reel is only big enough for a smaller hose capacity, you&#8217;re not likely to overload the plastic construction. You could probably load 175 feet of hose if you carefully guide it into an even wrap, but 100-150 feet is a more realistic length if you&#8217;re just spooling quickly.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no guide here to help your hose wrap evenly, but the slot in the handle does have two notches that effectively lock a 5/8&#8243; hose in place. That and other little design touches, like the foot-pedal that sticks out to help you stabilize the reel, help make up for the materials.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Suncast &#8211; Hosemobile was the cheapest hose reel we tested, but it&#8217;s far from the worst.</li>
<li>This isn&#8217;t going to hold a really long and heavy hose, but 150 feet is more than enough for most of us.</li>
<li>The wheels and light weight make it easy to move your coil of hose from the backyard to the front.</li>
</ul>

We bought the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00261PYMA//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eley &#8211; Rapid Reel </a>to see just how much better a hose reel can get if you throw money at the problem. The answer kind of surprised us: this is the nicest hose reel, but it actually doesn&#8217;t do its job as well as the less expensive models we tested.</p>
<p>As expected, the components included are all impressive. Even the purpose-built two-size allen wrench included for assembly is impressive: heavy-duty and with a nice finish. The cast-brass fittings on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0056IVTVU/?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the leader hose are gorgeous</a> and easy to grip without tools, a nice upgrade over other cheap pack-in hoses.</p>
<p>The fact that there&#8217;s an adjustable reel brake is a testament to the thought that goes into these reels. Likewise, the loop of webbing that secures the hose to the reel is a nice touch. Neither of those features is really necessary, though.</p>
<p>This reel will undoubtedly survive more weather (and abuse) than a cheap plastic reel, but an extra hundred dollars doesn&#8217;t solve all the problems in the world of garden hose reels. The sloping flanges on either side push the hose toward the center as it winds; if you aren&#8217;t careful when quickly winding a long hose it might start to overlap itself.</p>
<p>We squeezed on 215 feet of hose and the reel still turned freely, but even at 150 feet, the overlapping problem is frustrating. Eley rates this model for 175 feet of standard ⅝&#8221; hose, but we wouldn&#8217;t recommend it as-sold for much more than 125 feet.</p>
<p>Eley sells an <a href="https://www.eleyhosereels.com/products/extra-capacity-kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extra-capacity kit</a> to make the reel wider for long hoses and that would make the overlapping and bunching less problematic, but that brings the total cost for your stationary hose reel north of $200. On the bright side, installing the kit gives you an excuse to use that really nice allen wrench again!</p>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FL1KBC//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ames &#8211; Fold &amp; Store</a> hose cart checks a lot of boxes on the feature list: it folds for storage, it has wheels to make dragging it around easier, it has a storage bin in the bottom and the slot in the handle even works as a built-in winding guide.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that great in person, though. We&#8217;re not going to fault a plastic hose reel for being made from plastic, but the way the outlet fitting sits on the reel means there&#8217;s a lot of strain on it if you use a stiff hose. One of our cheap hoses has a kink-preventing strain relief sleeve that makes the end five inches very stiff; the sideways force against the fitting on this reel make it leak pretty severely.</p>
<p>Cutting off the strain-relief sleeve made our hose fit better, though it still leaked. Some thread-sealing tape or an extra gasket could probably take care of all the leaking, but you shouldn&#8217;t have to use extra tools to get a fit that doesn&#8217;t leak.</p>
<p>The way this reel sits in the frame, the side flanges don&#8217;t have any extra room to bend or expand out before they&#8217;ll start to rub as the reel turns. The flanges are bar-shaped rather than full circles (which does mean it takes up less space when folded), so when you get more than 100 feet of hose loaded they make a repeated &#8220;thwack, thwack, thwack&#8221; as you&#8217;re turning the handle.</p>
<p>The slot in the handle doesn&#8217;t actually do much to keep your hose tidy on the reel, either; mostly it just keeps your <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-garden-hose-nozzle/">garden hose nozzle</a> in place for storage.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you want a reel that will survive decades of sun, rain and abuse, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00080FGME/?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Liberty 703-1</a> is well-built and affordable. It held almost 200 feet of bulky, stiff hose and it should be easy to repair or replace the metal fittings.</p>
<p>For those looking for something more portable, we liked the cheap and easy-to-find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00023BHRA/?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Suncast &#8211; Hosemobile</a>. It&#8217;s not going to survive the apocalypse, but if you&#8217;ve got a smaller roll of hose that you want to move from yard to yard this reel will do the job.</p>
<p>If we had to choose one best reel for all our hose needs, though, we&#8217;d take the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FJF8P8//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Suncast &#8211; CPLSSM200B</a> Swivel Hose Hideaway. The Smart Trak guide system does a great job of feeding the spool evenly and the swiveling base means you can move around the yard and pull your hose straight off the reel, never binding it against the side.</p>

<h2 id="why-qualified">Why trust us?</h2>
<p>We read through gardening forums, garden hose reviews, and the r/gardening subreddit to determine what consumers care about most when choosing a garden hose. We then spent 30 hours over the course of six weeks testing each of our garden hose finalists.</p>
<p>Since we also reviewed the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-garden-hose-nozzle/">best garden hose nozzles</a> at the same time, we were able to test the compatibility of each garden hose with a wide range of popular garden hose nozzles.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-found">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>In order to determine which of our garden hose finalists was best overall, we ran each of them through a series of tests designed to analyze how each garden hose would perform in real-life situations. This was aided by actual watering and gardening of our front and backyard over the course of a month and a half.</p>
<p><strong>A lot of what we measured had to do with the overall ergonomics of each garden hose</strong>. We made note of which garden hoses would tend to get stuck while being pulled around the yard, as well as how easy &#8212; or unwieldy &#8212; they were while being dragged around. We also looked at how easy it was to attach and detach each hose to the spigot, as well as to each of the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-garden-hose-nozzle/">garden hose nozzles</a> we were testing.</p>
<p>We recorded how often each hose kinked, which we also tested by measuring how tightly we could squeeze each hose before water flow would stop.</p>
<p>We measured water flow from each garden hose as well. We tested this by measuring how long it took each garden hose to fill a five gallon bucket of water, and the distance each garden hose could spray when held horizontally at a height of five feet.</p>
<p>Finally, we considered the overall build quality, including the materials used, and the durability of each hose &#8212; particularly in very hot and very cold conditions.</p>

<h2 id="why-50">Why we only tested 50-foot hoses</h2>
<p>If you look through our list of the six best garden hoses, you’ll notice that all of the hoses we tested are 50 feet long. This wasn’t an accident.</p>
<p>While researching what gardeners and others who use garden hoses look for, we found that 50 feet appeared to be the sweet spot for garden hoses in almost all situations.</p>
<p>For the most part, 25 feet usually isn’t quite long enough to be useful as an all-around tool &#8212; with the notable exception of those who live in an apartment or townhome and only have a small porch or patio. On top of that, the difference in cost between 25 and 50 foot hoses typically isn’t all that significant.</p>
<p>On the other hand, 100-foot hoses are typically longer than most people need. More importantly, 100-foot hoses are significantly more expensive than 50-foot hoses, sometimes they’re more than double the price!</p>
<p>A 50-foot hose is the ideal size for a number of reasons. First and foremost, most people simply don’t need more length than that. For those that do, we think that simply connecting another 50-foot hose is preferable to a 100 foot hose.</p>
<p>If a 100-foot hose leaks, rusts, or otherwise wears out, you have to replace the entire thing. If one of your 50 foot hoses breaks down, you can simply replace the one that breaks. In addition, walking around the yard with a 100-foot garden hose in tow &#8212; which is heavier and more prone to kinks &#8212; is simply an unnecessary difficulty.</p>
<p>Unless you have a very specific need for a 100 foot hose, we think most people are much better off with a 50 foot garden hose.</p>
<h2 id="new-hose">When is it time to buy a new hose?</h2>
<p>Replacing a garden hose comes down to more than just aesthetics. If you’ve had the same garden hose for 10 years, and it’s been sitting outside in the sun for most of that time, it’s probably time to consider a new one.</p>
<p>Over time, garden hoses can start to break, leak, or corrode. When this happens, the hose will waste water, and the corroded elements can even be harmful to plants, animals, or even children drinking from the hose. Even worse, hoses that have been left undrained for extended periods of time can develop harmful levels of bacteria.</p>
<p>There are a number of benefits that come with a new garden hose. For many, the most notable benefit is the fact that there won’t be any corrosion inside the hose, particularly on the fittings on each end of the hose.</p>
<p>You’ll also have water that is cleaner and safer for anything living (plants and people alike) that receive water from the hose.</p>
<p>If you’ve decided that it’s time to buy a new hose, be sure to follow these simple steps to ensure the longevity of the hose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the water out of sunlight when not in use.</li>
<li>Drain the hose when not in use. This is particularly important in very hot and very cold conditions.</li>
<li>Use a garden hose nozzle, so that dirt and bacteria can’t get into the hose as easily.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="think-about">Important features to consider</h2>

<p>When buying a new garden hose, there are a few things to consider.</p>
<p>The most important thing to think about is what you plan to use the hose for. While a standard hose will be sufficient for most situations, for some it might be worth investing in a specialized garden hose.</p>
<p>For example, if you plan to have pets, your children, or even yourself drinking from the hose at any point, it is strongly recommended that you use a garden hose that doesn’t have any potentially harmful components, and is certified as a “drinking water-safe” hose.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t plan on having anyone or anything drink from the hose, it’s still worthwhile to look at what materials the hose is made from. When possible, avoid hoses that expose water to brass, since <a href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/07/sipping-from-the-garden-hose-think-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is evidence</a> that the lead in brass can cause health problems.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you plan on using your hose in extreme heat or cold conditions, a hose that is designed to handle those conditions &#8212; even if it’s more expensive &#8212; could actually save money (and time) in the long-run, since it should last much longer than a regular hose.</p>
<p>It’s also worthwhile to consider how heavy, and therefore unwieldy, the hose is. This is particularly important if the hose will be used by children or the elderly.</p>
<p>Finally, if you want peace of mind that your hose will last for many years, our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-hose-reel/">garden hose reel review</a> has some great picks for storage options that will keep your hose out of the sun.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always great to know you&#8217;re covered in case you get a hose with a hidden flaw, so choosing a hose with a long-term or lifetime warranty is a good idea as well.</p>

<h3>Craftsman inventory update</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0035HLLJ4/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">listing we used when we bought product for testing is still active</a>, but it appears that Sears has swapped that product (keeping the same part number, 69602) for a round hose that appears to have a thinner outer layer and doesn&#8217;t have the nickle plating on the fittings. Recent reviews on the Amazon and Sears sales pages are mixed, but everyone who says they have both prefers the old style.</p>
<p>We found an Amazon listing that appears to have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XXN0J7K/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the 25-foot hose in the old style</a> and updated links in this post; there&#8217;s also <a href="http://www.kmart.com/craftsman-5-8-in-x-50-ft-all-rubber/p-043W885180110001P" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a listing for the old-style 50&#8242; hose at kmart.com</a> but it appears to be out of stock. As near as we can tell, the hose we reviewed was manufactured by Continental at their ContiTech factory, but we haven&#8217;t located an exact replacement to test. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B1050XA/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Continental&#8217;s retail-packaged hoses</a> use a different fitting that some reviewers say is not as crush-proof, but it should be the same EDPM rubber hose.</p>
<p>Original review:<br />
As soon as we started testing the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XXN0J7K/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Craftsman &#8211; Premium Rubber Garden Hose</a>, we had a feeling it was going to be the top pick. After spending a month and a half testing the Craftsman hose along with our other five finalists, this feeling was confirmed.</p>
<p>The Craftsman gardening hose is easily the best option overall. Unless you have specific garden hose requirements &#8212; for example you’ll be drinking from the garden hose or using it in particularly cold weather &#8212; there really isn’t a reason to choose any hose other than this one.</p>
<h3>Build quality and durability</h3>
<p><strong>Right away, the Craftsman garden hose felt like a premium product</strong>. The rubber was heavy and study in our hands, yet the hose was still flexible enough to walk around the yard with ease.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XXN0J7K/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/craftsman-premium-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/craftsman-premium-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/craftsman-premium-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/craftsman-premium-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/craftsman-premium-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/craftsman-premium-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/craftsman-premium-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/craftsman-premium-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/craftsman-premium.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Top Pick: Craftsman - Premium</h3><p>A durable and affordable rubber garden hose with a lifetime warranty.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XXN0J7K/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>This premium feel makes sense, given the materials that are used in the construction of the Craftsman hose. In addition to using a heavy rubber, the hose utilizes nickel-plated brass connectors, which helps prevent any harmful materials from leaking into the main part of the hose, and by extension, into the water itself.</p>
<p>The durable health-conscious design of the Craftsman rubber hose is a large part of the reason the hose is regarded as one of the safest garden hoses on the market. In fact, the consumer reporting organization Healthy Stuff rated the Craftsman rubber hose as <a href="http://www.ecocenter.org/healthy-stuff/samples/50-ft-craftsman-premium-heavy-duty-rubber-garden-hose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the safest on the market today</a>.</p>
<h3>Ergonomics and functionality</h3>
<p>Most of us that have used a garden hose have at some point experienced a kinked hose. You know the feeling, you’re going about your watering, when suddenly the water sputters to a stop. You look back, try to shake the kink out, but ultimately have to walk over and manually unkink the hose &#8212; just for it to happen again 30 seconds later.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this is something that we didn’t experience a single time while testing the Craftsman garden hose. No matter how much we walked around the yard with the hose &#8212; twisting around bushes and weeds in the process &#8212; we never lost water flow.</p>
<p>In fact, we had to squeeze the hose pretty tight just to get water flow to stop. Our experience indicated to us that it is nearly impossible to kink the Craftsman hose under normal working conditions.</p>

<p>The Craftsman hose was also very easy to attach and detach from the spigot and from our various garden hose nozzles. When <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-hose-reel/">we tested five of the best hose reels and carts</a> we were always happy with how easy it was to turn the Craftsman fittings and get a leak-free seal.</p>
<h3>Overall value</h3>
<p>Overall, we feel that the Craftsman premium garden hose is one of the best values currently on the market. For less than $40, you’ll have a heavy-duty hose that won’t kink and should last for years and years.</p>
<p>On top of that, the Craftsman hose comes with a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer, so you can rest assured that Craftsman stands behind their product.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Craftsman Premium Rubber Hose, you simply need to try it out for yourself. We had never used a garden hose quite like this one before. For the price, and with the lifetime warranty that comes included, this is an easy choice for most garden hose users.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XXN0J7K/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Craftsman Premium Rubber Garden Hose</a> is our top pick for best overall garden hose.</li>
<li>It is both durable and easy to use.</li>
<li>The lifetime warranty, combined with a price point below $40, makes this a no-brainer for most consumers.</li>

<h2 id="cold-weather">Best for cold weather: Clear Flow &#8211; Flexible</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2079 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow02-1.jpg" alt="Photo Credit Kimberly Lostroscio" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow02-1.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow02-1-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow02-1-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow02-1-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow02-1-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow02-1-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow02-1-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow02-1-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow02-1-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow02-1-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We had never seen a garden hose quite like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M8UUWV2/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Clear Flow &#8211; Flexible</a> before. Unlike every other garden hose we tested, the Clear Flow hose is completely flat when not in use.</p>
<p>While we think that the Craftsman rubber garden hose is better for typical use, the Clear Flow hose is an effective and innovative design, which is ideal for cold weather. The Clear Flow hose is also great for situations where space is at a premium &#8212; for example, in an RV.</p>
<h3>Build quality and durability</h3>
<p>This design is a big part of what makes the Clear Flow hose such a great option for cold weather situations, since water naturally drains out of the hose &#8212; something that is critical in freezing or near-freezing conditions.</p>
<p>The hose itself is made out of durable polyurethane. Unlike many other hoses, which use brass or other metals in their construction, there is essentially zero risk of lead or other contaminants leaking out of the hose into the water.</p>

<p>The Clear Flow hose is also completely made out of recyclable materials. This means that the hose won’t take up landfill space, or ultimately harm the environment, even when it’s time to get a new one.</p>
<p>The hose itself lays very flat while not in use. However, once you turn on the water pressure, it will inflate and become much easier to handle. While the Clear Flow hose doesn’t feel quite as sturdy and durable as the heavy rubber of the Craftsman hose, it still feels well-constructed, and should be able to handle typical yard terrain without any issues.</p>
<h3>Ergonomics and functionality</h3>
<p>While the Clear Flow did feel strange in our hands at first, we eventually became comfortable with it. We found that using a garden hose nozzle is absolutely essential with this hose — without one there simply isn’t enough pressure built up in the hose to be useful.</p>
<p>Thanks to the design of the Clear Flow hose, it’s also nearly impossible to kink. In addition, the polyurethane glides over the yard without getting stuck on rocks or other debris in the way. Also, despite its unique design, all standard garden hose nozzles were able to fit without any problems.</p>
<p>The Clear Flow hose is rated as safe to use for drinking potable water, largely due to the fact that it isn’t built out of any harmful materials. However, the hose is also aided by the fact that that it is transparent.</p>
<p>Since the UV rays from sunlight can hit the water inside the hose directly, bacteria and other harmful organisms aren’t able to fester between uses of the hose.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2078 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow01-1.jpg" alt="Photo Credit Kimberly Lostroscio" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow01-1.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow01-1-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow01-1-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow01-1-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow01-1-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow01-1-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow01-1-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow01-1-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow01-1-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow01-1-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Finally, while the 10 year warranty that comes with the Clear Flow hose isn’t quite as impressive as the lifetime warranty on the Craftsman hose, it is still a long time for one hose to survive. The fact that Clear Flow is able to offer this warranty is a strong indicator of the build quality and general confidence they have in their product.</p>
<h3>Things we didn’t like about the Clear Flow Hose</h3>
<p>While there was plenty we liked about the Clear Flow garden hose, we did have some issues with it as well.</p>
<p>First and foremost, you absolutely must use this hose with a nozzle. Without a garden hose nozzle, there simply wasn’t enough pressure to make the hose usable. In fact, when we first turned the hose on without a nozzle, we were almost ready to write it off as a poorly designed product. With a nozzle on, however, is another story altogether.</p>
<p>This hose is also pretty awkward to use at first. It really doesn’t feel like any other hose we’ve used before. However, the learning curve doesn’t last too long &#8212; after using the Clear Flow hose once or twice you shouldn’t have any trouble.</p>
<p>Lastly, this hose is fairly expensive, averaging nearly twice as much as our top pick, the Craftsman rubber hose. If you don’t have a specific use-case for this hose, such as RVing or cold weather, you’re probably better off saving your money and going with the Craftsman hose.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, if you have a specific need for the Clear Flow hose, it is a solid option and well-worth the money. However, for those who just need a standard hose for regular yard work, it’s hard to justify the cost, and trade-offs, you’ll have with the Clear Flow.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>

<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M8UUWV2/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Clear Flow &#8211; Flexible</a> utilizes a unique design which is best suited for cold weather.</li>
<li>The Clear Flow hose is also useful for RVs and other places where space is limited.</li>

<p>If you plan on regularly drinking from your outdoor garden hose, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003P9XAAU/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Water Right &#8211; 400 Series</a> might be worth the extra cost. We found that it functions essentially like a regular hose, except that it is certified by both the NSF and the FDA to be made from materials that are safe to drink from.</p>
<h3>Build quality and durability</h3>
<p>The Water Right garden hose is made from a polyurethane resin that is free from toxic materials, such as lead and BPA.</p>
<p>The hose itself utilizes lead-free fittings that appeared to be high-quality and built to last for many years, even under heavy use.</p>
<h3>Ergonomics and functionality</h3>

<p>The Water Right hose is fairly flexible and difficult to kink. While Water Right claims that it works perfectly in extremely hot and cold conditions, we weren’t able to verify that ourselves in San Diego. However, we did find a number of reviews online that corroborate their claims.</p>
<p>Since it’s advertised as a drinking water-safe hose, we wanted to see how the water tasted. Unlike the water from other garden hoses, which often has a distinct flavor, the water from the Water Right hose tasted clean &#8212; as if it was straight from the tap.</p>
<h3>Things we didn’t like about the Water Right garden hose</h3>
<p>There isn’t anything wrong with the Water Right hose, per se. If you want a hose that is safe for drinking out of, and if that particular feature is important to you, then it is likely worth the (significant) premium you’ll pay over a hose like our top pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XXN0J7K/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Craftsman</a>.</p>
<p>However, you’ll pay for this functionality, both in terms of the cost, and from the fact that water pressure is reduced compared to other hoses.</p>
<h2 id="others">Other finalists we tested</h2>
<p>The remaining three hoses we tested are certainly viable options. However, our testing convinced us that our three top picks work better, and are a better value.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2092" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_NON-Finalist01-1.jpg" alt="Photo Credit Kimberly Lostroscio" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_NON-Finalist01-1.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_NON-Finalist01-1-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_NON-Finalist01-1-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_NON-Finalist01-1-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_NON-Finalist01-1-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_NON-Finalist01-1-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_NON-Finalist01-1-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_NON-Finalist01-1-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_NON-Finalist01-1-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_NON-Finalist01-1-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Camco Drinking Water Hose</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004RNR9QY/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Camco</a> is a decent hose, and significantly less expensive than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003P9XAAU/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Water Right</a> hose. If you are looking for a hose that is safe to drink from and is also inexpensive, the Camco hose is worthy of consideration.</p>
<p>However, during our testing we found it to be fairly unwieldy, and we didn’t particularly enjoy using it. The Water Right 400 is better, but you’ll be paying significantly more for the upgrade.</p>
<h3>Gilmour Flexogen</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00002N674/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gilmour Flexogen</a> is a solid garden hose overall. It is very difficult to kink, feels solid and durable in our hands, and attached to our spigot and the various garden hose nozzles easily.</p>
<p>We found it to be most similar to our top pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XXN0J7K/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Craftsman Premium Rubber hose</a>. However, for a few dollars more, you can get the Craftsman, which we found to be a stronger choice overall.</p>
<h3>Teknor Apex NeverKink Pro</h3>
<p>We were disappointed by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00INTILWY/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Teknor Apex hose</a>. Their major selling point is that it is highly flexible and doesn’t kink. While this is true, it also gets twisted up very easily, even after several days of use. The NeverKink was also the most unwieldy of the hoses we tested.</p>
<h2 id="long-term">Long term testing notes</h2>
<p>After continued use of the Craftsman, our opinion hasn&#8217;t changed: it&#8217;s a great, multi-purpose garden hose. The hose has rarely kinked, the 50-foot reach easily covers most large-sized lawns, and it continues to show no signs of wearing down.</p>
<h3>Craftsman inventory update</h3>
<p>In 2019, the writing is on the wall for Sears. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0035HLLJ4/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon listing for hose we loved is still active</a>, but it appears that Sears has swapped that product (keeping the same part number, 69602) for a round hose that has a thinner outer layer, doesn&#8217;t have the nickle plating on the fittings, and isn&#8217;t made in the U.S. anymore.</p>
<p>We found an Amazon listing that appears to have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XXN0J7K/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the 25-foot hose in the old style</a> and so we&#8217;ve updated links in this post to that item. If you&#8217;re not as worried about crush-proof fittings, there&#8217;s a good bet <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B1050XA/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Continental&#8217;s 50-foot garden hose</a> is the same synthetic-rubber hose they used to make for Craftsman, but with less-impressive connectors.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you’re looking for the best standard garden hose, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XXN0J7K/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Craftsman Premium Rubber Garden Hose</a> is hands-down your best bet. It is a durable and easy to use hose that should last for many, many years.</p>
<p>For those who need a more compact hose, and for those who live in parts of the world where it gets very cold, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M8UUWV2/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Clear Flow Garden Hose</a> offers an innovative design that should last for many cold winters.</p>
<p>If having a hose that is safe to drink from, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003P9XAAU/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Water Right 400 hose</a> is worth your consideration &#8212; however you’ll pay a notable premium over hoses like our best pick, the Craftsman.</p>

<h2 id="why-qualified">Why we are qualified to test garden hose nozzles</h2>
<p>We spent 30 hours over the course of a month and a half in our backyard, testing each of the garden-hose nozzles to determine which would work the best in real-life conditions.</p>
<p>We also tested each of the nozzles with <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-garden-hose/">several of the best garden hoses</a> in order to compare how each nozzle would work with different types of hoses.</p>
<p>While we did use a series of qualitative tests to determine which nozzle was best, ultimately our decision came down to using our finalists extensively before we could make a recommendation.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-found">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We used several different metrics to determine which garden hose nozzle is best:</p>
<h3>Durability</h3>
<p>First we looked over each nozzle&#8217;s overall build quality and durability. We considered everything from the materials used to the likelihood that the individual components would jam or otherwise break down over time.</p>
<p>The number of moving parts within the nozzle was an important consideration as well. Since garden hose nozzles are frequently dropped and often wet, it’s important that a nozzle not be susceptible to corrosion or rapid wear and tear.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1478" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/moving-parts.png" alt="moving parts" width="880" height="557" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/moving-parts.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/moving-parts-610x386.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/moving-parts-360x228.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/moving-parts-375x237.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/moving-parts-414x262.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/moving-parts-295x187.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/moving-parts-180x114.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/moving-parts-320x203.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></strong></p>
<p>One way we tested durability was by dropping each nozzle on concrete and then checking whether any particularly weak components could potentially break after a relatively short period of regular use.</p>
<h3>Ergonomics</h3>
<p>We also tested each garden-hose nozzle ergonomically. Since watering your garden or washing your car (or for any other chore you would use a garden hose) can require holding a garden hose for an extended period of time, it’s important that the nozzle is easy to hold — particularly for those who might not have a strong grip.</p>
<p>We also looked for nozzles that could “lock” into place so that water would continue flowing even without a hand squeezing the nozzle itself. While each nozzle had different locking mechanisms, we made sure that all the finalists we tested could lock into place.</p>
<p>We looked at how comfortable each nozzle was when held for an extended period of time. We also noted how easily the nozzle locked into place and switched from one “mode” to another.</p>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>When testing each nozzle, we looked at the functionality that each one offered. In practice, people buy garden hose nozzles for a variety of reasons, and there is no single set of functions that will work best for every application.</p>
<p>That said, we did look at the specific functions on each nozzle. The most important functions we looked for were spray patterns, a locking mechanism and ease of use. We also recorded how far each nozzle could spray in the “jet” configuration.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1476" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/jet-distance.png" alt="jet distance" width="880" height="724" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/jet-distance.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/jet-distance-610x502.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/jet-distance-360x296.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/jet-distance-375x309.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/jet-distance-414x341.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/jet-distance-295x243.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/jet-distance-180x148.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/jet-distance-320x263.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Finally, we made note of how easy it was to actually use these functions and how well they worked together.</p>
<h3>Longevity</h3>
<p>In general, garden hose nozzles are fairly inexpensive. As a result, many people expect to replace them every year or so. However, just because something is relatively inexpensive doesn’t mean you should settle for a product that breaks after light or moderate use, which wastes both time and money.</p>
<p>While we couldn&#8217;t get a full sense of the longevity of each nozzle during our six weeks of testing, we did notice which nozzles looked like they were starting to wear down and those that looked as good as new.</p>

<h2>Do you need a garden hose nozzle?</h2>
<p>If you don’t yet have a garden hose nozzle or have an old one that is still attached to your garden hose, you might be wondering whether or not it’s worth spending money to buy a new one.</p>
<p>In general, if you already have a garden hose nozzle that is working, and you don’t have a specific function that it is failing to do, you probably don’t need to buy another one — at least until your current one stops working.</p>
<p>However, if you have a specific function you’re looking to do — such as use a mist or shower-spray pattern to water your garden — you could be better off investing in a new garden hose nozzle.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you have a garden hose but don’t have a garden hose nozzle at all, we strongly recommend you get at least a simple nozzle. This will prevent dirt and other contaminants from getting into your garden hose.</p>
<p>Garden hose nozzles will help you use less water. Without a nozzle, you’ll have water running constantly while the spigot is on. With a nozzle, water will only be running when you are actively trying to water something.</p>
<p>Garden hose nozzles also make it easier to run a direct stream of water specifically where it needs to go and in a spray pattern that works best for a given activity. Nozzles also prevent dirt from splashing around when watering your garden.</p>
<h2 id="considerations">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>When buying a garden hose nozzle, there are a few things worth thinking about before making your decision.</p>
<p>First and foremost, think about what you’re going to use the nozzle for. As an example, a gardener would typically want a nozzle that has a shower-spray pattern and potentially a mist option as well.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a garden hose nozzle used for washing a car should have a strong (but not too strong) jet-spray pattern and and is durable enough to handle the inevitable falls onto driveway concrete.</p>
<p>It’s also worth taking your hand and wrist strength into account. If children or the elderly will be using the nozzle, it’s useful to have one that is comfortable and easy to put into a “locked” position.</p>
<p>If you plan on having <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-garden-hose/">multiple hoses</a> — for example, one in the front yard and one in the back yard — it may be worth considering two different nozzles, depending on how you plan to use each of them.</p>
<p>Finally, while some people do simply accept that they will need to buy a new garden hose nozzle every year or so, not everyone thinks this way. If you plan on having a garden hose nozzle that lasts for years before it needs to be replaced, be sure to take the build quality and any applicable warranties into consideration when making your choice.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: SprayTec &#8211; 9-Pattern Hose Nozzle</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2095 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Nozzles_Spraytec01-1-1.jpg" alt="Spraytec Hose Nozzle" width="900" height="600" /></p>
<p>When choosing the best overall garden hose nozzle, we wanted an option that would appeal to the greatest number of people while also being affordable, durable and easy to use. While some might be able to get away with a more basic garden hose nozzle, such as our other topic pick, the Gilmore, we found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YQ73WBW/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SprayTec &#8211; 9-Pattern Hose Nozzle</a> was worth the additional cost.</p>
<h3>Durability and ergonomics</h3>
<p>First and foremost, the SprayTec is among the most durable of all the nozzles we tested. In addition to having an all-metal body and trigger, the tip of the nozzle itself is rubberized, making accidental drops onto concrete essentially a non-issue.</p>
<p>The grip was notably comfortable as well, which made the SprayTec easy to use, even for extended periods of time. The locking mechanism located on the bottom of the SprayTec handle also contributed to the ease with which the nozzle could be used for 10 minutes or longer.</p>
<h3>Functionality and reliability</h3>
<p>The SprayTec has nine different spray patterns to choose. In actual testing, we found the most useful to be the jet, shower and mist settings — however, the other six settings could conceivably be useful for someone with a specific need for them.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1477" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/spray-pattern.png" alt="spray pattern" width="880" height="693" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/spray-pattern.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/spray-pattern-610x480.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/spray-pattern-360x284.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/spray-pattern-375x295.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/spray-pattern-414x326.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/spray-pattern-295x232.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/spray-pattern-180x142.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/spray-pattern-320x252.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Since we tested garden hoses at the same time that we were testing garden hose nozzles, we were able to test the compatibility of the SprayTec nozzle with six different hoses. The SprayTec was easy to install and remove from all of the hoses we had,  and the combination of the SprayTec and the Craftsman hose was our favorite combination overall.</p>

<p>In terms of reliability, we saw no evidence of leaking from the SprayTec, even after extensive use and dropping it on the ground more than a dozen times. In addition, the SprayTec nozzle came with five rubber washers, which will extend the reliability and useful life of the nozzle.</p>
<p>Finally, the Spraytec nozzle has a lifetime 100-percent money-back guarantee. SprayTec wouldn’t be able to do this, unless they were confident in the long-term reliability of their product.  During our testing, we saw every indication that their confidence was warranted.</p>
<p>Overall, the Spraytec garden hose nozzle is an excellent all-around nozzle. It is compatible with all standard garden hoses, is easy to use and reliable and will work for almost every garden hose-related function we could think of.</p>

<h2 id="most-durable">Most durable: Bon-Aire &#8211; Original Ultimate</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2108 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Nozzles_Bon-Aire01-1-1.jpg" alt="Bon Aire Hose Nozzle" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>While the SprayTec garden hose nozzle is certainly a durable nozzle and a great choice overall, we found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001L0DFA/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bon-Aire Ultimate Aluminum Hose</a> to be a compelling choice as well.</p>
<h3>Durability and ergonomics</h3>
<p>The first thing we noticed when testing the Bon-Aire nozzle was just how durable it was. In addition to being made with “aircraft-grade aluminum,” the thick-yet-soft rubber made the nozzle essentially impervious to drops on the ground.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001L0DFA/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bon-aire-ultimate-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bon-aire-ultimate-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bon-aire-ultimate-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bon-aire-ultimate-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bon-aire-ultimate-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bon-aire-ultimate-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bon-aire-ultimate-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bon-aire-ultimate-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bon-aire-ultimate.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Most Durable: Bon-Aire - Original Ultimate Hose Nozzle</h3><p>Made from aircraft-grade aluminum and heavy-duty rubber, the Bon-Aire is our most durable pick.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001L0DFA/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>From an ergonomic perspective, there was a lot to like about the Bon-Aire as well. The nozzle is very easy to twist from side to side, which makes turning the Bon-Aire on and off, as well as switching from one spray pattern to another, very easy to do.</p>
<p>Despite being easy to twist, the twisting function never felt loose or unstable and never moved unless done intentionally. The Bon-Aire nozzle also can be turned off by twisting it to the left or right, meaning that you’re never more than three settings away from turning the nozzle off.</p>
<p>Bon-Aire claims that this “two-way shutoff system” is patented. While we weren’t able to independently verify this claim, it is a significant advantage if true — and we have no reason to think otherwise.</p>
<h3>Functionality and reliability</h3>
<p>While the Bon-Aire doesn’t have quite as many spray patterns as the SprayTec, the five it does have should be more than enough for most people.</p>
<p>The jet-spray pattern is most noteworthy, since it was the second strongest jet-spray pattern of all the garden hose nozzles we tested. We measured a distance of 315 inches when the nozzle was held at a height of five feet — second only to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MP3JFHO/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dramm 9-Pattern Spray Nozzle</a> at 324 inches.</p>
<p>The shower-spray pattern wasn’t quite as evenly spaced as the SprayTec, but we found that it should be more than sufficient for most situations where a shower-spray pattern is required.</p>
<p>The remaining three spray patterns probably wouldn’t be used by most people; however, the soaker setting could be useful for potted plants.</p>
<p>In terms of reliability, the build quality of the Bon-Aire nozzle leads us to believe that this nozzle should last for many years, even if it is banged up a fair amount during use. The fact that there is only one moving part increases the likelihood that the Bon-Aire nozzle should work well long-term.</p>
<p>In addition, the one-year warranty, while not quite as impressive as the lifetime warranty offered on the SprayTec nozzle, still indicates that Bon-Aire is confident in their garden hose nozzle.</p>
<h3>What we didn’t like about the Bon-Aire Aluminum Nozzle</h3>
<p>There wasn’t much we didn’t like about the Bon-Aire nozzle. However, we do believe that some will find the form factor somewhat strange and awkward. The front of the nozzle is fairly large and can be uncomfortable for those with smaller or weaker hands who need to frequently turn the water on and off.</p>
<p>However, we think that this is a minor negative overall, and the Bon-Aire Aluminum Nozzle is an excellent, durable option.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Bon-Aire Aluminum nozzle is one of our top picks, thanks to its durability and strong build quality.</li>
<li>Bon-Aire’s two-way shutoff system makes it easy to turn the nozzle on or off regardless of which spray pattern you’re using.</li>
<li>With only one moving part, the Bon-Aire should work reliably for many years.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re looking for a straightforward and reliable garden hose nozzle without the extra features, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00002N68C/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gilmour &#8211; Zinc Pistol Grip</a> is a worthwhile option. Coming in at a fraction of the cost of our other top picks, the Gilmore garden hose nozzle is an effective and cost-effective garden hose nozzle for less than $5 on Amazon.</p>
<h3>Durability and ergonomics</h3>
<p>Built out of metal, the Gilmour nozzle is fairly resistant to cracks, especially when compared to garden hose nozzles built from plastics. However, we did notice a vulnerability with the trigger. After being dropped a few times, we noticed that it was slightly less stable than when we first started using the nozzle.</p>
<p>While this decrease in stability wasn’t a huge problem in the six weeks we tested the Gilmour nozzle, we think it’s reasonable to expect that the Gilmour nozzle would be more susceptible to breaking or becoming less reliable over time.</p>
<h3>Functionality and reliability</h3>
<p>Unlike our other two top picks, the Gilmour nozzle doesn’t have multiple spray patterns to choose from. Instead, the Gilmour is a “traditional” garden hose nozzle with a jet-spray pattern when fully engaged that becomes less intense and more spread out the lighter you press on the handle.</p>
<p>The Gilmour does have a locking mechanism, which makes extended use easier. The nozzle also has a screw that can be tightened or loosened, depending on what spray pattern you want to lock the Gilmour into. However, the locking mechanism and screw are moving parts that are fairly exposed and run the risk of jamming or otherwise degrading over time.</p>

<p>Given the low cost of the Gilmour relative to other nozzles, you can go through at least two or three before spending the same amount as you would on our other top picks. In addition, since the Gilmour nozzle is made from metal, it can easily be recycled.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the Gilmour &#8211; Zinc Pistol Grip is backed by a three-year warranty from the manufacturer, so if it breaks within that timeframe, you might even be able to get a free replacement.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Gilmour &#8211; Zinc Pistol Grip is an inexpensive and well-established design that functions well as a basic garden hose nozzle.</li>
<li>While not as durable as our other top picks, the Gilmour is less than half the cost and is still fairly durable.</li>
<li>For those who only need a basic nozzle, the Gilmour is a viable option.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-others">Other finalists we tested</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2097" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Nozzles_NON-Finalist01-1-1.jpg" alt="Group of Hose Nozzzles - Non-Finalists" width="900" height="600" /></p>
<p>The remaining four garden hose nozzles we tested each had their own pros and cons. However, we felt that our top three picks were able to do the job better than these four:</p>
<h3>Dramm 9-Pattern Revolver Spray Nozzle</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MP3JFHO/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dramm revolver nozzle</a> was the closest of the remaining four to be recommended by us. It functions similarly to the SprayTec nozzle and has a unique design feature that allows water to flow by clicking the valve open. The Dramm was also fairly comfortable in our hands and had the longer jet-spray distance.</p>
<p>However, we had concerns about the long-term durability of the Dramm nozzle, specifically due to the use of exposed plastic in both the handle and the nozzle. After dropping the Dramm nozzle several times, we saw scratches and early signs of wear and tear.</p>
<p>Dramm does offer a lifetime guarantee. However, for those who want a multi-function garden hose nozzle, we think the SprayTec (which also has a lifetime warranty) is a better option for your money.</p>
<h3>Orbit Mini XL Fire Hose Nozzle</h3>
<p>We thought we’d like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003LY4I3W/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Orbit nozzle</a> much more than we did after testing. The design was intriguing since water can stream from the nozzle without needing to hold down or lock the handle.</p>
<p>In practice, however, we found the Orbit nozzle to be unnecessarily complex. There are multiple settings that felt redundant during our testing, and the multiple spray patterns available simply didn’t work as well as either the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YQ73WBW/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SprayTec</a> or the Dramm nozzles.</p>
<p>While the Orbit fire hose nozzle was an interesting idea in theory, it was underwhelming in practice.</p>
<h3>Home Depot brass twist nozzle</h3>
<p>We went to our local Home Depot to see what the typical consumer could get by walking into a store (versus having a garden hose nozzle delivered by Amazon). Since brass twist nozzles are among the most popular and highly rated designs, we gave <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/Orbit-5-in-Adjustable-Brass-Nozzle-27928/100659304">Home Depot’s version</a> a shot.</p>
<p>While we did like the sturdy and simple design of this brass nozzle, the Bon-Aire nozzle functioned in a similar manner, while also being easier to use and having more functionality. On top of that, the health issues regarding brass made the Bon-Aire an easy choice over this particular nozzle.</p>
<h3>Home Depot fire hose nozzle</h3>
<p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/Orbit-XL-Stream-Fire-Hose-Nozzle-27991/203019986">Home Depot fire hose nozzle</a> worked similarly to the Orbit fire hose nozzle and our conclusion was largely the same. While we thought the fire hose design was innovative and potentially useful, we ultimately determined that there were simply better options to choose from.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you’re using a garden hose, you’re almost always better off using it with a garden hose nozzle attached. Of the six garden hose nozzles we tested, we found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YQ73WBW/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SprayTec</a> to provide the best overall value and functionality. The SprayTec’s durable build quality, alongside its ergonomic design and nine spray patterns, makes it our top garden hose nozzle overall.</p>
<p>For those focused primarily on durability, our favorite pick is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001L0DFA/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bon-Aire aluminum nozzle</a>. If you’re simply looking for an expensive yet well-built garden hose nozzle with a classic and time-tested design, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00002N68C/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gilmour nozzle</a> is worthy of consideration as well.</p>
