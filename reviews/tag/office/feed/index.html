				<description><![CDATA[Our team of testers carried six bags for 12,000 steps and tested five factors before choosing the Boost as the best gym bag with a shoe compartment.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ur team of testers took 12,000 steps and 12 trips to the gym in pursuit of the best gym bag with a shoe compartment. After a week of side-by-side testing, we determined that the best overall is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DLQP1T1/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Boost &#8211; Sports Gym Bag</a>. It’s inexpensive yet sturdy, water-resistant and provides the most enjoyable day-long carrying experience. Close behind was the roomy, durable <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011R5MHKC/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adidas &#8211; Team Issue</a>, best for athletes and outdoor exercisers.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>The market for gym bags is filled with great products in wildly varied size and price ranges. To narrow our testing field, we set our budget at 50 dollars and only looked for bags with excellent average review ratings at the usual online retailers.</p>
<p>From there, we checked lists from Men’s Health, Wirecutter and NY Magazine. When we found a bag that was on multiple lists and met both our buyer-rating and budget criteria, we added it to a shortlist for testing.</p>
<p>Finally, we talked to our gym-going colleagues and friends to find out which bags they use and love. Our final list is made up of high-quality, inexpensive, well-loved bags that have the features to make your trips to the gym more productive and maybe even less smelly.</p>
<h2 id="lineup">Compare the best gym bags</h2>
[table id=328 /]
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Size</h3>
<p>We chose gym bags specifically with shoe compartments to test, and that distinction naturally lent itself to at least medium-sized bags. Our goal was to find a bag comfortable enough to carry, but big enough to fit not only our shoes and gym outfits, but also toiletries and cosmetics, a change of clothes, a full water bottle and one specialty equipment item (we chose boxing gloves). If walking to the gym, you may want a smaller bag like the gym-friendly pick in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-laptop-backpack/#17-inch-pick">Laptop Backpack review</a>. If transporting large equipment, you&#8217;ll want to check out larger bags.</p>
<h3>Weight</h3>
<p>Depending on the weight of the equipment you’re carrying and the distance you have to travel with your gym bag, you’ll likely want as lightweight a bag as possible. If you’re opting for a heavier bag for either style or sturdiness, you’ll want to make sure the bag’s straps are adequately padded. All the gym bags we tested are two pounds or fewer, with the exception of the Everest.</p>
<h3>Material</h3>
<p>We looked for a bag that we were confident could last and remain fresh for a long time. We considered material type (body of the bag and zippers included), which influences how much weight a bag can bear, how susceptible it is to tearing and its breathability.</p>
<p>Generally, gym bags with shoe compartments are made of nylon (often laminated and less breathable), polyester (more breathable), or some combination of the two. The strongest bags in our bunch were blends. In the case of our top pick, different weaves are added to the mix, but a backing is still present to keep out water.</p>
<p>You should also note that breathable fabric also allows water in. Nylon technically gets soggy more than polyester if you let it sit in the rain, but it&#8217;s the rubbery backing that keeps your clothes dry inside.</p>
<p>To mitigate the effect a waterproof bag might have on the smells trapped inside, find a bag that includes a vented shoe compartment.</p>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>Most gym bags with a shoe compartment will do a fairly decent job of holding everything you need. What sets the great apart from the good is a bag’s ability to organize. The amount, size and arrangement of pockets can make a huge difference in how functional a gym bag is. When working out under a time constraint, digging for the items you need can be incredibly frustrating. Check for pocket numbers and layouts that will make your life easier, not harder.</p>
[table id=330 /]
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Over the course of a week, we tested six different bags  on our commutes and in our gyms. We standardized our packing lists to include sneakers, clothes for working out, a change of street clothes, cosmetics, a water bottle, electronics, keys and a pair of boxing gloves.</p>
<h3>Packing and functionality</h3>
<p>Our picks ranged from four pockets to nine (with the shoe compartment included), with the Mier &#8211; 20 inches Sports Gym bag at the lowest end and the Everest &#8211; Gym Bag with Wet Pocket at the highest. The latter became our organizational favorite, but still wasn’t our top pick overall.</p>
<p>As we packed for each of our trips to the gym, we used our standardized packing list to establish a preference for one gym bag over another. We wanted to know which bag was the best organizational help and which felt like a bottomless pit. Packing and using the same gear for our trips gave us a clear indicator which bags we liked to use best.</p>
[table id=329 /]
<h3>Comfort</h3>
<p>Each gym bag accompanied our team members on their individual commutes, but each bag was also taken for a roughly 2,000 step journey to compare comfort levels. We rated the comfort level of each bag on a star system, where one is “ too uncomfortable to use again,” two is “became very uncomfortable quickly”, three is “pretty comfortable”  and four is “no discomfort at all.”</p>
<p>Because different testers can comfortably carry different weights, potentially influencing this test, we also made a more direct assessment of strap padding.</p>
<h3>Durability</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25398" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key.jpg" alt="Testing abrasion resistance with a key" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We left each bag hanging with 30 pounds inside for one hour to test the strength of straps, buckles and zippers. Next, we applied a scratch test. For the scratch test, we took a key and scraped the outside and the lining of each bag with varying degrees of pressure (first soft, then firm, then as hard as possible) and recorded any tears or permanent scratches.</p>
<h3>Breathability and smell</h3>
<p>To test how well our bags dealt with moisture and smell, we performed two tests. For the first test, we kept our dirty gym clothes in the bag for a full eight hours, and after taking the clothes out, noted how long the bag retained its dirty smell. We unzipped each bag but did not fully open them, and checked in at the half hour, hour and two hour mark.</p>
<p>For the second, we muddied an old pair of sneakers and put them into the designated shoe compartment. Then, we checked back in an hour to see if the mud was dry. We also checked to see if we could smell the shoes from the outside of the bag from both a foot away and right next to the bag.</p>
<p>Our goal was to find a gym bag that resisted odors entirely, but it became clear that this was unrealistic, so we placed greater emphasis on the second test and the breathability of a bag’s shoe compartment.</p>
<h3>Water resistance</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25397" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water.jpg" alt="Testing waterproofing" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We also poured a cup of water directly onto our bags to test claims of water resistance or waterproof-ness. For bags claiming to be only water resistant, we accepted damp clothes as a result, but not wet ones. Waterproof bags needed to keep clothes inside completely dry.</p>
<h3>Cleaning test</h3>
<p>If you’re carrying specialized equipment that sees a lot of outdoor use, you’ll want a gym bag with a shoe compartment that cleans easily. As a final test, we gave each of our gym bags a thorough cleaning with wipes to compare maintenance effort.</p>
<p>We counted how many wipes it took to clean each bag, checked to see if mud remained in nooks and crannies after a single cleaning pass and gave extra kudos for machine washable bags.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Boost</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25402" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Boost.jpg" alt="Boost" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>Our tests to find the best gym bag with shoe compartment confirmed our initial intuition; many of these bags are excellent, and this was a tough race. Ultimately, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DLQP1T1/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Boost</a> proved itself as our favorite with its attention to detail, overall functionality and affordable price.</p>
<p>The Boost gym bag was near the top of our list for functionality thanks to its structure and layout; it has five total pockets (including the shoe compartment), and one is meant specifically for holding wet clothes or swimsuits. It has no designated place for toiletries, but our team was satisfied storing those in the front pocket. On the side is a mesh bottle pocket we found perfect for holding the full range of sizes we&#8217;ve tested in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/">water bottle review</a>, and the shoe compartment was vented, which helped it perform well in our breathability and smell test.</p>
<p>In terms of comfort, we loved the Boost gym bag for its comfortable straps, and for the way its shape helps it stay easy to carry on long trips. The unique (among this group of bags) textured material – a nylon-blend oxford weave – made the bag feel more luxurious.</p>

Its thoughtful design makes the Boost a great, functional companion for the gym</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DLQP1T1/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Performing well on our durability test was an absolute must, and the Boost gym bag did not disappoint. We thought its unique fabric texture might rip easily, but no amount of pressure in our scratch test damaged the bag. In the weighted hanging test, we found that the reinforced seams and metal clasps held the load without trouble. The added reinforcement on the bottom of the bag and its water-resistant (though not waterproof) outside ensure this bag will last a long time.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Boost &#8211; Sports Gym Bag excels in combining versatile functionality with subtle style.</li>
<li>If you need a fully waterproof gym bag, you’ll need to look elsewhere (like the runner-up from Adidas), but this bag can handle a bit of water, and can keep wet clothes separate.</li>
<li>The relatively low price and high durability of this gym bag make it ideal for long term use without making a big investment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="runner-up">Runner up: Adidas</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25401" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Adidas.jpg" alt="Adidas" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011R5MHKC/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adidas &#8211; Team Issue</a> came highly recommended not only by a number of review websites, but also by some trusted friends and colleagues who swore by its longevity and spaciousness. Our team found that it lived up to its reputation, but fell slightly short in terms of functionality.</p>
<p>The main pro of the Adidas bag is that it combines lightweight comfort with durability. We knew from other tests that this bag would be durable, but from the way the fabric blend (nylon, polyester and elastane) felt in our hands, and considering the bag weighs less than two pounds, we were surprised by how well it stood up to abuse.</p>
<p>In our durability tests, this bag performed extremely well. The straps barely strained holding 30 pounds for an hour, and no amount of scratching (on any of the distinct fabric types) left a lasting mark. It comes with a lifetime guarantee, but we don’t think you’ll need to use it.</p>
<p>It’s the elastane in the fabric mix that gives this bag its stretch and lightweight feel, and the nylon provides a fair degree of water resistance, especially on the reinforced bottom. We found too that the lining of this bag was great at repelling moisture — lugging around wet clothes or swimsuits won’t be an issue, nor would setting this bag down in a puddle on the locker room floor.</p>

<p>Our Adidas gym bag was slightly quicker to clean than our top pick and also included a vented shoe compartment, which we liked for our muddy shoes and sweaty clothes. Even with five total pockets, though, its spartan functionality (or lack thereof) knocked it to number two on our list.</p>
<p>Despite a small toiletries section, the main pocket felt way too disorganized. With almost no structure (and no water bottle pocket), we found that our items continued to slide around in transit, knocking our attempts at organization further out of alignment.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Adidas &#8211; Team Issue is a great bag for athletes because of its easy cleanability and cavernous design.</li>
<li>For a busy, everyday gym-goer, this bag’s lack of structured organization made finding things too difficult.</li>
<li>The mix of durability and light weight this bag provides makes it a comfortable way to lug your gym gear that will last a long time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-other-finalists">The other finalists we tested</h2>
<h3>Coreal</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25403" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Coreal.jpg" alt="Coreal" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CTPM7MC/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coreal &#8211; Sport Gym Bag</a> is another gym bag that makes great use of its pockets. High functionality combined with a fully waterproof shell almost earned it a top spot.</p>
<p>We found this bag to be spacious yet organized and especially liked the side pockets. A dedicated water bottle pocket seems like it should be a prerequisite for a good gym bag, but not all of our picks had one, so we appreciated Coreal for including theirs. This bag passed our packing functionality test easily.</p>
<p>The most fully waterproof of all our finalists, we felt so confident in this bag’s impenetrability that one of our testers took it into a torrential downpour. It protected the contents inside and proved its worth even further.</p>
<p>A completely waterproof shell does come with one main drawback, however, and that is the Coreal gym bag’s complete lack of breathability. The bag is mainly waterproofed ripstop nylon, and the shoe compartment has no vent. During our testing, we noticed that our muddy shoes were not dry after an hour and that the Coreal bag retained the smell of our sweaty gym clothes overnight.</p>
<p>If you live in an especially wet climate, or favor swimming as your exercise of choice, this orderly, highly waterproof bag is perfect. If, on the other hand, you aren’t keen on at least wiping down your gym bag after every use, more breathable designs on this list may serve you better.</p>
<h3>Everest</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25394" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Everest.jpg" alt="Everest" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000F3FVTC/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Everest</a> was the top of Wirecutter’s list of best gym bags for a while before they reconsidered due to durability issues. Likewise, a number of other sites and friends suggested giving this bag a try, and it performed well until our durability test, where it ultimately failed.</p>
<p>Nine pockets (including shoe compartment) make it very easy to put everything in exactly the right place when using this bag; there is even an extra water bottle pocket, which would be great for bringing coffee or tea during a commute to an early morning workout. The inside compartment of the Everest gym bag is smartly divided and we especially liked that it included both a wet-item pocket and a pocket for toiletries and cosmetics. We felt that this bag could have easily held double our packing list and remained high in our functionality ranks; there really is a place for everything.</p>
<p>This bag may not be waterproof and is barely water resistant – our clothes were definitely damp after we did our water test – but it did a great job at not holding onto odors. While the lining of the main compartment was a little more difficult to clean than others, we had no trouble wiping the shoe compartment of its mud thanks to its more water-resistant material.</p>
<p>Where the Everest gym bag lost our testers was in its durability testing; even before applying full pressure, we were able to tear the polyester canvas on the outside of the bag. During the hanging test, we also saw that the seams were straining and were worried they might pop; our top three gym bags with shoe compartments performed much better.</p>
<p>Our testers also found that the sub-par straps on the Everest bag less comfortable to travel on their shoulder than most other bags on this list. Though Everest provides padding for the long strap, we found it to be insufficient. This gym bag will serve you really well for a while, but if you have to walk far with the bag or expect to have it for a long time, you may want to reconsider.</p>
<h3>G4free</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25395" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/G4free.jpg" alt="G4free" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>A few of our testers prefer backpacks over duffels, so were excited to give the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KV96XFU/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">G4Free &#8211; 3-Way 40L</a> convertible backpack a try, thinking it would be more comfortable.</p>
<p>While we found this bag to be high on our functionality list – it’s convertible and has lots of organization features – we were disappointed to find that the padding for the duffel strap was much more substantial than the padding for the backpack straps. This makes carrying the G4free less comfortable as a backpack than it should be.</p>
<p>When performing the weighted hanging test with this bag, we did separate tests for the duffel straps and the backpack straps. The duffel straps performed well, but the backpack straps did not. Though it’s likely the backpack straps were made thinner to make sure they tuck into their pocket during conversion, we thought a bit more reinforcement wouldn’t hurt. Our key also made some faint marks during the scratch test portion of our durability investigation.</p>
<p>Pluses of this bag include its lightweight design and its waterproof shell; like the Coreal gym bag, though, the shoe compartment was not vented and made for wet, muddy and smelly sneakers. We appreciated the addition of a toiletries pocket, but missed the water bottle pocket.</p>
<h3>Mier</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25399" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mier.jpg" alt="Mier" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>Our testers might have marked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01A4Z4VC8/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mier &#8211; SPO002</a> higher if other products on this list hadn’t been so excellent. As a gym bag with shoe compartment, it’s perfectly adequate, but has nothing to set it apart from the rest.</p>
<p>We were excited by the structure in this bag, a factor which usually makes packing easier, but with only four total pockets, we felt like some of our smaller items had nowhere to go where they wouldn’t get lost. This alone doesn’t make this bag our least favorite, but combined with its poor performance during other tests, it didn’t quite live up to expectations. There is almost no padding on the straps (which struggled as a whole throughout testing) to provide comfort and we quite easily put marks in the nylon material of this bag during our scratch test. Other gym bags jumped ahead quickly in the rankings.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>During our testing, we looked for a gym bag with excellent features that could be had for under 50 dollars, and the competition was quite close.</p>
<p>Our top pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DLQP1T1/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Boost &#8211; Sports Gym Bag</a>, earned its number one spot by passing all of our durability tests and particularly wowing our testers in packing functionality and comfort.</p>
<p>We placed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011R5MHKC/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adidas &#8211; Team Issue</a> in a very close second place, and it’s a great choice for sports equipment. The high quality of this bag means you may never have to replace it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter our four testers used six backpacks for two months, we&#8217;ve determined that  <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-north-face-mainframe-laptop-backpack-dark-gray-heather-zinc-gray/5968000.p?skuId=5968000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The North Face &#8211; Mainframe</a> is the best laptop backpack for less than $150.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>Backpacks for carrying laptops are everywhere, and there are tens of thousands of designs to pick from. The essential features are pretty obvious: A laptop backpack has to carry your laptop and other daily essentials in a comfortable and secure way, but should also give you easy access when you need your most frequently-used items.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re gear enthusiasts at Your Best Digs, with a team that&#8217;s mostly made up of remote contributors. We all have bags we love, and most of us have owned bags we loathed.</p>
<p>After writing down a list of features that we consider absolutely essential, we started our research by collecting data about what influences the preferences of backpack buyers. We polled the gear nerds in the office and the digital nomads on our remote teams about the qualities they consider essential to a perfect laptop bag.</p>
<p>Access to a laptop and the accessories that come with it were (predictably) top of the list, but the other priorities were split. When we broke down our results into groups of people with different budgets, the preferences were more consistent.</p>
<p><strong>It was pretty clear that the more you spend, the more important the aesthetic of a backpack becomes.</strong> Those willing to spend big bucks on a backpack also prioritized waterproofing.</p>
<p>Of our survey-takers who didn&#8217;t want to spend as much money on a backpack, the biggest priority was functionality. Features like sunglasses pockets and bags that don&#8217;t fall over started filtering to the top in this group.</p>
<p>Our lead researcher for this review has owned a Tom Binh bag for a decade, and he spent some time searching the Tom Binh official forums for opinions about what makes a particular bag best for certain scenarios. (People on the Tom Binh forums like to talk about bags a lot.)</p>
<p>We considered all the recommendations from websites that actually tested for specific qualities, like Outdoor Gear Lab, as well as sites that focused on summarizing the strengths of different bags, like PackHacker, TheBrokeBackpacker and Wirecutter.</p>
<p>We took the priorities from our research and started searching retailers for high-quality backpacks with essential features and good design. We also checked out budget-friendly bags with high review counts and good overall scores from people who had purchased them.</p>
<p>We scoured subreddits like r/bifl, r/onebag and r/digitalnomad for recommendations from people who aren&#8217;t paid to review bags, and we also spent a long time watching YouTube reviews, mostly from the travel-focused &#8220;one bag&#8221; minimalism crowd.</p>
<p>We also spent some time away from computer screens and looked at bags in person at local retailers like REI and Best Buy. We&#8217;re happy we did, because we would have missed all our top picks if we had only looked at Amazon.</p>
<p>After we put together a list of 30 top-rated backpacks that fit our criteria, we had to cull the herd to a short list that really hit our core priorities. <strong>We found six bags with all the essential features plus some key perks that made them stand out.</strong></p>
<p>We decided to test bags that were mostly in the $50–$100 price range. We did test one $130 bag, however, to see if our testers noticed the difference high-end materials can make.</p>
<p>We skipped the really cheap bags we researched after reading too many accounts of bad zippers, bad stitching and uncomfortable straps. If you just want something cheap that will carry a laptop, you can use nearly any backpack and even get decent protection with a padded sleeve.</p>
<h3>What about premium bags?</h3>
<p>We like a lot of bags in the $200-and-up price range that we didn&#8217;t test. From the nine premium bags we researched in-depth, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EH3CM4C" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Incase &#8211; Icon</a>, the <a href="https://blackember.com/pages/waterproof-urban-backpacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Ember &#8211; Citadel</a>, the <a href="https://www.tombihn.com/collections/laptop-bags/products/synapse-25?variant=7593508110399" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Binh &#8211; Synapse</a> and the <a href="https://www.goruck.com/rucksacks/compare-rucksacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoRuck &#8211; GR1</a> came the closest to making the grade.</p>
<p>When we talked to our friends and coworkers about expensive bags, they all had very different ideas about what they wanted. Some people want a leather briefcase that will make a good impression at business meetings, while others want a pack with adjustable suspension for comfortable all-day trail use.</p>
<p>We decided not to try picking just one or two of these &#8220;ultimate upgrade&#8221; bags to test, but we hope that the testing we did with less expensive bags can help you find out about the features that make a great bag.</p>

[table id=256 /]
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Internal capacity:</b> Typically listed in liters, this is a measurement of how much space a pack has to hold bulky items. A 20-liter backpack is just big enough for a laptop and a few books, 25 liters gives you room to stash a sweater, and a 35-liter bag can usually replace a carry-on suitcase for weekend trips.</p>
<p><b>Fall protection: </b>There are three ways a good backpack can keep your computer safe from falls. First, the laptop pouch can be sewn so that its bottom is higher than the bottom of the bag. Second, the pocket can include foam padding to absorb shock and pressure. Finally, a pouch that holds your laptop tightly means there&#8217;s less room for it to knock around inside when your bag is bumped.</p>
<p><b>Fabric weight:</b> Fabrics are graded by weight in &#8220;deniers,&#8221; and 1000-denier nylon yarn is the extra-rugged stuff woven into the canvas-like materials used for suitcases and outdoor gear. The 500-denier yarn most bag manufacturers use is still resistant to abrasion and rips, but it&#8217;s significantly lighter and more supple. As saving weight becomes even more important, manufacturers are more likely to use thin 200-denier fabric in a &#8220;ripstop&#8221; weave that won&#8217;t fall apart if you get a hole.</p>

<p><b>Fabric type:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Nylon</b> is the gold standard for a tough, light-weight polymer that resists wear, heat and stains. The main downside to nylon is that it absorbs water, which makes it more difficult to dye and can lead to soggy-feeling fabric if you&#8217;re caught in the rain.</li>
<li><b>Polyester</b> is sometimes substituted to allow colors or textures that aren&#8217;t possible with nylon. It&#8217;s not as tough as nylon, but it&#8217;s very slightly more heat resistant and the fabric itself won&#8217;t get soggy.</li>
<li><b>Dyneema, Spectra and Kevlar</b> are extra-tough filaments (like fishing line) that are sometimes woven into the ripstop pattern of lightweight nylon to make it stronger.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Waterproof treatments: </b>Most fabric used in bags is given at least a quick spray with a durable water repellent (&#8220;DWR&#8221;) treatment. This coating will keep water in droplets and help it roll off your bag instead of soaking in. If your bag is sitting in the water or puddles form on the top of the bag, you need a fabric with a heavier waterproof backing and sealed seams to keep your gear dry.</p>
<p><b>Specialized pockets:</b> We looked specifically for bags that had some way to carry a water bottle or travel mug in an easy-to-reach place while you&#8217;re wearing it. Glasses don&#8217;t demand as much specific space, but a convenient pocket that will protect them from scratches is a nice bonus.</p>

<p><b>TSA checkpoint-friendly features:</b> Since 2008, the Transportation Safety Agency has had <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/releases/2008/08/15/checkpoint-friendly-laptop-bag-procedures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a specific set of rules</a> that allows you to keep your laptop inside some kinds of bags while clearing security checkpoints. Bags that meet these guidelines have a fold-out laptop sleeve or pouch that gives an unobstructed view of the laptop to the X-ray machine. The advantage is that you don&#8217;t need to pull your laptop out and put it in a bin, but sometimes these bags are actually less convenient for everyday laptop use.</p>
<p><b>Anti-theft features:</b> The most common and functional security feature we saw is a set of rings on some bags&#8217; zippers that lets you lock them together with a small padlock. Other features like embedded cut-proof steel mesh tend to add a lot of bulk and weight, so we discounted bags that included them.</p>
<p><b>Sternum and waist straps:</b> Even the best shoulder straps can only do so much for keeping a heavy load balanced and in place. A connecting strap across your chest or an extra strap around your waist will keep a backpack from slipping, shifting and flopping, which is especially important if you&#8217;re on a bike or running to catch a bus.</p>
<p><b>Ventilated back panels: </b>All of the backpacks we tested feature some kind of sweat-wicking material or ventilation-friendly sculpting to keep your back cool and comfortable on long, hot days.</p>

<p><strong>We gave our six top bags to four testers, each with their own personal taste and set of needs.</strong> Two of our digital nomads are remote-working editors for Your Best Digs, and they rely on an Ogio backpack and a Tom Binh messenger bag, respectively.</p>
<p>One tester is a regional account manager who carries his laptop in a Timbuk2 backpack to different cities every week, and he gave us some perspective on the suitability of bags for air travel and on-the-road organization.</p>
<p>Our last tester is a biomechanical engineering PhD candidate who carries her laptop all over the University of California Irvine campus every day. She normally uses a North Face &#8211; Recon backpack, and she&#8217;s an avid hiker, so she provided some insight into the way laptop-focused bags compare to trail gear.</p>
<p>Our testers took these bags on planes, trains and motorcycles. We carried laptops ranging from 12-inch ultralights to full-size 15-inch models. We loaded each bag with our everyday complement of things like chargers, headphones, books, water bottles and lunches.</p>
<h3>Fit for different laptop sizes</h3>
[table id=257 /]
<p>While the average laptop is thinner and lighter than anything we could imagine a few decades ago, those of us with big desktop-replacement machines need their bags to be just as supportive and protective as ever.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as simple as saying that a bigger backpack will be better for more people, though. Our testers with slim or compact laptops felt much happier when using bags that kept their computers from flopping around.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ESKY9FU/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Swissgear &#8211; 1900</a> has, technically speaking, the biggest laptop pocket. That pocket is really a full-size section of the backpack, though, and it only has a velcro strap to keep a laptop from flopping around. If you keep your laptop in a neoprene sleeve and value the checkpoint-friendly design that might be totally fine, but most of us worried about how much our machines clunked around in the Swissgear bag.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F118789%2Frei-co-op-ruckpack-18-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REI &#8211; Ruckpack</a> had the opposite problem: While this slim and utilitarian bag will technically hold a 15-inch MacBook Pro, such a wide laptop will push out on the Ruckpack&#8217;s side pockets and make the bag much less usable than it should be.</p>
<h3>Comfort and stability</h3>
<p>After carrying laptops, lunches and other day-to-day loads for four weeks, our lead tester tried wearing each pack with 20 lbs of weight inside for ten minutes at a time while working at his desk and walking around the block. By the time he circled back to his first pack for a second try, it was clear which designs were actually comfortable under a bigger load.</p>
<p>The trail-born pedigree of The North Face &#8211; Mainframe and Mystery Ranch &#8211; Rip Ruck made them easy choices for comfort. The surprise was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H7WPYJ/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Targus &#8211; Work + Play</a> pack, which was still surprisingly comfortable with a full load.</p>
<h3>Waterproofing</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/waterproof.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Our team is fortunate enough to live in a climate without much unexpected rain, so none of our testers had to use these bags in a real downpour.</p>
<p>But we did test for waterproofing anyhow. We put a paper towel into each of the pockets and compartments of the six bags and then thoroughly drenched them with the soaker head from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-garden-hose-nozzle/">garden hose nozzle review</a>. Next, we blew the remaining water off the bags with a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-leaf-blower/">leaf blower</a> to simulate the worst conditions for waterproofing, like cycling in the rain.</p>
<p><strong>All of the bags have some kind of water repellent coating to help shed water.</strong> If you just get caught in a quick downpour while you&#8217;re walking to your car, you probably won&#8217;t have to worry about any of these bags letting water in.</p>
<p>Under a sustained downpour, though, most bags will let you down. Only <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-north-face-mainframe-laptop-backpack-dark-gray-heather-zinc-gray/5968000.p?skuId=5968000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The North Face &#8211; Mainframe</a> was able to keep any water from seeping in, undoubtedly because it features a flap that covers the main zipper and backing trim behind the other zips.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F129538%2Fmystery-ranch-rip-ruck-sack-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mystery Ranch &#8211; Rip Ruck</a> is a close second in this category, with its beefy water-resistant YKK Aquaguard zipper that has a polyurethane coating to minimize leaks. We still saw some drips seep through under the full blast of our test downpour, but the fabric on the Rip Ruck absorbed less water overall and dried out more quickly than the Mainframe.</p>

<p>Our testers all preferred the look, feel and features of <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-north-face-mainframe-laptop-backpack-dark-gray-heather-zinc-gray/5968000.p?skuId=5968000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The North Face &#8211; Mainframe</a> mid-size laptop backpack. With 24 liters of storage capacity but only one main compartment, this bag strikes a great compromise between carrying enough gear and keeping a sleek, minimalist profile.</p>
<p>The North Face is a top manufacturer of sporting goods, with a devoted following among those who use their gear on the trail and those who just want to look like they do. The Mainframe is based on many of the best features of the big <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LFE73T0/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">30-liter Surge travel pack</a>, cut down to the size of smaller daypacks like the Recon and Jester. The Mainframe has only one main compartment and a clean, no-nonsense set of accessory pockets.</p>

<p>Despite being a bag designed for sale at Best Buy exclusively, The North Face didn&#8217;t cut any corners with the build quality. The Mainframe uses heavy YKK coil zips with cast metal pulls all over. The fabric used is mostly 210-denier ripstop Cordura nylon, with a heavier Oxford-weave polyester-nylon bottom panel to help with long-term wear.</p>
<p><strong>This was easily the most-loved style among our testers, too.</strong> The outside zips, loops and straps are just enough to indicate a serious piece of gear without making you look like you got lost on your way to a campsite. Best Buy only buys this in gray, but the fabric has a nice texture and pattern that goes with basically everything.</p>

The style, comfort and versatility made this a winner with each of our testers.</p><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-north-face-mainframe-laptop-backpack-dark-gray-heather-zinc-gray/5968000.p?skuId=5968000" target="_blank"><button>See Price at BestBuy.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The waterproofing on the Mainframe, as mentioned above, is excellent. Water won&#8217;t get in through the flap-covered zippers, even after a thorough soak and a blast of wind. It&#8217;s not a dry bag, though: The Nylon fabric will soak up water if you leave it sitting in the bottom of a kayak. If you do get caught in a downpour, make sure to empty the bag, and let the fabric dry out.</p>
<h3>Not as good for 17-inch laptops</h3>
<p>While the Mainframe is technically just big enough to hold the old 17-inch 2011 MacBook Pro (which is 10.51 inches wide and just under an inch thick), it&#8217;s not going to help you with a massive gaming laptop. For example, the new 17-inch chassis from Clevo (customized and re-packaged by specialty brands like Sager and Falcon Northwest) fills up 11.6 inches in pocket width and more than 1.6 inches in thickness.</p>
<p>The Mainframe doesn&#8217;t make any allowance for thickness in the cut of the pouch; the pocket panel is cut about a half-inch wider than the back panel of the pack so it puffs out, and the stiff padding materials will bend around a laptop to allow a thicker laptop to fit. Even an old 14&#8243; Thinkpad is a tight fit when you slide it in.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a good thing on the whole; modern laptops tend to err on the side of slimness. When we were carrying a Surface and a MacBook Air, they practically disappeared in the bigger laptop pockets and moved around a lot when we walked with them, but the Mainframe keeps slim laptops snug.</p>
<p>In addition to the main laptop compartment, the Mainframe also has a padded tablet pocket, at 8 by 11 inches it&#8217;ll hold a mid-size tablet like the 10.5-inch iPad Pro or Surface Go.</p>
<h3>Useful organization for essentials</h3>
<p>The big, vertical zippered pockets on the Mainframe are a great compromise between a second full-size compartment and a smaller set of handy outside pockets. <strong>These pockets are just right for easy access with the bag slung over one shoulder and pulled in front of your chest.</strong></p>
<p>A fleece-lined glasses pocket is great for fragile and scratch-prone items, but it&#8217;s big enough to nestle a full-size pair of folding headphones.</p>
<p>For hydration on the go, the side water-bottle pockets are also basically perfect. They&#8217;re stretchy elastic mesh, so they don&#8217;t look baggy when empty, and they can secure anything from a compact 12-ounce water bottle to a 32-ounce insulated monster like <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/">our beloved Klean Kanteen</a>. The side compression straps also make these bottle pockets great for lugging a compact tripod.</p>
<p>One thing this bag doesn&#8217;t do well is keep your lunch separated from your books. With only the one main compartment and a slim profile, stuff gets squished together when you start walking with this pack on.</p>
<p>Of all the bags we tested, the Mainframe was the model everyone loved most. It&#8217;s a great backpack for small to mid-size laptops up to 15 inches, and organization features are ideal for keeping accessories handy during a day at work or the library. It can&#8217;t carry enough clothes for a weekend trip, but for bombing around town it won&#8217;t slow you down.</p>

If the Mainframe is still too big for your minimalist setup, the <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F118789%2Frei-co-op-ruckpack-18-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18-liter Ruckpack from REI</a> impressed all of our testers with its thoughtful design that gets the maximum possible utility out of a tiny bag.</p>
<p>Let’s get the drawbacks out of the way: The Ruckpack is not very waterproof, and the thin ripstop nylon doesn&#8217;t inspire as much confidence as the heavier fabric on other bags. The zippers on the Ruckpack are also the smallest in this lineup of packs.</p>
<p>If you fill up the laptop pouch completely with a 15-inch laptop (or even a clunky older 14-inch) you&#8217;ll lose most of the functionality of the side organizer pocket and the water bottle pocket. This bag really only shines if you&#8217;re carrying a laptop that’s 13 inches or smaller.</p>
<p>REI sells a 28-liter version of this back that&#8217;s an inch wider and should be better for carrying a full-size laptop, but it&#8217;s not any less expensive than the higher-quality North Face bag.</p>
<p><strong>The real selling point of the Ruckpack is the organization features.</strong> One zippered side pocket can hold pens, a wireless mouse, every day carry tools and pocket-sized notebooks. There&#8217;s even a dedicated glasses pocket tucked inside. Access to essentials couldn&#8217;t get much better than this.</p>

<p>This is a top-loading bag, and it&#8217;s small. If you only need to carry a small laptop and stuff a sweater and a paperback in the main compartment, the design is fantastic. Even loading up headphones, spare chargers and notepads, we were impressed at how well it carries.</p>
<p>If you want to get your laptop in and out of a backpack as quickly as possible, the zip-around shape of this top flap isn&#8217;t ideal. You basically need two hands to open and close this backpack easily.</p>

<p>The shoulder straps on the Ruckpack are fully featured, with an adjustable-height sternum strap and a waist belt you can tuck away or remove altogether. The padding on these straps is good for the amount of gear you could reasonably pack inside.</p>
<p>If you find yourself carrying jugs of water or bags of flour, you&#8217;ll definitely want to use the extra straps to take as much weight off your shoulders as you can.</p>
<p>For a slim and budget-priced bag, we were impressed to find a full-size water-bottle pocket that&#8217;s not just floppy netting. The cinch strap does a good job of adjusting for different bottles, and the cinch strap can make this side pouch a good spot for long and bulky items as well. There are even elastic loops and hidden ladder straps if you want to attach pouches or trekking poles.</p>
<p>The only problems we had with the Ruckpack are excused because of the compact size or the price constraints. For a budget-priced bag carrying a compact laptop, the design sensibility on offer here is top-tier.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H7WPYJ/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Targus &#8211; Work + Play Fitness</a> is our pick for the best 17-inch laptop backpack. With ample space for a large laptop, but not so many random pockets that you&#8217;ll lose your wallet and keys, this is a big bag that&#8217;s also smart.</p>
<p>Our testers didn&#8217;t rate this bag highest for any one factor, but when we went back and compared bags for how they looked and how well they helped us carry stuff, a few of us gave Targus major bonus points.</p>
<p>This Targus laptop bag carries well. It&#8217;s a bag that feels smaller than it really is, and that&#8217;s almost always a sign of great bag design. The straps are comfortable, and there&#8217;s a sternum strap to keep it from slipping off your shoulders on a long trek or bike ride.</p>
<p><strong>The perfect application for this bag is for anyone who hits the gym mid-day or on the way to work.</strong> For those people, the shoe compartment, laundry bag and toiletry organizer are excellent features that set this bag apart.</p>
<p>Note that the shoe compartment at the bottom of this bag is vented, which makes it better for the stated application but hurts the water resistance of the bag.</p>
<p>There is a small coat-hanger style hook that peeks out of the top of this backpack and attaches to a strap that runs all the way down to the bottom seam. For accessing toiletries and the laundry bag in a locker room, that&#8217;s a really great feature. In some offices, it might also work, but we can&#8217;t see it being useful in a coffee shop.</p>
<p>One downside to a full-zip main compartment design like this is that you might accidentally open the bag farther than you intend. If you just want to get your laptop out and wind up dropping books on the floor, that&#8217;s annoying.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear if this laptop pocket qualifies as TSA-checkpoint friendly. If you have anything in the laundry bag ,and you don&#8217;t separate the velcro-attached shaving kit, it certainly wouldn&#8217;t be. But with the right load-out and an understanding TSA crew, you might be able to keep your laptop in the pouch going through security.</p>

It's not as stylish or rugged as some backpacks, but the features are well-designed.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H7WPYJ/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p><strong>Even if you don&#8217;t use all of the features as they were designed, the pouches and pockets are great for keeping your giant laptop and accessories in order.</strong></p>
<p>Compared to the Swissgear and other full-size backpacks we tested or researched Targus hit a good balance of size and function. Some large bags have too many pockets and pouches, and that makes it hard to remember where you stashed seldom-used accessories.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a giant backpack that will replace your suitcase, but it is a great bag to carry large laptops and bulky items in a sensible way. Many people could probably get away with using this as a weekend carry-on.</p>
<h3>Carrying big laptops</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;ve got a giant laptop, there are two ways to carry it in a backpack. You can find a bag like the Targus with a built-in sleeve or pouch that will cradle your big-boned device and keep it from moving around, or you can forget about trying to find the perfect bag and just throw it in a full-size compartment.</p>
<p>Targus made this bag with a pouch that&#8217;s 11-inches wide and an inch thick when empty, which makes it big enough to hold most modern 17-inch desktop replacements. It&#8217;s far more secure than the giant flip-out compartment SwissGear uses, though some bigger laptops won&#8217;t fit.</p>
<p>The pocket features a flap that completely encloses the laptop, which mostly gets in the way when you want to quickly insert or remove your machine. Most bags just use a simple strap for this kind of extra security. Fortunately, you can tuck the flap inside the pocket and mostly forget it&#8217;s there.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re carrying a tablet with your giant laptop, there&#8217;s also a padded tablet pocket in the second compartment.</p>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>The quality of materials on the Targus bag is less impressive overall than on the Swissgear or Dakine packs, but comparable to the REI. The mesh padding on the back is ample, but a few of our testers raised concerns about how it will hold up over time.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of recognizable zipper brand names or over-sized coils, the zippers on this bag were actually some of the smoothest-zipping we found. Dakine gets points for using YKK zippers on a backpack that costs less than $60, but Targus seems to have found a supplier that gives even better bang for the buck.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a 17-inch laptop, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H7WPYJ/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Targus &#8211; Work + Play Fitness</a> gives you carrying capacity without forcing you into a giant bag.</li>
<li>Open-flat design is great for travel or even the locker room, not ideal at a coffee shop.</li>
<li>The organizer pockets in this bag are aimed at gym use, but they work for organizing other accessories too.</li>
<li>If you change shoes at the office, definitely check out this bag.</li>
<li>Targus bags are easy to find, but are priced fairly high.</li>

<p>If you&#8217;re tired of stretched-out water bottle pockets and broken zippers, and if you take one look at the latest trendy fake rucksacks and shake your head, <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F129538%2Fmystery-ranch-rip-ruck-sack-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mystery Ranch offers the Rip Ruck</a>.</p>
<p>For laptops up to 15 inches, this backpack includes a great carry pouch with elastic bands at the side to keep the fit snug. It&#8217;ll take thicker models than the Mainframe, since the main restriction here is the width of the pack rather than the size of the pouch. There&#8217;s a tablet pouch integrated into the laptop pouch, and there are also document sorters in the laptop compartment which are great for large books, notepads and magazines.</p>
<p>The laptop compartment in this backpack is nearly perfect. It&#8217;s the rest of the bag that was polarizing.</p>
<h3>Materials and comfort</h3>
<p>This is a bag made from 500-denier Cordura nylon, which is an industry standard for rugged durability. It&#8217;s coated on the inside for good water resistance, and this worked very well to keep this bag from feeling soggy after a good dousing.</p>
<p>Mystery Ranch has built their brand around beefy YKK Aquaguard coil zips in surprisingly versatile configurations, and these are very good at keeping out water without relying on flaps. <strong>This is the fastest bag to get gear in and out of, and it only let in droplets of water in our simulated downpour.</strong></p>
<p>Padding on the shoulder straps of the Mystery Ranch makes the bag cushy above all else. The thick padding has enough contouring and a functional adjustable-height sternum strap. There is no waist belt.</p>
<p>The fit and stability of this pack when it&#8217;s weighed down mostly feels like a half-baked version of the fully-adjustable suspension system that Mystery Ranch uses on bigger bags. That said, if competition for this bag is supposed to be the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G4ZYFXI/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kanken</a> or other classic leather-and-canvas rucksack designs with skinny or un-padded straps, the Rip Ruck is pure joy.</p>
<p>One of our testers was quick to note that he was very disappointed that the so-called &#8220;black&#8221; Cordura nylon was an inky-green and didn&#8217;t match the black straps and zippers. The other styles available make that contrast look less accidental, but this is not a bag for people who are picky about aesthetics.</p>
<h3>Too many zippers</h3>
<p>Mystery Ranch is probably best known for the three-zip design they use on hiking and hunting backpacks, and the Rip Ruck gives you a sample of that utility. The zip on the biggest compartment opens and closes on each side independently, but not up and down for duffel-style packing like other Mystery Ranch bags.</p>
<p>We love the design philosophy of Mystery Ranch, and we love the convenience of opening the one part of a pack you need access to. Most Mystery Ranch bags don&#8217;t offer a quick and easy way to get a laptop out of the suspended pouch, though.</p>
<p>The Rip Ruck is one of the company&#8217;s few designs to separate the main compartment from the laptop pouch (which can also hold a hydration bladder). They&#8217;ve also included two outside pockets, which are a good size for water bottles or other accessories.</p>
<p>The let-down of the Rip Ruck is in all its fasteners. The comment we heard most from testers was &#8220;too many zippers.&#8221; We think it&#8217;s important for a laptop bag to have easily accessible pockets so you don&#8217;t need to dump out your backpack just to find a charging cable or wireless mouse, but the dual-zip-plus-buckle design makes these pockets almost less convenient than an inside pouch.</p>
<p>The dual zippers on the outside pouch pockets help keep a water bottle or travel mug more secure than we expected, but a side-mount elastic water bottle pouch would have been far better.</p>

<h3>Who is this bag for?</h3>
<p>If you need a bag for hiking, Mystery Ranch has some <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F144968%2Fmystery-ranch-scree-32-pack-mens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-suspension designs like the Scree</a> that help you keep your load stable and comfortable while still allowing quick and easy access with the three-way zip. The Rip Ruck is close to that kind of utility, but the straps aren&#8217;t part of an adjustable suspension system. <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F146676%2Fmystery-ranch-urban-assault-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Urban Assault</a> is a much better daypack for hiking, but there&#8217;s an extra zipper and a giant flap between you and easy access to your laptop.</p>
<p>If you want a quality, rugged daypack that also has a laptop pocket, this isn&#8217;t even the best of both worlds. It&#8217;s a compromise, and it leans heavily on using buckles for fashion&#8217;s sake to justify itself. There&#8217;s nothing you can&#8217;t do with this backpack compared to the others we tested, but we expected better organization features.</p>
<p><strong>So, if you want a bag like a classic alpine rucksacks with updated materials, comfy shoulder straps and room for a thick 15-inch laptop, this is a pretty great backpack.</strong> The Rip Ruck is much easier to use than one with a traditional design and leather cinch-straps.</p>
<p>The rest of the materials and construction quality make this a good value if you like the look and attitude. This is one of those buy-it-for-life bags that you can use for decades without seeing any obvious signs of wear.</p>

<p>Dakine is a company with established credibility in the surf-and-skate scene, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SV9PRBO/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dakine &#8211; Campus 33 liter</a> is their entry-level backpack. As the name implies, this is a student-targeted bag, but it has some features that could make it a good value for anyone toting around a laptop.</p>
<p>Dakine uses good materials in this bag, and it&#8217;s offered in a wide array of patterns. For build quality, Dakine uses the good stuff, like real YKK-branded coil zips. They&#8217;re not the smoothest zippers we tested, so the low price is a reflection of cheaper materials.</p>
<p>Waterproofing on this bag is almost non-existent. Your stuff won&#8217;t get soaked in a brief shower, but this bag let in the most water of all we tested.</p>
<p>Note that Dakine makes the Campus line in a variety of fabrics, so if you love the style but want more waterproofing you can get this bag in the &#8220;squall&#8221; color with waterproof Cordura fabric. The big zips are still going to be the primary source of leaks, though.</p>
<p>The waxed nylon bottom panel used for the &#8220;tamarindo&#8221; colorway we tested is a nice touch, with just the right amount of creasing and patina from daily use.</p>
<p>When it comes right down to it, this is a basic backpack with a giant laptop pouch. It&#8217;s definitely the least comfortable backpack if you intend to fill the big main compartment with books or anything else heavy.</p>
<p>If simple and low-cost are what you want, browse the colorways on offer and see if there&#8217;s a style you like. <strong>Our testers were most dissatisfied with the minimal laptop support provided by the gigantic pouch.</strong> It&#8217;s suspended and padded, but smaller laptops just flop around. The most interesting thing about the bag is probably the smallest outside pocket, which is insulated for carrying a small lunch.</p>
<h3>SwissGear &#8211; Scansmart 1900</h3>

<p>SwissGear laptop backpacks are some of the best-selling laptop and school bags of all time, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ESKY9FU/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SwissGear &#8211; ScanSmart 1900</a> is one of the most reviewed laptop bags on Amazon. It&#8217;s a giant backpack with some travel-oriented features that might make it good carry-on luggage.</p>
<p>The association between SwissGear and Swiss Army knives is hard-earned, and the brand represents affordable utilitarian bags. The 1900 is really missing a clear purpose behind its design features, though; like a pocket knife with a corkscrew, we&#8217;re not really sure what this is best used for.</p>
<p>The biggest failing of the SwissGear is the laptop compartment. It&#8217;s TSA-approved checkpoint friendly, which means you can unzip the laptop compartment from the rest of the bag and fold it onto the x-ray machine belt without waiting for someone to restock the trays you would need to put your laptop into otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>The Scansmart feature works, but after using these features a few times, our testers agree that it&#8217;s almost quicker to pull the laptop out of a well-designed bag.</strong></p>
<p>The real drawback of Scansmart is that your laptop is mostly bumping around in its giant pouch with only foam padding around the edges to protect it. If your laptop is smaller than a 13-inch model, you&#8217;d probably wind up putting it in an inside compartment.</p>
<p>The SwissGear laptop bag does have a lot of pockets, though. If you&#8217;re diligent about always putting your stuff in the same place so you don&#8217;t lose it, this is a bag that can organize your laptop-toting life.</p>
<p>For the rest of us, the sheer number of pockets is just a liability: This bag will help you lose your keys, your wallet, your passport and your boarding pass on the same layover.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After surveying our friends and coworkers, we came to the conclusion that a laptop backpack doesn&#8217;t have to be overly complicated, but it should help keep your laptop secure and your accessories organized.</p>
<p>In testing, the bag that accomplished that task best for laptops up to 15 inches was <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-north-face-mainframe-laptop-backpack-dark-gray-heather-zinc-gray/5968000.p?skuId=5968000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The North Face &#8211; Mainframe</a>. This bag strikes a balance between elegant and nerdy and offers just enough room to keep track of the stuff most of us need. It&#8217;s not a cheap laptop backpack, but The North Face uses top-grade materials for durability, waterproofing and comfort.</p>
<p>If you only want a slim and affordable bag to carry a small laptop, <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F118789%2Frei-co-op-ruckpack-18-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REI&#8217;s house-brand Ruckpack</a> gets you some of the same great functionality for about 35-percent less money.</p>
<p>If you need to carry a 17-inch behemoth, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H7WPYJ/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Targus &#8211; Work + Play Fitness</a> backpack impressed our testers with sensible organization features that help you carry things most backpacks are just not good at carrying, like shoes.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After testing the most popular Keurigs on the market, we found that the Keurig K-Elite is the best pick for most coffee drinkers. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ver the past two weeks we have brewed dozens of cups of coffee, testing the five most popular Keurig machines on the market in our quest to find the best one. From this research, we found that the best Keurig overall was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0788F3R8X/?tag=ybdkeu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K-Elite</a>. With a large water filter, built in reservoir, and multiple brewing options, it&#8217;s coffee at its most convenient.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>To ensure we tested the newest and highest quality Keurigs on the market, we first checked out user reviews from Amazon and Walmart to get a feel for what consumers found important. Next, we consulted reviews from respected websites such as Wirecutter and Consumer Reports to get a feel for which Keurigs rated highly. Finally, we called Keurig to ensure that all of our finalists were the newest models and had no plans of discontinuation in the coming year.</p>
<p>We did not test a machine from Keurig’s Classic line because we already tested the K-Classic in <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-single-cup-coffee-maker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our single cup coffee maker review</a>. We also did not test any of Keurig’s 2.0 machines, as a brand representative told us they were no longer going to be produced.</p>
<p>Our research portion for this article also included a “cupping” coffee tasting at James Coffee Co. in San Diego. During this event, our testers learned about the many factors that affect the way a cup of coffee tastes. We used this knowledge to help our Keurig testers set proper controls while taste testing.</p>

<h2 id="keurig-controversy">The Keurig controversy</h2>
<p>In recent years, Keurig machines have gotten pushback from environmental advocates over their use of K-Cups. K-Cups are single-use, individually packaged portions of coffee for Keurig machines. They are not biodegradable and have a detrimental environmental impact that has been well-documented.</p>
<p>K-Cups can be recycled if the separate components are taken apart prior to recycling, according to <a href="https://www.recycleacup.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recycleacup.com</a>. The coffee inside the K-Cup must first be emptied and then the plastic, aluminum and paper of the K-Cup must be disassembled. This is a pain — which is why millions of K-Cups end up in the trash.</p>
<p>An easier solution is to use Keurig’s universal reusable filter called My K-Cup. To use, fill it up with the ground coffee of your choice (read our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-cheap-coffee/">cheap coffee review</a> here), brew in your Keurig machine and rinse out after use. While My K-Cup requires a bit more effort than simply popping in a plastic K-Cup, it greatly minimizes your environmental impact.</p>
<p>My K-Cup can also save you some cash, as K-Cups are more expensive than buying coffee by the pound. However, French presses and traditional drip coffee makers are still cheaper and create less waste than operating any Keurig machine.</p>
<p>Despite these considerations, many consumers still prefer the convenience of a Keurig to traditional coffee makers. Keurig provides a consistent cup of coffee with the touch of a button and is less expensive than visiting Starbucks everyday.</p>
<p>However, if you&#8217;re still wary after reading this, you might want to check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-drip-coffee-maker/">drip coffee maker review</a> instead.</p>

<p><b>Size:</b> Counter space is precious. Before buying, make sure your Keurig fits in your kitchen without dominating it. Keurig offers many size options, so finding the right one for you should not be a problem.</p>
<p><b>Cup volume: </b>Most Keurigs brew four to 12 ounces of coffee per serving, but some have more limited options.</p>
<p><b>Water reservoir: </b>When it comes to everyday handiness, the capacity of the Keurig’s water reservoir makes a big difference<b>.</b> While it does not take a large effort, it is still a bit annoying to constantly fill up a small water reservoir. The Keurigs we tested ranged from 12 to 90 ounces in water capacity.</p>
<p><b>User interface:</b> Making a cup of coffee should not be complicated, so an easy, well-designed interface is a big plus.</p>
<p><b>Features: </b>Automatic turn-on, filtration, attached frothers and different strength options are all features offered by different Keurigs. Deciding which of these features is the most important for you will help you decide which machine is right for you.</p>
<p><b>Aesthetics:</b> Make sure your Keurig appeals to you visually because it will likely be on view in your kitchen.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Unit dimensions and cup volume</h3>
[table id=201 /]
<p>First things first, we wanted to see how much space these machines would take up. We measured the footprint of each machine and checked if they could fit a 7-inch travel mug under the brewer. The only machines we tested unable to do this were the K-Mini Plus and K-Latte.</p>
<p>We also compiled information about the different cup volumes each Keurig can pour. Our testers preferred a typical eight-ounce cup, but we gathered information on each machine’s capabilities to help you find the right one for you.</p>
<h3>Brew temperature</h3>
[table id=202 /]
<p>It is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18226454" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally recommended</a> that coffee is best brewed between 195 °F &#8211; 205 °F and best served between 160 °F &#8211; 175 °F. However, how hot you like your coffee is largely based on personal preference.</p>
<p>To find out how hot each of our Keurigs served coffee, we used a digital kitchen thermometer to measure the coffee temperature right after the last drop had been poured from the machine. To ensure consistency in our testing, we brewed three cups of coffee prior to measurement. We also made sure water temperature, room temperature and cup temperature were consistent throughout testing.</p>
<p>We found that all of our finalists served coffee within the recommended range of 160 °F &#8211; 175 °F. The <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Keurig-K-Latte-Single-Serve-K-Cup-Coffee-and-Latte-Maker-Comes-with-Milk-Frother-Compatible-With-all-Keurig-K-Cup-Pods-Black/669553233" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K-Latte</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C1XC3GF/?tag=ybdkeu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K-Cafe</a> served our hottest cups of coffee, both measuring at 175 °F. The lowest temperature coffee was served by the K-Elite and the K155, which both measured 161 °F.</p>
<p>It should be noted that we tested the K-Elite’s temperature on its default temperature setting. However, if you prefer a hotter cup of coffee, you can increase the machine’s temperature settings.</p>
<p>Our testers did not find any of the coffee brewed to be too cold for their taste, but one remarked that the K-Latte and K-Cafe felt hotter. If you know that you like your coffee extra hot, the K-Latte may be your best pick, as it also performed well in our other testing categories.</p>
<h3>Brew speed</h3>
[table id=203 /]
<p>We used a timer to find out how long each machine took to heat up and brew an eight-ounce cup of coffee. All of the Keurigs we tested were able to heat up and brew a cup in about two minutes, so this was not a make-or-break testing category for our finalists. In general, our finalists took about a minute to heat up, and then just under a minute to brew.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0788F3R8X/?tag=ybdkeu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K-Elite</a> was our only finalist to come with an automatic turn-on feature. This means it can be programmed to automatically turn on and heat the water at your desired time, which can help save you a minute during your morning routine.</p>
<h3>Sound</h3>
<p>Overall, we did not like the unattractive sounds produced by all of the Keurigs we tested. We wanted a Keurig to be as quiet as possible while brewing coffee.</p>
<p>To test this, we used a sound meter that recorded the sound level in A-weighted decibels. While each of our Keurigs brewed an eight-ounce cup of coffee, we held the sound meter about an arm’s length distance from the machine and recorded its loudest sound.</p>
<p>We found that all of the Keurigs were similarly noisy, topping off around 70 dBa. This is about the same amount of noise produced by a vacuum cleaner running in an adjacent room. All of our Keurigs measured about 60 dBa for the majority of their brew, but then emitted a 70 dBa spurting sound as they pushed the last drips of coffee into the cup.</p>
<p>We did not record any significant differences in noise level between our finalists, so we can’t name any one machine the quietest.</p>
<h3>User experience and taste</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/k-latte-1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>For our practical testing, we had two testers brew multiple  eight-ounce cups with each of our machines and record their experiences. Our testers prepared for this at a cupping event at James Coffee Co. in San Diego, CA. Here, our testers learned about factors that can affect the taste of coffee.</p>
<p>We learned that during the extraction of coffee from the coffee bean (which occurs when you add water to brew the coffee), the water ratio, contact time, grind size, water temperature and agitation of the beans all influence the taste of coffee. All of these factors were pretty standardized by using Keurig machines to brew coffee, meaning there wasn’t much difference in taste between machines. The water ratio was set to eight ounces for all of our taste testing; each machine had about a minute of contact time between water and grounds; and the beans were agitated in a very similar fashion. We also had our taste testers use the same batch and amount of ground coffee in the My K-Cup for taste testing.</p>
<p>Our testers did not find much variation in taste when using our finalists, which makes sense because of the standardization across Keurig’s machines. However, our testers thought that the K-Mini Plus brewed a more watery tasting cup than the other machines. This could be related to the fact that the K-Mini brews a cup according to how much water you put in the machine. For example, if you want an eight-ounce cup, you must fill the machine to eight ounces. However, because we used eight ounces for all of our machines and were sure to put exactly eight ounces into the K-Mini, we are a bit mystified by the watered down taste.</p>
<p>Our testers also rated how easy it was to set up and use each Keurig. We thought that a single-serve coffee machine should be simple enough to figure out without consulting a manual.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">The best overall: K-Elite</h2>

<p>While testing, one major thing stood out about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0788F3R8X/?tag=ybdkeu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K-Elite</a>: you do not have to refill its water reservoir nearly as often as the other machines. This sounds obvious, but its 75-ounce water capacity really makes it handier than the other Keurigs we tested.</p>
<p>Our testers also liked that this Keurig has a water filter. If you prefer making coffee with filtered water, this is an obvious choice for you. However, even if you don’t mind the tap, the water filter is supposed to extend the life of the machine overall, as less impurities should build up within it. Installing the filter in the reservoir was not hard, but it did require reading the manual.</p>
<p>The K-Elite brews four, six, eight, 10 and 12 ounces of coffee, meaning you can fill anything from a tiny cup to a travel mug. It also offers “strong” and “iced” options, but we didn’t find these options helpful, as our testers preferred the normal brew strength.</p>
<p>On its default setting, this machine served coffee at about 161 °F. This was on the low side of our finalists — about the same temperature of coffee produced by the K155 and K-Mini Plus. However, our testers did not make any remarks about the coffee temperature being too cold. Also, the K-Elite was the only Keurig we tested that can be programmed to brew at higher temperatures, up to 192 °F. You can change the default temperature of the K-Elite in its settings menu, which is a big plus if you are picky about your coffee temperature.</p>

<p>This Keurig was the fastest to heat up, taking only about thirty seconds. Its automatic turn-on feature also means that you can skip these thirty seconds in the morning by programming the machine to heat itself up at a certain time. This means that after you press the brew button, you only have to wait 45 seconds while it brews.</p>
<p>Our testers thought that this Keurig was the most complicated to use because of its many features. When setting up this Keurig, we were immediately asked to program the time, altitude mode and automatic turn-on time. While all of these features are useful, we had to consult the manual to figure out how to program them.</p>
<p>This machine does take up a fair amount of counter space at 13.1&#8243; H x 9.9&#8243; W x 12.7&#8243; D. It also has the shortest power cord, measuring only about a foot. However, it has a sleek look that’s aesthetically appealing on a counter.</p>
<p>Overall, the K-Elite takes our top spot because when you wake up in the morning you want coffee fast — this machine delivers on that. The last thing anyone wants to do is mess with a water reservoir first thing in the morning. The K-Elite delivers on convenience, which is why consumers are attracted to Keurigs in the first place.</p>
<p>This Keurig runs at about $160, which is a relatively mid-range price for a Keurig machine. If you are buying a Keurig to make your life more convenient, we believe the K-Elite is worth the extra coin.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The K-Elite was our fastest-brewing Keurig machine.</li>
<li>This machine’s 75-ounce water reservoir means you won’t be constantly refilling this machine.</li>
<li>The included water filter is a plus for those who prefer filtered water; the machine may also have a longer life for this reason.</li>
<li>This machine’s short power cord and large size limit its movability in the kitchen.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Keurig-K-Latte-Single-Serve-K-Cup-Coffee-and-Latte-Maker-Comes-with-Milk-Frother-Compatible-With-all-Keurig-K-Cup-Pods-Black/669553233" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K-Latte</a> was nearly our first pick because of its bargain price (about $100), milk frother and simple design. If you have any interest in using your Keurig machine to make cappuccinos and lattes, this is the best machine for you. However, we found the K-Elite to be better overall because it beat out the K-Latte in crucial areas such as brew time and reservoir size, which make a difference in day-to-day use.</p>
<p>The K-Latte’s reservoir is 36 ounces, which is significantly smaller than the K-Elite’s reservoir. However, this machine is not much smaller than the K-Elite because of its attached milk frother. The milk frother’s base is attached to the bottom of the machine, but can be folded up. This means if you are not using the milk frother you can fold in its base, and then store the frothing cup in a cabinet. This is much handier than the other latte-making Keurig — the K-Cafe.</p>
<p>This milk frother worked well, taking about two minutes to froth and warm milk to 150 °F. While this machine is frothing milk, you can use the coffee portion to brew a shot of coffee. However, you cannot brew a regular cup of coffee while the machine is frothing milk.</p>

<p>While our testers did not think that these lattes tasted as great their store bought competitors, they were still pleased with the results, which took only about two minutes to make once the machine heated up.</p>
<p>This machine took one minute and fifty seconds to heat up and one minute to brew — a relatively slow time for our finalists. However, the resulting coffee was among the hottest of our competitors, measuring 175 °F. Therefore, if you like your coffee extra hot, this is your best pick.</p>
<p>Our testers also thought that this Keurig’s interface was very simple to use. Aesthetically, this machine looks a little funny because of the attached frother, but its black design won’t stand out on your counter. Its power cord is also much handier than the K-Elite’s, measuring about 40 inches.</p>
<p>The K-Latte is only available at Walmart or by phone order from Keurig because of Keurig’s exclusive agreement with Walmart. Its price is a bargain at about $100, especially when you consider Keurig’s other latte machine, the K-Cafe, rated poorly with our testers and costs an additional $50.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The K-Latte was our best latte maker because of its bargain price and easy-to-use design.</li>
<li>This machine’s milk frother can be detached and its base folded up, making this machine much handier than the K-Cafe.</li>
<li>The K-Latte has a smaller water reservoir, holding only 36 ounces, meaning you will have to fill it up more often.</li>
<li>The K-Latte served one of the hottest cups of coffee of our finalists.</li>

<p>This Keurig performed well with our testers, but was not our top pick because of its high price — upwards of $250. This machine shined when it came to ease-of-use and water-reservoir size and performed on par with our other finalists for speed and temperature.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DWKEHU4/?tag=ybdkeu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K155</a> had the best display of our finalists by far. Our testers loved its easy-to-navigate digital display. This machine does not offer many extra features, which makes using it really easy. All you are asked to do is select a four, six, eight or 10 ounces and brew.</p>
<p>The huge water reservoir (90 ounces) is also a big plus for this machine, which is marketed to work for small offices. If you were using this machine in an office setting, this large water reservoir would be really useful, so employees would not have to continually fill its tank.</p>
<p>However, we still cannot justify its $250 price tag from its ease-of-use and water capacity alone. Where are the extra features? A water filter or automatic turn-on feature would also be very helpful for a small office. We believe that even with its smaller 75-ounce tank, you could use the K-Elite for a small office and get these bonus features for a cheaper price.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C1XC3GF/?tag=ybdkeu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K-Cafe</a> comes with a milk frother and a coffee shot option like the K-Latte. However its poor design and similar speed performance to the K-Latte leave us wondering why it costs about $80 more than the K-Latte.</p>
<p>This machine design is less handy than the K-Latte’s because its milk frother cannot be folded in. This means you always need space for a Keurig machine with an attached milk frother, which measures 15.3 inches in total width. One of our testers thought it  also made the machine look a little goofy.</p>
<p>The K-Cafe’s performance testing was largely on par with the K-Latte’s. It also brewed one of our hottest cups of coffee at 175 °F. It took a similar two minutes to heat up and 45 seconds to brew. Also, its frother also took two minutes to froth milk to 155 °F (just five degrees hotter than the K-Latte).</p>
<p>The only justification for the increased price of the K-Cafe we could find was the larger water reservoir, which holds 60 ounces. This is a big factor in handiness as we have mentioned before, but we do not believe it to be handy enough to justify spending an extra $80, especially considering this machine’s cumbersome design.</p>
<h3>K-Mini Plus</h3>

<p>This was the smallest and most stylish of our finalists. However, those were the only areas this machine really delivered on.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DR89BR6/?tag=ybdkeu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K-Mini Plus</a> requires you to put in the amount of water that you would like for each individual cup of coffee. For example, if you want an eight-ounce cup of coffee, you put eight ounces of water into the machine before brewing. To heat and brew, this machine takes about two minutes total. This left us asking — why not just use a French press?</p>
<p>If you have to put in the exact amount of water for each cup, the only conveniences you are saving for yourself by using the K-Mini Plus are not having to measure your own coffee grounds or rinse out the French press after use. However, if you are using the My K-Cup and coffee grounds, you will have to measure your own grounds anyway.</p>
<p>Also, our testers thought this machine’s coffee tasted worse than the other finalists. Overall, we cannot justify spending about $100 for a machine that does not deliver on convenience or taste.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>In practical testing, our Keurig finalists had a lot of similarities. For example, testing data for noise level and brew temperature was very similar across all of the Keurigs we tested. However, the K-Elite stood out from the crowd because of its fast brew time, 75-ounce reservoir and included water filter. For about $150, the K-Elite provides the best Keurig experience for your buck.</p>
<p>If you are buying a Keurig machine to make your morning routine more convenient, your best bet is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0788F3R8X/?tag=ybdkeu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K-Elite</a>. We like the extra features this Keurig offers such as a water filter and automatic turn-on feature. We also think you could use this Keurig for a small office and skip paying the extra dough for a K155 Office PRO.</p>
<p>If you want to indulge in a latte or cappuccino, we recommend the <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Keurig-K-Latte-Single-Serve-K-Cup-Coffee-and-Latte-Maker-Comes-with-Milk-Frother-Compatible-With-all-Keurig-K-Cup-Pods-Black/669553233" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K-Latte</a>. This machine is a great price at around $100 and delivers the hottest cup of coffee of our finalists. It costs less and has a more convenient countertop design than its rival, the K-Cafe.</p>
<p>In the future, we hope Keurig finds solutions to help minimize noise levels. We also think that offering a complimentary K-Cup recycling service would be a great way to help reduce waste created by these machines.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After weeks writing with the most popular pens on the market, we've determined that the Pilot - G2 is the best. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e tested 15 pens, ranging in price from just under $1 to just over $25, and found that the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058NN4C0/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Pilot &#8211; G2</a> is overall one of the best pens on the market. The G2 is America’s top-selling gel pen. Our testers loved this pen for its smooth ink flow, professional look and quick-dry ink. As runners-up, we think the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IE87/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">uni-ball &#8211; Onyx</a> is the best rollerball and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004U9TEEA/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paper Mate &#8211; InkJoy</a> is the best ballpoint.</p>

<h2 id="how">How we selected pens to test</h2>
<p>If you’ve searched online for pens, you know that there are hundreds and hundreds from which to choose. So, we narrowed down our prospects by focusing only on gel, ballpoint and rollerball pens. These are the pens most commonly used in people’s everyday lives, rather than fountain or calligraphy pens.</p>
<p>We only tested pens that were rated well among online retailers, and for the most part, we selected pens that cost well under $5. (The one exception is the Cross rollerball pen, which was mentioned frequently enough in forums that we had to give it a test.)</p>
<p>We consulted forums like /r/pens/ to find out what inexpensive pens the aficionados were recommending. We browsed through the <a href="https://www.penaddict.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pen Addict’s</a> blog for inspiration and consulted The Wirecutter’s pen review, too.</p>
<p>Finally, we chose to focus primarily on .7 mm pens, which create medium-sized lines and are a good writing choice for a lot of people. However, we also tested some smaller and larger pens for those who want range.</p>
<p>It should be noted that while some of our testers used the pens to freehand draw or doodle, we did not test pens that were created explicitly for drawing purposes. (That’s another review for another time!)</p>

<p>Ballpoint pens are arguably the most popular for everyday use, and for good reason. Their ink writes smoothly and dries quickly. Their refills also last longer than other types of ink. However, the oil-based ballpoint ink can occasionally get messy and blobby at the tip, making it less-than-ideal for longform writing and journaling. Conventional ballpoint pens come in three sizes: fine (making lines .8 mm wide and thinner), medium (1.0 mm to 1.2 mm) and bold (1.4 mm and wider).</p>
<h3>Gel pens</h3>

<p>Many of us remember the thick-lined, metallic and opaque pens of our childhood, often with whimsical product names like “moonlight” and “stardust.” These type of pens get a bad rap from adults, who can see them as impractical. One of our designer-testers even specified that they’ll test “anything but gel pens, please!”</p>
<p>But while there <i>are </i>a number of youthful-looking gel pens on the market (like the Gelly Roll we tested), there are also plenty of quality, businesslike pens that you may not know use gel ink. Gel ink is simply pigment in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_pen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">water-based gel</a>. If you’re looking for strong colors and sharp, featherless lines, then a gel pen is probably a great choice for you.</p>
<p>That being said, if you’re left-handed, you should <a href="https://www.penchalet.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-pen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stay away from gel</a>. It doesn’t dry as quickly as its ballpoint and rollerball counterparts.</p>
<p>Conventional gel pens come in three sizes: micro (making lines .5 mm wide and thinner), medium (.7 mm) and bold (1.0 mm).</p>
<h3>Rollerball pens</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11083" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Rollerball pens use a dark, saturated, fast-flowing liquid ink. They create finer lines than a conventional ballpoint pen, and unlike gel pens, the ink dries quickly enough for left-handers. Because of the free-flowing ink, rollerball pens require less pressure, making them more comfortable to write with.</p>
<p>However, a rollerball’s intense ink can sometimes bleed through paper if you’re not careful, and the pen can leak if it’s left uncapped or taken to high altitudes. Conventional rollerball pens come in three sizes: micro (.5 mm), fine (.7 mm) and bold (.8 mm and wider).</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>A pen can seem like a deceptively simple product, but there’s a lot that goes into making one great. Ask any pen aficionado and they can wax poetic about nibs and ink flow for hours. However, for the purposes of the everyday pen user, there are only a few things you need to keep in mind:</p>
<p><b>Ink flow:</b> You want a pen that creates a clean, consistent line. It shouldn’t skip, bleed through the paper, or feather out into more tiny lines. Similarly, the ink should come out easily, requiring you to put very little pressure on the pen.</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SiegePenGIF.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p><b>Comfort and aesthetics:</b> The pen should look nice sitting out on your desk, but more importantly it should be designed to hold comfortably. Look for lighter pens. They will be easier on your hand than heavy ones. And don’t be fooled by pens with soft grips included on them; they’re not necessarily any more comfortable.</p>
<p>You can make your pen even more comfortable to hold by using it correctly. This may seem like an elementary skill, but many of us are doing it wrong (or have forgotten proper form in the age of the keyboard). Remember to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press down only as much as you need to get a smooth line</li>
<li>Use good posture to prevent writing fatigue</li>
<li>Write from your arms and shoulders, rather than your fingertips</li>
<li>Use quality paper; we tested our pens on classic Moleskine notebooks</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Line width:</b> Most pens are marketed with a millimeter measurement somewhere on the package. This measurement refers to the width of the line your pen will create. Many people enjoy writing with a .7 mm pen, which is a medium width. If you like to write with smaller letters, you can get pens in .5 mm, and some brands make them even finer than that.</p>
<p>If you like to make big, bold strokes, you can pick something with a 1.0 mm width or greater. Some consumers find that they like a certain brand and model of pen, but only in a certain size. So if you think a pen is a good fit for you, but you don’t quite love how it writes, try sizing up or down.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We started by rounding up a group of designers at our <a href="https://www.siegemedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content marketing agency</a> in San Diego, and gave them each a few pens and a Moleskine notebook to call their own. In the weeks leading up to our formal focus group testing, they were encouraged to use the pens daily, whether it be for journaling, making grocery lists, signing cards or sketching out plans for the next photoshoot.</p>
<p>Then, we asked them to join us in a focus group, where they wrote assigned sentences (using every letter of the alphabet). Then, they had “free time” to use the pen however they pleased. After this process was complete, they filled out a survey about the experience using each pen.</p>
<p>The survey asked questions including (but not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>How much pressure did you have to exert on the pen to write?</li>
<li>Was it comfortable to use this pen? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Does the pen ink smear if you touch it soon after writing?</li>
<li>What has been your overall experience using this pen?</li>
</ul>
<p>After the focus group, we tested our worst offender and best pens on cheaper notebook and scratch paper, to see how they’d act. We found the results to be just about what we expected; lesser-quality pens wrote even more poorly on cheap paper, and good quality pens wrote about the same, save for a slightly less-smooth flow.</p>
<h2 id="top-pick">The best overall: Pilot &#8211; G2</h2>

<p>Like a popular celebrity, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058NN4C0/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pilot- G2</a> inspires polarized opinions. People seem to either <i>love</i> or <i>hate</i> the G2 — and we have our suspicions that some hate it just because it’s so well-loved!</p>
<p>When we started our testing, we didn’t know which side of the fence we stood on for the great G2 debate. (Though we always lean toward skepticism.) After testing, though, it was clear that the G2 was the best pen overall, and by default the best gel pen. Our testers loved the writing experience with this one: a smooth flow of ink with no skipping, no feathering and no bleeding. The ink dried quickly as they wrote, meaning it’s a good pen for left handers. They also noted that the G2 had a pleasing haptic feedback when you clicked it, and that it looks professional enough to use in a meeting.</p>

Its smooth gel ink flow makes your writing look more clean and elegant. Plus, the ink dries quickly.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058NN4C0/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The G2 is retractable, meaning you can carry it around in your pocket without being jabbed. It’s also refillable, but according to Pilot, you won’t have to refill it often. They say that their pen is “proven to last longer than the average of competitive gel ink brands.”</p>
<p>It’s available in four sizes (.38 mm, .5 mm, .7 mm and 1.0 mm) and comes with a comfort grip. (Though, many pen enthusiasts will tell you that these included rubber grips don’t necessarily add to the comfort.)</p>
<p>One thing to beware of with the G2 in finer sizes: its thin point allows you to create beautifully thin and close-together characters, but won’t mask any shakiness in your hands. So if you don’t have a steady grip (or tend to go hard on the caffeine), you may want to choose a different pen — or opt for a bolder point. If you do choose the G2 in a fine point, it should set you back less than a $1.50 per pen.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a pen of the rollerball variety, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IE87/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">uni-ball &#8211; Onyx</a>. Sleek, black and professional looking, our testers gave the Onyx high marks for its lightweight and fine tip. It doesn’t bleed or feather or skip when you’re writing with it, and it creates a nice uniform line.</p>
<p>The Onyx does require slightly more pressure to write with (and has a lighter-pigmented ink) than our top pick, but for the more heavy-handed writers, this may be a welcome feature.</p>

<p>What prevented the Onyx from being our No. 1 pick? It can smudge if you touch it too quickly after writing, which makes it non-ideal for left-handed writers. One tester also remarked that “this pen was [their] favorite … but [they] could tell it was an overall cheaper model.” We don’t consider this a fatal flaw though; at less than 50 cents a pen, it <i>is</i> a cheaper model.</p>
<p>Those who aim to be more eco-friendly will like that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IE87/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Onyx</a> is made from 80 percent post-consumer recycled electronics — a fact uni-ball is proud of, as evidenced by the “eco” logo on each pen. uni-ball says that their Onyx ink also protects against “water, fading and fraud.” However, we didn’t test for this.</p>

<p>Ballpoint is the most popular type of pen, so it’s surprising that our top pick is a somewhat less popular brand. Sure, Paper Mate products are ubiquitous in the office supply world, but their pens have notably fewer reviews on Amazon — and are hardly discussed by pen enthusiasts. In the interest of diversity, we tested a few Paper Mate’s anyway, and we’re glad we did. Our testers loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004U9TEEA/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InkJoy Ballpoint</a>.</p>

The InkJoy truly is a pleasure to write with. It's extremely comfortable to write with, and will likely cost you less than a dollar per pen.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004U9TEEA/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>They found that the pen didn’t bleed or feather, and it didn’t smudge either. They thought the pen’s grip was solid and comfortable, which led to nice, uniform lines. The one minor discrepancy with the Paper Mate was that each new pen requires a bit of “warming up” the first time around before it stops skipping and starts writing smoothly. At most retailers, the InkJoy will cost you well under a dollar per pen.</p>

<p><b>Pentel &#8211; Energel-X (gel): </b>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005EE4UG2/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pentel &#8211; Energel</a> is another pen that most people either love or hate. We fell somewhere on the <i>like</i> end of that spectrum. On the plus side, it has a nice grip, requires little pressure to write with and doesn’t bleed. It creates a uniform lines and the ink flows smoothly. However, the Pentel does have a tendency to feather, and it can smear if you touch it right after writing. For these reasons, one tester claimed that it made them “write messier than [they] already do.” So, buy this one at your own risk — if you have nice handwriting and prefer a dark, saturated ink, it may still be a great pen for you. The Energel-X will likely cost you over $2, making it a little bit more of an investment than your typical office supply pen.</p>
<p><b>Zebra &#8211; F-701 (ballpoint): </b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002L6RB80/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zebra</a> is an esteemed name in the world of writing utensils, and after testing their F-701, we can see why. Aesthetically, it stands out from the other pens with its sleek, all-metal body. Our testers said it felt sturdy, and they liked the textured grip. It met all the basic requirements of a good pen: no skipping, bleeding or feathering and a smooth and uniform ink flow. It also doesn’t smudge when you touch it. Our testers’ primary complaint is that the ink is relatively light in color — something you may not expect from a pen that costs over $5. <b> </b></p>
<p><b>uni-ball &#8211; Jetstream Premier (ballpoint): </b>A crowd favorite, uni-ball makes a slew of good quality pens, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001PV13JK/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jetstream Premier</a> (about $7) is one of them. Testers especially appreciated some design features of this pen, namely the softened click action and large grip. The only flaws we found were that its ink doesn’t dry very quickly, and it requires a moderate amount of pressure to write.</p>
<p><b>Uni &#8211; Jetstream (ballpoint): </b>We also liked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001BYNGGO/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Uni &#8211; Jetstream</a>: a pen with a bit of cult following. Different in design from the Premier with its thick gel grip, testers were a fan of its smudge free ink and comfortable hold. One tester noted that though it writes well, they wish the “grip was a little less squishy.” They felt like they “lost a little control with how thick it is.” One of the most expensive pens on our list, the Uni will cost you over $10 at most retailers.</p>
<p><b>Pilot &#8211; Precise V5 (ballpoint): </b>Pilot, the makers of our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058NN4C0/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">best pen overall,</a> also did a good job with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00347A8C6/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">V5</a>. Our testers loved the way this pen writes, and appreciated its uniform and even ink flow. It didn’t bleed or feather, and it required only a small amount of pressure to write. Our only gripe with the V5? It doesn’t have much of a grip, which can make it hard to hold.</p>

<p><b>Sakura &#8211; Gelly Roll Classic (gel): </b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075VLPL1F/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sakura</a> makes many of the fun, glittery gel pens that added color to our childhood, so we were hoping we’d like their office-appropriate black gel pen. However, we found it very uncomfortable to write with. It also skipped more than the other pens we tested.</p>
<p><b>Cross &#8211; Beverly (gel): </b>Cross is known for making higher-end pens that can cost as much as $10,000 (like their discontinued AT0086-107G). We tested one that costs significantly less than that; their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012ENWGI4/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Beverley</a> pen rings in at about $30. <b> </b>Even though the Beverley is on the (very) low end of the cost spectrum for Cross, it’s still significantly more expensive than the other pens we tested. So, we expected excellent results. To our dismay, the Beverly was uncomfortable to write with, tended to feather, bleed and smudge and had a confusing design that made the cap seem like it was on backwards.</p>
<p><b>uni-ball &#8211; 207 Retractable (gel): </b>uni-ball may be popular among writers everywhere, but they missed the mark on their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FDR47E/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">207 gel pen</a>. Our testers found that uni-ball’s gel formula feathered and didn’t create very uniform lines.</p>
<p><b>Paper Mate &#8211; InkJoy (gel): </b>Though Paper Mate’s ballpoint version of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B019QBOG4Y/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InkJoy</a> was the best in our tests, we weren’t as impressed by the gel version. We found that it feathered, bled and tended to smudge.</p>
<p><b>Bic &#8211; Round Stic Xtra Life (ballpoint): </b>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00347A8NK/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bic</a> felt like a standard, uninspired office pen. It was uncomfortable to hold, required a decent amount of pressure to write with, and the ink often felt dry and uneven.</p>
<p><b>uni-ball &#8211; Vision &amp;</b> <b>Vision Elite (rollerball): </b>Both uni-ball’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IE8J/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vision</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002S5383G/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vision Elite</a> feathered, bled and smudged. The Vision also failed to deliver a smooth flow or a uniform line.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>A good pen can make the everyday tasks, from taking notes in a meeting to making a grocery list, a little bit more pleasant. And the good news is, they don’t have to cost you a fortune. All of our top pens cost under $5, and some of them cost under $1. If you’re looking for the perfect all around pen, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058NN4C0/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pilot &#8211; G2 gel pen</a>. If you need a rollerball pen, choose the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IE87/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">uni-ball Onyx</a> for clean-writing lines, and if you prefer the more utilitarian ballpoint style, opt for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004U9TEEA/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paper Mate InkJoy</a>.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>To find the best mechanical pencil, we scoured forums like r/mechanicalpencil and blogs like <a href="https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2008/12/15/review-uni-ball-kuru-toga-mechanical-pencil.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pen Addict</a> (Brad and his friends also love pencils) and <a href="https://bleistift.blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bleistift</a> to get an idea of the pencils the obsessives like best. We also consulted Wirecutter’s and <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/08/pencils/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wired’s</a> reviews of mechanical pencils. Then, we took to Amazon to find the most popular and highly-rated pencils loved by consumers.</p>
<p>We mostly chose pencils sized 0.5 mm to 0.7 mm, but we also tested some larger sizes for those who like range. We know that different people are looking for different levels of quality (and “keepability”) in a mechanical pencil, so we also tested a range of price points, from around 15 cents to 25 dollars per pencil. We tested brands known for their mechanical pencils (like Pentel) and the big two technical drawing brands, as well as some traditionally cheaper brands like Paper Mate.</p>

<h2 id="why-use">Why use them?</h2>
<p>A good mechanical pencil can create smooth, consistent lines (without the need for sharpening). It’s convenient for travel, and is guaranteed not to stain your pocket with ink. There are plenty of studies that show that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handwriting engages your brain</a> better than typing, and some would argue that the more tactile experience of graphite on paper connects you even more to your writing.</p>
<p>A mechanical pencil is refillable and looks more professional than a traditional pencil. Best (and most obvious) of all, its lead is erasable. So you can leave the correction fluid in the drawer. Tradition dictates that pencils should be used for rough sketches, arithmetic, and any other time that you might need to erase or change the marks you&#8217;ve made.</p>
<p>A high-quality mechanical pencil will almost always cost you less than a high-quality pen. And lest style be a concern, rest assured that there are plenty of attractive (and even pen-like) mechanical pencils on the market these days.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Lead size and grade: </b>Most people will like a 0.5mm or 0.7mm width pencil (the width refers to the size of the lead and the line it creates), but there are smaller and larger widths available if you prefer. Lead can also vary in hardness, which changes the shade and the strength of the tip. If you’re a heavy-handed writer or don&#8217;t want smudging, you may want to go with a lighter and harder lead; mechanical pencils often use different grades than regular pencils so they can make the leads stronger so interpreting the grades is tricky.</p>
<p><b>Cost: </b>Mechanical pencil costs can vary dramatically. But just like we learned testing pens, the most expensive isn’t always the best. You should be able to find a mechanical pencil you love for just a few dollars or less.</p>
<p><b>Grip: </b>A pencil grip won’t necessarily make your pencil more comfortable to use, and some people actually find them cumbersome. But if you want a pencil with a big, squishy grip, we know the perfect one for you. Surprisingly, our testers found the grips on some of the higher-end mechanical pencils more uncomfortable — perhaps because they’re designed to keep your grasp firmly in place, but not cushion your hand.</p>
<p><b>Lead advancement: </b>The classic mechanical pencil model requires you to click the top to advance the lead. Some newer models have a side-click mechanism instead. Others still have a twist advance. What’s best for you comes down to preference, though the idea behind a side advance pencil is that it’s quicker and disrupts your writing flow less.</p>

    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Siengepencils.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p><b>Retractable vs. capped: </b>Standard mechanical pencils are retractable, but if you want to look more polished in the boardroom, Pentel makes a capped version.</p>
<p><b>Lead cushioning: </b>Some mechanical pencils use a lead cushion or guard that reinforces the lead against rougher writing styles. If you’re aggressive with your writing utensils, you may want to consider it.</p>
<p><b>Materials and aesthetics: </b>Just like other writing utensils, there are an array of colors and styles of mechanical pencils available. You can get ones that resemble a pen or a conventional woodcase pencil, or you can get something bright and colorful. As a general rule, don’t assume that the quality of the pencil’s “look” is equal to how well it writes.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We recruited the same group of illustrators, hand lettering artists, bullet journalers and designers that we used for our best pen testing to test mechanical pencils. We gave them several weeks to use the pencils throughout their everyday lives, jotting down work notes, writing grocery lists and sketching designs. For quick notes and sketches like this, our testers found that almost all of the mechanical pencils were acceptable. The one exception? The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008LXM47K/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pilot &#8211; Eno</a> pencils, which came with lead that broke immediately upon use.</p>
<p>Then, we conducted a focus group in which our testers used each pencil to write assigned sentences (that used every letter of the alphabet) and doodle their own whimsical creations. After that, each tester gave detailed feedback on the experience of using each pencil. From there, we did a qualitative analysis to determine which mechanical pencil was the best.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, our testers had much stronger opinions about each pencil after being forced to write for minutes on end with each one. Also unsurprising, most feedback had to do with comfort rather than how the pencil actually wrote.</p>

<p>By a narrow margin, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017DBEIG/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pentel &#8211; Quicker Clicker</a> (0.5mm) took first place in our tests for best mechanical pencil for writing. We liked its slick design and its smooth feel, and at just a few dollars, it’s high quality for a low price. Refilling it was easy, and so was advancing the lead.</p>
<p>Pentel is a Japanese-held company that has been innovating in the stationery industry since the mid-forties. They’ve come up with a lot of “firsts,” including the Quicker Clicker mechanism — Pentel says it’s the “original side-advance mechanical pencil.” It comes standard with Pentel lead and eraser, a strong metal clip and a transparent barrel so you can see the status of your lead. You can purchase it in a myriad of colors, and we especially like the classy look of the sky blue.</p>
<p>There are many a loyal Quicker Clicker devotee out there. Unfortunately, many who have been using it for years don’t like the new and “improved” model with the rubber grip. Our testers weren’t bothered by the grip, but some didn’t like the side advance as much as a “traditional” mechanical pencil that requires you to click the top.</p>

With smooth lead and a slick aesthetic, the Pentel - Quicker Clicker is both a joy to write with and attractive enough to leave out on your desk.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017DBEIG/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p><b>Though the </b><b>Quicker Clicker</b><b> has fine lead, it didn’t break when we were writing — even when used by a heavy-handed writer.</b> It also required very little pressure to write with, which will save you from hand cramps if you’ll be writing for a while. The Quicker Clicker, which our testers described as “smooth and reliable,” comes in three line widths: 0.5mm, 0.7mm and 0.9mm. You can get its lead in the traditional graphite (No. 2 grade), or in shades of violet and blue.</p>
<p>The eraser on the Quicker Clicker is high quality, as far as attached mechanical pencil erasers go. In our testing and regular use, we didn’t notice a lot of residue or “smearing” left from erasing mistakes. One thing to be aware of: Some Amazon users complain that the eraser refills for the Quicker Clicker are hard to find in brick-and-mortar stores. That being said, they’re readily available online.</p>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0026ICM1E/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Uni-ball Kuru Toga</a> (0.5mm) was a standout in our tests. Uni-ball is one of the most highly regarded brands in the stationery world, and the Kuru Toga is one of the most frequently discussed (and recommended) mechanical pencils by the aficionados. We can see why. The lead is high-quality and doesn’t break when you write with it. It’s got a hardy plastic body and clear grip, and feels balanced in your hand.</p>

Only narrowly missing the first place mark due to its hard-to-refill lead, the Uni-ball Kuru Toga impressed us with its high quality and virtually break-proof lead.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0026ICM1E/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>Uni-ball was founded in Tokyo, so it’s no wonder that its name is Japanese. The Kuru Toga was <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/kuru-toga-a-comprehensive-guide/pt/706" target="_blank" rel="noopener">named</a> with a Japanese portmanteau of “rotating” and “to become sharp.” This aptly describes the pencil’s rotating lead mechanism which keeps lead, you guessed it, consistently sharp.<b> For this reason, we think it’s one of the best mechanical pencils for writing longform.</b></p>
<p>Like with a traditional mechanical pencil, you click the top of the Kuru Toga to advance the lead, and from there it flows nice and smoothly. So why isn’t the Kuru Toga our first-choice pick? Changing the lead is a little more difficult than usual, due to the very small opening the pencil provides to insert the lead.</p>
<p>Even so, the Kuru Toga beats every other pick in terms of quality and smoothness of writing. And in those respects, it’s also right on par with the Quicker Clicker.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for something that feels good to write with, but doesn’t cause a panic if you lose it, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001T6QCJC/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paper Mate &#8211; 34666PP Clearpoint</a>. At less than $1.50 per pencil, it delivers quality and value all wrapped up in an erasable package.</p>

For less than two bucks, you get something that feels good to write with.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001T6QCJC/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>Our testers found this pencil comfortable and easy to use. <b>One tester even went so far as to say that it was his favorite to write with — even more so than the expensive pencils. </b>The only concern with the Paper Mate? The eraser doesn’t erase very well. But with the ubiquitous and cheap auxiliary erasers available on Amazon, we don’t consider this too big a problem. In fact, you could purchase one of these mechanical pencils and a separate eraser for less than the cost of some of the other pencils on our list.</p>
<p>Like our top pick, the Paper Mate requires you to click the side of the pencil to advance it. It’s got a clear barrel so you can see the status of your lead, and it has a textured grip that some users will like. It’s worth noting that this one also comes in a colored pencil version with an array of rainbow leads available.</p>

<p><b>Zebra &#8211; M701:</b> Zebra is a big name in writing utensils, and we’re generally impressed with their products. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003G4SSLK/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M701</a> is not an exception. It’s got the weighted, smooth feel of a high-quality pencil and it encourages neat handwriting. Plus, while the grip isn’t smooth, it also doesn’t dig into your hand. The Zebra lost points because it felt especially heavy, which can tire your hand out over time. Still, some writers may prefer a weightier pencil. At over five dollars, it’s more expensive than most of our pencil picks, but we also think it’s one of the best quality mechanical pencils out there.</p>
<p><b>Pentel &#8211; Sharp Kerry: </b>There’s no doubt that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017DBEIG/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Quicker Clicker</a> is the best Pentel mechanical pencil, but the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006SW6YO/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Sharp Kerry</a> is probably the classiest. It looks exactly like a capped pen until you remove the cap and see its point. Some testers found it a bit slippery and hard to hold on to. Nonetheless, it can’t be beat for its sophisticated look, and when all is said and done, it writes well.</p>
<p><b>rOtring &#8211; 600 Series: </b>This is a classic design that has an avid following among designers; we’ll call the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001A1POWC/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">rOtring</a> a luxury mechanical pencil. At more than 25 dollars, it’s certainly an investment. As we would hope, it performed well on almost all accounts: smooth, break-free lead and controlled writing included. If you want a pencil that doesn&#8217;t get in the way when you&#8217;re using a stencil or ruler, this is a great pick. The only thing we didn’t like was the tiny hole you’re forced to fit the lead through when you refill it. It’s a minor complaint, but for a pencil this expensive, we expect near perfection. The rOtring comes pretty close.</p>
<p><b>Uni &#8211; Kuru Toga Roulette: </b>Similar to our runner up, but with an upgraded metal body and knurled grip. Our testers found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004OHNTVC/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Uni &#8211; Kuru Toga Roulette</a> to be “light and efficient” and an overall joy to use. There’s not much to pick on with this pencil — we love its performance. This is a good thing, since one will cost you about ten dollars. If we had to pick something to dislike, we’d say the eraser on this pencil is a little small.</p>
<p><b>Pentel &#8211; GraphGear 1000 Automatic Drafting: </b>Our testers found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GAU2RU/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GraphGear 1000</a> to be delightfully “futuristic,” and they also liked that the top clicks into place like a pen when you advance the lead. It’s nicely weighted (not too heavy or too light) and writes well and smoothly. The only downsides? Some testers found the lead filling process a little cumbersome and the lead itself a little weak.</p>
<p><b>Staedtler &#8211; Silver Series: </b>A pencil with the name “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002BNHMC8/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silver Series</a>” (and a price point of over ten dollars) invites some big expectations, and for the most part the Staetdler didn’t disappoint. It&#8217;s available with an extra-sharp 0.3mm size and writes precisely and smoothly. Like the rOtring, this is a technical pencil well-known among architects, planners, and designers. Our testers’ biggest complaint with this pencil was the grip; most found it somewhat uncomfortable. If you’re not writing longform content though, this pencil might still be for you.</p>
<p><strong>Paper Mate &#8211; 1.3mm Mechanical Pencils</strong> Paper Mate markets these as an alternative to the traditional woodcase pencils, and they do look like a fat and colorful version of the original. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CRGP8B6/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1.3mm</a> are targeted toward young children who are just learning to write — the larger width of these utensils makes them easier for little hands to control. However, there were plenty of user comments from full-grown adults who love these pencils and the thick lines they create. Are they right for you? It comes down to taste. Most of our testers found them very comfortable to write with.</p>
<h3>Pencils we don&#8217;t recommend</h3>
<p><b>BIC &#8211; Xtra Sparkle: </b>With a name like “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007L1VLO/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xtra Sparkle</a>,” we didn’t expect this BIC to deliver high-octane pencil performance. Still, with nearly 2,000 Amazon reviews, we had to give it a go. Unsurprisingly, it was sub-par in almost every way. When asked to describe it in two words, one tester said “meh” and “whatever.” For quality, we give this one a 50 percent. For jazzing up your kid’s pencil box? A solid 100.</p>
<p><b>Pilot &#8211; Color Eno: </b>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008LXM47K/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Color Eno</a> are the only “colored pencils” we tested, again due to their high number of reviews. Their primary tester, a designer, actually loved their hues. However, he found that the lead broke easily and that the pencils were overall “not super reliable.”</p>
<p><b>Pentel &#8211; Sharp Automatic:</b> The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000SBSAYE/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sharp Automatic</a> is another pencil that probably lands somewhere in the “meh” and “whatever” zone. It doesn’t stand out for much except its uncomfortable grip and the distinctive way it makes you feel not-in-control of your own writing.</p>
<p><b>Pentel &#8211; Twist Erase: </b>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00822DZLY/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Twist Erase</a> has a cool name, but the lead is too light, thick and dull. Our testers found that you have to press harder than is comfortable to use it. Another complaint: It doesn’t allow for very good control of your writing.</p>
<p><b>Pentel &#8211; GraphGear 500: </b>We loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GAU2RU/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GraphGear 1000</a>, but its little brother didn&#8217;t make the same impression. We found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006HXQXA/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">500</a> to be dull and fragile, with lead that breaks too easily and a lead changing process that’s too time-consuming. This one isn’t worth paying over five dollars for.</p>
<p><b>Alvin &#8211; Draft-Matic: </b>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VTP62U/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alvin,</a> another “luxury” pencil at over ten dollars for one, disappointed us. It’s sleek and cool looking, but it’s uncomfortable to hold, it’s too hard to change the lead and it made our writing uneven and scratchy.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>We tend to treat mechanical pencils like they’re disposable, but really, a good one should last you a long time. For one you’ll want to keep around, we recommend the all-around impressive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017DBEIG/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pentel &#8211; Quicker Clicker</a>. If for some reason you can’t get your hands on that one, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0026ICM1E/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Uni-ball &#8211; Kuru Toga</a> is also a good bet. And if you do want one you can treat like a disposable, then choose the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001T6QCJC/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paper Mate &#8211; 34666PP Clearpoint</a>. It’s great quality for a very low price.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter 50+ hours spent researching, testing and tasting coffee and even more hours spent analyzing concerns and comments from consumers, we determined that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YEYKK8U/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO &#8211; On Barista Brain</a> is the overall best drip coffee maker thanks to its modern design, refined construction and delicious brew. For connoisseurs who want drip coffee in its purest form, try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O9FO1HK/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bonavita &#8211; BV1900TS</a>. Without any bells and whistles, this brewer sticks to basics and produces a simple cup that a barista would be proud of. If you want one below the $100 threshold, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MVWGQX0/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; DCC-3200</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>The massive home-brewing industry includes several substantial subcategories like <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-single-cup-coffee-maker/">single-cup coffee makers</a>, percolators, <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-french-press/">French press coffee makers</a> and drip coffee makers. To narrow down the focus and ensure we were able to test thoroughly, we opted to specifically test the most popular drip coffee makers. We also wanted to take cost, ease of use and coffee amount into consideration.</p>
<p>Drip coffee makers are the most common household appliances for brewing coffee at home. Consisting of a reservoir, a heating element, a shower head, a container for grounds and a tube connecting the heating element to the reservoir, they have a relatively simple composition. This simplicity makes them easy to use, durable and capable of quenching the thirst for an entire office of coffee drinkers, or just one java lover at home.</p>
<p>We wanted to ensure that a variety of brands and styles were tested, so we took to consumer reports, reddit and consumer forums to see what other coffee drinkers were saying. On reddit, we came across the Bonavita and the Moccamaster, which were mentioned in nearly every thread on drip coffee makers.</p>
<p>We also read hundreds of Amazon consumer reviews. Afterwards, we scoured the rankings for twelve coffee makers that had the highest number of five-star reviews and cross-checked other sites.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://scaa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA)</a> was the next step in our elimination process. The SCAA has a list of well-regarded home brewing machines that they recommend. It should be noted that to be considered for their list, you must apply. The SCAA rigorously tests each applicant “on proper water temperature, brewing time and ability to brew within their Golden Cup recommendations.” There are only 12 home brewers currently certified by the SCAA.</p>
<p>We also consulted the extensive <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/coffee-makers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Reports</a> guide, as well as reviews from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Best Buy. We added a Hamilton Beach maker to our list after noting that Consumer Reports highlighted several different models. None of their other suggestions passed the Amazon consumer rating test; they all either had poor ratings or a small number of excellent reviews.</p>
<p>After narrowing down the list to six candidates, we decided to dive into the science behind the brewing process so we knew which elements to test. The science is simple. Fill the reservoir with the desired amount of water, measure the grounds, add them to the filter, and it is time to brew!</p>
<p>The heating element boils the water causing it to bubble and rise through the tube and into the shower. Here, it flows through the grounds and creates the coffee, which drips into the pot. This meant we needed to test water temperature during the brewing process and the amount of time each coffee maker takes from start to finish.</p>
<p>Both the basic construction and process behind drip coffee makers are what make them durable and easy to maintain. No one wants to solve a math equation first thing in the morning. They just want to pour some water, measure some grounds, press a button and enjoy.</p>
<p>Once we were versed in the best coffee makers on the market and knew exactly how they brewed coffee, we were ready to begin testing.</p>

<p><strong>Taste:</strong> Taste is obviously subjective, but you should take your preferences into consideration. Are you ok with a cup of joe from a fast-food joint or do you prefer going to a coffee shop? Can you distinguish between burnt, nutty or fruity coffee? Do you prefer bitter? All of this comes into play when choosing which coffee maker to purchase. The beans you select play a large role in determining the taste of the coffee, but don’t underestimate the machine. Some are constructed to brew for speed, others for temperature, and some are intended to brew to the SCAA Golden Standard.</p>
<p><strong>Carafe Size (or cup capacity):</strong> If you are brewing at home, you may not need a 14-cup carafe, but this could very well be a requirement for an office.</p>
<p><strong>Footprint:</strong> If you live in a studio or have a small kitchenette in your office, you may not be willing to dedicate a large amount of space to your coffee machine. So, you will want to consider space when purchasing.</p>
<p><strong>Height:</strong> If you plan to put your coffee maker on your kitchen countertop, be sure to measure the height available in your space. Many of the coffee makers we tested required additional space above them to allow room for pouring water into the reservoir.</p>
<p><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> A well-designed coffee maker will have a comfortable carafe handle, be easy to pour and easy to fill. It should also be fairly intuitive to use and simple to clean. There shouldn’t be any pools of water around the machine after pouring.</p>
<p><strong>Brew Time:</strong> Not everyone will mind if their coffee takes 20 minutes to brew, but some want it to be ready in minutes after they wake up. This is also an important factor if you want a machine that meets SCAA standards. They mandate that water should only be in contact with the coffee grounds for six to eight minutes. If it is taking longer, the flavor will be impacted which can result in a bitter cup of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> There is a huge range in cost for coffee makers. The cheapest machine we tested was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EI7DPPI/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach</a> coming in around $57.69. On the other end, the Moccamaster cost close to $300.95.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We used a combination of qualitative and quantitative tests to determine the best coffee maker. First, we noted practical concerns like temperature, brew time and cup capacity that came up frequently in product reviews. Then we also called on the team to provide insight into usability and taste.</p>
<p>We invited eight colleagues to use and taste the six coffee makers and provide feedback over the course of one day. The following day we asked eight different colleagues to participate in a blind taste test and took our own notes on usability. This called for several rounds of testing and resulted in a very hyper work environment. Our goal was to test the coffee makers against SCAA standards to see how they matched up.</p>
<p>We used a burr grinder and fresh coffee beans throughout all testing to ensure consistency in taste and grind sizes.</p>
<h3>Carafe Capacity</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-7031 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/carafe-capacity.jpg" alt="carafe size comparison" width="900" height="488" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/carafe-capacity.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/carafe-capacity-610x331.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/carafe-capacity-768x416.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/carafe-capacity-300x163.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/carafe-capacity-295x160.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/carafe-capacity-885x480.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/carafe-capacity-360x195.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/carafe-capacity-375x203.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/carafe-capacity-414x224.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/carafe-capacity-320x174.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>As we mentioned above, cup capacity is a big factor to consider when choosing a coffee machine. If you are only brewing for yourself, a 14-cup carafe may be overkill. In an office of 20, the Bonavita didn’t seem quite sufficient. The Cuisinart has the largest cup capacity of 14 cups. While it was slow to brew, it did maintain temperature, which we&#8217;ll delve further into later.</p>
<h3>Brew time</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/brew-time-animation.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The SCAA has set standards for brew time as well. They require that brew time last more than four minutes but no longer than eight. If the brew cycle continues for too long, the resulting coffee can be bitter, and if it’s too short it will not be strong enough to keep you caffeinated.</p>
<p>Brew time varied considerably. We noted that prime performance occurred between the eight- to ten-cup capacity. If more water than that had to be shuttled through the machine, the task simply could not be completed in time.</p>
<p>We performed this test with two iterations. The first time we used exactly eight cups (to match the capacity of our smallest machine), then in the second test we loaded each reservoir with the maximum capacity. In both iterations, only the Bonavita, Moccamaster and the OXO were able to brew a cup in the prime amount of time.</p>
<p>The Bunn was able to brew efficiently as well, but it has many shortcomings which are why we took it out of the running for this test.</p>
<h3>Temperature</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7033" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brew-basket-temps.png" alt="brew basket temp. data" width="1800" height="1475" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brew-basket-temps.png 1800w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brew-basket-temps-610x500.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brew-basket-temps-1500x1229.png 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brew-basket-temps-768x629.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brew-basket-temps-885x725.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brew-basket-temps-300x246.png 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brew-basket-temps-295x242.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brew-basket-temps-1000x819.png 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brew-basket-temps-360x295.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brew-basket-temps-375x307.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brew-basket-temps-414x339.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brew-basket-temps-320x262.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>According to the SCAA and industry standard, a coffee machine should reach within five degrees of 200 °F for four to six minutes. We used the Javelin PRO digital thermometer to measure the water temperature when it began brewing and then measured again five minutes later. To ensure that we were getting the water temperature as it hit the coffee grounds, as the SCAA requires for certification, we inserted the Javelin right above the grounds where the shower head disposes the water.</p>
<p>The SCAA also has relatively strict requirements for temperatures in the carafe after brewing, which we also tested.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the three priciest models were the only coffee makers to come close to upholding this standard. The OXO was the only coffee maker to maintain the appropriate temperature for five minutes. The Bonavita and the Moccamaster both came close, passing the first test but losing heat in the second.</p>

<h3>Brewing methods</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7035" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brewing-method.jpg" alt="brewing method" width="900" height="507" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brewing-method.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brewing-method-610x344.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brewing-method-768x433.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brewing-method-300x169.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brewing-method-295x166.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brewing-method-885x499.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brewing-method-360x203.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brewing-method-375x211.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brewing-method-414x233.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brewing-method-320x180.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Now we get into the fun stuff. After watching these coffee makers in action for the above testing, we brewed a few pots in each machine for tasting. We opted to do both a blind and an open trial to get feedback on functionality as well as pure taste. The eight of us involved in the taste testing are coffee addicts who drink multiple cups a day, both home-brewed and from our favorite local coffee shops.</p>
<p><strong>Brew Methods</strong> &#8211; We did several rounds of taste testing over the course of a few days and brewed with two methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>We brewed according to the SCAA standards which call for approximately two tablespoons of coffee grounds per ¾ cup of water.</li>
<li>We followed the recommendations listed in each maker’s manual.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first round following SCAA guidelines had far more polarizing results. The scores ranged much more dramatically than when we followed each individual manual. The Moccamaster, the OXO and the Bonavita all required the same amount of grounds as the SCAA standard (which may be why they are all on their list of certified home brewers). As for the other three machines, the amount of coffee was cut in half.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that while the range of results was much higher in the test that made use of the SCAA scale, the order remained the same. The OXO came in first and the Bunn took last place.</p>
<p>Each maker also came with a recommended serving amount of coffee grinds per cup of water. The OXO and the Moccamaster both came with their own serving scoops which resulted in the highest ranking coffee according to our taste test.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, when we followed the instructions in the user manual, the Cuisinart coffee was even stronger. We expected the high-end machines to follow very closely to SCAA standards, which they did, but we didn’t expect the less-specialized makers to recommend the same high amount of coffee. Again, the results followed in the same order with the OXO taking first and the Bunn coming in last.</p>

<p>During both tests, we asked all participants to rank each coffee on a scale from one to ten on smell, taste, strength and bitterness. We gave them a minute to enjoy each sample and offered water and plain biscuits in between cups to help neutralize their palettes. The floor was also open for any additional feedback.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YEYKK8U/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO</a> took first place overall. It scored third in bitterness in both tests, which we considered ideal as we prefer our coffee to be strong but not overly bitter. When the results were averaged, the OXO won in all versions of the test that we performed. It produced coffee with a pleasant aroma and a strength that will wake you up without the biting bitterness.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O9FO1HK/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bonavita</a> came in second place. It ranked highly for both taste and bitterness. If you do not like strong bitter coffee, this is not the machine for you.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002S4MUHM/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Moccamaster</a> narrowly scored third place, with similar scores that were just slightly lower than the Bonavita. The Moccamaster was notably less bitter than the Bonavita. It was also mentioned by several participants that coffee this machine produced was not particularly hot.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MVWGQX0/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart</a> scored well in strength and bitterness, balancing out the lower taste and smell results. The one positive comment we heard repeatedly was the nice temperature. Our office likes their coffee hot.</p>

<h3>Cleaning &amp; general user experience</h3>
<p>While each machine brewed a drinkable cup of coffee, the user experience was not created equal. Many of these had slightly aggravating quirks that either resulted in a mess or a less than seamless initial brew.</p>
<p>The Bunn was not even part of an initial group test because it took so long to figure out how to get the machine started. All other coffee makers can be operated without really looking at the manual.</p>
<p>With The Bunn, you will need the instructions, YouTube tutorial and a time machine so you can just avoid the whole experience. You have to pour water in the reservoir, allow that to heat up and then brew as normal. This may not sound atrocious, but try emptying and cleaning it and get back to us. Aside from the Bunn, none of the coffee machines we tested had any flaws that would prevent us from buying again.</p>
<p>The Bonavita has a reservoir that is slightly difficult to fill, but you will only make this mistake once. It also has a brew basket that only attaches to the carafe, which means fewer pieces; however, you have nowhere to place the wet, leaking basket when you go to pour your coffee.</p>
<p>The Moccamaster has a durable yet lightweight build but also has a lot of loose plastic parts that could easily go missing. It has a cool sensor feature that prevents brewing unless the thermal carafe is placed properly, which helps to prevent spills.</p>
<p>Cuisinart has a lid design that users had trouble with because it had to be removed in order to fill the reservoir. Said reservoir also had a narrow opening that led to several spills.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach and the OXO didn’t have any notable complaints.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>When it came to price, there was a notable range of several hundred dollars between the most and least expensive models we tested. The Hamilton Beach, coming in at $57.69 at our last check, was the least expensive. On the other end of the price spectrum was the Moccamaster costing a whopping $307.95 which is over one hundred dollars more than the next most expensive coffee maker.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach is a cost-effective model that markets itself as two for the price of one because of the single-serve option. While we had several complaints with the single-serve option, this was a solid option for the price (albeit slow to brew).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YEYKK8U/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO &#8211; On Barista Brain 9-Cup Coffee Maker</a> won our top pick not only for its simplistic design and usability but also for the quality cup of coffee it produced. Each step of the brewing process from filling the reservoir to enjoying your cup was a breeze. In fact, it is so quiet and easy to use that our team asked if they were using it properly. You need only select your cup amount and wait until the reservoir is empty. Testers appreciated that this machine was simple and fine-tuned in every detail.</p>
<p>The only complaint heard from any of our participants was that you cannot see through the aluminum pot to know how much is left, which can lead to disappointment when the afternoon fatigue hits and there is no coffee left.</p>
<p>While it did have a brew time of 8:37 for a full pot, which is several minutes longer than both the Bonavita and Moccamaster (which came in at 6:15 and 6:12 respectively), there were far fewer flaws in this machine than in the other top contenders.</p>

<p>The OXO was the only coffee maker to abide by the SCAA rules and keep brewing temperatures within five degrees of 200 °F for five minutes. This resulted in a strong, slightly bitter and piping hot cup of coffee. The seasoned coffee drinkers in our office were delighted.</p>
<p>In terms of design, the OXO was a crowd favorite. It had the fewest amount of delicate attachments and a sturdy composition that can handle a high volume of use. It also looks incredibly sleek and modern. This is not an unsightly kitchen necessity; it is a welcome futuristic-looking addition.</p>

<li>The OXO &#8211; On Barista Brain 9-Cup Coffee Maker brewed coffee according to industry standards for temperature and brew time.</li>
<li>Its sleek stainless steel design looks great on any countertop.</li>

<h2 id="runner-up">Runner-up: Bonavita &#8211; BV1900TS</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-7049 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bonavita-bv1900ts2.jpg" alt="Bonavita - BV1900TS" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bonavita-bv1900ts2.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bonavita-bv1900ts2-610x343.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bonavita-bv1900ts2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bonavita-bv1900ts2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bonavita-bv1900ts2-295x166.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bonavita-bv1900ts2-885x498.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bonavita-bv1900ts2-360x202.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bonavita-bv1900ts2-375x211.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bonavita-bv1900ts2-414x233.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bonavita-bv1900ts2-320x180.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O9FO1HK/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bonavita &#8211; BV1900TS</a> was selected as the second best coffee maker in our testing. We have to qualify this by saying that bitterness was ranked as a negative rather than a positive. If you prefer bitter coffee, the Moccamaster might be a better fit for you.</p>
<p>Overall, The Bonavita brewed a wonderful, balanced and nutty cup of coffee in just six minutes. It came within three degrees of maintaining the temperature recommended by the SCAA. This was likely due to the fact that it had practically finished brewing by the time five minutes had passed and we measured the temperature again.</p>
<p>This coffee machine looks like something you would see in a trendy coffee shop or on a designer kitchen’s counter. Without any bells and whistles, this maker is built with one purpose, delivering a consistent and reliable cup of coffee. Although the individual pieces won’t strike you as built to last, the pared-down design makes it seem like this coffee machine has a long life in it.</p>

<p>While the Bonavita did produce the best tasting cup of coffee, there are a few notable concerns that prevented it from being our top pick. Let’s start with filling the reservoir. This seems like a simple task, but if you like to fill the reservoir with your coffee pot, you are in for a mess. Without the lid, the coffee pot spills water everywhere and you will quickly find any nearby items covered in water. We opted to use an extra cup rather than the coffee pot itself.</p>
<p>Next we have the shower head and basket. The shower head is flimsy and mists over coffee grounds that lay in a filter basket. The basket is not attached to anything and becomes a nuisance after brewing. When you go to pour your first cup, you have to remove the filter basket and replace with the lid. While we did find this to be annoying, we adapted quickly and found that it pressured us to maintain a cleaner coffee maker (since you are forced to empty and clean the filter basket immediately after use).</p>
<p>Overall, this is a pricy option but it did brew amazing coffee and was easy to clean and maintain. It also takes up a very small amount of space and has a portable aluminum coffee pot you can bring to your workspace for easy refills.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Bonavita &#8211; BV1900TS&#8217;s design is aesthetically approved for most households with its petite, sleek shape.</li>
<li>The basket in which the grounds are placed are not fixed to the machine, occasionally leading to a scattering of coffee grounds.</li>
<li>This is a pricy option, but the coffee it brews is top-notch.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="budget-pick">Budget pick: Cuisinart &#8211; DCC-3200</h2>

<p>If you are looking for a quality coffee maker under $100, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MVWGQX0/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; DCC-3200</a> is a great choice. It came in third place in our taste test and cost only $74.99 when we checked last, which is $100+ less than our top pick and $200 less than our second choice. This is also a great option for an office because it brews a whopping 14 cups at a time, which is significantly more than the OXO’s nine-cup limit.</p>

<p>While brewing a batch of coffee, we really enjoyed the sturdiness of this machine. The handle was the most comfortable to hold and carry.  Although this coffee maker might not have the same sleek design as the high-end Bonavita or Moccamaster, it still looks relatively streamlines and is quiet and compact, especially considering how much coffee it can produce.</p>
<p>In the taste test, several participants noted how great the temperature of this coffee was. If you prefer a piping hot cup of joe, give the Cuisinart a shot.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, this was one of the only machines that actually notified you with a beep when the brewing process was complete. We thought this was a nice touch on a well-thought-out product.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Cuisinart &#8211; DCC-3200 is a steal that also brews a whopping 14 cups at a time.</li>
<li>This machine brewed the hottest cup of joe and even notifies you when coffee is brewed.</li>

<h2 id="other-finalists">Other finalists we tested</h2>

<h3>Technivorm &#8211; Moccamaster KBT</h3>
<p>There was a notable divide in the six coffee machines we tested. Three were built to appease coffee connoisseurs and the other three were built for those who just want a cup of morning joe. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002S4MUHM/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Technivorm &#8211; Moccamaster</a> definitely belongs in the former category. This difference was not only evident in cost, but design and taste.</p>
<p>Costing $307 at our last check, this maker has the price tag and delicate design that elevates it from the everyday brand. We really enjoyed using this coffee machine and drinking the coffee it produced. It narrowly missed being named our runner-up because of the bitterness of the coffee it brewed.</p>
<h3>The Hamilton Beach &#8211; 49980A</h3>
<p>Not only is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EI7DPPI/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach</a> the cheapest coffee maker on our list, but it also offers a single-serve option. The Hamilton Beach came in last place in our taste tests and scored low for the poor strength of the coffee. This coffee maker was not made for satisfying a refined palette; it was made for practicality.</p>
<h3>The Bunn &#8211; NHS Velocity Brew</h3>
<p>None of the other coffee makers had any notable flaws that would prevent us from recommending a purchase other than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EAQJCWW/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bunn &#8211; NHS Velocity Brew</a>. Using the Bunn is the opposite of straightforward.</p>
<p>When you start your day, a complicated coffee maker is the last thing you want to deal with. The instruction manual was practically useless. We had to watch several YouTube tutorials to even get the brewing started.</p>
<p>When first setting up the Bunn coffee maker, we had to fill multiple pots of water into the maker. It&#8217;s easy to overfill without warning, which results in water spilling from the bottom. After making a huge mess, we hesitantly hit the start button.</p>
<p>Both filling and emptying the water reservoir is an ordeal. To empty it, you have to pick it up, carry it to the sink and hold the entire machine upside down. This led to our assumption that most Bunn users probably don’t clean their coffee maker often.</p>
<p>The Bunn can brew a cup in three-and-a-half minutes because it is always on and always heating the water that is permanently left in the reservoir.</p>
<p>Although the Bunn is recommended by the SCAA, during our testing we found that it failed to reach proper temperature when brewing the coffee or hold at the proper temperature. SCAA rule states that the brew basket much reach, but never exceed 197.6-204.8 °F, we found the Bunn only reached 196 °F. Another rule requires the carafe to hold an entire pot of coffee between 176-185 °F for 30 minutes, but at the end of 30 minutes, the Bunn had dropped to a temperature of 168 °F.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>All of these coffee machines produce drinkable coffee, but in our opinion, a coffee maker should be more than that. If you are a caffeine addict like us, you rely on this machine to get you through the day. Investing slightly more for a cup of coffee that makes you eager to get out of bed in the morning is a game changer.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YEYKK8U/?tag=ybddrip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO</a> not only had us racing to get that first sip in the morning, but it also revamped our countertop. The space is no longer covered in coffee grounds or puddles of coffee from a poorly designed machine. The coffee area is tidy, because every part of the OXO is doing exactly what it was designed to do and looking super cool while doing it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> single cup of coffee is often all we need as we’re rushing out the door in the morning or fighting that midafternoon crash at work.

<h2 id="what-is">What is a single-cup coffee maker?</h2>
<p>Single-cup coffee makers fall into one of three categories.</p>
<p><strong>Drip machines:</strong> First, single-cup coffee makers can be simpler, smaller versions of traditional drip machines. These look and function like most home brewers you’re probably familiar with, but they drip coffee directly into your waiting mug.</p>
<p><strong>Keurig pod compatible:</strong> The Keurig brand dominates pod coffee makers, and they&#8217;re the largest supplier of both machines and patented cups of prepackaged ground coffee vacuum-sealed in nitrogen to prevent oxidation. With the pod in place and the mechanism shut, small pins pierce both the top and bottom of the pod.</p>
<p>At the push of a button, water is pumped from a tank on the side of the machine into a reservoir containing the heating coils. Once the water is heated to the optimal temperature, it is pushed through the pod and directly into your mug.</p>
<p><strong>Nespresso:</strong> A third type of machine creates a stronger, more concentrated espresso-style brew. Also dominated by a single brand, Nespresso, these machines pump out shots of espresso topped with that desirable frothy layer of crema. The shots can be enjoyed on their own or used to make lattes, cappuccinos, and other espresso drinks.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-chose">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>We wanted to put together a comprehensive sample of the best coffee makers out there, representative of these three categories. Before we started our research online, we got input from our resident coffee aficionados. Obviously, the two big names, Keurig and Nespresso had to be included.</p>
<p>We spent a dozen hours combing through Amazon reviews, coffee blogs, and ranking sites like Cnet and Consumer Reports. We also watched product demonstration videos and searched through a few subreddits in the pursuit of actionable information and advice. Using this new knowledge, we chose seven products for testing.</p>
<h3>2019 Update</h3>
<p>In our initial round-up, we featured the flagship of the Keurig &#8220;2.0 system&#8221; fleet, the K575. This more expensive Keurig featured a variety of brew settings and the option to fill a carafe using special jumbo-size pods. The 2.0 system was notable for using a proprietary label and electronic reader to only allow Keurig&#8217;s own coffee pods; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9e0yCq1AEeY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it was an easy system to bypass with an old label</a> but many users objected to the intended restriction.</p>
<p>One Keurig 2.0 model is still for sale direct from the manufacturer, but Keurig has switched focus away from proprietary pods. The advantages of the second-generation system, like custom temperature settings or iced coffee brew modes, have now been incorporated into a new K-Elite model that we picked as best overall in a roundup of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-keurig/">the best Keurig brewers</a> in 2019.</p>
<h2 id="the-seven-best">Compare the best single-cup coffee makers</h2>
[table id=270 /]
<h2 id="why-buy">Who needs a single-cup coffee maker</h2>
<p>Single-cup coffee makers have grown in popularity because of their reliability; single-cup machines that use pods make a consistent product every time. They’re efficient, convenient, and offer a huge selection of beverages &#8212; over 200 coffees, teas, and hot chocolates, including styles from Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Snapple, Tazo, and Illycafe.</p>
<p>By eliminating bean scooping and paper filters, these machines also take away the chore of making coffee and cleaning out the machine. No need to guess on the water-to-coffee ratio and no need to measure either. Just pop in the pod, hit the button, drink your coffee, and toss the pod.</p>
<p>With the exception of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MFC73AZ/?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nespresso &#8211; Citiz</a> (pronounced &#8220;cities&#8221;), all the coffee makers we tested also allow you to use your own ground coffee if you prefer. A common complaint in the 1990s, when the Keurig system was introduced, was the reliance on pods exclusively. Today, Keurig offers the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EMWIXL4/tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a>, which lets you use your favorite freshly ground blend from your local roaster.</p>
<p><strong>Brewing one cup at a time also ensures the mug you’re drinking is fresh.</strong> It cuts down on time and waste too. If the first person to get into the office at 8 a.m. makes a full pot of coffee, but the boss doesn’t roll in until after nine, his coffee will be stale, taste burned, and probably end up going in the microwave.</p>
<h2 id="controversy">Controversy around single-cup coffee makers</h2>
<p><strong>First, K-Cup coffee is more expensive than buying beans and using a traditional brewing machine, French press, or percolator.</strong> Depending on the particular K-Cup and brand of coffee in comparison, coffee made with the Keurig system is somewhere between three and five times more expensive.</p>
<p>According to an article published in the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/03/the-abominable-k-cup-coffee-pod-environment-problem/386501/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March 2015 issue of the Atlantic</a>, the 11 grams of coffee per pod works out to about $40 per pound. A pound of whole bean dark roast at Starbucks goes for about $12 a pound and the same is about $9 at Dunkin Donuts.</p>
<p>Even our favorite local premium roaster in San Diego, Dark Horse Coffee, sells its <a href="http://www.darkhorsecoffeeroasters.com/shop/harrar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethiopian Yirgacheffe</a> for $18 a pound, which is still less than half the price of a pound of K-Cup coffee.</p>
<p>When the Keurig was introduced in 1990, the company held the exclusive patent on the cups that fit into the machine. In September of 2012, that patent expired and the market was flooded with private-label pods from a variety of independent and corporate entities. The competition brought down prices &#8212; but only temporarily.</p>
<p>Keurig responded by introducing a sensor embedded in their 2.0 models that prohibits the use of unlicensed pods. The machine reads a piece of digital information on each pod label and will only brew if the pod is, in fact, a licensed variety. The competition, in turn, filed lawsuits and the Internet community posted hacks and workarounds that allowed third-party pods to be used.</p>
<p>Proprietary pod detectors have all but disappeared from Keurig&#8217;s line, but consumer freedom advocates have long memories.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the Keurig system that has drawn criticism is the environmental impact of the one-use-only pods, which are neither easily recyclable nor biodegradable.<strong> According to <a href="https://www.recycleacup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recycleacup.com</a>, K-Cups can only be recycled if the separate components are taken apart prior to recycling.</strong></p>
<p>Pods are made of a combination of plastic, aluminum, and paper. The coffee inside must be emptied before you put it in the recycle bin, and each different material within the K-Cup should be separated. Most people don’t do this. Therefore, most coffee brewed with a Keurig machine results in another plastic pod being added to the trash.</p>
<p>A traditional drip coffee maker or pour-over method utilizes a paper filter that is biodegradable and compostable, and French presses and percolators create no waste. That cannot be said for Keurig systems. Not only are the disposable K-Cups an environmental issue, but also the manufacturing of them involves many more steps than any other kind of coffee.</p>
<p>Many coffee drinkers find convenience in pod-style coffee machines. They pour a consistent cup of coffee every time, they’re cost-effective compared to buying a cup of coffee at Starbucks, and you can choose from a variety of flavors and beverages. If you consider that worth the expense, read on.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-look-for">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4066" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Top-picks.jpg" alt="top coffee makers" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Top-picks.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Top-picks-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Top-picks-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Top-picks-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Top-picks-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Top-picks-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Top-picks-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Top-picks-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Top-picks-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>The features that are important to you will primarily be determined by the type of coffee you intend to make on a daily basis. If espresso-based coffee drinks get you going in the morning, you should look no further than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MFC73AZ?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nespresso &#8211; Citiz Espresso Maker</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to continue to make drip coffee from freshly ground beans, and you want to manipulate the strength and water-to-coffee ratios yourself, you probably don’t need a Keurig. But, if you’re attracted to the convenience and variety of the K-Cup system, then choosing which one is right for you will require looking at some additional factors.</p>
<h3>Size</h3>
<p>These machines vary significantly in terms of size. <strong>The Keurig appliances are large and can take up quite a bit of counter space</strong>. Their height, in particular, makes them hard to store out of the way and off of the counter, in a cabinet or on a shelf. The size of your kitchen and your needs for clear counter space will lead to considering some options over others.</p>
<h3>Aesthetics</h3>
<p>In addition to varying dimensions, the machines all have distinct design qualities that make them more or less visually appealing. Some models are sleek, sharp, and impressive. Others look bulky, antiquated, or cheap.</p>
<p>Objectivity is difficult to achieve when evaluating what looks good aesthetically, but for something that will end up most likely living in view on your kitchen counter, it would be nice to like the way your coffee maker looks.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>Your Best Digs is primarily motivated by the quest to find and recommend the very best products. While value is important to us, we do all of our testing and evaluation without weighing price too heavily. We aim to give our readers a complete understanding of what it’s like to own and use these products. Armed with that information, it is then ultimately for you to decide on the cost-benefit analysis that fits your needs and your budget.</p>
<p><strong>It’s important to remember, however, that it’s not just the cost of these machines that varies so greatly; so does the cost of operating them</strong>. As discussed above, the price per cup of using the Keurig or Nespresso pod system is much higher than using a traditional grind and drip. The convenience vs. affordability evaluation will differ depending on what you value.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Capacity</h3>
[table id=267 /]
<p>Our first task was to noted the different volumes that each machine pours in order to determine the size of cup that it can accommodate. Many travel mugs, like the 12-ounce version of the top-ranked model in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/">travel mug review</a>, will fit under the standard 7&#8243; spout, but in most cases we had to remove a drip tray to get extra clearance.</p>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<p>One of the main attractions of the single-cup coffee maker is the speed. Most people hope for a quick process with a minimal wait time as they’re trying to get out the door in the morning. We ran the clock on both the time it took for each machine to heat the water and how long it took to brew an eight-ounce drink (a 3.7-ounce pour with the Nespresso).</p>
<p>When considering time, it’s useful to know that two of the machines we tested offer an auto-on timer option &#8212; the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014W1C2VM?th=1?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart SS-700 Single Serve Brewing System</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018UQ5VEK?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Keurig &#8211; K-Elite</a>. The water heater will click on at the specific time you set, which means all you have to do is press the brew button and you’ll be drinking coffee in less than a minute.</p>
[table id=269 /]
<h3>Heat</h3>
<p>One common complaint of people using Keurig machines is that the coffee isn’t quite as hot at they would like it to be. Most coffee is recommended to be brewed between 195 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit, and served between 155 and 175 degrees, but personal preference for coffee temperature varies widely.</p>
<p>We used the thermometer that won our pick for <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-digital-meat-thermometer/">best digital thermometer</a>, the Lavatools Javelin Pro, to determine the temperature of an eight-ounce cup of coffee immediately after the brewing process concluded. For the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MFC73AZ?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nespresso &#8211; Citiz</a>, we used the larger 3.7-ounce setting since it lacks an eight-ounce option. If you know you tend to enjoy your coffee at a certain temperature, the data we found during this test will be particularly helpful.</p>
<p>Note that high-end Keurig machines feature a temperature adjustment setting, but this only brings the brew temperature down from 192 degrees to allow for brewing at high altitudes where water will boil at low temperatures. We tested at the default (highest) setting of 192 which resulted in water hitting the cup at just under 170.</p>
[table id=268 /]
<h3>Accessories</h3>
<p>The machines we tested come with a variety of different accessories to suit any taste. Some come with charcoal filters, which attach to a wand sitting in the water tank to purify the water before brewing. <strong>Some Keurig systems come with a K-Cup reusable coffee filter that allows you to use your own ground coffee</strong>, while you might need to buy this piece separately with other machines.</p>
<p>Many of the models we tested came with sample packs of pods to try, and one machine, the Black+Decker Brew &#8216;n Go, even came with a travel mug that fits perfectly under the spout.</p>
<h3>User Experience</h3>
<p>After coming down from the buzz of testing the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-french-press/">best French presses</a> earlier in the year, our coffee-testing team was excited to get familiar with the user experience of the single-cup machines. We lived with the coffee makers for two weeks and used them often, toggling through features, observing sounds, deciphering cleaning directions, and of course, drinking copious amounts of coffee.</p>
<p>We recorded our thoughts, feelings, and emotions throughout the whole process and reflected back on them, in conjunction with all of our data, to determine our favorite single-cup coffee makers.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0788F3R8X/?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Keurig &#8211; K-Elite</a> is a leader in the single-cup market for a reason. It’s versatile, easy to use, and allows some adjustment &#8212; plus it makes decent coffee. If you want the best pod-based single-cup coffee maker on the market, you should invest in the Elite.</p>
<p>When you brew with the K-Elite, you have the ability to choose the size of the drink, from a strong, concentrated four-ounce up to a 12-ounce travel mug. If you want to fill a 16 oz. travel mug, you&#8217;re probably best off running two pods unless you prefer coffee on the watery side. The increments allow for more control over the size and strength of your morning cup of joe than any other single-cup machine we tested.</p>
<p>This machine does take up a fair amount of counter space at 13.1″ H x 9.9″ W x 12.7″ D. It also has the shortest power cord, at about a foot. However, it has a sleek look that’s appealing on a counter.</p>
<p>While you can manipulate the strength of your coffee by adjusting the ounces of water to some extent, the Elite also has a “strong” setting. This adds about 20 seconds to the regular brew cycle, increasing the extraction time. The result is coffee that is noticeably richer. Taste varies, so we&#8217;re glad to see this option.</p>

<p>Our testers also liked that this Keurig has a water filter. If you prefer making coffee with filtered water, this is an obvious choice for you. However, even if you don’t mind the tap, the water filter is supposed to extend the life of the machine overall, as less impurities should build up within it. Installing the filter in the reservoir was not hard, but it did require reading the manual.</p>
<p>Other upgrades over the original Keurig machines include “auto-on” and hot water functions. The “auto-on” feature will heat the water at your pre-set time, leaving you just 45 seconds away from your coffee when you press the brew button on your way out the door.</p>
<p>The hot water function does not use a separate spout, so you&#8217;ll probably want to run a rinse cycle between making coffee and tea.</p>
<p>On its default setting, this machine served coffee at about 170 degrees Fahrenheit. This was on the low side of our finalists — but normal for a Keurig. Our testers did not make any remarks about the coffee temperature being too cold.</p>
<p>Also, the K-Elite was the only Keurig we tested that can be programmed to brew at different temperatures, from 187 to 192 degrees. You can change the brew temperature in the settings menu, which is a big plus if you&#8217;re at higher elevations or using specialty pods.</p>
<p>Our testers thought that this Keurig was the most complicated to use because of its many features. When setting up the machine, we were immediately asked to program the time, altitude mode and automatic turn-on time. While all of these features are useful, we had to consult the manual to figure out how to program them.</p>
<p>Overall, the K-Elite takes our top spot. When you wake up in the morning you want coffee fast — this machine delivers on that. The K-Elite is tops for convenience, which is why consumers are attracted to single-cup machines in the first place.</p>

<p>This Keurig runs at about $160, which is a relatively mid-range price for a Keurig machine. If you are buying a Keurig to make your life more convenient, we believe the K-Elite is worth the extra coin.<br />
In our testing, the Keurig 2.0 outperformed the competition in terms of speed, heat, and usability. The one-minute, 47-second heat cycle was the fastest of the K-Cup-based systems we tested, and the 41-second brew time was just two seconds slower than the fastest K-Cup machine, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014W1C2VM?th=1?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart SS-700 Single Serve Brewing System</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The K-Elite was our fastest-brewing Keurig machine.</li>
<li>This machine’s 75-ounce water reservoir means you won’t be constantly refilling this machine.</li>
<li>The included water filter is a plus for those who prefer filtered water; the machine may also have a longer life for this reason.</li>
<li>This machine’s short power cord and large size limit its movability in the kitchen.</li>
<li>Some coffee drinkers dislike the watered-down nature of Keurig&#8217;s standard recipe, but this model gives you options.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005MF9C?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Black+Decker &#8211; Brew &#8216;n Go</a> may lack the bells and whistles of some of the other machines, but that’s part of its appeal. The Brew n’ Go is essentially a mini version of a traditional drip coffee maker that dispenses coffee into a 15-ounce stainless steel travel mug, which is included in the box.</p>
<p>It has one button and one setting: Brew. The Brew n’ Go will use all the water poured into the machine, so it’s recommended to use the included mug, or the same mug you plan to use for coffee, to fill the tank.</p>
<p><strong>Unlike the other single-cup coffee makers, it does not shut off after a specific number of ounces, and it will overflow your mug if you pour in too much water.</strong></p>
<p>This can be a positive or negative depending on your personal coffee brewing preferences.</p>

<p>The permanent mesh filter system eliminates the need for paper filters, and it cleans easily with just a rinse. You can either use coffee ground for drip machine use or grind the beans yourself at home. You have total control over strength and taste because you select the amount of coffee, the type of coffee, and the amount of water.</p>

<p><strong>We found that the Brew n’ Go made coffee significantly hotter than the other single-cup coffee makers we tested.</strong> At 182 degrees, coffee made with the Brew n’ Go is five degrees hotter than the newer Keurig model and more than 10 degrees hotter than every other machine we tested.</p>
<p>The coffee that comes from a Brew n’ Go will stay warmer longer, so you can slowly enjoy it longer than coffee from the other machines we tested.</p>
<p>The compact design allows the Black+Decker Brew &#8216;n Go to fit on any small counter, in a cabinet, or even on your desk at work. It’s about a quarter of the size of the Keurig machines we tested.</p>
<p>Finally, at about $18, it is substantially more affordable than the other top seven single-cup coffee makers. And, that price includes the stainless steel mug that fits the machine perfectly. If what you want is a single cup of no nonsense, reliably hot drip coffee, the Black+Decker Brew &#8216;n Go is an excellent choice.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A permanent mesh filter and included stainless steel travel mug make the Black+Decker Brew &#8216;n Go a truly complete system. Just add coffee.</li>
<li>One setting means the control is in your hands, not the machine. Choose your favorite blend, grind the beans your way, and add just the right amount of coffee and water for you.</li>
<li>It serves hotter coffee at a more affordable price than any other machine we tested.</li>
<li>The Brew n’ Go has a sharp, compact design that will fit just about anywhere.</li>

<p><strong>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MFC73AZ?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nespresso &#8211; Citiz Espresso Maker</a> is a beautiful machine that makes espresso-style coffee in servings of 1.35 or 3.7 ounces.</strong> These highly concentrated coffees can be enjoyed on their own or can be used to make lattes, Americanos, cappuccinos, or iced drinks.</p>
<p>Like the K-Cup brewers, the machine is very easy to operate. Pop in a pod, press the size option you want, and the coffee pours directly into your mug. The Citiz is even designed with a small tray that folds out so a smaller espresso cup, or demitasse, can sit just below the spout.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8397" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Maker_Nespresso-Pod-animated-1.gif" alt="" width="900" height="600" /></p>
<p><strong>The end product is not just strong; it’s finished with a light tan, frothy top layer called crema.</strong> This delicate foam has a lot going on. As we sifted through information on chemistry, fats, oils, proteins, roasting temperatures, and optimal extraction pressures that influence the appearance of crema, our heads spun a bit.</p>
<p>In our testing, however, we found that the mouth-feel of the espresso is satisfying and the taste is what you&#8217;d expect from a $5 espresso at a coffee shop.</p>
<p>The Nespresso company markets about 30 pod varieties with exotic names based in Italian and Turkish. Independent companies market additional options as well as reusable pods that can be filled with your own ground coffee at home.</p>
<p>The pods, or capsules, as Nespresso calls them, are primarily made of aluminum which can be recycled. Because the used grounds must be separated from the aluminum, it’s pretty difficult to do at home. However, Nespresso will send you a free recycle bag that you can fill with up to 200 capsules and then drop off at any UPS location to shipped backed to Nespresso free of charge.</p>

<p><strong>In our testing, the Nespresso machine was the fastest to produce a finished product from turning the machine on to taking the first sip of coffee.</strong> While the espresso was just outside the top three in terms of temperature, at 171 degrees, it didn’t seem to be a deal-breaker because the small shots are meant to be enjoyed quickly or mixed with another hot beverage like steamed milk.</p>
<p>The machine itself is expensive, priced at just under $200 when we published this article, and the pods are more expensive per cup than using a traditional brewing method. That being said, it is a high-class machine that looks and feels top-of-the-line while consistently producing a product that would otherwise be very difficult to accomplish at home without a full-blown espresso machine.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Nespresso Citiz makes espresso complete with a light, foamy layer of crema on top.</li>
<li>Coffee varieties from Nespresso and other producers, along with the ability to use your own espresso blend, have greatly increased options since the machine was first introduced.</li>
<li>It is a high-end product with an high price tag that we feel is justified and well worth it for serious coffee connoisseurs.</li>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4058 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_MrCoffee.jpg" alt="Mr. Coffee" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_MrCoffee.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_MrCoffee-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_MrCoffee-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_MrCoffee-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_MrCoffee-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_MrCoffee-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_MrCoffee-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_MrCoffee-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_MrCoffee-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Instead of a lever that opens to reveal the K-Cup compartment, the Mr. Coffee pod compartment slides out completely and you pop the pod into the chamber before sliding it back in. A bit of care needs to be taken because this exposes the small sharp needles that pierce the pods during brewing.</p>
<p>The Mr. Coffee has one setting for brewing, and it lacks any different size settings. While the Mr. Coffee machine doesn’t have extra features, the straight-forward operation and entry-level pricing make it worthy of consideration.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EI7DPS0?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; Single Serve Scoop Coffee Maker</a> functions in much the same way as the Black+Decker Brew &#8216;n Go but with a higher quality design and the addition of a strong setting. Made of stainless steel, the Hamilton Beach looks sharp and durable. The mesh scoop filter, also made of steel, can be used to spoon coffee out of the bag and then directly into the machine for brewing.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4059 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_HamiltonBeach.jpg" alt="hamilton beach coffee maker" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_HamiltonBeach.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_HamiltonBeach-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_HamiltonBeach-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_HamiltonBeach-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_HamiltonBeach-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_HamiltonBeach-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_HamiltonBeach-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_HamiltonBeach-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_HamiltonBeach-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>As mentioned with the K-Elite’s strong setting, a single cup of coffee can be made stronger by slowing down the extraction process. Much like allowing a tea bag to steep a bit longer, more flavor is released from coffee that is exposed to hot water for a longer period of time. The Hamilton Beach has a “bold” setting that functions in this manner and produces a cup that does indeed taste stronger.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of speed, the Hamilton Beach excels.</strong> It brews a full cup of coffee quicker than any other machine, when combined with the heating cycle, and it’s just one second slower than the Nespresso, which brews a cup half the size. However, at 167 degrees, the end product is substantially cooler than the coffee from other single-cup coffee makers we tested.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart &#8211; SS-700 Single Serve Brewing System was made by the popular kitchen appliance company to rival the newer Keurig machines. In our testing, it closely mirrored the Keurig &#8211; K-Elite in performance. The Cuisinart was one second slower in the heating cycle, but two seconds quicker to brew. It was also just one degree cooler than the K-Elite. Since our testing, this model has been replaced by the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014W1C2VM?th=1?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SS-10</a> model, and we&#8217;ve updated links throughout our review to the new one.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4060 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Cuisinart.jpg" alt="cuisinart coffee maker" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Cuisinart.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Cuisinart-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Cuisinart-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Cuisinart-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Cuisinart-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Cuisinart-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Cuisinart-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Cuisinart-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Coffee-Makers_Cuisinart-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The Cuisinart includes many of the same features we fell in love with in the big Keurig machine: a water filtration system, push-button for hot water, and the “auto-on” capability. The Cuisinart will brew licensed K-Cups as well as alternative pods, and it is compatible with the My K-Cup system that lets you use your own ground coffee.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart advertises five temperature settings, but when we used our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-digital-meat-thermometer/">known-accurate digital thermometer</a> to check the coffee set at 168 and 172, (the lowest and highest setting, respectively) we found just half a degree of difference.</p>
<p>We were also less impressed with the LED screen, blue backed instead of full color, and the maximum brew size of just 10 ounces. The old Keurig 2.0 system had half a dozen settings between 4 and 30 ounces. These shortcomings, combined with the lofty price tag of $220 held the Cuisinart back in the larger competition.</p>
<p>Another machine that failed to impress is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018UQ5AMS?th=1?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Keurig &#8211; K-Classic Coffee Maker</a>. One of the longest-lived Keurig models, the Classic does a fine job of brewing K-Cup coffee into one of three different sizes. But that’s all it does.</p>
<p>Knowing that so much more is now possible with the Keurig brand in terms of size options, functions, and design, it’s hard to justify investing in the older model when the newer models are available for about $50 more.</p>

<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The single-cup coffee maker is a great machine for quickly and conveniently making one cup of coffee, right when you want it. A lot has been written about the environmental impact of single-use pods that have been popularized by the Keurig system. It is also clear that K-Cup coffee is significantly more expensive than traditionally brewed drip coffee.</p>
<p>We understand both of these concerns, but for the purposes of this review, we sought to declare the best single-use coffee maker on the market today. <strong>After two weeks, many cups of coffee, and more than a few jitters, we can declare that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0788F3R8X?tag=ybdsccm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Keurig K-Elite Series Coffee Maker</a> is the best single-cup coffee maker.</strong></p>
<p>The Keurig K-Elite accommodates more brewing sizes and completes the brewing process quicker than all the other machines we tested. The next generation features like its charcoal-based water filtration, “auto-on” programmability, and on-demand hot water make the machine incredibly versatile and easy to use.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to stay away from pod-based systems, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005MF9C/?tag=ybdkeu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker Brew &#8216;n Go</a>. The Brew n’ Go is essentially a smaller version of a traditional drip coffee maker with a reusable mesh filter and a travel mug that fits the machine perfectly. It has one button, it does one thing, and it does it very well. Coffee made with the Black+Decker was consistently hotter than any other machine we tested.</p>
<p>At the opposite end of the spectrum is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MFC73AZ/?tag=ybdkeu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nespresso &#8211; Citiz, our favorite high-end machine</a>. The Nespresso Citiz makes espresso that is reliably strong and delicious. It looks sleek and modern, and we felt a little spoiled to have it simply sitting on the counter. The Nespresso pods are even recyclable, and while that does require a bit of an effort, we are grateful for it.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s obvious at this point that the Keurig is for you, we might also suggest checking out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-keurig/">review of the best Keurigs</a> to see how their other offerings (including all-in-one latte machines) fare against the Elite.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[In testing the best anti-fatigue mats for kitchen and office, we stood. And we stood some more. The result is our recommendation of the best possible mat for you.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ver the course of several weeks, we tested six of our top pick anti-fatigue mats to find the ones that provided the best support when standing. After extensive research and testing at a standing desk as well as in the kitchen, we found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005UA2WO2/?tag=ybdfmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Imprint &#8211; CumulusPRO Commercial Grade Mat</a> to be the best anti-fatigue mat. Of our six finalists, this mat proved the most durable and was the only one marketed as a commercial-grade product. Great for standing in the kitchen or at a desk, the Imprint mat has a premium feel and quality that none of our other finalists could match.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs-this">Who needs an anti-fatigue mat?</h2>
<p>Since an increasing number of studies about ‘sitting disease’ are being published, there’s been a rise in popularity of standing desks — one of the main reasons (aside from kitchen use) that people buy a standing mat.</p>
<p>Anyone who stands for prolonged periods of time in the same place can benefit from an anti-fatigue mat. Prolonged standing is tiring, and standing on bare floors puts pressure on your feet, legs, hips and back, causing both muscle and joint fatigue. An anti-fatigue mat can help relieve these issues, and those who are looking for further relief at the end of a work day can check out a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/foot-massagers/" rel="noopener">foot massager</a> too. People stand the most in the kitchen or at standing desks but also in laundry rooms, the garage or the bathroom as well.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, these mats help a lot at the sink or the stove.  They reduce pressure on your feet and body and also catch water and soap that splash while you&#8217;re doing dishes, thus improving traction and reducing the chance of slipping. Kitchen mats also catch oil and food splatters when used near the stove. People who have added wood floors to their kitchens will appreciate the extra safety as well as prolonging the life of floors in those areas.</p>
<p>Some people will stand at a standing desk for most of a work day, which can be taxing on the body, and a mat will reduce muscle fatigue and stress.</p>
<p>Both sitting or standing for prolonged periods of time is generally not recommended, so it’s suggested that we switch off or incorporate activity in between stretches of sitting and standing. Studies suggest that trying to balance out prolonged periods of inactivity with an hour of gym time doesn’t cancel out the day’s sedentary behavior, even though <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3404815/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it does suppress it</a>.</p>
<p>Of course we don&#8217;t want to be standing around all day long. If you&#8217;re looking to relax inside your home check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-bean-bag-chair/">bean bag chair review</a>. Entertaining friends outdoors, or just want to catch some rays? Look into a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-zero-gravity-chair/">zero gravity chair</a> for your back yard. And finally if you&#8217;re outdoors but not at home, nothing improves rough unpadded seating of bleachers or park benches like a padded and portable <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-stadium-seats/">stadium seat</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we chose mats to test</h2>
<p>We spent many hours reading through forums, review sites and retailers to discover the most loved brands and types of anti-fatigue mats.  Only one mat that we chose to test was specifically made exclusively for standing desks, while the other mats can be used in both the kitchen and at a standing desk.</p>
<p>There are dozens of brands that have mats available but only a handful of established companies. We narrowed much of our list by leaning on Amazon’s popular products that had a four-star or higher rating and filtered out products with excessive negative reviews.</p>
<p>Some review sites we found helped us discover new brands we may have missed, but many of them have not actually tested the mats and just publish stock images and review specs of the products.</p>

[table id=14 /]
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested the finalists</h2>
<h3>Standing test</h3>
<p>Over the course of several weeks, we used these mats in a normal home setting and rotated where they were used. Three were in use at any given moment: one at a standing desk (where we stand for half of the workday), one at the kitchen sink and one in front of the stove.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V3TO9EK/?tag=ybdfmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Topo mat</a> was not used in the kitchen since its bumpy design is strictly made with standing desks in mind — you’d easily trip on this mat in your kitchen.</p>
<p>We considered doing a timed standing test on these mats, but after a short while we realized it made more sense to have this measured more informally or qualitatively. It didn’t really make sense to measure this <i>quantitatively</i> because many factors could throw off the data. These include fatigue based on the order it was tested, strength/tolerance built up over the weeks of testing and accurately measuring severity and location of pain points from using each mat.</p>
<p>We tested them all with and without shoes on in case there was any noticeable difference. Wearing shoes added more cushion and masked the texture and cushion of all the mats we used. If you plan to use these standing mats in a setting with shoes, you can get away with using a lower-end or lower-priced product.</p>
<h3>Durability test</h3>
<p>All of the anti-fatigue mats we tested were pretty durable and showed no signs of wear other than dust and dirt. We expect all of these models to last for many years before needing to be replaced.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3295" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/mat-durability-testing.jpg" alt="anti-fatigue mat durability testing" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/mat-durability-testing.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/mat-durability-testing-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/mat-durability-testing-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/mat-durability-testing-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/mat-durability-testing-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/mat-durability-testing-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/mat-durability-testing-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/mat-durability-testing-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/mat-durability-testing-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>As the second stage of durability testing, we sliced into each of these mats with a box-cutting blade to see how it would withstand the accidental drop of sharp objects. All mats were sliced through with some effort and with more force than would be exerted by dropping anything on the mats with normal use. The Sky Mat, Gorilla Grip and Royal anti-fatigue mats were pretty durable and sit in the mid-range of this test. On the low end, the top coat of the Cumulus9 was easily pierced. The two anti-fatigue mats that fared best were the Topo standing desk mat and the CumulusPRO. The CumulusPRO required extra effort and dragging to cut into the material.</p>
<h3>Traction test</h3>
<p>We measured how slippery the mats were when soaked and how much they shifted on the floor over time. First we tested how slippery the dry mat was, then we sprayed a few mists of water on the mat, and finally we sprayed enough for it to be completely soaked to see how much traction was lost. Lastly, we tested how much the mats themselves shifted under our feet during use, making you reposition mats over time. Both tests were done barefoot, since shoes add their own grip and affect the test in other ways.</p>
<p>Surprisingly the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003BYRDLG/?tag=ybdfmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cumulus9</a>, with its slightly odd-feeling mat, performed the best in the spray test. When soaked, the CumulusPRO was ranked second best, also maintaining its unique grip feel and making us feel confident to use this in slippery situations. Tied for third place were the Sky, Royal and Topo mats. It definitely was better than standing on a wet tile floor and helped with traction but you can still slip if you&#8217;re not careful. The worst performer in this test was the Gorilla Grip mat, providing the least traction when soaked.</p>
<p>We shifted our weight, twisted and turned our body, and purposely tried to move the mat. The Topo, Gorilla Grip, and Royal mats moved enough when we forced them; however, the Topo didn&#8217;t shift around much during actual use despite its more slippery bottom. The Sky mat, CumulusPRO and Cumulus9 shifted the least during this test, which means you won&#8217;t have to reposition them as often.</p>
<h3>Cleaning test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3963 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cleaning-test.jpg" alt="cleaning test" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cleaning-test.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cleaning-test-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cleaning-test-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cleaning-test-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cleaning-test-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cleaning-test-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cleaning-test-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cleaning-test-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cleaning-test-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Only some of these mats advertise that they&#8217;re easy to clean, but they all have  similar material on the top coating so we wanted to test for ourselves.</p>
<p>Each mat was subjected to three food items to simulate real-world stains: flour, oil and honey. We chose flour to test a dry substance commonly used in the kitchen and one we could test with a vacuum.</p>
<p>Next was oil. If you’re cooking in the kitchen or eating lunch at your standing desk, oil splatters or dropping oily food onto the mat is bound to happen.</p>
<p>Finally, we wanted to test honey. We thought this would simulate any sweet or sugary spills from drinking beverages, cooking, or stuff you can track inside with your shoes.</p>
<p>The difficulty of cleaning oil was fairly consistent across all the mats. We could vacuum flour from all the mats easily and even wipe off the honey easily. Oil proved to be the difficult one to properly remove, requiring multiple cleanings no matter which mat it was.</p>

<p>At a quick glance, the CumulusPRO Commercial Grade mat looks deceivingly like the other mats, but the experience on this mat is on another level.</p>
<p>It’s also important to know that the manufacturer, Imprint, also has a non-commercial version of this mat called the “CumulusPRO Professional,” which we did not test. This anti-fatigue mat is the only one we tested that’s sold as a “commercial” product. And for what it’s worth, all products from the Imprint brand are tested and certified by the National Floor Safety Institute and a partner of the American Chiropractic Association. This particular product comes at an extra cost, but the differences were easily spotted during testing.</p>

This commercial-grade mat is denser and firmer. It remains securely in place, and its beveled edges help prevent tripping.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003BYRDLG/?tag=ybdfmat-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If you use this standing mat indoors and barefoot, you’ll immediately notice the difference in texture on this one. The CumulusPRO features a one-piece construction of polyurethane — with a texture similar that’s grippier, more like silicone or rubber than any of the other mats. The CumulusPRO Commercial mat simply feels more premium than any that we tested.</p>
<p>Like most (not all) of the other mats, its edges are beveled to help reduce chances of users tripping over the mat when walking by. And it was one of the few mats that didn’t shift beneath our feet during testing — saving you the trouble of having to reposition every so often.</p>
<p>This mat is ¾-inch thick, the same as most other mats available on the market. But likely due to its commercial-grade rating for more foot traffic, the material is firmer and less springy than other mats. Much like when choosing a bike seat meant for longer-term comfort, we actually preferred this denser option.</p>
<p>The 24-inch width on this standing mat may be a little wider than most, which may be something to consider if you’re using it in a small kitchen or office. However, it works and looks great in both settings in our testing. The CumulusPRO is well made and, in our opinion, well worth the cost. Having four or five of these throughout the house would be great.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-standing-desk-mat">Best standing desk mat: Ergodriven &#8211; Topo</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3965 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/topo-ergodriven-mat.jpg" alt="Topo Ergodriven mat" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/topo-ergodriven-mat.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/topo-ergodriven-mat-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/topo-ergodriven-mat-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/topo-ergodriven-mat-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/topo-ergodriven-mat-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/topo-ergodriven-mat-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/topo-ergodriven-mat-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/topo-ergodriven-mat-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/topo-ergodriven-mat-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Being a different style of mat altogether, and completely designed with the standing desk in mind, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V3TO9EK/?tag=ybdfmat-20"> Ergodriven &#8211; Topo</a> was our top choice for standing desk mats.</p>
<p>The marketing on this product touts that the bumps, divots and raised edges encourage movement. While we thought it sounded like a gimmick, we actually found it to be true during our testing. It works because putting your foot on any of these features becomes slightly uncomfortable from extra pressure over time. So we shifted, looking for new, more comfortable stances.</p>
<p>The teardrop shape in the middle can act as sort of a nice massage ball, and the extra raised back is useful for calf stretches while you’re standing too.</p>

Its bumps and divots encourage shifting your feet so that you don't stand in the same position for too long.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V3TO9EK/?tag=ybdfmat-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Since we’re not supposed to stand or sit without breaks for the entire day, we wouldn’t say the shifting is meant to replace regular breaks from your standing desk. However, the bumps really did make us shift around when we may not have consciously thought of doing. While wearing shoes, the terrain was a little less muted, but it still made us shift around more than other mats did.</p>
<p>Designed to make it easy to slide, this 100-percent polyurethane mat is the only one we tested that has the same material on the bottom and top, which makes the mat somewhat slick, durable and waterproof. The other mats have more of a grippy bottom to help stay in place, but the Topo’s design was made so you can reposition or put the mat away with just one foot. This is a convenient feature, and despite the slick bottom, this mat didn’t shift all that much while in use.</p>
<p>Let’s not skirt around the price of the Topo though. Yes, it’s durable and comes with a seven-year warranty, but it is priced much higher than most standing desk mats. Given its unique design and benefits, you won’t get from other mats, it’s a bit difficult to directly compare. But if you spend even half your workday at a standing desk, the extra cost will quickly become worth it.</p>
<h2 id="other-anti-fatigue-mats">Other mats we tested</h2>

<p>We liked the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003BYRDLG/?tag=ybdfmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Imprint &#8211; Cumulus9</a></strong> the least, and surprisingly it was not the lowest price mat we tested. This mat measured a standard 20-inch width and was 36-inches long, an average-sized mat overall.</p>
<p>The Cumulus9 was the only mat that left actual imprints of our feet in the mat throughout use. The foam is moderately firm, but as we shifted position, feet imprints compounded and gave the mat a cratered appearance. More importantly, it took a while before the mat recovered and provided support again.</p>
<p>Overall the Cumulus9 mat felt the cheapest made and had a top cover that could easily be cut in our durability test. We can&#8217;t overlook the fact that it performed the best when soaked with water, so if you can withstand its downsides, this mat could be a good fit.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M8O122G/?tag=ybdfmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sky Solutions</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U8L1JUG/?tag=ybdfmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Royal</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B868D1M/?tag=ybdfmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gorilla Grip</a> mat are very similar in many ways. They’re all ¾-inch thick, 20 inches wide, and two are 32 inches long, except the Sky Solutions is 39 inches long. All of these mats come in a longer variety, so this length did not factor into our review. They all have a slightly grippy foam bottom, and a top coating that feels a little slick and tougher to withstand wear. They all performed relatively well in durability and cleaning tests too.</p>
<p>All three of these mats also have a bevel around the edge to provide a transition from floor to raised surface, which helps prevent tripping and better integrates the mat into the environment. The Royal and Gorilla Grip actually shifted more underneath our feet in traction tests, so if you want one that stays put, this seems to be the only edge the Sky Solutions mat has over the others.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V3TO9EK/?tag=ybdfmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ergodriven &#8211; Topo</a> has a unique design for standing-desk mats that sets it above the rest. It easily stores away and sets up by using just one foot, since the bottom is made to be a bit slick, but doesn’t shift while you stand on it.</p>
<p>Based on our testing, the quality of the materials and build appeared to be great. This mat is easy to wipe down and clean. The raised terrain is the stand-out factor here though, subconsciously reminding us to keep moving since staying still in any position is not good for our health.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a mat for a standing desk or the kitchen, our other top pick is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005UA2WO2/?tag=ybdfmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Imprint &#8211; CumulusPRO Commercial Grade</a> mat. It has a unique, grippier feel none of the others had, which you’ll really appreciate if you&#8217;re standing without shoes. It also has a slightly denser foam core, which will probably handle more traffic and outlast others. We’d be happy to have this mat in many places throughout the home.</p>
<p>If you want a cost-effective, no-frills solution, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M8O122G/?tag=ybdfmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sky Solutions</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U8L1JUG/?tag=ybdfmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Royal</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B868D1M/?tag=ybdfmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gorilla Grip</a> would perform fine in the office or kitchen. Given their price point, it may be easier to outfit the entire house with a less costly solution such as these.</p>
