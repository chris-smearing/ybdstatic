The Char-Broil gave us perfectly seared and evenly cooked steaks and juicy burgers and chicken. But if you want to upgrade, then the Weber’s superb build quality and impressive ignition and grease-management technology are worth the increased cost.</p>

<h2 id="compare">Compare the best gas grills</h2>
[table id=290 /]
<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected gas grills to test</h2>
<p>Many manufacturers of gas grills frequently update or improve their models, so we looked for gas grills that would not likely be replaced in a couple of years. Although these upgrades are often minor, we focused on grills that manufacturers had released in 2018-2019.</p>
<p>If you have a couple thousand in expendable cash, you could plunk it down on a high-end <a href="https://www.napoleon.com/en/us/grills" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Napoleon</a>, which has years’-long warranties. A Napoleon, however, may be out of the average consumer’s price range, so we instead we researched the moderately expensive Webers, one of the leaders in the industry.</p>
<p>Weber has several series of gas and charcoal grills — each with a lofty name, like Summit, Genesis and Master-Touch — and we chose to test the Spirit II, since its features are similar to less-expensive brands.</p>
<p>Our tester then personally checked out all of the grills sold at Home Depot and Lowe’s, and since we wanted an equitable test, we selected grills that we believed would be a fair match against the Weber. (For the record, we also considered grills sold at Target, but the selection only included older models.)</p>
<p>To be comparable with the Weber, the grills needed to have at least three burners, two side shelves, approximately the same size cook space (475 square inches) and at least 30,000 BTUs. (If you want to know more about BTUs — British Thermal Units — and their importance, check out our review of the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-portable-air-conditioner/#btucalculator">best portable air conditioner</a>.)</p>
<p>Finally, we kept to a budget of no more than $300 each for the other two finalists. Models with cabinets are more expensive, so we chose models that had carts instead. Both the Char-Broil Performance and <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Dyna-Glo-4-Burner-Open-Cart-LP-Gas-Grill-in-Black-DGF493PNP-D/302774519" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyna-Glo</a> are highly rated by consumers and are available in two to five-burner models. Oddly, Char-Broil’s price decreases with the larger models, and we chose the five-burner for a very reasonable $199 and the comparably priced four-burner Dyna-Glo.</p>
<h2 id="assemble">Assembling a gas grill</h2>
<p>First off, if there’s an offer (from whichever store you purchased the grill) for free assembly, grab it. Unless you really enjoy building things from nuts and bolts, be forewarned that assembling a gas grill requires two people and two hours of time. Lowe’s sells the Char-Broil fully assembled, so we paid the service charge for its delivery. Amazon usually charges for assembly, but for the Weber, it was free at the time we purchased it. However, since this service might not be available in your location, we decided to assemble the Weber and the Dyna-Glo ourselves to compare difficulty.</p>
<p>The Weber’s shipping weight is 116 pounds, and even with two people, it would be back-breaking to lift and carry the boxed Weber from the driveway to the backyard. So we unpacked and constructed it in the driveway. Although all of the pieces and hardware looked like we were about to put the disassembled Tin Woodsman back together, the Weber’s instructions were detailed and specific. Tools were required (not included), but everything fit perfectly into position.</p>
<p>Assembling the Dyna-Glo was a completely different experience. It weighs less than 65 pounds, because its materials are so much less substantial. The Dyna-Glo’s hood was encased in styrofoam for shipping, but it was dented in several spots. Metal splinters came off its side panels, and its framework was so flimsy, we worried it would not support the grill box. Surprisingly, it held, but the Dyna-Glo’s sturdiness didn’t compare well with the Weber’s.</p>
<h2 id="how-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Each grill had an igniter button, and following their manual’s lighting instructions, we preheated the grills to 500°F, which took between 10-15 minutes. We then cooked hamburgers, steak and chicken on each grill in the same way.</p>
<h3>Hamburgers</h3>

<p>We put four beef hamburgers on each quadrant of the cooking grate to determine whether the grill was hotter in the back, sides or front. We seared the burgers for three minutes, turned them and using a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-digital-meat-thermometer/">digital meat thermometer</a>, cooked them to medium-rare, between 140°F and 145°F. We let the burgers rest five minutes before cutting into them.</p>
<h3>Steak</h3>

<p>Next, we heated the grills back up to 500°F (there was always heat loss when the grill hoods were opened) and seared one-inch-thick New York strip steaks (seasoned only with Kosher salt and black pepper) on both sides for three minutes. We then lowered the heat and continued to cook them, turning frequently, until the digital meat thermometer hit 135°F. We took the steaks off the grill and allowed them to rest 10 minutes before cutting into them.</p>
<h3>Chicken</h3>

<p>We spatchcocked a whole chicken, cut it in half and seasoned each half with Kosher salt and black pepper. Then we turned off two or four burners, depending on how many burners each grill had, and cooked the chicken with indirect heat by putting the chicken on the unlit burners for 30 minutes. When the leg and thigh were cooked through, we transferred the chicken to the lit burner and crisped up the skin until it was golden brown.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/Char-Broil-Performance-Black-And-Stainless-5-Burner-Liquid-Propane-Gas-Grill-with-1-Side-Burner/1000523547" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Char-Broil &#8211; Performance &#8211; 463347519</a> five-burner gas grill that we tested had a couple of minor design flaws, but otherwise it grilled everything virtually the same as our upgrade pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JTCMKQ/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Weber Spirit II &#8211; E-310</a>, and actually bested the Weber in our steak competition with a better sear. At only $199, it’s a fantastic value for this well-made and sturdy grill that we believe will last you several grilling seasons.</p>
<p>Let’s get the design flaws out of the way. Its temperature gauge is located on top of the hood, so we couldn’t easily see the temperature without getting closer and looking directly down at the gauge. Second, the hood has a stainless steel handle that gets searingly hot when grabbed near the curvature close to the lid.</p>
<p>Physically, the Char-Broil has some of the same features as the Weber: porcelain-coated cast-iron cooking grates, recessed porcelain-coated flame tamers — which vaporize grease and force excess grease to drip below — and a tapered drip pan that funnels grease to a small tray underneath the fire box.</p>
<p>The Char-Broil took five minutes longer to heat up than the Weber and Dyna-Glo, but when it hit 500°F, it maintained that temperature and distributed the heat evenly throughout its 475-square-inch cooking space.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with grilling, then you know it’s vital to monitor how quickly food is cooking and, if necessary, adjust the heat or move food to the upper rack so it doesn’t burn. We didn’t need to do either with the Char-Broil. The heat stayed consistent, and there were no flare-ups or hot spots. It wasn’t quite “set-it-and-forget-it” cooking, but it was definitely stress-free.</p>

With consistent heat distribution, the Char-Broil can sear steak and burgers and also slowly cook chicken to juicy and crispy perfection.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JZ9QY4R/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The hamburger we placed in the rear of the cooking space cooked a little faster than the burger in the front, but we simply switched them, and they finished at the same time as the burgers on the sides. The indirect-heat method worked very well with the chicken, which was cooked through and juicy. The steak was a wonder: It seared beautifully, and the fat crisped to a delicious golden brown.</p>

<p>The five-burner Char-Broil also has a side burner with 10,000 BTUs, which can be used for sauteing onions or peppers or making a pan sauce for your grilled meats and vegetables. It measures 53 inches wide and 26 inches deep, so if it’s too large for your patio, the Char-Broil &#8211; Performance is also available in several sizes and styles, like a compact <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HID4Y7Q/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">two-burner with cabinet</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JZV24HV/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a stainless steel four-burner, cart-style</a> (like the model we tested), and for $400, a <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/Char-Broil-Performance-Stainless-6-Burner-Liquid-Propane-Gas-Grill-with-1-Side-Burner/1000713050" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six-burner with side burner</a> and a 15,000 BTU sear burner.</p>
<p>If you’re considering buying a Weber, but you can’t justify its high price, the Char-Broil &#8211; Performance is an excellent, more affordable option.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Char-Broil &#8211; Performance- 463347519 is a well-made and sturdy propane-gas grill with some of the same features as a comparable Weber, but it’s half the price.</li>
<li>It maintained and evenly distributed heat over its entire 475-square-inch cooking area during our tests.</li>
<li>The Char-Broil &#8211; Performance seared steak and burgers to perfection and slow-cooked chicken so it had juicy meat and crispy skin.</li>
<li>A couple of minor design flaws — a misplaced temperature gauge, for one — aren’t deal-breakers.</li>
</ul>

<p>On grill forums, diehard Weber fans state that any Weber — charcoal or gas — is the best grill money can buy. Other people, however, question why Webers are much more expensive than other grills. We were intrigued as to what made a Weber grill so special.</p>
<p>We selected the moderately expensive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JTCMKQ/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Weber Spirit II &#8211; E-310</a> to test, and its performance was excellent, but it did not surpass the Char-Broil. Weber’s build quality, however, can’t be beat, so if you can afford a Weber — and the latest models with infrared are pretty pricey — then we can easily recommend the Weber Spirit II &#8211; E-310 as our upgrade pick.</p>
<p>Free assembly was offered when we bought on Amazon, but if it’s not available where you live, or if you really want to get a sense of how well a Weber is constructed, try assembling it yourself. A Weber’s parts and materials are hefty, and even when we had it together, rolling it to the patio was like pushing a wheelbarrow of bricks. Our advice is to build it where it will live.</p>
<p>Weber aggressively markets their patented GS4 technology, consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infinity Ignition, which Weber guarantees will light every time</li>
<li>Flavorizer bars, similar to Char-Broil’s flame tamers</li>
<li>Tapered burners, which heat evenly across the entire 529-square-inch cooking space</li>
<li>Grease-management system, again similar to Char-Broil’s, in which a tapered pan forces the grease to drip into a tray with a replaceable foil inset.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Spirit also has a unique device that attaches to the propane tank and indicates the level of propane gas inside the tank. The temperature gauge is located on the front of the hood, so it’s easy to see the grill’s internal temperature (when the lid is closed) even from across the patio.</p>
<p>The Spirit heats up fast and maintains the temperature, until the hood is opened to flip or turn the food you’re grilling. Each time we lifted the hood, the grill’s internal temperature dropped 100 degrees. Once the hood was closed again, the grill rapidly reheated.</p>

But you’re paying for superb construction and high-end technology that deliver excellent cooking results. If durability, design and performance are what you expect from a grill, then the Weber Spirit II is for you.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JTCMKQ/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>There was almost no difference between the Spirit and the Char-Broil in cooking results. We did notice, however, that the Spirit was slightly hotter in the back of the grill and less hot on the left side. We accommodated this discrepancy by shifting food towards the center or far right, when we wanted to sear the steak.</p>
<p>Overall, we were impressed by the Spirit’s design and can understand why Webers have a passionate following. The Spirit — and all Weber models — are built to last in most climates, and anecdotally, its devotees claim their Webers are still going strong after ten years, which is remarkable, considering many grills collapse into rust when exposed to the elements for a year or two.</p>
<p>The Spirit II series is also available in the same price range as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JTFDG7/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">red two-burner</a>, and for $150 more, a sleek and modernistic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0098HR1FI/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">black three-burner</a> with a cabinet.</p>
<p>Weber’s new Genesis II series is nearly double the price of the Spirit II series for a three-burner grill, but its additional features include a side burner, stainless-steel grates (instead of porcelain-enameled) and Weber&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H6193C8/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iGrill 3 smart technology</a> that allows you to monitor the grill&#8217;s internal temperature with an app.</p>
<p>For its durability, design and performance, we think the Weber is worth the high price tag.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s expensive, but the Weber Spirit II &#8211; E310’s build quality and technology make this grill a clear upgrade from other starter models.</li>
<li>Weber’s advanced GS4 grill system includes an igniter that’s guaranteed to light every time, even heat distribution, grease management to prevent flare-ups and an indicator that shows the level of propane remaining in your tank.</li>
<li>The Spirit II &#8211; E310, like all Webers, is a heavy-duty grill designed to last for decades in most climates.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Dyna-Glo-4-Burner-Open-Cart-LP-Gas-Grill-in-Black-DGF493PNP-D/302774519" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyna-Glo &#8211; DGF493PNP-D</a> four-burner gas grill is only $20 less than the Char-Broil &#8211; Performance, but the difference in build quality and performance was noticeable. The Dyna-Glo is a popular grill sold by Home Depot, but in reading online reviews, it’s clear that people are buying it for a single season and hoping it will last through the winter to maybe get a second summer out of it. That’s a fair assessment; its lightweight and cheaply finished materials would soon rust if the grill was left outside in the rain and snow.</p>
<p>During our testing, we had frequent grease flare-ups, which upon inspection, were caused by the Dyna-Glo’s flame tamers: they’re too narrow and positioned directly under the cooking grate. Consequently grease drips off the cooking food onto the burners rather than the bottom of the firebox. We needed to keep a close watch that the sudden bursts of flame didn’t burn everything we were grilling.</p>
<p>The back of the grill was much hotter than the front, so we continually re-positioned the food to prevent it from overcooking. Overall, grilling on the Dyna-Glo was more hands-on and a less pleasant experience than it was with the Char-Broil and Weber. If you’re looking for an inexpensive grill, we recommend the far superior Char-Broil &#8211; Performance instead.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you’re new to grilling or you’re looking to replace the grill you have, we recommend the <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/Char-Broil-Performance-Black-And-Stainless-5-Burner-Liquid-Propane-Gas-Grill-with-1-Side-Burner/1000523547" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Char-Broil &#8211; Performance</a> series as the best gas grill for the money. We tested the five-burner, but the Char-Broil Performance is available in other sizes to suit your needs or space requirements.</p>
<p>It’s sturdily made, heats and cooks evenly and makes it easy to grill like a pro,</p>
<p>If you want to upgrade, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JTCMKQ/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Weber Spirit II &#8211; E310</a> lives up to the company’s storied reputation. Like all Weber grills — both charcoal and propane gas — the Spirit is heavy-duty and built to last. Its high-end infinity ignition system, evenly distributed heat and grease management are worth the splurge if you grill everyday.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>There are basically two types of microwave bacon cookers on the market, both of which we tested. One type has a rack onto which the bacon is draped so it’s lifted off the tray and the other type is simply a plastic tray with raised ridges. The companies that manufacturer bacon cookers all boast that their design quickly crisps up bacon in the microwave with little or no mess.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/5funoa/does_anyone_cook_bacon_in_the_microwave/?st=jgy1hz83&amp;sh=5de47f68#bottom-comments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bacon connoisseurs on Reddit</a>, however, generally dismiss microwaved bacon as lacking both the flavor and texture of traditionally cooked bacon. We combed through reviews online, but most are advertisements. Our best resource proved to be the thousands of Amazon reviews and photographs posted by consumers who documented their results (including the bacon cookers melting in their microwaves).</p>
<p>We focused on finding microwave bacon cookers that had consistently high ratings and stood out as less gimmicky than the many cookers on the market.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-cook-bacon">How to cook bacon</h2>
<p>Cooking bacon perfectly crisp in a skillet isn’t as easy and is more time-consuming than you may think. A cast-iron skillet is generally considered to be the best type of pan for any frying. Although the cast-iron skillet has superb heat distribution, you still need to regulate the heat at a low temperature for frying bacon. The low-and-slow method allows the bacon’s fat to render and crisp and the bacon meat to cook evenly and not turn rubbery.</p>
<p>There are, of course, many ridged pans, square pans and grill pans for cooking bacon, but we prefer oven-cooked bacon. Once you’ve laid out the bacon (you can cook up to a pound) in a foil-lined baking sheet and pop it into the oven, it’s virtually stress-free and hands-off for the next 15 to 20 minutes. The bacon comes out crispy and chewy — cleanup is a cinch. And while you might consider using a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-toaster-oven/">toaster oven</a>, cooking bacon in a microwave is a faster alternative.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-microwave-bacon">How to microwave bacon</h2>
<p>You could simply microwave bacon on a microwave-safe plate sandwiched between paper towels. We tried out this method before testing the microwave bacon cookers and it gave us rubbery bacon with bits of paper towel stuck to it.</p>
<p>Depending on the microwave cooker, you can cook between four (the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0049WV8S8/?tag=ybdbac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Joie Piggy</a>) and 12 slices of bacon (the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002HSFB2/?tag=ybdbac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Makin’ Bacon</a>) at a time. Substantial shrinkage occurs during the cooking, so you can lay as many slices on the tray as it can hold without crowding them. Also, avoid overlapping the slices as this will cause uneven cooking.</p>
<h3>Cooking time</h3>
<p>The majority of microwave ovens have a range of 600 watts to 1200 watts and the microwaves with higher wattage will cook food more quickly and evenly. Most of the bacon cooker instructions are based on your using a 1000-watt microwave oven.</p>
<p>All of the microwave bacon cookers we tested advise cooking the bacon for one minute per slice. However, because of the variance in wattage of microwaves, there’s really no hard rule to follow. For lower-wattage microwaves, you need to add approximately 10 to 15 seconds per slice; conversely, for higher-wattage microwaves, you need to subtract 10 to 15 seconds per slice.</p>
<p>Turkey bacon is literally and figuratively another animal altogether. Turkey bacon is chopped turkey with oil added that’s been compressed into bacon-like strips. It doesn’t have the high-fat content of pork bacon and needs approximately half the time to cook.</p>
<h3>How to get crispy microwaved bacon</h3>

<p>You can get crispy microwaved bacon, but it’s a bit by trial and error. All of the cookers (or trays) we tested are supposed to produce crispy bacon. Our results were decidedly mixed and more often than not we ended up with crisped fat and bacon-meat jerky that would put the strongest teeth to the test.</p>
<p>We recommend initially undercooking the bacon; for example, program three minutes for four slices of bacon. After that, turn the bacon over, then reprogram the microwave at 30-second increments, continually checking the bacon until it’s as crispy as you like. Also remember that if the fatty sections of the bacon are golden brown, the bacon will crisp up as it cools.</p>
<h3>Should you use paper towels?</h3>
<p>If the microwave bacon cooker has a lid (like the Joie Piggy), then it’s not necessary to cover the bacon with a paper towel. Otherwise, we recommend covering the bacon with a paper towel to absorb the significant grease splatter. It’s not necessary to line the cooker with a paper towel since all of the cookers we tested are designed to capture and drain rendered bacon fat.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>During our testing, we learned that there are several important features about the design of a microwave bacon cooker that you should consider.</p>
<p><b>Dimensions: </b>Before purchasing a microwave bacon cooker, measure the inner dimensions of your microwave to ensure that the cooker you buy can actually fit. The rack-style bacon cookers are compact enough to fit any size microwave. The tray-style, however, can be either square or rectangle and depending on its length, it might not turn properly on your microwave’s turntable.</p>
<p><b>BPA-free plastic: </b>Since the bacon comes in contact directly with the cooker, make sure that it is made of BPA-free plastic.</p>
<p><b>Gutter design: </b>Since the purpose of the bacon cooker is to drain off as much fat as possible, look for a design that keeps the bacon elevated enough so it doesn’t sit in the captured fat. We found that the rack-style bacon cookers were the most efficient. However, the unique design of the OXO Good Grips, with its kickstand that raises the tray so the fat drains into the gutter, is also excellent.</p>
<p><b>Ease of storage: </b>The rack-style bacon cookers are the easiest for storage. The racks can be removed, laid in the tray and stored compactly in a cabinet.</p>
<p><b>Build quality: </b>Microwaving any plastic item has a long-range effect on its stability, so look for a bacon cooker that is made of a sturdier plastic.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We used Costco’s Kirkland Signature Bacon for our tests and its slices can be wider than other kinds of bacon. The number of slices that we tested at one time was dependent on the size and shape of the bacon cooker.</p>
<p>For the ridged-tray-style bacon cookers — the OXO, Joie Piggy and Nordic Ware — we had to lay out the bacon horizontally across the ridges, so the bacon stays elevated. Consequently, the ridged-tray cookers could hold only four or five slices at one time.</p>
<p>We were able to fit up to 12 slices on the rack-style bacon cookers — the Presto &#8211; Power Crisp, Emson &#8211; Bacon Wave and Makin’ Bacon — but due to the bacon width, we avoided overcrowding by testing nine slices at a time.</p>

<p>We followed the instructions for each bacon cooker and programmed the microwave for the recommended cooking times. In each case, the recommended time was too long, since we used a 1700-watt microwave. As a second attempt, we decreased the power level and cooking time for subsequent tests to determine whether a lower power and time combination would affect results.</p>
<p>For our third round of tests, we cooked only three slices to see if the bacon cooked differently than when the cooker was loaded to capacity.</p>
<p>We also wanted to test how well turkey bacon cooked on each cooker, and since there’s less fat in turkey bacon, we cut the cook time in half. We got excellent results from the Presto and the OXO.</p>
<p>Finally, we tested whether or not each bacon cooker was dishwasher safe by washing them in the upper rack of the dishwasher.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016N3PGQK/?tag=ybdbac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Presto &#8211; Power Crisp</a> is a microwave bacon cooker that has three sturdy plastic racks over which the bacon is draped. As the bacon cooks, the fat drips into a tray underneath the racks. The bacon cooks into a V-shape, which easily slides off the rack. Although the bacon isn’t straight like traditionally fried bacon, it was evenly cooked with a nice crunch.</p>
<p>The Presto &#8211; Power Crisp can hold up to 12 slices of bacon, depending on the width of the bacon. The instruction manual recommended 40 to 90 seconds per slice and we programmed the microwave for five minutes to avoid over-cooking. The bacon was only half-done after that time, so we cooked it for three-and-a-half minutes more. The fat was beautifully rendered and crispy, and the meat was chewy without being rubbery.</p>

<p>For our next test, we cooked three slices for three minutes. We prefer our bacon extra crispy, so we added 30 seconds more and again, it was perfect. As recommended by the manufacturer, we covered the bacon with a paper towel and it absorbed all grease splatter without the paper towel sticking to the bacon.</p>
<p>The tray into which the racks are inserted is made of heavy-duty black plastic that remarkably stayed cool to the touch. The grease poured easily out of the tray without dripping and the entire cooker is dishwasher safe.</p>
<p>Of the rack-style microwave bacon cookers we tested, the Presto &#8211; Power Crisp is one of the least expensive and its superior design and construction gave us the best results.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Presto &#8211; Power Crisp’s design allows more bacon fat to drip off the bacon into a cool-to-the-touch tray underneath.</li>
<li>The three stand-up racks cook the bacon into an unconventional V-shape but also produced the crispiest bacon of all the cookers we tested.</li>
<li>The racks can be stored in the tray, so this cooker easily fits in a kitchen drawer.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06W2MHM7W/?tag=ybdbac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; Bacon Crisper</a> is double the price of most of the bacon cookers we tested, but it has two unique design elements that we think are worth it. It’s a tray-style bacon cooker with a deep gutter for catching rendered bacon fat. A ridged removable silicone insert fits into the hard plastic tray, which prevents grease from leaking into the tray and is incredibly easy to clean.</p>
<p>The second feature we love is that the tray has a kickstand, which raises the tray to an approximately 45-degree angle. As the bacon cooks, the rendered fat drains and runs off into the gutter.</p>

<p>During our tests, the raised tray had positive and slightly negative effects on the bacon. On the positive side, most of the bacon fat drained away, leaving the bacon very crispy. On the other hand, so much fat had been rendered that the bacon meat of a couple slices was chewier than the other slices.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the OXO is a bit expensive for a microwave bacon cooker, but overall it consistently gave us evenly cooked bacon that nearly matched our top pick.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The OXO Good Grips &#8211; Bacon Crisper’s elevated tray and silicone insert drains virtually all the rendered bacon fat.</li>
<li>It consistently makes crispy and evenly cooked bacon.</li>
<li>It’s more expensive than most other cookers, but the unique design elements are worth it.</li>

<h3>MSC International &#8211; Joie Piggy Microwave Tray</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0049WV8S8/?tag=ybdbac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Joie Piggy</a> — also called the Joie Oink Oink — is a 9-inch by 8-inch curved rectangle tray with slightly raised serpentine ridges. It comes with a vented pink cover with an impossibly cute pig-head handle. Its small size only fits four bacon slices at a time.</p>
<p>It performed well in our tests; the bacon was crunchy and chewy. The tray’s tiny handles, however, made it difficult to remove the hot tray from the microwave. When we lifted the lid, we found that there had been substantial grease splatter since the tray lacks a drainage receptacle. Consequently, we had to dab the collected grease off the top of the bacon with a paper towel.</p>
<p>The Joie Piggy is dishwasher safe, which is fortunate since the excess splatter thickly coated the inside of the lid.</p>
<h3>Emson &#8211; Bacon Wave</h3>
<p>This best-selling “As Seen On TV” product is an interesting concept. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0016P1AFM/?tag=ybdbac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bacon Wave</a> is a molded BPA-free tray with three grooved rows, into which the bacon is inserted horizontally. The bacon is then held into place with two plastic skewers inserted through at both ends. The skewer needs to be inserted high enough through each slice to elevate it above the tray.</p>
<p>The packaging claims that the Bacon Wave can cook up to 14 slices, which seems possible, but it’s also ridiculously time-consuming to weave the skewers precisely to hold the bacon upright. As the bacon cooked, shrinkage pulled the slices tightly together and the fat dripped into the tray as intended. However, there was also a lot of grease was absorbed by the paper towel on top.</p>
<p>In our three tests of the Bacon Wave, the fat was well-rendered, but the bacon did not crisp and had the consistency of jerky.</p>
<h3>Cameron Products &#8211; Makin’ Bacon</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002HSFB2/?tag=ybdbac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Makin’ Bacon</a> is a small plastic griddle pan that resembles a toy. (It was, after all, created by an eight-year-old girl.) Three t-bars are inserted into three holes and the bacon is draped over them. The website claims that 16 pieces can be cooked at one time, which is certainly an exaggeration.</p>
<p>The vague instructions claim that six slices can fit on one spindly t-bar. However, the most we could fit was 12 pieces crowded together. Since they kept sliding off, we reduced the number to three per bar, but the ends flopped at the bottom of the tray.</p>
<p>We cooked the bacon per the instructions — six minutes for nine slices — but half were crisp and half were rubbery. Also during the cooking, a couple of the slices had curled and slipped off the t-bar and were lying in the accumulated fat. We continued to cook the bacon in 30-second increments until done. We did get bacon that was crispy in spots, but mostly it was very chewy.</p>
<p>The frying-pan design makes it simple to pour out the accumulated grease and all parts are dishwasher safe.</p>
<p>Although our winner has a similar design, we did not get the same results. The Makin’ Bacon comes apart easily for convenient storage, but it seems cheaply made and a bit on the pricey side for what it is.</p>
<h3>Nordic Ware &#8211; 60150 (Not Recommended)</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00080QJXE/?tag=ybdbac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nordic Ware &#8211; 60150</a> is a tray-style bacon cooker onto which bacon slices are laid across the ridges. Differing from the other ridged-tray cookers we tested, the ridges are in a V-shape, which is supposed to allow the rendered fat to drain down a center gutter into a reservoir at the bottom of the tray. It’s a nice idea, but it limits how many slices can actually fit. We managed to squeeze in six slices.</p>
<p>The Nordic Ware has a serious design flaw:  the tray measures 10 inches by 12 inches, which makes it too long to use in a standard microwave. Our large microwave has a center circular revolve with a 14-inch diameter, but the Nordic Ware has a 15-inch diameter and cannot turn. Consequently, we had to manually stop the microwave, turn the tray and restart the microwave.</p>
<p>Results were actually quite good; the bacon had both crunch and chew. But since the Nordic Ware is not dishwasher safe, it’s simply too inconvenient to use.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The best way to cook bacon is undoubtedly in the oven. But if you want to enjoy healthier bacon with less fat, a microwave bacon cooker will make it fast and easy. Over the course of our research and tests, we learned that a lot depends on how the cooker is designed. All of the bacon cookers we tested gave us good to excellent results, but two stood out as particularly well-designed and convenient to use.</p>
<p>Our top pick — the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016N3PGQK/?tag=ybdbac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Presto &#8211; Power Crisp</a> — can cook up to 12 slices at a time in about 12 minutes. Its efficient stand-up racks allow the rendered bacon fat to drip into the tray beneath, leaving the bacon crispy and evenly cooked. It also makes disposal of bacon fat easy and is completely dishwasher safe.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06W2MHM7W/?tag=ybdbac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; Bacon Crisper</a> is our runner-up and its unique design with a raised tray and silicone insert made tasty bacon and clean-up a cinch. It’s about double the price of our top pick, but if you don’t mind spending a little more, it’s worth the price.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected pressure cookers to test</h2>
<p>We began our research by reading many websites and blogs devoted entirely to electric pressure cookers and viewing YouTube videos that demonstrated their functions and recipes. The reasons that most consumers cited for purchasing an electric pressure cooker are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast cooking time</li>
<li>Ease of use</li>
<li>Safety</li>
<li>Capacity</li>
<li>Ease of cleaning</li>
</ul>
<p>Since 2015, Instant Pot has emerged as the dominant electric pressure cooker brand. Introduced in 2010, Instant Pot now has well over 25,000 reviews on Amazon and nearly 1 million followers on Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest.</p>
<p>There are now many different electric pressure cookers to choose from, each claiming to have new features and improved functionality over the Instant Pot. We avoided testing those that had a high proportion of low ratings and repeated customer complaints.</p>
<p>Generally, pressure cookers have a 6- or 8-quart capacity. We read comments that people chose to buy a 6-quart model that could cook smaller portions but also have the capacity to accommodate a whole chicken. People who bought an 8-quart model wanted to cook larger portions for freezing and canning.</p>
<p>We decided to test a range of food — from eggs to pot roast — in portion sizes that a family of two or four might actually cook. So, we only tested cookers with a six-quart capacity.</p>
<p>Our criteria for selecting stove top pressure cookers was different. Stovetop models are made of aluminum, stainless steel or a bi-metal composite. Aluminum tends to easily dent and ding, so we opted for the heftier and more durable stainless steel. We also decided to test the pressure cookers that could be used on gas, electric and induction cooktops.</p>

<h2 id="why-buy">Why buy a pressure cooker?</h2>
<p>The pressure cooker was invented in the mid-17th century. Since then, chefs and home cooks worldwide have used pressure cookers to transform tough cuts of meat into tender, juicy morsels in half the time. Beef stew, for example, which in an oven or stovetop takes three hours to be edible, takes less than an hour in a pressure cooker.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why you might want to purchase a pressure cooker:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressure cookers cut cooking time for everything by about two-thirds. So you could easily come home from work, toss a chicken into the pressure cooker, and have dinner ready 30 minutes later.</li>
<li>Nobody wants to cook roasts in summer. A pressure cooker doesn’t heat up the kitchen, and if you use an electric pressure cooker, you can set it and forget it.</li>
<li>Imagine you get home and you’ve got a family to feed, but you forgot to defrost the pork chops. You can put those rock-solid chops into a pressure cooker, and by increasing the cook time by 10 minutes, you’ll have it on the table in no time.</li>
<li>Beans are a fiber-rich and nutritious addition to our diets, but the traditional method calls for soaking them overnight. You can combine dried beans and a few cups of water in a pressure cooker, and 50 minutes later, they’re done perfectly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How does pressure cooking work?</h2>
<p>A traditional pressure cooker works somewhat like a covered pot when you increase the temperature of the liquid to cook the food inside. However, a pressure cooker has a heavier lid equipped with a rubber gasket that clamps onto the top of the pot.</p>
<p>Once heat is applied, the trapped steam builds pressure to approximately 15 pounds per square inch (psi), thus increasing the temperature of the liquid in the pot above the boiling temperature of water 212 ℉ to 250 ℉. The higher temperature cooks the food faster.</p>
<p>The increased pressure also infuses moisture and liquid into the food, which softens the fibrous or connective tissue (in beef chuck, for example) and tenderizes it.</p>
<p>Once cooking time is completed, and before the lid can be opened, pressure must be released in one of two methods. For softer foods, like vegetables and eggs, the pressure valve on top of the lid is unlocked, which releases the built-up steam inside the cooker in a geyser-like rush. For meats and beans, the pressure valve is kept locked, which allows the pressure to decrease naturally on its own in about 20 minutes.</p>

<p>The electric pressure cooker was invented in 1991, and since then, three generations of it have been introduced to the public, each of which has newer technology. Mechanical timers, delayed cooking features and advanced programmability have all made each generation a little easier to use. Since Instant Pot’s launch in 2010, electric pressure cookers have become extraordinarily popular.</p>
<p>Most of the electric pressure cookers on the market today are multi-functional, and you can easily program the cooker for stews, beans and rice by simply pushing a button. The electric pressure cooker is programmed to automatically set the amount of pressure and cooking time, so you can truly set it and forget it. Also, once the cooking was completed, all of the pressure cookers we tested automatically shifted to a “keep warm” mode, which comes in handy if you’re not ready to eat.</p>
<p>Stovetop pressure cookers are just as fast and efficient as an electric model, but heat and pressure levels must be manually maintained throughout the cooking. It still takes only about 30 or 40 minutes for a pot roast to cook in a stovetop pressure cooker, but you need to watch over it while it cooks.</p>
<h3>User-friendly programmable functions</h3>

<p>We tested electric pressure cookers that had multiple pre-programmed functions for both pressure cooking and slow cooking. At first look, you might assume you can do more with a 12-button model than one with seven buttons. However, two of the electric pressure cookers we tested — the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MZZXO4W/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Power Pressure Cooker XL</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B016RYKKL6/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">T-fal &#8211; CY505E</a> — had terrible user manuals, rendering it difficult to figure out what their extra buttons did without a lot of experimentation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Instant Pot and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000MPA044/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; CPC-600</a> had excellent step-by-step instructions for each of their features. We decided that more buttons don’t necessarily make a better pressure cooker.</p>
<p>Another important feature is the ability to change the pre-programmed function before or during the cooking. For example, this would be helpful when the meat/stew function may be pre-programmed for 20 minutes, but the piece of beef you’re cooking only needs 15 minutes.</p>
<p>All of the pressure cookers enabled us to cancel one program and restart a different program. <b>But we could change cook time and pressure levels only with the </b><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FLYWNYQ/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Instant Pot</b></a><b>.</b> The other pressure cookers locked the program in place once the function button was pressed.</p>
<h3>Speed to pressurize</h3>
<p>All of the electric pressure cookers we tested claimed that they could turn out a fully cooked meal in 20 or so minutes. That’s only half true. It may take 20 minutes to cook, but it could take another 20 minutes for the cooker to build up pressure, or “come to pressure” as it’s commonly called. If you’re using the natural-release method (letting the pressure dissipate without opening the release valve) you need to add 20 minutes more.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12187" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed.png" alt="pressure cooker speed data" width="2000" height="1716" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed.png 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed-610x523.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed-768x659.png 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed-885x759.png 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed-1500x1287.png 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed-295x253.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed-1000x858.png 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed-360x309.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed-375x322.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed-414x355.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed-320x275.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed-885x759@2x.png 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The speed with which the cooker pressurizes depends on the volume of the contents in the cooker’s inner pot. For example, a 3-pound chicken will generally take approximately 15 minutes to come to pressure, while dried beans or rice will take half that time.</p>
<p>We timed how long it took for each pressure cooker to pressurize for every test. Stovetop pressure cookers were fastest; they took between 3-½ and 7 minutes. Timing varied with the electric pressure cookers, but Instant Pot had a substantial lead over the others by pressurizing several minutes sooner.</p>
<h3>Ease of cleaning</h3>
<p>The majority of stovetop pressure cookers are made of stainless steel (for durability) or aluminum (for heat conduction), but unless they have a ceramic coating or a bimetal base, scorched or overdone food particles can be difficult to clean off.</p>
<p>Generally, electric pressure cookers are a lot easier to clean. Each electric pressure cooker we tested had an inner pot made of stainless steel, which, even after repeated uses, maintained its sheen. We did take exception with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MZZXO4W/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Power Pressure</a>’s inner pot, which seemed to be lesser-grade stainless steel with a non-stick coating. This one did begin showing signs of wear.</p>
<p>The inner pot is the only piece of the electric pressure cookers that is dishwashable. The main body of the cooker, the lid and the lid’s inner silicone gasket must be manually cleaned after each use to maintain a secure seal. The T-fal-CY505E is the only model we had trouble cleaning, because of an odd design choice: its lid is attached by a hinge to the cooker body and cannot be removed, which limited how well we could clean it.</p>

<p>We wanted our tests to cover a variety of typical foods people might cook with a pressure cooker. So, we tested cooking:</p>
<ul>
<li>A whole 3-pound fryer chicken</li>
<li>A 3-pound beef pot roast</li>
<li>1 cup of black beans</li>
<li>1 cup of long-grain rice</li>
<li>Hard- and soft-cooked eggs</li>
</ul>
<p>Except for the eggs, each product was minimally seasoned with salt and pepper and cooked in the recommended liquid (usually one cup) for the time instructed in each user manual. Because many people are new to using a pressure cooker, we followed each recipe in the manuals precisely to determine how accurate they were the first time we tried them.</p>
<p>We took a different approach with the eggs by cooking them at 3 minutes (soft), 5 minutes (cooked with jammy yolks) and 6 minutes (firm yolks). However, the shortest cooking time that both the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MZZXO4W/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Power Pressure Cooker XL </a>and <a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B016RYKKL6/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">T-fal &#8211; CY505E</a> could be manually programmed was 5 minutes, so we couldn’t test them for the 3- and 6-minute eggs.</p>
<p>We considered the following questions while testing each of the pressure cookers:</p>
<p><b>Ease of use:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Were programs/functions clearly designated?</li>
<li>Could we figure out how each program worked without consulting the user manual?</li>
<li>Did the user manual provide sufficient instruction for each program?</li>
<li>Were recommended cook times and recipes easy to understand?</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Safety: </b>We examined the cooker’s lid, silicone gasket, lid-locking capability and pressure-escape valve to ensure safety when the cooker was turned on. For the stovetop pressure cookers, we experimented several times with securing the lid to ensure that it was properly and tightly sealed.</p>
<p><b>Performance: </b>We recorded how long it took for each pressure cooker to come to pressure. <b> </b>Once the cooking time completed, we checked how well the food was cooked, its consistency and taste.</p>
<p><b>Convenience: </b>Manufacturers claim that you could replace your <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-slow-cooker/">slow cooker</a> and rice cooker with their multi-function electric pressure cooker. We determined whether their claims were viable. (In almost all cases, we would not recommend throwing your rice cooker in the trash.)</p>

<p>It became clear during our testing that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FLYWNYQ/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Instant Pot &#8211; DUO60</a> was the one to beat. It’s the only pressure cooker we tested that gave us exceptionally luscious meats and perfectly cooked rice, beans and eggs with almost no learning curve. All of the other pressure cookers had either too many or too few buttons, and even though we followed their instruction manuals precisely, food was often over-cooked or, more problematically, under-cooked.</p>

From rice to beans to roast, Instant Pot gave us superior results across the board. In other words, it's worth the hype.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FLYWNYQ/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Instant Pot does exactly as advertised: an entire meal can be prepared in one pot. The saute function sears at three heat levels (221 ℉, 320 ℉ and 338 ℉) for light to dark browning, the meat/chili function pressure cooks and tenderizes the toughest cuts of meat, and the automatic “keep warm” function kicks in when the programmed cooking cycle completes.</p>
<h3>Cooking results</h3>
<p>We used the meat/stew, bean/chili, poultry, rice and saute functions for our tests. Each pre-programmed setting can be adjusted to add more time or pressure, but we found that generally, the settings were spot-on accurate. The chicken was very juicy, flavorful and tender in 20 minutes; after an hour the pot roast sliced easily and held together and unsoaked beans were perfectly cooked in 50 minutes.</p>
<p>Instant Pot’s claim that it replaces a number of kitchen appliances, like a rice cooker, has merit. Instant Pot’s rice function produced excellent rice, each grain individual and only slightly sticky. Every other pressure cooker gave us rice that was soft and very sticky, similar to Chinese take-out rice.</p>
<p>Food expert and chef Alton Brown recently wrote about <a href="https://altonbrown.com/pressure-cooker-eggs-recipe/">the science behind easy-to-peel hard-boiled eggs</a> from a pressure cooker. It’s somewhat tricky to get them just right in a stovetop pressure cooker since you need to continually monitor the pressure and timing.</p>
<p>However, cooking eggs in the Instant Pot couldn’t be easier. We manually programmed Instant Pot to 3 minutes for soft-boiled eggs, 5 minutes for hard-boiled eggs with soft, almost jammy, yolks and 6 minutes for a fully cooked hard-boiled egg. Each test gave us perfectly cooked eggs at the desired consistency.</p>
<p>The Instant Pot has other functions that we didn’t test: multigrain, porridge and yogurt. These unique functions allow you to cook wild rice, steel-cut oatmeal and make a large batch of yogurt from scratch.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>A feature that we like is how easily the Instant Pot seals. Once you’ve inserted the sturdy stainless steel inner pot, you lock the lid in place, by clicking it clockwise. The Instant Pot emits musical tones to let you know you’ve sealed it securely. For the other pressure cookers, we needed to carefully align arrows on the lid and casing, which was less foolproof.</p>
<p>The other pressure cookers we tested hissed and spat a little steam during cooking. The Instant Pot, however, was completely silent, a testament to the efficacy of its sealing.</p>
<p>The Instant Pot’s inventor, Robert Wang, took years to experiment with and test his invention, and his research and development are evident in the Instant Pot’s user-friendly functionality and thoughtful design. The other electric pressure cookers we tested were either the same price or a little cheaper than the Instant Pot, but none of them proved to be as reliable or easy to use. We recommend spending a few dollars more for this superior kitchen appliance.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Instant Pot &#8211; DUO60’s exceptional user interface and accurate pre-programmed functions make pressure cooking easy and stress-free.</li>
<li>Dual pressure settings allow you to select high pressure for tenderizing and cooking tough cuts of meat or low pressure for delicate foods and vegetables.</li>
<li>Unique to Instant Pot, ten safety mechanisms safeguard lid closure, pressure build-up, overheating and vent blockage.</li>
<li>Instant Pot was the only electric pressure cooker we tested that cooked meats, rice and beans equally well.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000MPA044/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; CPC-600</a> doesn’t have Instant Pot’s “bells and whistles,” but its much simpler functions still gave us great results. The Cuisinart has only three buttons: Menu, Time and Start/Cancel. The Menu button allows you to select high or low pressure, browning, saute, simmer and keep warm.</p>
<p>We found Cuisinart’s instruction and recipe booklets to be the best of all the pressure cookers we tested. The instruction booklet is written clearly with easy-to-follow step-by-step instructions. The flip side of the booklet is a collection of recipes and cook times for meats and vegetables. The recipes are not only interesting (for example, “Veal Shoulder Roast Stuffed with Sage Mushrooms” and “Not The Same Old Three-Bean Salad”) but very detailed as well.</p>
<p>The pressure value needs to be installed, and admittedly, we had trouble with the Cuisinart coming to pressure at the first try. We reinstalled the pressure value and discovered that it was quite sensitive and occasionally needed to be nudged to retain pressure. Other than this minor issue we had no problems operating the Cuisinart.</p>

Its browning function might be even better than our top pick Instant Pot's.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000MPA044/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>For all of the tests, the Cuisinart came to pressure quickly, usually between four and 12 minutes.</p>
<p>Chicken, beans, eggs and rice turned out almost exactly as they had in the Instant Pot.</p>
<p>The recipe book calls for pressure-cooking pot roast for a substantial 99 minutes (the longest time that the Cuisinart can be programmed). As instructed, we allowed a natural release, but the beef was somewhat under-cooked. We set the roast for an additional 15 minutes, and this time, it came out fork-tender.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart has an excellent browning function. It’s hotter than the saute function, and it gave the beef and chicken a rich golden-brown color that we didn’t get with the other pressure cookers, including the Instant Pot.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart isn’t as expensive as Instant Pot, and if you don’t think you’ll need all the extra functions and just want a reliable pressure cooker, then the Cuisinart is an excellent choice.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Cuisinart &#8211; CPC-600 has a simple interface and the essential functions for simple and accurate pressure cooking.</li>
<li>It has a unique browning function for meats and poultry that most other pressure cookers lack.</li>
<li>Cuisinart’s instruction and recipe booklets are the best of all pressure cookers we tested. Instructions and recipes are clearly written with detailed easy-to-follow step-by-step instructions.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EXLOW38/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">T-fal &#8211; P25107</a> stovetop pressure cooker is constructed of heavy-gauge stainless steel, which proved very efficient in rapid pressurizing and evenly distributing heat. Despite its terrible user’s guide, the T-fal stovetop is a viable option if you prefer a more hands-on method for pressure cooking or don’t want to incur the expense of an electric pressure cooker.</p>
<p>The T-fal is outfitted with an accurate operating valve that controls pressure. It’s labeled 1 (low pressure) for delicate foods and vegetables, 2 (high pressure) for meat and frozen food, and it has a steam symbol for slow release. As with other stovetop pressure cookers, running a stream of cold water over the pressure cooker causes a rapid release.</p>

<p>The user’s guide has a single page of two skimpy tables for cooking times, mostly for vegetables, rice and beans. In keeping to our test conditions, we followed the guide’s recommendations and crossed our fingers.</p>
<p>Our first test was cooking rice. During the build-up of pressure, condensation appeared around the handle joints and dripped onto the cooktop. The user’s guide recommends 5 minutes for rice, and although we were initially uncertain that it had come to full pressure, we got the hang of waiting for the bobbin to hiss and pop up before beginning timing.</p>
<p>The rice was an unqualified success, slightly sticky with individual grains, and the most like rice cooked in a saucepan.</p>
<p>The T-fal didn’t leak condensation in subsequent tests, and pressure remained constant (with our continual monitoring of the heat).</p>
<p>We had excellent results using the recommended times in the user’s guide: chicken (16 minutes) was cooked through and juicy, beans (4 minutes, pre-soaked) were soft with a perfect bite to them, the eggs (5 minutes) were tender with slightly jammy yolks and the pot roast (40 minutes) held together with minimal shredding.</p>
<p>The T-fal &#8211; P25107 is well-priced for such a quality product. If you’re looking to buy a traditional stovetop pressure cooker, we recommend you consider purchasing this one.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The  T-fal &#8211; P25107’s heavy-gauge stainless steel construction is efficient in rapid pressurization and even heat distribution.</li>
<li>The user’s guide recommended cooking times are accurate and produced excellent results in all of our tests.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MZZXO4W/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Power Pressure Cooker XL </a> is manufactured by Tristar Products, a company better known for exercise and beauty products “as seen on TV.” Despite the substantial number of complaints posted on Amazon, there is a higher proportion of excellent-to-good ratings for this pressure cooker. Generally, we found it performed well, but there are several negatives about the Power Pressure Cooker that don’t justify its high price.</p>
<p>From the outside, it physically resembles Instant Pot. But that’s where the comparison stops. The Power Pressure’s stainless steel inner pot has a non-stick coating, which comes in contact with food. Undoubtedly this will wear down from repeated high-heat use, and when chipped, it’s hazardous.</p>
<p>Before first use, the manual instructs running the cooker through the canning cycle. (We weren’t ever sure why, as no other pressure cooker manual advises doing this.) To do so, the manual instructs filling the inner pot two-thirds full of water; the pot, however, is marked in fifths. Right from the start, it’s a matter of guessing, a pattern that continues with the recipes.</p>
<p>The manual’s recipe for chicken was unnecessarily confusing. According to instructions, the chicken should be browned using the chicken/meat button, then covered and programmed for 30 minutes with the soup/stew function. The cooker’s timer immediately counted down with no indication that pressure was building, and in fact, after 30 minutes, there was no pressure to release. We were unsure whether the chicken had been pressure cooked or stewed instead.</p>
<p>The chicken/meat function browned both the chicken and beef well, but although the chicken turned out tender and juicy, the pot roast was dry, stringy and inedible.</p>
<p>Another negative factor is that the pre-programmed times for each button can’t be adjusted upward or downward. The least amount of time is 5 minutes, using the Rice/Risotto button, so it was impossible for us to complete the egg test (cooking them for 3, 5 and 6 minutes). As it was, the yolk of the 5-minute egg was overcooked and rubbery.</p>
<p>Unlike the Instant Pot, the Power Pressure has a special canning feature and separate instruction manual. We experimented with the canning function and found that it works as advertised. However, this additional feature doesn’t justify the Power Pressure’s price, which, depending on where you purchase, is the same as (or even higher than) the Instant Pot.</p>
<p>The Power Pressure Cooker simply isn’t as well designed as the Instant Pot and could easily discourage a first-time user from cooking with it on a regular basis.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B016RYKKL6/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">T-fal &#8211; CY505E</a> is loaded with features and functions that none of the other electric pressure cookers have. These include oatmeal (identical to the Instant Pot porridge function), baby food, bake, reheat and DIY Chef, a function that supposedly allows you to program time, temperature and pressure.</p>
<p><b>All of these would seem to be excellent additions,</b> <b>except that T-fal doesn’t include any instructions for how to program them</b>. This was especially irksome with the DIY Chef function since it would be the only function that allows manual programming.</p>
<p>Many consumer complaints cite the uselessness of T-fal’s instruction booklet; some people get quite bitter about it. We researched online, and other than a duplicate of the print version, we found no documentation for explaining how to use T-fal’s additional features.</p>
<p>T-fal made an odd design choice in permanently attaching the lid to the body of the unit with a hinge, presumably to ensure sealing. However, not only did we find it awkward and troublesome to shut securely, the lid was also impossible to clean thoroughly.</p>
<p>Since there were limited instructions for use, we had to guess what might work for each test. We began by browning the chicken, but an error message kept popping up. We checked the troubleshooting page of the manual and learned the message meant the lid isn’t shut. We triple-checked the lid, but the error message still flashed.</p>
<p>We decided to program the pressure cook function for 30 minutes. It took over 15 minutes to come to pressure. Once the program completed, we unlocked the release valve for a quick release. However no steam was emitted, and the lid still wouldn’t budge until 25 minutes later.</p>
<p>Regarding test results, the chicken was juicy and tasty, but the dark meat was under-done. We tried rice twice, and both times (9 minutes and 6 minutes), it stuck together in clumps.</p>
<p>We used soups/stews to brown the pot roast and cooked it using the pressure cook function. The beef turned out dry, stringy and tasteless.</p>
<p>Since 5 minutes was the lowest time we could program, we couldn’t complete the three tests for eggs. The five-minute eggs had chalky yolks and chemical-tasting whites.</p>
<p>The only food to be well-cooked was the beans, which came out soft and flavorful.</p>
<p>If T-fal improved the instruction manual, they might have a viable product. But as the T-fal CY505E costs only slightly less than the Instant Pot, we recommend going for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FLYWNYQ/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Instant Pot</a> instead.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005FYF4F2/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Presto &#8211; 01365</a> required minimal assembly before we could begin testing. Unlike T-fal, Presto offers detailed instructions for operation, maintenance and cleaning. It’s made of stainless steel, but it seems light-weight, and during our tests, we found that heat distribution was uneven.</p>
<p>The Presto is easy to seal by simply pushing down on the lid until air is forced out and clamping it shut. The Presto came to pressure quickly, between 4 and 8 minutes, but it was necessary to continually regulate the heat to sustain pressure. As food cooks, steam is released through a pressure regulator, which bobs on top of a valve and indicates high or low pressure. It takes some practice to figure out whether heat needs to be lowered or raised.</p>
<p>As we did with all the pressure cookers, we followed the cooking time recommended in Presto’s instruction and recipe booklet. Unfortunately, the recipes aren’t as accurate as the operating instructions. Rice was soft but gummy. The beans were only half-cooked at the recommended time, so we brought them back to pressure and cooked them an additional 3 minutes.</p>
<p>The recipe instructed cooking a 3-pound chicken for 16 minutes, which proved insufficient time, as both the inner chicken breast and thigh were raw. For the pot roast, the manual recommends 45 minutes and a natural pressure release (which added 10 minutes to cooking time). The beef shredded too easily and was dry and stringy.</p>
<p>There’s only a few dollars’ difference between the Presto and the T-fal stovetop pressure cooker. The T-fal, however, is a better product that gave more consistent results.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>A pressure cooker can definitely change the way you cook. By cutting cooking time by half or even two-thirds, a pressure cooker gives you the opportunity to enjoy a favorite, long-simmered dish in an hour or less.</p>
<p>Electric pressure cookers are certainly more convenient than stovetop models, but we found that many on the market have extra functions than unnecessary. There’s always a learning curve with a new appliance, but with too many bells and whistles, it will take a while to learn how to use them.</p>
<p>Our top pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FLYWNYQ/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Instant Pot &#8211; DUO60</a>, is an affordable and extremely user-friendly electric pressure cooker. It turned out perfectly-cooked food in all of our tests. For performance, functionality and convenience, Instant Pot can&#8217;t be beat. Our runner-up, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000MPA044/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; CPC-600</a>, has far fewer functions, but it has all the essentials.</p>
<p>If you want an electric pressure cooker that’s just for pressure cooking, then the Cuisinart is a great and somewhat less-expensive choice. If you prefer a traditional stovetop pressure cooker, then we recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EXLOW38/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">T-fal &#8211; P25107</a> as the most efficient, well-priced and easy to use option.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>In the 1970s you could pretty much count on finding a slow cooker in every kitchen. The slow-cooker revolution let working parents cook a full meal all day unattended without worrying about the house burning down. With the recent advent of <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-pressure-cooker/">electric pressure cookers</a> (for example, Instant Pot), you might think that slow cookers are less popular. But defying the odds, sales of slow cookers have actually increased substantially, thanks in part to a global market.</p>
<p>Factors contributing to sales growth are portability, programmable functions and low power consumption. Based on our research of consumer posts on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/4x8khb/looking_for_recommendations_for_a_programmable/?st=jfedvjmc&amp;sh=f49cf069" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reddit</a>, Consumer Report’s buying guide and Amazon, as well as information gleaned from other review sites, we chose to test a wide range of newer models with add-on features and less-expensive models with basic functions.</p>

<h2 id="why-buy">Why buy a slow cooker?</h2>
<p>Since the 1970s, when the Crock-Pot was introduced, the slow cooker has been a must-have kitchen appliance. It’s particularly helpful for working parents who don’t have time during the workweek to fix a meal for the family.</p>
<p>Today there’s a broad range of slow cookers you can buy. The simpler models haven’t changed much since the 1970s, but newer models are programmable and can also be Bluetooth capable. Fancy or simple, they all share the same desirable characteristics that make the slow cooker one of the most purchased kitchen appliances in the world.</p>
<p><b>Convenience: </b>This is the number one reason why people buy a slow cooker. The ingredients for a recipe can be layered in the stoneware or ceramic pot (and refrigerated) the night before or in the morning. Plug it in, set it on low and eight hours later, you’ve got a luscious beef pot roast or whole chicken and vegetables ready to serve.</p>
<p><b>Low power consumption:</b> The slow cooker is undoubtedly a cost-efficient way to cook. On average, the slow cookers we tested ranged between 180 watts and 320 watts. (The Cuisinart is the highest at 1,350 watts.) In comparison, an electric oven can use a significantly higher 2400 watts. <a href="http://energyusecalculator.com/electricity_oven.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Using this calculator</a> to calculate energy consumption at 10 cents per kilowatt hour, an electric oven used for a four-hour period could cost approximately $1 per day. A slow cooker (using the average wattage of the models we tested) at 250 watts for eight hours would cost only 19 cents per day. Even the higher wattage Cuisinart consumes half the energy of an electric oven.</p>
<p><b>Portability:</b> A slow cooker is ideal for a holiday meal, a family get-together, potlucks and even a tailgating party, since you can cook the food in one location and transport it, still warm, to another location. A slow cooker is also <a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/95914/jewish/Food-Preparation-on-Shabbat.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved by Jewish religious leaders</a> for partially cooking, warming and serving the traditional cholent stew during the Sabbath (when all cooking is forbidden).</p>
<p><b>Economy:</b> Most slow cookers are inexpensive and as noted above are cheap to operate. But a slow cooker could also reduce your grocery bill since you can buy less-choice, tough cuts of meats, which the slow cooker simmers to incredible tenderness.</p>

<p><b>Capacity:</b> Slow cookers come in a number of sizes, ranging from a capacity of 1.5 quarts to 8 quarts. The user manuals of the slow cookers we tested advise filling the slow cooker to a maximum of three-quarters full, so capacity is important for what you plan to cook and for how many people. Most manufacturers recommend a 5- or 6-quart model for a family of four, and it can easily accommodate a whole chicken, beef roast or pork shoulder for pulled pork. If you plan to cook chili, soup or stew for a crowd or in bulk quantities for freezing, then the 7- or 8-quart model would be best.</p>
<p><b>Removable inner pot:</b> Slow cooker inner pots are round, oval or oblong, and most are ceramic or stoneware. If you want to make desserts in a slow cooker, a circular cake pan or springform pan can fit into a round inner pot. However, for chili, soups and stews, we found that the heat was better distributed in the oval or oblong inner pot and required less stirring.</p>
<p><b>Sealing/locking lid:</b> A glass lid that seals with a rubber gasket and locks onto the slow cooker maintains a consistent internal temperature in the inner pot. A sealing/locking lid is also essential for transporting the inner pot without spillage.</p>
<p><b>Programmable controls:</b> Newer models have digital controls, which can be programmed to schedule time and temperature settings. The programmable models are especially convenient for all-day cooking, automatically switching from the cook mode to the keep-warm mode and preventing overcooking.</p>
<p><strong>“</strong><b>On” light:</b> Surprisingly, very few slow cookers have an “on” light. None of the manual models we tested had an “on” light, so we didn’t know if the slow cooker was functioning unless we touched the sides of the slow cooker’s housing. Some digital models have an “on” light or a “ready” light to indicate that the inner pot has reached the programmed temperature.</p>
<p><b>Browning/sauteing function:</b> The majority of slow cooker inner pots are oven-safe, but they aren’t stovetop-safe, so meat and vegetables should be browned or sauted in a separate pan. A browning function isn’t essential, but it does give you the ability to brown a roast without washing a second pan.</p>

<p>Depending on the recipe and what you’re cooking, a slow cooker needs to rapidly reach and exceed 140 ℉ — the <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/danger-zone-40-f-140-f/CT_Index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“danger zone” where salmonella bacteria can grow</a> — and continue to increase in temperature to no higher than 210 ℉ for a period of four-to-eight hours. If the temperature exceeds 210 ℉ and hits the boiling point at 212 ℉, the food will cook too quickly and dry out.</p>
<p>On the keep-warm setting, the slow cooker must also sustain a temperature not lower than the “danger zone,” below 140 ℉, to inhibit bacterial growth.</p>
<p>To ensure food safety, modern slow cookers are much hotter than the 1970s slow cookers, so anything you cook in a slow cooker can easily overcook. It’s a good idea to actually take your slow cooker’s temperature to know whether you need to change a recipe’s timing.</p>
<p>We filled all of our slow cookers halfway and set them on low. Over the next four hours, we used an <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-digital-meat-thermometer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instant-read thermometer</a> to check temperatures every hour. Some slow cookers have hot spots around the edges of the inner pot, closest to the heating element, and these hot spots will cook food faster than the food in the center of the inner pot.</p>

<p><b>The </b><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008YEXC22/?tag=ybdslow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Cuisinart &#8211; MSC-600</b></a><b> was the only slow cooker that hit above the danger zone in the first hour. </b>By 90 minutes, all of the slow cookers — except the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D68QHSG/?tag=ybdslow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Proctor-Silex &#8211; 33042 </a>— were between 147 ℉ &#8211; 152 ℉. The Proctor-Silex didn&#8217;t clear the danger zone until after the second hour. At this point, the internal temperature of a large piece of beef or a whole chicken would not have reached above 140 ℉, <strong>so there would be a risk of bacterial growth.</strong></p>
<p>By the third hour, all of the slow cookers’ temperatures had spiked 20 degrees. By the fourth hour, all — except for the Cuisinart — increased by another 10 degrees. The Cuisinart stayed consistent at 199 ℉, a good temperature for the low setting.</p>
<p>For our final water test, we turned up the setting to high. Within 30 minutes, all of the slow cookers hit over 200 ℉ with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X5XJ9FG/?tag=ybdslow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; SC1007D</a> at boiling (212 ℉), which is much too hot. The Cuisinart reached its high temperature at 209 ℉ and sustained it for the next hour.</p>

<p>For our performance tests, we selected pinto beans and pot roast because they ran the gamut of different preparation, heat levels and cooking times. Many online recipes suggest heating up the slow cooker at high for one hour and then adjusting it to the low setting for the remainder of the cooking time. However, we decided it would be a fairer test of performance to cook at its low and high settings without making any adjustments to temperature.</p>
<p>We soaked one pound of pinto beans per slow cooker overnight, drained them and combined the beans with enough water to cover them by two inches. Each slow cooker was set at low, and we took the temperature at the center and the edges of the inner pot every hour. At the third hour of cooking, we began to test the beans for level of doneness.</p>
<p>We intentionally didn’t stir the beans so we could determine whether the beans in the center of the pot cooked differently than those around the edges of the pot. (Under normal non-test conditions, the beans should be stirred.)</p>
<p>Slow cookers have always been marketed as a “set-it-and-forget-it” appliance. Theoretically, you could layer meat and vegetables in the slow cooker, set it on low and leave it unattended for eight hours. However, our results showed that unless you occasionally stirred or checked on what you’re cooking, you would wind up with chewy, undercooked or overcooked food.</p>
<p>For the pot roast test, we cut three-pound pieces of beef chuck, approximately two inches thick, from the same large piece of beef. We seasoned each three-pound roast with Kosher salt and black pepper and added enough beef broth to fill each slow cooker halfway. We set the slow cookers on high and recorded the temperatures of the liquid at one-hour intervals. Once the roasts were done (approximately 4-½ to 5 hours), we adjusted the setting to warm for an additional hour to test how the cooked roasts might be affected.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008YEXC22/?tag=ybdslow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; MSC-600</a> outperformed all of the slow cookers we tested. It maintained an ideal temperature range of between 199 ℉ and 210 ℉, which evenly cooked the beans at the low setting and produced a tender and juicy pot roast at the high setting.</p>
<p>Perhaps in an attempt to attract consumers not quite ready to dip into the Instant Pot pool, Cuisinart is marketing this 6-quart slow cooker as a three-in-one “multi-cooker,” which we believe is an overstatement. In reality, it’s a slow cooker with the additional functions of steaming and browning, both of which certainly elevate it above simpler models.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart has a brushed stainless-steel housing with a blue backlit LCD display and buttons for selecting slow cook, brown/saute, steam, start/stop and plus and minus increments for time and temperature. We found it very easy to program (without needing to consult the user’s manual) and can be adjusted at any point during the cooking time.</p>

<p>Its oval heating element is raised from the bottom of the housing unit and approximately runs the length and width of the inner pot. The inner pot is composed of sturdy but lightweight aluminum, which is coated with xylan, a nonstick coating manufactured by <a href="https://www.whitfordww.com/industrial/commercial-bakeware.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whitford Worldwide</a>. (There are concerns posted on Amazon that the coating is Teflon, <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/teflon-and-perfluorooctanoic-acid-pfoa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long exposure to which is known to cause health issues</a>. However, we confirmed with Cuisinart’s customer service that the inner pot is coated with xylan and not Teflon.)</p>
<p>The Cuisinart’s inner pot has BPA-free plastic cool-to-touch handles. It is the only inner pot of the slow cookers we tested that didn’t require us to use pot holders to remove it from the housing. The Cuisinart comes with a steaming rack and, like all slow cookers, a heavy glass lid. Our only criticism of the Cuisinart’s design is that the lid doesn’t lock onto the inner pot, so you need to devise a way to prevent spillage during transport. (One online suggestion is bungee cords.)</p>
<p>The Cuisinart maintained an optimal temperature range in all of our tests. For the beans (cooked at the low setting), once it reached 198 ℉, the temperature was sustained for three hours. The temperature in the center of the pot was minimally less by one or two degrees, a difference that did not affect the cooking. The beans were done after 5-½ hours, and they were all evenly cooked without any uncooked, hard beans mixed in.</p>
<p>The pot roast test was a real make-or-break for all of the slow cookers. The Cuisinart had the edge over the others, thanks to its excellent browning/sauteing function, which can be programmed up to 400 ℉, the hottest of all the slow cookers we tested.</p>
<p>Browning occurs at 280 ℉-330 ℉, so the Cuisinart can achieve similar results to those of a saute pan. Although many slow cooker recipes suggest that browning meat isn’t necessary, we found that it made a big difference in flavor.</p>
<p>The pot roast was done at four hours, and it was tender and beefy-tasting. We switched the temperature setting to warm, and because the Cuisinart’s warm setting is the lowest temperature (165 ℉) of all the slow cookers we tested, the roast did not dry out and stayed juicy an hour later.</p>
<p>The nonstick coated aluminum pot was easy to clean and is dishwasher-safe. We had a bit of trouble with cleaning stains from the heating element, and we noticed pinpricks of rust on the housing’s stainless steel after repeated use. It’s not a deal-breaker, but the stainless steel does need to be maintained.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart’s user manual and recipe booklet were by far the most complete and extensive, with recipes ranging from breakfast to entrees to sauces to desserts. (We did question, however, why anyone would want to wait 3 hours for oatmeal or breakfast strata to cook.)</p>
<p>The Cuisinart MSC-600 is a bit more expensive than the other slow cookers we tested, but for ease of use, performance and design, it is undeniably superior to the rest.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Cuisinart &#8211; MSC-600 has well-calibrated settings that quickly reach the programmed temperatures and sustain them throughout cooking.</li>
<li>The Cuisinart is the only slow cooker we tested that had a browning/sauteing function, which adds substantial taste to slow-cooked meats, such as roasts and stews. It also saves time since you only have one pot to wash.</li>
<li>Its non-Teflon-coated aluminum inner pot heats evenly without any hot spots and is easy to clean.</li>
<li>The Cuisinart has an attractive stainless steel housing with an easy-to-read blue LCD display and simple programmable functions.</li>

<p>If you don’t mind giving up the Cuisinart’s digital programming feature, the manually-controlled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MR0FFPS/?tag=ybdslow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chefman &#8211; RJ15-5-N</a> is a great option for about half the price. The Chefman has an attractive and unique stoneware crock with a nonstick, non-chemical (<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/teflon-and-perfluorooctanoic-acid-pfoa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PFOA-free and PTFE-free</a>) coating that is oven-safe — and the only inner pot of the slow cookers we tested that is stovetop-safe. The stoneware crock can be used for reheating food in the oven and for simmering or reducing sauces on a stovetop’s open flame.</p>
<p>In other respects, the Chefman is very similar to most slow cookers. It’s oval-shaped, has a tempered-glass lid and manually controlled settings for low, high and warm. The lid doesn’t have a locking device, so it can’t be readily transported elsewhere other than from the kitchen to the dining room table. The heating element is built within the stainless steel housing, so it gets very hot and can’t be touched without pot holders.</p>

<p>During our tests, the Chefman was a little slow at the low setting to reach the temperature above the danger zone, but at the high setting it hit 206 ℉ within 90 minutes and increased just a few degrees to 210 ℉, which it then sustained for three hours. The Chefman’s temperature range at high was comparable with the Cuisinart and kept the liquid at a steady simmer without ever boiling.</p>
<p>The pinto beans completed cooking in six hours, and although a few from the center of the pot were not as well-cooked as those around the edges of the pot, they were flavorful. The Chefman’s pot roast was on par with the Cuisinart’s — tender, juicy and beefy. Its warm setting was a little high at 206 ℉, but even at that temperature, the roast didn’t dry out.</p>
<p>The Chefman’s housing was easy to clean, and the stoneware crock and lid are dishwasher-safe. The pot roast left slight staining in the crock, but this can be cleaned with a paste of water and baking soda.</p>
<p>The Chefman is about the same price or even a bit less expensive than the other slow cookers we tested that didn’t perform nearly as well. So if you don’t mind having to manually control temperature and time, we can recommend the Chefman as an excellent alternative to the more high-end Cuisinart.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Chefman &#8211; RJ15-5-N is the only slow cooker we tested that can be used in the oven for reheating food and on a stovetop open flame for simmering and reducing sauces and gravies.</li>
<li>Its attractive and unique chemical-free stoneware crock evenly distributes heat and maintains temperatures for its settings.</li>
<li>The Chefman is well-priced for such a high-quality slow cooker.</li>

<p>Another slow cooker that comes with bells and whistles is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NAPBT3E/?tag=ybdslow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Crock-Pot &#8211; SCCPVC600AS-B</a>, a 6-quart slow cooker, and it’s also highly rated on Amazon. This Crock-Pot has simple digital programming with an easy-to-read LCD display that flashes between heat setting and remaining time to the program.</p>
<p>The Crock-Pot ran a bit cool overall, not exceeding 200 ℉ on the low setting and 206 ℉ on the high setting. The beans were done in five hours, but they were inconsistently cooked; some were soft, others were mealy. The pot roast took 5-½ hours, and although the bottom half of the roast was juicier, it was still tender and quite flavorful.</p>
<p>During our first tests, we experienced a couple of issues, so we decided to test a second unit to determine whether our first unit was faulty or not.</p>
<p>With the first unit we noticed a strong, acrid smell emitting from the Crock-Pot’s housing. There are some complaints from Amazon reviewers about this prevalent odor, and the Crock-Pot company claims that it will lessen over time. However, even after repeated washings, the first unit’s odor did not dissipate and added an unpleasant metallic flavor to the beans and pot roast.</p>
<p>We had better success with the second unit. We again smelled the distinctive odor during the water test, but it lessened after each subsequent use and did not affect the food.</p>
<p>The second issue we had was with the Crock-Pot’s automatic stirring attachment. It has its own power source, so the Crock-Pot itself is plugged into the stirring motor. It’s equipped with two paddles: a four-pronged metal paddle for stew and a wide plastic paddle for soup and chili.</p>
<p>The stirrer can be programmed to stir at 30-minute intervals. It’s a great idea, if only it worked. After the first unit failed to stir, we tested the second unit, and it also failed to stir at the programmed time. The stirrer has a “pulse” button, which lets you stir without using the program, and this worked fine both times.</p>
<p>Crock-Pot has other programmable models without the automatic stirring attachment, which might be more reliable for the same midrange price.</p>
<h3>Proctor-Silex &#8211; 33042</h3>

<p>This is a basic, round, no-frills 4-quart slow cooker. Its dishwasher-safe ceramic pot and glass lid fit into a metal housing with manual controls. As the housing heats up, it gets very hot and can’t be touched.</p>
<p>At the low setting, it took over two hours for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D68QHSG/?tag=ybdslow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Proctor-Silex &#8211; 33042 </a>to surpass the 140 ℉ danger zone, and then it didn’t reach a temperature at which food would actually cook until four hours later. One can imagine coming home to a stew after a day at work and finding it half raw.</p>
<p>The beans and pot roast test results were wildly divergent. It took the Proctor-Silex 11-½ hours to cook the beans through.</p>
<p>However, the pot roast surprised us by being one of the best we cooked. It took a bit longer at the Proctor-Silex’s high setting — six hours — but it shredded easily and had lots of meaty flavor.</p>
<p>One advantage to the Proctor-Silex’s cooler temperature is that the keep-warm setting is 189 ℉, which was enough to keep the roast hot, but not overcook it.</p>
<p>The Proctor-Silex is a bit more expensive than our runner-up, the Chefman. It’s not a bad little slow cooker at its high setting, but it&#8217;s too-low temperature doubles the cooking time of recipes that need a low setting, such as soups and stews.</p>
<h3>Black+Decker &#8211; SC1007D</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X5XJ9FG/?tag=ybdslow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; SC1007D</a> is an oval, 7-quart slow cooker with a stoneware inner pot that fits into a metal housing with models that are decorated with three different retro designs. The housing’s plastic handles are cool-to-the-touch, although, like other slower cookers, the inner pot’s handles cannot be touched without pot holders. The Black+Decker also has the same basic, manual settings of low, high and warm.</p>
<p>The tempered glass lid is not secured, and throughout cooking, as the liquid boiled, the lid rocked up and down, leaking built-up condensation into the lip of the stoneware pot and into the food. After we finished testing, we noticed that this condensation had dripped down into the housing unit and stained the heating element.</p>
<p>The Black+Decker runs very hot (209 ℉-212 ℉), which caused rapid evaporation of the cooking liquid, so we needed to add more liquid to prevent the beans from drying out. The beans were done in six hours, with beans in the center much harder than those along the edges of the inner pot. These results indicate that you would need to occasionally stir anything you’re cooking to ensure it all cooks the same.</p>
<p>The high heat cooked the pot roast in 4-½ hours, but because it maintained the temperature at the boiling point for two hours, the beef was bone dry.</p>
<p>The Black+Decker is about five dollars less than the Chefman, but it’s certainly not worth the small savings.</p>
<h3>Hamilton Beach &#8211; 33969 Set ‘n Forget</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EZI26GO/?tag=ybdslow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignnone wp-image-11963 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hamilton-beach-33969.jpg" alt="Hamilton Beach - 33969" width="1945" height="1296" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hamilton-beach-33969.jpg 1945w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hamilton-beach-33969-610x406.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hamilton-beach-33969-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hamilton-beach-33969-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hamilton-beach-33969-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hamilton-beach-33969-1500x999.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hamilton-beach-33969-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hamilton-beach-33969-1000x666.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hamilton-beach-33969-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hamilton-beach-33969-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hamilton-beach-33969-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hamilton-beach-33969-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EZI26GO/?tag=ybdslow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 33969 Set ‘n Forget</a> shows up on a lot of “the best of” lists, but we were less impressed, particularly with its digital programming, which we found to be difficult to use.</p>
<p>Settings are programmed by pushing a series of buttons, and once the program begins, it can’t be changed. So if the temperature is too high or too low, or if you want to adjust the time, you need to cancel the program altogether and reprogram the new settings.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach has a couple of excellent features. A rubber gasket lines the inside of the glass lid, which keeps the lid snugly secured during cooking. The lid has two vent holes to prevent condensation forming. The Hamilton Beach is also transportable without leaks, thanks to two clips on either side of the lid that snap onto hooks on either end of the pot.</p>
<p>Its unique feature is a meat probe, which can be programmed to automatically switch the cooker off when the meat reaches the designated internal temperature. This feature works for a large roast and a whole chicken; however, the probe simply isn’t long enough to get into the center of a smaller piece of meat. So it’s a nice feature, but unless Hamilton Beach extends the length of the probe, it’s pretty useless.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach also runs too hot on both high and low settings. After six hours, the beans were soft around the edges of the inner pot and only half-cooked in the center of the pot. Those beans that were fully cooked tasted delicious. The high setting boiled the pot roast for nearly three hours, resulting in dry, stringy beef.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach is about $50, approximately half the price of our top pick, the Cuisinart, and although it might make an attractive addition to your countertop, it just doesn’t perform as well.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The slow cooker has come a long way since the 70s, but some companies haven’t changed their model very much since then. We think that with all of the technology available, it makes sense to buy a digital slow cooker that ensures a constant temperature, is easy to program and gives consistent cooking results.</p>
<p>Three of the six slow cookers that we tested were digital, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008YEXC22/?tag=ybdslow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; MSC-600</a> was undoubtedly the best. Its unique additional feature of a browning/sauteing function is a real bonus for adding rich flavor to roasts and stews. The Cuisinart does not get too hot — an issue with almost all slow cookers — and it maintains the programmed temperature for hours at a time. It’s a bit more expensive, but we feel the Cuisinart is worth it.</p>
<p>Of the three manually controlled slow cookers, we preferred the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MR0FFPS/?tag=ybdslow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chefman &#8211; RJ15-5-N</a> to the others. Its nonstick, chemical-free stoneware crock is both oven-safe and stovetop-safe, and it maintained temperature settings like the Cuisinart. At half the price, if you don’t mind losing the digital programming, the Chefman is a worthy pick.</p>

<p><em>Editors note: as of April 2019 our top pick, the Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S appears to be out of stock and has been replaced with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DC3VJG6/?tag=ybdslr-20">Crenova&#8217;s &#8211; VS100S</a> model. We&#8217;re currently looking into the differences. We have also found that the original winner looks identical to a rebrand by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DWVVX5F/?tag=ybdslr-20">TINVOO&#8217;s VS100S</a>, which we&#8217;ve replaced links throughout this article to reflect.</em></p>
<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>With plenty of vacuum sealers available on Amazon, it was no easy feat  narrowing down the list to six for testing. We started by talking to chef, Draper Donely, who’s spent the last three years with Submariner as Director of Franchise Operations. He helped us learn which qualities were essential for food safety in vacuum sealed foods. We also discussed with him the necessities of sous vide cooking.</p>
<p>While researching further in the subreddit /r/frugal, we learned there is a wide range of use for vacuum sealers that will place more importance on some features than other use cases. For example, game hunters that will be spending several hours vacuum sealing in one session need a machine that can stand up to repeated and heavy use, but aren’t too concerned about how big the machines are.</p>
<p>This led us to looking at some commercial-grade sealers such as the Weston Pro &#8211; 2300 and Cabela’s 12 inch commercial sealer. And while these are amazing devices that are well-loved by hunters and chefs, they do come at a hefty price. For your average kitchen, we looked at what consumers thought were important qualities from Amazon reviews, Reddit and YouTube. We looked at reliability reports and warranties and pitted that against companies with solid reputations. No vacuum sealer scored a perfect review, as each had their own minor grievances, but we were able to discern which vacuum sealers were worth considering.</p>

<h2>Who needs a vacuum sealer</h2>
<p>Food vacuum sealers are a great addition to the busy household looking to save time and money. They’re especially great for people with memberships to bulk retailers like Costco and Sam’s club. For anyone trying to save money and eliminate food waste, preservation is the key to success. Food sealers are great for extending shelf life, which will help keep foods preserved up to five times longer in both the refrigerator and the freezer, according to the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/downloads/food/guidanceregulation/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation/seafood/ucm521533.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FDA</a>.</p>
<p>Vacuum sealers not only save money and help eliminate waste, they also save you time. Busy families have tight schedules and being able to bulk shop, vacuum seal and freeze helps reduce shopping trips. Leftovers will also last longer which will help eliminate cooking a few meals, adding more to your time saved.</p>
<p>Food vacuum sealers are incredible machines that pull as much oxygen out of the storage bag as they can, before heat sealing the bag. Oxygen is the enemy of freshness and is what accelerates spoilage in food. These sealers are able to extend shelf life by eliminating most of the oxygen in the bag. That being said, it’s important to remember that food will eventually go bad over long enough period of time, even if it’s been vacuum sealed.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Width of sealer:</b> The size of the food you want to vacuum seal will determine what size bag you will need. Most food vacuum sealers are around 11 inches wide, which will accommodate most food items. Hunters will typically need a vacuum sealer at least 12 inches wide to vacuum seal larger portions of meat.</p>
<p><b>Speed/convenience/suction power:</b> All of the vacuum sealers work exactly the same way, but each one will have different combinations of features for speed and convenience. Larger units will often include a bag roll storage and cutter, a great convenience, but one that comes with the cost of a larger unit. Other units will sacrifice vacuum control for a more powerful pump that reduces the time to remove oxygen, which can lead to crushing softer foods.</p>
<p><b>Versatility:</b> If you also want to be able to seal jars and extra large bags, a hose attachment is great feature that will add versatility to your unit.</p>
<p><b>Noise:</b> No food vacuum sealer is going to have an absolutely silent motor, but some are built with noise reduction in mind.</p>
<p><b>Size / weight:</b> The importance of the size and weight will largely depend on the size of your kitchen. Assess your available counter space and your predicted frequency of use. Larger units will often have storage for bag rolls and come with a few other convenience features that offer a compelling reason to make permanent room on your counter. But if space is an issue, choose one of the lightweight vacuum sealers that’s easy to store.</p>
<p><b>Liquids / oily foods:</b> It’s important for the vacuum sealer to be able to detect liquids and oils entering the vacuum chamber quickly and shut off the motor before they enter the main housing. Lower quality machines can break down quickly if they fail to shut off in time. Packaging will reflect whether or not this feature is present.</p>
<p><strong>Warranty:</strong> With heavy use, even the best vacuum sealers may quit on you before you know it. Getting at least a one year warranty will help ease your mind, should you use your vacuum sealer often.</p>
<p><b>Performance over long sessions:</b> The average household won’t need to consider this often, but if you’re prepping for winter by sealing and storing in the freezer, it’s helpful to have a vacuum sealer that can maintain performance speed and quality over longer sessions. This is especially true for hunters that may need to seal large quantities of meat.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-does-your-food-last">How long does your vacuum sealed food last?</h2>
<p>Storage is everything when it comes to keeping your food fresh. Throughout more than 50 hours of testing vacuum sealers and discussing with food-safety experts, we also learned the length of time that popular food items last in the freezer, refrigerator and pantry. Learn more about how long your food will last if vacuum sealed and stored properly with our guideline below.</p>

<p>If you find yourself tossing expired food at the end of the week, investing in a vacuum sealer could save you money in the long run. Record how much food you’re throwing out without a vacuum sealer for a month — you might be surprised by how quickly it will pay for itself.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Convenience</h3>
<p>The first thing we wanted to know was how easy it was to get up and running with each of the vacuum sealers. Most of the units we tested were pretty straightforward: plug it into the wall, place food in provided bag, place open end in vacuum chamber, secure and press the vacuum button. The FoodSaver &#8211; V4840 was the only one that had an automated process, which took reading the directions beforehand to operate correctly. The directions are also on the machine itself and weren’t difficult to follow. The Geryon, NutriChef &#8211; Automatic Vacuum Air Sealer and Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S were the most intuitive and easiest to get started using.</p>
<p>The size and weight of the FoodSaver &#8211; V4840 made it the biggest vacuum sealer by far. It’s definitely meant to stay where you put it, so moving it around for storage will likely not be convenient. And while the Nesco &#8211; VS-02 was light in comparison, the dimensions were big enough to make it inconvenient to move around and store when not in use. The Greyon was by far the most portable food vacuum sealer.</p>
<h3>Suction power</h3>

<p>We looked at each vacuum sealer’s listed wattage and performed our own test to determine the suction power of each machine. We measured out six portions of six ounces of kidney beans, one portion for each sealer. We used the provided bags for each machine as they were all very similar in construction. We timed the process as well to further determine the convenience of each unit. To make the process as fair as possible, we eliminated as much air as possible by hand for each bag before beginning.</p>
<h3>Speed comparison</h3>

<p>For our visual assessment, we looked closely to see how much air had been removed. The bags with the most air removed sealed most tightly to the beans.  Vacuum sealing dry kidney beans is a pretty easy task for all six of our chosen vacuum sealers. The Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S had the quickest time and only the FoodSaver &#8211; FM2000 had a subpar vacuum seal with a time of almost ten seconds more than the best time recorded.</p>
<p>To further test our sealers on suction power and their ability to handle moisture-rich foods, we did another round of testing with pork chops and fish. The fish, being softer and more easily crushed to produce more moisture, was great for testing how good each unit was in shutting off before pulling too much moisture into the vacuum chamber.</p>
<p><b>A note on how to get the most air removed from bags containing moisture-rich foods:</b></p>
<p>Take a sheet or two of paper towels and fold them horizontally until they are three inches tall. Place the folded up paper towel(s) in the top of the bag (make sure you’ll still have plenty of room for the machine to seal without touching the towel(s)) and away from the food. The paper towel will soak up the moisture being pulled from the food, saving it from entering and damaging the vacuum sealer. It’s not recommended to use this method for sous vide cooking. The paper towel trick will collect residual moisture and remain in the top portion of the bag.</p>
<p>The FoodSaver &#8211; V4840 and the NutriChef &#8211; Automatic Vacuum Air Sealer are the only vacuum sealers to have specific dry and moist food modes. In the case of the FoodSaver &#8211; V4840, this slowed down the process. This allowed the machine to remove more air before having to shut off. The slow process prevented moisture from entering the vacuum chamber. The moist mode on the NutriChef &#8211; Automatic Vacuum Air Sealer had no discernible effect. We used it with the mode on and off with the same foods and had negligible difference in both time and results.</p>
<p>The moisture-rich fish helped further separate the quality of the suction achieved by each machine. The smaller units did very well. The Geryon &#8211; Vacuum Sealer Machine and Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S both shut off during appropriate times to ensure too much moisture didn’t enter the vacuum chamber. The Geryon barely edged out the FoodSave &#8211; FM2000 in our visual assessment of the pork chops, with a barely noticeable difference in the amount of air removed.</p>
<p><b>A note on vacuum sealing raw chicken:</b></p>
<p>When vacuum sealing raw chicken, make sure to thoroughly clean the vacuum chamber after each use. Salmonella is always a risk factor when working with raw chicken in the kitchen. It’s important to clean the vacuum chamber after any liquid or juices from raw meat enter it to ensure food safety.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>To test the performance of our six vacuum sealers we specifically wanted to look at longevity, strength of the seal and how well it does with soft foods.</p>
<h4>High volume testing</h4>
<p>For our high volume test, we measured out 30 portions of kidney beans weighing six ounces each. We then vacuum sealed each one to see how many each unit could vacuum seal at 100% efficacy, meaning we did repeated vacuum sealing until each unit could no longer remove air to the same degree as the first bag sealed. We also checked to see how much rest each unit needed after failure before being able to use it again at 100% efficacy.</p>

<p>The FoodSaver &#8211; V4840 was a real champion at sealing bags consecutively. It made it to 25 bags before getting too hot to get a 100% vacuum on the next bag. This is because the bags would start to seal from the heat, which would not allow the machine to pull out air to create the vacuum. The cool down time was also the longest, but we’ll forgive that due to the much higher bag count. We noticed that units that were made of mostly plastic had quicker recovery times. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IUAK39A/?tag=ybdslr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nesco</a> wasn’t able to last as long but it cooled down and was able to get back to work faster than all, but the Geryon.</p>
<h4>Strength of seal</h4>

<p>We tested the strength of the seal through a variety of means, both normal and extreme. Our normal involved using a sous vide cooking machine. Sous vide cooking utilizes vacuum sealed food to achieve a very thorough and even cooking that results in marvelously tasty meals. We used each unit to vacuum seal an eight oz. cut of beef chuck for our sous vide cooking.</p>
<p>Sous vide cooking takes an extremely long time compared to other methods, but is actually very easy and yields wonderful results. Our beef chuck was an excellent choice to use as it is a very inexpensive cut of beef that highlighted the benefits of using a sous vide cooker.</p>
<p>We sealed each portion with seasoning, thyme and rosemary before cooking. In this test, there was no clear winner as each performed admirably with equal results. Each portion was cooked perfectly throughout the entire portion.</p>
<p>For our first extreme test we sealed six slices of apple and took these to the desert and left them in the sun while we rock climbed. This helped us check for oxidation which helped us determine just how good the vacuum and the seal were. A pleasant surprise greeted us when we opened the bags; the apples were completely baked and tasted superb. The only bag to show signs up oxidation was the bag vacuum-sealed by the Nesco &#8211; VS-02, meaning it failed to achieve a high level vacuum seal.</p>
<p>Our second extreme test involved sealing paper towels and taking them freediving with us to a depth of 60 feet. While it’s unlikely anyone will need to take vacuum sealed food 60 feet underwater, we thought it would be a fun way to test how well the seal did under pressure. And not surprisingly, not a single bag leaked.</p>
<p>In the end, the only machine to underperform was the Nesco and only in terms of vacuum. Each unit performed admirably in regards to the strength of the seal.</p>
<h4>Soft foods</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10275" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test.jpg" alt="testing crushable soft foods" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-768x512@2x.jpg 1536w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>To check how well each food vacuum sealer dealt with vacuum sealing soft foods, we used the softest food we could think of: sliced bread. We placed two slices of bread into a bag, vacuum sealed it and compared our results.</p>
<p>This allowed us to test how quickly the stop function worked on all the vacuum sealers. If you let any of them go automatically, they will each crush the bread into almost nothing. Every unit we tested stopped immediately after pressing the stop button, but the Nesco would allow a little bit of air to return to the chamber before sealing.</p>
<p>The Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S has a wonderful feature that allows you to remove a little more air in small bursts through a pulse button. This came in handy throughout our time with the unit.</p>
<h4>Unique features</h4>
<p>As mentioned above, the Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S has a pulse button that allows for quick bursts of suction to remove as much air as possible. This was especially useful for soft foods, but came in handy during other uses as well.</p>
<p>The FoodSaver &#8211; V4840 4840 and Nesco &#8211; VS-02 both come with storage for a bag roll. This is a fantastic feature that makes it easy to keep track of everything and create custom-sized bags. Both also have a slicer integrated into the machine to make cutting effortless and precise.</p>
<p>The FoodSaver &#8211; V4840 4840 is the only one we tested that came with an included canister pump that is attached to the machine. While this feature is not as commonly used, it’s a nice addition.</p>
<h4>Cleaning</h4>
<p>Food vacuum sealers are going to get dirty. It’s a fact of life for almost every kitchen appliance. And keeping these machines clean, especially the rubber seal of the vacuum chamber, is crucial to keeping them functioning properly and lasting for years instead of months. In our testing, we found that all but the FoodSaver &#8211; V4840 4840 were very easy to clean. The FoodSaver &#8211; V4840 4840 sliding tray made it difficult to thoroughly clean the device if too much liquid was pulled during suction. While not an impossible task, it was nowhere near as easy as with the other units.</p>
<p>The Geryon &#8211; Vacuum Sealer Machine was perhaps the easiest to clean in these situations, being constructed almost entirely of heavy duty plastic and having a removable inner tray.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S</h2>

<p>Of the six vacuum sealers we tested, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DWVVX5F/?tag=ybdslr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S</a> sucked the most, which in this case is the best. When used to vacuum seal pork chops and fish, it performed admirably and was easy to put away after sealing anything. While it isn’t the smallest unit, it’s relatively close in size to the Geryon — the smallest unit — and is still easily storable. The Tinvoo was also the quickest machine and was only outperformed in longevity by the two FoodSavers. This made our consecutive sealing test easier to perform in comparison to the other models. The simplicity of its design also lent it a nice aesthetic while in use in our kitchen.</p>

<p>We also appreciated how easy it was to use in comparison to the larger FoodSaver &#8211; V4840 4840 while still having similar features. The vacuum chamber was large, making it easy to place the open end of the bag into the machine. Pushing down on the machine to lock it into place took the least amount of guesswork due to the design. The Tinvoo hinge for the lid is very close to the front of the machine, giving it enough weight towards the back to balance the machine while pressing down the lid to lock.</p>
<p>The Tinvoo also featured a pulse button, a welcome and unique feature to the unit. The pulse button allowed us to maximize our vacuum and remove as much air as possible past the point of the machine’s automatic pump. This was extremely helpful when sealing moisture-rich foods with our papel towel trick.</p>
<p>With 79% of its users on Amazon giving it five stars, we aren’t surprised it was our top pick as well. The negative reviews reported the unit quit after less than 20 uses. We put it through the paces and never had an issue. Many of the negative reviews did mention that the company replaced defective units promptly and with no hassle.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to save money and time with an excellent vacuum sealer that isn’t going to break the bank or eat up your counter space, then you’ll appreciate the simple and easy to use Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Our top vacuum sealer, the Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S, not only performed better than the other six food vacuum sealers, it featured a unique pulse button to get the best vacuum seal possible.</li>
<li>Small and lightweight, the Tinvoois easy to pack up and store or hang out on the counter without taking up too much space.</li>
<li>The manufacturer warranty is good and the company treats customers well.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DI342IW/?tag=ybdslr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FoodSaver &#8211; v4840</a> almost wins by default because as its name implies, it has a built-in handheld pump. This is a nice addition if you want to seal very large objects with compatible zipper bags. It also doubles as storage for your sealing bags roll and has a built-in slicer to cut custom-sized bags. This tried and true brand takes what’s good about the smaller FoodSaver &#8211; FM2000 and increases the power and improves the overall performance while adding plenty of additional features.</p>

<p>The size of the v4840 will pretty much assure it a permanent place on your kitchen counter. If you have the room, it’s definitely worth it. Having a bag roll storage and slicer built-into the unit makes it so that you won’t have to potentially hunt around your kitchen for bags.</p>
<p>The FoodSaver was also the only one on our picks to feature an automatic start. To begin suction, you feed the end of the bag into the bottom tray and the unit will begin the process once it detects the bag. The unit also has instructions and tips printed inside the storage container which are definitely helpful. The key to getting it to work quickly is to orient the bag so that the curve of the bag faces down.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The FoodSaver &#8211; v4840 is from a trusted and well-established brand that’s been making home use vacuum sealers for over 30 years.</li>
<li>The automatic start makes for a convenient operation and gives this vacuum sealer a little more ease of use, especially when vacuum sealing multiple items in one session.</li>
<li>It has great versatility, from years of design experience.</li>
<li>The large size accommodates bag roll storage making this ideal for those who have the counter space available and don’t mind having a permanent place for it.</li>
</ul>

<p>This little beauty, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSZVPJM/?tag=ybdslr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Geryon &#8211; E2800-C</a> was right up there with the winner. It had many of the same things going for it that we loved about our top pick. It was almost as fast, almost as powerful and was even smaller. We honestly enjoyed using it as much as the Tinvoo. It was extremely easy to clean and worked wonderfully.</p>
<p>It’s a great device for the home cook with little space in the kitchen as its small size makes it easy to move about and store. But it can also squeeze onto even the smallest amount of counter space. And its stainless steel look will complement plenty of other appliances.</p>
<p>Amazon users who purchased the product agreed, with 69% giving it a five-star rating. They also loved the ease of use and clean-up. Many said they appreciated how quiet the machine was during use.</p>

<p>Another entry from the most established brand in the market of food vacuum sealers, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D5TMBE0/?tag=ybdslr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Foodsaver &#8211; FM2000</a> unit worked well, offering a solid user experience while being much smaller than its bigger and more expensive older brother. Even though it was the loudest of the bunch we tested, it was still relatively quiet.</p>
<p>It doesn’t beat out our favorites, but it still performs admirably and has been well-received by daily users for years. It’s a fan favorite and is often found in the kitchens of those who love sous vide cooking.</p>
<p>The FM2000 finished second, after it’s bigger sibling, in how long it could be used continuously. So if you’re a hunter that will be needing longer sessions or someone who does winter storing in bulk, this is a great alternative to the very expensive commercial-grade vacuum sealers.</p>

<p>Another small and lightweight unit, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2HE2HD/?tag=ybdslr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NutriChef &#8211; PKVS18BK</a> put up very respectable numbers in all our tests. It had one of the most aesthetically pleasing designs of the bunch and would fit well in a modern-style kitchen.</p>
<p>The touchscreen-style buttons were a neat touch that made the device feel far more futuristic than the other units, giving it an air of sophistication. Its small size and performance make it a great all rounder as it had a very satisfying locking mechanism when we used it. This made multiple sessions easy and never left us double checking to ensure both sides were secure before sealing.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IUAK39A/?tag=ybdslr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nesco &#8211; VS-02</a> was the only other unit we tested to feature a built-in storage for bag rolls along with a slicer to help make precise cuts. Its larger size will be more at home as a permanent resident on your countertop, but it’s light enough to be portable as well should you want to keep it in the pantry.</p>
<p>For those that are new to vacuum sealing their food, this is a great start to see if you’re going to be spending the time to seal and store. It won’t break the bank and it will meet all the needs of the occasional sealer.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>When it comes to saving time and money in the kitchen, eliminating food waste is a crucial component to success. The best way to eliminate food waste is to extend shelf life, and a vacuum sealer is the best method for to so. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DWVVX5F/?tag=ybdslr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S</a> comes in as our top choice for its ability to quickly and powerfully vacuum seal food, allow for pulse adjustment and doing so while occupying very little counter space. While the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DI342IW/?tag=ybdslr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FoodSaver &#8211; V4840</a> was an excellent and versatile machine, the difference in price and the simple and easy to use and clean <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DWVVX5F/?tag=ybdslr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S</a> made it the best choice.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>orking with a professional chef, we tested five of the top electric smokers, smoking over 40 lbs of pork butt, 25 lbs of baby back ribs and 20 lbs of chicken.

<h2 class="collapse" id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>We began our research by reviewing the top-rated electric smokers on Amazon. From there, we compared those reviews with the recommendations made on dozens of online meat-smoking forums, such as The Smoke Ring, Smoked-Meat.com and SmokingPit.com. We also consulted with barbecue experts Jeff Phillips at Smoking-Meat.com, Steven Raichlen at Barbecue! Bible.com and Meathead Goldwyn at AmazingRibs.com to get pro tips on smoking.</p>
<p>The meat-smoking community is vast, the majority of which is based in the U.S. Midwest and South, and opinions are divided about electric smokers. Many barbecue professionals and enthusiasts profess that an electric smoker can’t give the finely balanced and nuanced smoke flavor that a charcoal grill can. However, they also admit that an electric smoker does indeed produce delicious food.</p>
<p>We refined our selection to the electric smokers that were durable, reliable, sturdily-constructed, easy to clean and user-friendly, especially for the beginner. We also gave extra points if the smoker’s manufacturer had a long-term warranty and helpful customer service.</p>

<h2 class="collapse" id="types-of-smokers">Types of electric smokers</h2>
<p>There are four types of smokers you can buy: electric, charcoal, propane and wood pellets.</p>
<p><b>Charcoal smokers:</b> The most commonly used smokers for enthusiasts and barbecue competitions are charcoal fueled. Charcoal smokers generally come in three shapes and sizes: an upright cabinet (like a mini-refrigerator), upright bullet (oval or egg-shaped) and horizontal (similar to a propane grill).</p>
<p>The charcoal slowly burns wood chunks or water-soaked wood chips, which are arranged around and on top of the charcoal. In a vertical smoker, the smoke is funneled upward to the meat; in a horizontal smoker, the smoke is funneled across the meat. These smokers require frequent maintenance of the charcoal during a typical four-hour smoking period to regulate heat and smoke.</p>
<p><b>Wood pellet smokers:</b> These are horizontal electric smokers that are fueled by cylindrical wood pellets, which are automatically fed from a hopper into a burn pot. When the smoker is ignited, an electric rod in the bottom of the burn pot heats the pellets to smoking. Both the heat and smoke can be regulated so they are evenly distributed inside the smoker. Pellet smokers have increased in popularity, but they’re expensive.</p>
<p><b>Propane smokers:</b> These are vertical, lightweight cabinets that are fueled by propane and are designed for easy portability to campsites. The propane fuels a burner that ignites wood chips or chunks to smoking. Heat and smoke can be regulated by adjusting how much propane flows from the propane tank. Propane smokers are relatively inexpensive, but their narrow size limits food capacity, and they generally perform poorly in cold or windy weather.</p>
<p><b>Electric smokers:</b> These are built for beginners who want to smoke meats without the fuss of a charcoal smoker. Electric smokers are vertical cabinets with a heating element in the bottom of the cabinet. Wood chips are loaded into a vented metal box, which sits atop the heating element. The heating element is programmed to the desired temperature, which is automatically maintained by an internal thermostat. In the better models, the smoke can be regulated by a damper at the top of the cabinet.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="how-a-smoker-works">How an electric smoker works</h2>
<p>Electric smokers can be either analog or digital. Analog smokers are controlled by an on/off switch and a manual thermostat. Digital smokers are push-button on/off with a digitally programmed temperature setting. (Some have a digital timer as well.)</p>
<p>After the smoker has preheated, the wood chips are loaded, and they begin to smoke in about 15 minutes. The meat is then loaded onto the racks and the thermostat lowered for slow cooking. Depending on the weight and cut of the meat, this can take 90 minutes to three or four hours. The best electric smokers are well-insulated so when the door is locked, no smoke can escape except through a tube or damper at the top or side of the cabinet.</p>
<p>Wood chips smoke for approximately 30 minutes. Depending on how much smoke flavor you want, more chips can be added at intervals by opening the cabinet (in most cases, front-loading) and refilling the wood chip box.</p>
<p>The majority of electric smokers have a water bowl, which is filled to a prescribed level before the heating element is turned on. The water provides moisture inside the cabinet to prevent the meat from drying out as it smokes and cooks.</p>
<p>Some digital smokers have an internal meat probe (inserted when the meat is loaded onto the racks), which automatically shuts the smoker off when the meat’s programmed internal temperature is reached. If there is no internal meat probe, then the meat’s temperature needs to be checked manually to assure it is fully cooked.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="how-to">How to smoke meat</h2>
<h3>The science of smoking meat</h3>
<p>The method for preserving and flavoring meat by smoking dates back to the primitive era. All red meats are composed of muscle, fat and connective tissue, such as collagen. Some cuts have higher percentages of fat and connective tissue, so they need to be cooked at lower and slower temperatures for a longer period to dissolve and thus tenderize the meat.</p>
<p>If the animal’s muscle was exercised regularly &#8211; for example, the leg or thigh &#8211; there will be a higher content of connective tissue, which makes the meat tough. If less exercised &#8211; like the tenderloin &#8211; the meat will have less connective tissue and will need minimal cooking to be tender.</p>
<p>The gas chemicals released from hardwood smoking, combined with a low cooking temperature (between 225-250 °F), break down the meat’s connective tissue, As the fat and collagen dissolve, they moisten and tenderize the meat. It’s a technique that’s similar to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/braising-and-stewing-techniques-and-tips-995847" target="_blank" rel="noopener">braising</a>, but smoking also creates a rich brown exterior layer, known as the Maillard Reaction, cherished by meat-smoking enthusiasts.</p>
<p>The interior pink layer beneath the browned surface of smoked meats is known as the <b>smoke ring</b>, which is a result of the wood’s released gasses binding with the meat’s water composition. This chemical reaction creates a pink ring, usually ¼-inch deep, that indicates the smoke has penetrated the meat. In the barbecue world, achieving that perfect pink ring just beneath the crusty “bark” (exterior) of smoked meat is <a href="https://barbecuebible.com/2014/07/11/science-smoke-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered the hallmark </a>of a barbecue master.</p>

<p>The rule of thumb for what woods to use for smoking meat is that it should be a hardwood, like oak, apple or maple. Any conifer, such as pine, redwood or cedar, should be avoided, since they release toxins when heated, and the smoke can taint the meat.</p>
<p>Fruit and nut tree woods add a mild and sweet flavor and are great for chicken and fish. Hardier woods, such as hickory and mesquite, produce bold and rich flavors, so you want to use a meat that can hold up to their strong smokiness, like beef and lamb.</p>
<p>Hickory is used most often for smoking bacon. It’s an aggressive flavor that you might not want for a loin or chop. Smoking forums recommend nut and fruit woods, such as pecan or pear, which give a milder smoke flavor to chicken and pork.</p>
<p>You could also try blending different woods; for example 70 percent apple wood with 30 percent mesquite. When it comes down to it, you can experiment and dictate the smoke’s flavor to your personal taste.</p>
<h3>Wood chips v. bisquettes</h3>
<p>The wood used for electric smokers can be either wood chips or bisquettes. They are available in an extensive variety of hardwoods.</p>

<p><b>Wood chips</b></p>
<p>The majority of electric smokers on the market use wood chips, which are readily available online or in hardware and barbecue stores. A small portion of wood chips is loaded into the smoker’s wood-chip box, which is set on top of the heating element.</p>
<p>Overall the smokers we tested use dry wood chips only. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JGF97D0/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Masterbuilt,</a> however, allows you the choice of either dry chips &#8211; for an intense smoke and flavor &#8211; or soaked chips &#8211; for less smoke and a lighter flavor. After about 30 minutes, the wood chips cease smoking and burn to black shards or ash. If you want more smoke flavor, you would add another portion of chips, and continue to do so until the meat is fully cooked.</p>

<p><b>Bisquettes</b></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bradleysmoker.com/product/bradley-original-electric-food-smoker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bradley Original Smoker</a> is one of the few electric smokers that uses bisquettes, which are discs about two inches in diameter and one-half-inch thick, composed primarily of compactly pressed sawdust. The bisquettes burn for approximately 20 minutes, and they produce a milder smoke than wood chips.</p>
<p>Bradley Smoker is the only manufacturer of the bisquettes (the method is a closely guarded secret), and they sell plain hardwoods and hardwoods flavored with herbs or beer.</p>
<p>Bisquettes are more expensive than wood chips, and several smoking forums and videos will instruct you on how to make your own. It’s an involved process that requires woodworking skills, but the forum contributors claim that their DIY bisquettes cost pennies and burn the same as the Bradley Smoker bisquettes.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Digital vs. analog: </b>Two of the five smokers we tested were digital &#8211; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JGF97D0/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Masterbuilt</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SMRXYCE/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Char-Broil</a> &#8211; and they were the easiest to program temperature and time settings. There is a slight difference in price between the digital and analog models, but paying more for a digital model for its ease in programming is worth it.</p>
<p>An exception is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002VGE36S/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smokin&#8217;-It #1</a>, which is nearly twice the price of our top pick, the Masterbuilt, but it stands out as a superior analog model.</p>
<p><b>Cabinet material:</b> The cabinets of the two best-performing models, Masterbuilt and Smokin&#8217;-It #1, are made of reinforced high-grade stainless steel, which proved very effective in retaining smoke and moisture and were much easier to clean than the other smokers made of lower-grade steel.</p>
<p><b>Door lock and seal: </b>The rubber gasket lining the smoker door isn’t enough for sealing the door. A strong lock is essential for heat and smoke retention, and each of the smokers we tested had a different type with a wide variance of effectiveness.</p>
<p>Smokin&#8217;-It #1 doesn’t have any gasket, but its heavy-duty latch system uses a compression fit that tightly seals the door. We experienced the worst smoke leakage with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000Y1RNFK/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smoke Hollow &#8211; 30162E</a>, which had a thin gasket and a small, weak latch that barely held the cabinet door shut.</p>
<p><b>Internal meat probe: </b>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SMRXYCE/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Char-Broil</a> was the only smoker we tested that had a built-in programmable meat probe, and it was accurate in gauging the meat’s internal temperature. For the other smokers we needed to manually check the meat’s internal temperature at intervals. Remote control meat probes are not expensive, so we recommend purchasing one if it is not included in the smoker.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Seasoning the smoker</h3>
<p>Before testing could begin, we needed to “season” the electric smokers. In this case, seasoning doesn’t mean applying herbs and spices to the meat. It’s a preliminary preheating of the smoker that burns off any residue from manufacturing, packing and shipping. Because there are potentially toxic substances, such as paint and machine oil, clinging to the inner cabinet’s walls, it’s essential to season your smoker before you smoke any food.</p>
<p>When seasoning a cast iron skillet, you apply a thin coat of oil and then heat the skillet in a hot oven. The oil bakes into the skillet and leaves a protective coating, which then allows you to simply wipe the skillet clean without soap and water.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to seasoning an electric smoker. It’s a simple process. The smoker is heated to 275 °F for three hours, and wood chips are inserted for the last 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Other cooks on forums advise applying a thin coat of oil to the inner cabinet’s walls, which, after heating, leaves a protective finish. However, except for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000Y1RNFK/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smoke Hollow</a>, instruction manuals for the smokers we tested did not recommend oiling their cabinets before heating.</p>
<p>We followed Smoke Hollow’s manual and seasoned the cabinet with canola oil. After we completing our testing, we discovered that the cabinet was permanently stained and impossible to clean.</p>

<p>We wanted to smoke meats that represented the most popular types and cuts people cook, so we could get a good feel for results with each machine.</p>
<p>Beef brisket and pork ribs are undoubtedly the most popular meats that people smoke. Brisket, however, is <a href="http://www.thesmokerking.com/page1a.html#.WdvXJWhSzIU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered something of an art form</a> in barbecue. The cut and quality of the brisket, its preparation, smoking time and whether the smoker is fueled by wood, charcoal or propane affect the quality of the finished smoked meat.</p>
<p>Pork ribs, pork butt (for pulled pork) and chicken need less preparation and minimal attendance during smoking, which would allow us to continually monitor how well or poorly the smoker was functioning.</p>

<p>Debates rage among BBQ cooks and enthusiasts about when and if to slather a wet sauce (or mop) over ribs or chickens before and during smoking. We decided that a wet sauce would disguise how each of the smokers flavored the meats, so we opted for a dry rub.</p>
<p>Similar to a marinade, a dry rub needs to be applied several hours &#8211; if not a full night &#8211; before you smoke the meats. A major component of a dry rub is salt, which penetrates deeper than a marinade does and intensely flavors the interior of the meat the longer you keep it on.</p>
<p>We scoured online forums for the best dry-rub recipes for pork butt, pork ribs and chicken. They all have ingredients in common &#8211; salt, pepper, paprika, sugar and garlic &#8211; but they differ in proportions. Paprika adds almost no discernible flavor and simply colors the meats the beautiful burnished brown desired by meat-smoking enthusiasts.</p>
<p>We used the following dry rub recipes for our testing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/north-carolina-pulled-pork-242247" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pork butt</a></li>
<li><a href="https://barbecuebible.com/recipe/memphis-style-ribs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pork ribs</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/patrick-and-gina-neely/applewood-smoked-chicken-recipe-1945085" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicken</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>U.S.D.A. recommendations</h3>
<p>Since smoking involves cooking meats at low temperatures, the U.S. Department of Agriculture advises certain precautions for avoiding illness from food contamination, which we adhered to during our testing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thaw meat in the refrigerator, never at room temperature.</li>
<li>Once the meat is thawed, apply the dry rub and let it marinate in the refrigerator, never on the counter.</li>
<li>Use two thermometers when smoking meats, one for the smoker itself and the second for monitoring the meat’s internal temperature. All of the smokers we tested had thermostats, but we also used an oven thermometer to compare the accuracy of the smokers’ thermostats. We maintained the smoker temperature at 225-240 °F. (The U.S.D.A advises no lower than 225 °F.)</li>
<li>Cook pork to the internal temperature of 145 °F and chicken to 165 °F.  We frequently checked internal temperatures with an instant-read thermometer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Texture and flavor</h3>
<p>We followed the U.S.D.A. recommendations for internal temperatures, and the chicken was fully cooked in 90 minutes, the pork ribs in two hours and the pork butt in three to three-and-one-half hours. Next, we let the chicken and pork ribs rest 30 minutes and the pork butt 45 minutes before slicing so the juices could be reabsorbed into the meat.</p>
<p>Overall, the chicken was the most successful. Each of the smokers produced a well-seasoned, tender and juicy chicken with a crisp and richly browned skin. We smoked the chicken with applewood, and generally, the smoke flavor was light. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002VGE36S/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smokin&#8217;-It</a>’s chicken was exceedingly juicy, but the skin had a strong smoke flavor, which we didn’t find appealing.</p>
<p>We had mixed results with the pork ribs and pork butt. All the smokers gave us flavorful and nicely smoked pork, but tenderness and juiciness were inconsistent. The Masterbuilt and Smokin&#8217;-It gave us the best pork butt, and Smokin&#8217;-It’s ribs were superior to the rest.</p>
<h3>Cleanup</h3>

<p>During the smoking and cooking process, the meat’s fats and connective tissue melt and splatter inside the smoker’s cabinet and onto the racks, drip pan, wood-chip holder and water bowl. The grease &#8211; deeply colored by the dry rub sugar and seasonings &#8211; and the soot produced by the burning wood stain the smoker. Smoker enthusiasts often refer to this stain as the “patina.&#8221; Even with proper curing, your smoker will never look like new again.</p>
<p>Manufacturers advise simply wiping the smokers down with paper towels, but we did not find this was the most effective way to clean the baked-on grease and soot. Cleaning products are too abrasive and can destroy the smoker’s “patina”, so after some research, we found the best cleaner to be a 50-50 solution of distilled vinegar and water.</p>
<p>Masterbuilt’s reinforced, high-gauge stainless steel prevented staining and the vinegar-water solution was effective in dissolving the greasy splatter. The smoke slightly burnished the cabinet, but in this case, it actually was a patina. Smokin&#8217;-It had minor staining, but it was also very easy to clean.</p>

<p>For convenience, ease of use and consistent results, we recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JGF97D0/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Masterbuilt &#8211; 20071117 </a>as the best electric smoker overall. Right out of the box, we knew we had a winner. The smoker cabinet is well-constructed and sturdy, and the few pieces that needed to be installed &#8211; cabinet feet, digital read-out, shelves, water bowl and drip-pan &#8211; were individually and meticulously packaged. The assembly was a snap, taking all of 15 minutes.</p>
<p>The Masterbuilt comes with four chrome-plated shelves (approximately 14 inches by 16 inches each), which, according to their website, can hold a total of 80 pounds of meat. However, the internal cooking space of the cabinet is 721 square inches and can realistically fit only 40 pounds of meat. We do not recommend crowding more than 40 pounds since it could hinder both cooking and smoking.</p>
<p>As with all the smokers, the Masterbuilt needed to be seasoned by heating the cabinet to 275 °F  for three hours. The digital display is user-friendly, and setting the temperature and timer are simple. We tested the accuracy of all the smokers with an oven thermometer, and the Masterbuilt’s built-in thermostat was on-the-nose accurate.</p>
<p>The smoker has a patented side-loading wood chip feeder, which allows you to add more chips without opening the cabinet’s front door and releasing heat and smoke. The wood chips (only ½ cup) are placed in the loader, which you then insert into a hole near the bottom of the cabinet. With a slight twist of the wrist, the loader dumps the chips into a tray on top of the heating element, and they begin to smoke within 15 minutes.</p>

Also, its reinforced high-gauge stainless-steel cabinet makes it exceptionally easy to wipe clean.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JGF97D0/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The chips stop smoking after about 45 minutes, which was enough time to thoroughly smoke and flavor chicken and pork ribs. (Cooking took another 45 minutes.) The pork butt needed double the time to smoke, so for the butt, we loaded an additional ½ cup of chips half-way through the three-hour smoking time. The loader only holds ½ cup of wood chips, so if you prefer a more smoked meat, you can add chips each time the prior load stops smoking.</p>
<p>All of the meats we smoked were beautifully browned, lightly smoked and delicious. What set the Masterbuilt apart from the others, however, is the exceptional moistness and tenderness of the smoked meats, especially the pork butt, which could be sliced as a juicy roast or easily shredded for pulled pork.</p>
<p>Cleaning the smoker couldn’t be easier. Due to the reinforced high-gauge stainless steel cabinet, smoke and grease didn’t stain it as deeply and permanently as they did with the other smokers.</p>
<p>Finally, the Masterbuilt is very affordable. The current price on Amazon as of this writing puts the Masterbuilt considerably lower than the other smokers we tested and just a few dollars higher than the much inferior Smoke Hollow. For such a superior product, the Masterbuilt’s value simply cannot be beat.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Masterbuilt &#8211; 20071117 is an incredible value for its many features, such as user-friendly digital programming, a perfectly calibrated internal thermostat and evenly distributed heating.</li>
<li>Its patented side-loading chip feeder allows you to add wood chips without opening the cabinet door and releasing heat and smoke.</li>
<li>The Masterbuilt was the only electric smoker we tested that gave us consistently tender and juicy meats with well-balanced smoke flavor.</li>
<li>The cabinet’s 720-square-inch interior allows you to smoke 40 pounds of meat at one time.</li>
<li>Its high-grade stainless steel cabinet prevents permanent staining and is easy to clean and maintain.</li>

<p>Our runner up, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002VGE36S/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smokin’-It &#8211; Model #1</a>, is the smallest model of the Smokin’-It electric smokers, which are known for their high-end construction, thoughtful design and features that no other electric smokers have, such as a compression-fit door latch and heavy-duty casters, sturdy side handles and extra-long 12-foot power cord for easy portability.</p>
<p>As with the Masterbuilt, the Smokin&#8217;-It #1 needed virtually no assembly, and once the casters and interior parts were installed, it was ready to be seasoned with the hickory blocks that were included with the smoker.</p>
<p>The  Smokin’-It #1 is a 13”x17”x12” box, entirely made of heavy-gauge stainless steel. Although its internal capacity (468 square inches) is less than the other smokers we tested, there’s still plenty of space to smoke a couple of chickens or a medium-size turkey.</p>
<p>The wood-chip housing slides over the heating element, which evenly distributes the chips across the depth of the cabinet. The efficient rheostat accurately heats the smoker up to 250 °F, and the heavy-duty latch system securely seals the smoker’s door by a compression fit so there is no dissipation of heat or smoke.</p>
<p>Although there are virtually no instructions for operation included, you can find plenty of information on Smokin&#8217;-It’s website. One suggestion is to line the smoker with foil for easier clean-up. This was unusual advice, since other smokers warned that doing so could cause irregular heating. The foil, however, had no effect on how the Smokin&#8217;-It distributed heat in our testing, and cleaning up afterward was indeed a cinch.</p>

<p>Unlike the other smokers we tested, a water tray isn’t required. According to the Smokin&#8217;-It forum, the cabinet is 90-percent air-tight, which substantially diminishes the meat’s natural moisture from evaporating. We were skeptical, but both the chicken and pork butt were exceedingly juicy and the baby back ribs were the best of all the ribs we smoked in the other smokers.</p>
<p>The Smokin&#8217;-It #1 is certainly a quality product, but it’s $170 more than our top pick, the Masterbuilt &#8211; 20071117.  However, the company’s three-year warranty for parts and workmanship and the smoker’s unique certification by NSF International for commercial kitchen use could be incentives for spending more for this electric smoker.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sturdily constructed of high-gauge stainless steel with a compression-fit door seal, Smokin&#8217;-It #1, is the only electric smoker to be NSF-certified for commercial kitchen use.</li>
<li>It’s compact design, sturdy side handles, heavy-duty casters and 12-foot power cord allow for easy mobility, even to campsites where an electrical outlet is available.</li>
<li>The Smokin’-It is more expensive than other smokers, but its high-end craftsmanship and a unique three-year warranty for parts and labor are worth the price.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since our review, Bradley made a minor change to their BTIS1 model by moving a heat control knob from the door to the generator panel. But other than that the <a href="https://www.bradleysmoker.com/product/bradley-original-electric-food-smoker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bradley Original Smoker &#8211; BS601</a> is exactly the same. The Bradley performed well, but as we noted earlier, it uses compressed-sawdust bisquettes, which can be costly, considering how many the smoker burns through in one smoke session.</p>
<p>The Bradley is different from the other smokers in that the smoke generator and the main cabinet are not integrated and are joined together by two power cords. Initially, the cabinet wasn’t heating properly, so we contacted the company’s excellent customer service who helped resolve the issue by advising us to simply “jam in” the power cords. (We did, and it worked!)</p>
<p>The bisquettes are automatically advanced through a feed hole from the smoke generator into the cabinet one at a time every 20 minutes. As the next bisquette pushes through, the charred remains of the previous bisquette fall into a water bowl. The generator reliably advanced the bisquettes, but during our testing, the charred bisquettes backed up and spilled over the water bowl onto the drip pan.</p>
<p>The generator also controls regulation of heat, and although the thermostat registers 300 °F, even turned up high, the smoker struggled to hit 250 °F.</p>
<p>Ribs smoked in the Bradley were alternately dry and moist, but both the pork butt and chicken were evenly cooked, juicy and lightly smoked. However, whereas the Bradley’s pork butt sliced beautifully as a roast, it wasn’t as shreddable for pulled pork as it had been in the Masterbuilt and Smokin’-It tests.</p>
<p>The Bradley’s internal cabinet is lined with polished chrome, and from the middle of the cabinet upward, it was relatively easy to clean and restore its mirror-like sheen. The bottom half of the cabinet, however, was stained by smoke, which could not be removed.</p>

<p>We got mixed results from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SMRXYCE/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Char-Broil &#8211; Deluxe Digital</a>. It’s equipped with some great features, such as a digital timer, thermostat, remote control and internal meat probe, The meat probe, in particular, as we noted above, is especially handy, since you can program the smoker to shut off when the meat reaches the desired internal temperature. We double-checked internal temperatures with an instant-read thermometer, and the Char-Broil was always accurate.</p>
<p>The instruction manual advises how much to fill the wood-chip box for smoking time. For example, one-quarter filled for two-to-four hours, which did not prove accurate since the chips were blackened shards that had ceased smoking after 90 minutes.</p>
<p>The Char-Broil produced beautifully colored and nicely smoked chicken, but both the pork butt and ribs were chewy. We resorted to wrapping them in foil and cooking them longer to achieve the results we got from the other smokers we tested.</p>
<p>Clean-up was challenging and messy. The removable pieces can be soaked in hot soapy water, but the cabinet and tempered-glass door are difficult to clean without using harsh cleaners and a lot of elbow grease.</p>
<h3>Smoke Hollow &#8211; 30162E</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000Y1RNFK/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smoke Hollow &#8211; 30162E </a>was trouble from the get-go. First, it needed to be completely assembled, which was difficult due to improperly bored holes and bolts pre-tightened too tightly. The puny door latch couldn’t sufficiently seal the cabinet, so smoke seeped out throughout the smoking process.</p>
<p>During our tests, black greasy liquid dripped from the bottom corners. We inspected the cabinet and discovered its inner aluminum lining had buckled, another factor attesting to the smoker’s shoddy build.</p>
<p>The Smoke Hollow’s temperature regulator is erratic, and since the smoker’s flimsy temperature gauge broke early on, we needed to manually monitor the cabinet throughout the smoking process to ensure a low temperature was maintained.</p>
<p>As to results, the chicken and ribs had good smoked flavor, but were dry. The pork butt could be sliced, but even after four hours, it was still not tender enough to shred for pulled pork.</p>
<p>Clean-up was even more challenging that it had been for the Char-Broil, especially in the corners where the black grease had collected underneath the cabinet’s buckled lining.</p>
<p>After our tests, we thought we might have received a dud or it had been damaged in shipping, but we re-reviewed comments on Amazon and saw many customers experienced the same issues we had with the Smoke Hollow that they had purchased.</p>
<p>Smoke Hollow is slightly less expensive than the other smokers we tested, but it’s cheaply made and not worth the price.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Hardline barbecuers probably aren’t going to change their opinion of electric smokers. But for the rest of us, electric smokers really do give great smoked meats that a professional might be hard-pressed to challenge.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the most reliable, durable and best-value electric smoker is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JGF97D0/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Masterbuilt &#8211; 20071117</a>, which will give you evenly smoked and cooked meats that are mouth-watering, succulent and delicious. Its numerous features &#8211; user-friendly digital programming, accurate thermostat, patented side-loading chip feeder &#8211; put the Masterbuilt ahead of the other smokers we tested.</p>
<p>If you want to spend a bit more money on a high-quality smoker, then we recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002VGE36S/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smokin&#8217;-It #1</a>. It’s the only electric smoker that’s been NSF-certified for commercial kitchen use, and the manufacturer’s three-year warranty for parts and workmanship simply can’t be beat.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After slicing dozens of apples, puréeing pints of strawberries to dry and trying a gamut of dried treats, we found the LEM 1152 to be the best food dehydrator.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter slicing a small harvest of apples, puréeing seven pints of strawberries and experimenting with a gamut of other dried treats, we’ve determined that the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B014IK804K/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> LEM Products &#8211; 1152</a> is the best food dehydrator for home users. It’s versatile, with a design and features that make it easier to operate than the competition. Plus, it dried very consistently in our tests. If you’re only looking for a dehydrator so you can make a bit of fruit leather and small batches of interesting things you find on your raw-food Pinterest board, the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012CG8N26/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Hamilton Beach &#8211; 32100A</a> is quite a bit louder than the LEM but takes up less counter space and comes at a fraction of the cost.</p>

<p>To put it mildly, our test team was unprepared for the range of opinions and demands that exists in the world of food dehydrating. Between raw diets, paleo diets, prepping, backpacking and people collecting garden herbs, there isn’t just one way to use a dehydrator.</p>
<p>In addition to our chats with raw food chef Jenny Ross and food safety expert <a href="https://fbns.ncsu.edu/faculty-directory/dana-j-hanson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Dana Hanson</a>, we looked at an abundance of consumer content. We studied reviews on Amazon, Reddit discussions, YouTube reviews and we even looked hard at life-hack dehydrator alternatives like microwaves and box fans. Both will work, but neither will replace the convenience and performance of a good dehydrator if you want to dry food on a regular basis.</p>
<p>We also looked at reviews of more expensive, high-capacity dehydrators, like Jenny Ross’s favorite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GUR325W/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tribest Sedona</a> and the Stainless-steel-bodied dehydrators from companies like LEM, STX, and Excalibur; they look like great products and may be worth investigating if you want to use a dehydrator commercially or if you’re making literally all of your food in one, but fundamentally those more expensive machines work the same way as the less expensive models we tested.</p>
<p>Warranty information and reliability reports were considered, and we chose manufacturers that had good reputations, but at the end of the day quality control is never a sure thing: every manufacturer had some reviews from customers who saw parts or assembly issues that gave them pause.</p>

<h2>Why use a dehydrator?</h2>
<p>Anyone with a productive zucchini plant or apple tree probably already knows: when gardening, a preservation plan is the difference between enjoying the fruit of your labor and tossing a good portion of it into the compost pile.</p>
<p>Preservation isn’t the only reason to use a dehydrator. Fruit that’s sliced or puréed and then dried makes for amazing snacks, like banana chips or strawberry leather. Almost all of the flavor of ripe fruit remains, but concentrated and without any sticky mess. (Backpackers love dehydrators, some even dry out cooked food — like chili or soup — so it’ll be easier to prepare on the trail.)</p>
<p>It’s not just about snacks, either. Those who eschew cooking to preserve the enzymes in raw or ‘living’ food can accomplish amazing things with a dehydrator. Believe it or not, our research turned up raw-food recipes for cracker-like dried breads, desserts, wraps, pizza&#8230; you can even make raw-vegan pancakes!</p>
<p>Dehydrators are machines dedicated to speeding up the drying process with forced air and electric heating elements. Handy trays, temperature control and built-in timers also help make the work easier.</p>
<p>Most literature on home preservation of food recommends that you try to eat all of your home-dried food within a year (spoilage can still happen with unexpected moisture and heat over time), but there’s really no limit on how long it could last in the right storage conditions. (Fruit cake has been known to keep for centuries.)</p>

<h3>Air flow direction</h3>
<p>The biggest difference in dehydrator designs is the way air passes among the trays: horizontally or vertically. Each design <em>will</em> successfully dry food, though consistency and ease of use may vary from one machine to another.</p>
<p>Horizontal flow (like our top pick) means a big box and a big fan blowing across trays that will slide in and out of the box (very much like a small convection oven, but with way more airflow and less heat). A horizontal airflow design means that there is fresh air coming off the fan hitting each tray directly. (You can also take some trays out to get more space for large items.)</p>
<p>Vertical flow (like our budget pick) means a fan at the bottom (or top, in the case of Nesco’s “Converge-a-Flow” system) with trays in a stack. Stacking designs capitalize on the way hot air naturally rises, so (theoretically) the fan doesn’t need to work as hard to do the same job. You can also buy extra trays and simply add them to the stack to increase the machine’s capacity.</p>
<p>There are downsides to each design. The horizontal-flow systems take up more counter space, while the stacking designs always have a vent hole in the middle of the tray that does require creativity when drying some items — sheets of cracker or fruit leather, for example, will have a circle cut out in the middle.</p>
<h3>Capacity</h3>

<p>How much you can dry in one go is the biggest variable when selecting a specific dehydrator model.</p>
<p>You can technically get more capacity for less money with a vertical stack, since additional trays cost less than an additional machine. Each of those trays is still going to be relatively small compared to the trays in a horizontal-flow machine, though, and any concerns about uneven drying will only get worse with more trays in a vertical stack.</p>

<p>If you need even more capacity, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HVJOBC6/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Excalibur</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B014IK804K/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LEM</a> sell machines with nine or ten trays compared to the five-tray designs we tested — of course, that makes the machines taller and more expensive. They come with larger fans and heating elements, so you’ll get similar drying performance to the five-tray models, unlike the just-add-trays philosophy of stacking machines.</p>
<h3>Controls</h3>
<p>There are a few control features that can add convenience to dehydrator operation. A thermostat is essential if you want any control at all over drying speed on different types and sizes of food items, while a timer doesn’t really change the way the machine works (it just means the machine won’t run forever if you forget about it.)</p>
<p>All the models we tested aside from one have a timer, and they all had some kind of thermostat (some digital, some analog.) Some can be purchased for less money if you don’t want a timer, or at rock-bottom prices if you only want one temperature (typically those are stuck wide-open at 160 °F, which is too hot for herbs or delicate veggies.)</p>
<h3>Accessories</h3>
<p>The machines we tested came with a wide gamut of accessory types, but the comparison isn’t always apples-to-apples.</p>
<p>The Excalibur and L’Equip dehydrators come with a removable mesh liner for each tray, which seems like a big bonus. The trays on most machines don’t actually need a mesh liner unless you’re drying seeds or small berries. The spacing of the grid is close enough that anything bigger than a grape won’t fall through.</p>
<p>In fact, in the tests we ran, the Excalibur was the only machine with trays that really needed a mesh “easy-clean” liner to keep food from falling through. If you’re drying fruit that’s super-sticky (candied fruit, for example) the liners might be easy to scrub, but you’ll need to wash off the trays themselves one way or the other.</p>
<p>Fruit leather trays from the manufacturer are a must-have if you want to make roll-ups in a stacking machine with a hole in the middle of each tray, but with broad square trays in the horizontal-flow machines, a sheet of greased parchment paper will do an even better job than purpose-built trays (since most people will use parchment paper to roll up fruit leather for storage anyhow.)</p>
<h2 id="raw-food-drying">A note for raw food drying</h2>
<p>Raw or “living” food diets typically call for preparation without heating past 118 °F, to preserve enzymes and other beneficial organisms or nutrients. For some guidance regarding the specialized needs of a raw-food diet, we reached out to a local raw-food restaurateur and cookbook author, <a href="http://href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Jenny-Ross/e/B004KUJKJS/?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ybddehy-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=c40fa8e34b67114ff79e15db6552ea3b&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jenny Ross</a>.</p>
<p>Jenny notes that while an accurate thermostat system is a crucial part of a dehydrator, drying temperature is a bit more complicated than the time/temperature you deal with when baking or roasting:</p>
<p><em>“What you have to understand is that the dehydrator is simply moving warm air over your food item. You are actually dealing with three temperatures: the temperature of that warm air [coming off the heating element], the internal temperature of the food product itself, and the ambient temperature of the air which is affected by the moisture release of the food product you are drying.”</em></p>
<p>All this means that drying will happen differently depending on the thickness of the food, texture of the food, and how much water it starts with.</p>
<p><em>“Wraps, for example, are very finicky. If your goal is a culinary masterpiece you want a dehydrator that holds its temperature accurately overall. Dehydrators with a solid construction are the number one thing I look for, number two is the drying technology: can it hold a solid temperature for the whole dehydrating process?”</em></p>

<p>We checked the weight of the top tray, bottom tray and the total net load that went into each machine before we started. We checked weights and temperatures for each machine after one, three, five and seven hours of drying. We checked both the air around the food and the internal temperatures of the items with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B018QHQSB8/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">beaded-wire K-type probe</a>. Once the food has dried it’s very difficult to get a probe inside, and the fruit leather is really too thin to begin with, so in those cases we switched to a surface reading with an infrared thermometer.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5923" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appletest_airtemptest-1.jpg" alt="apple air temp. testing" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appletest_airtemptest-1.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appletest_airtemptest-1-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appletest_airtemptest-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appletest_airtemptest-1-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appletest_airtemptest-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appletest_airtemptest-1-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appletest_airtemptest-1-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appletest_airtemptest-1-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appletest_airtemptest-1-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appletest_airtemptest-1-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The results are as follows:</p>
<h3>Percentage dry</h3>
<p>This is the percentage of the water-mass removed from the total mass of the food we put in the machine after seven hours. (The <a href="http://nchfp.uga.edu/how/dry/pack_store.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Center for Home Preservation says to aim for an 80% reduction for fruit</a>, and seven hours is within the expected drying time — which will vary depending on ambient humidity.)</p>
<h3>Evenness</h3>
<p>This is a measure of how consistently the fruit dried on the trays in a machine (for stacking machines, this is the weight difference between top/bottom; for the horizontal flow machines we chose the second and fifth trays because the middle three trays are closest to the heating element).</p>
<p>Note that in the apple test there were a few machines that had between four and six slices that were notably wetter than the rest on the same tray after the seven hour mark (wet enough that we separated them from the rest of the batch to prevent spoilage when we bagged everything). We’ve deducted 5% from the consistency score for those machines.</p>
<h3>Temperature Accuracy</h3>
<p>This is an indicator of how close the machine stayed, on average, to the temperature we set on the thermostat. Readings are averaged between two trays, which were checked with a dry-bulb test (bare probe in the airstream) for three minutes each time we checked the machines. Most of the machines cycled up and down over the course of a few minutes.</p>
<p>We tried three different dehydrator recipes for our tests:</p>
<p><strong>Fruit leather</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5906" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fruitleather_mangorollup2.jpg" alt="dried mango fruit leather" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fruitleather_mangorollup2.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fruitleather_mangorollup2-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fruitleather_mangorollup2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fruitleather_mangorollup2-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fruitleather_mangorollup2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fruitleather_mangorollup2-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fruitleather_mangorollup2-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fruitleather_mangorollup2-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fruitleather_mangorollup2-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fruitleather_mangorollup2-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>For each machine we took a 1lb basket of strawberries, cleaned them and removed any brown spots, then puréed with a few apple slices and a lemon wedge thrown in. The purée was poured into greased trays if included with the dehydrator, or onto greased parchment paper if they weren’t. (Rolling the leather with parchment paper is the best way to store fruit leather anyway.)</p>

<p>For the fruit leather test, we divided the purée for the LEM and Excalibur machines into top/middle/bottom; there was definitely quicker drying near the heating element in the back-middle of the machine, but by the end of drying the top and bottom, the two were basically the same and consistency was very good overall in the horizontal-flow machines. For the other tests, we checked top and bottom and found that the consistency was quite good in all of the machines except the L’Equip.</p>
<p>In the L’Equip FIlter Pro the bottom tray was very brittle even before the top tray was finished drying. It took some soaking to get most of the baked-on fruit off that tray, even though we greased it before we poured the purée in. The Filter Pro can put out enough heat to dry fruit leather, but the fan doesn’t seem big enough to circulate that heat evenly.</p>

<p>We used almost 20 pounds of fairly large granny smith apples, cleaned and sliced about 1/4” thick with an electric slicer to maintain uniformity. The slices went straight from the slicer to the dehydrator rack. After drying for seven hours at 140 °F, the result was (in most cases) tart and chewy with just the right amount of sweetness!</p>
<p>Many recipes suggest adding cinnamon, honey, or pre-treating in ascorbic acid (vitamin C) to help prevent browning; our slices dried quickly enough that we didn’t see much browning and we liked the ‘raw’ taste. Apples are easy to dry and provide a broad canvas with which to experiment!</p>

<p>We used the classic Worcestershire-and-soy-sauce jerky marinade overnight on some thinly-sliced top round beef. Before we dried it, we followed US Federal food-safety guidelines for jerky-making by heating the meat (we put the meat and marinade directly into a stockpot) to an internal temperature of 160 °F prior to drying. This method will reliably kill more than 99.9999% of any bacteria present.</p>
<p><strong>A note on jerky and food safety</strong></p>
<p>Although USDA food safety guidelines are usually mentioned in dehydrator instruction manuals, many recipes you’ll find among jerky enthusiasts skip the pre-cook, since cooked meat can make a jerky that’s more brittle or crumbly.</p>
<p>Jerky and other dried meat products have been around for nearly as long as humans have, so traditionalists might seem reasonable in insisting that un-cooked jerky won’t necessarily make you sick. There are cases of salmonella and e.coli contamination that have shown up even in commercially produced jerky when USDA guidelines aren’t rigorously followed, though: food safety policy is about evaluating risk.</p>
<p>To get a definitive answer about temperatures needed for reasonable safety in jerky-making, we reached out to <a href="https://fbns.ncsu.edu/faculty-directory/dana-j-hanson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Dana Hanson</a> of North Carolina State University’s Department of Food, Bioprocessing and Nutrition Sciences.</p>
<p>Dr. Hanson explained that simply salting the meat is not enough to eliminate pathogens that could be present in any meat. <em>“The pathogens that we worry about [salmonella and e. coli]&#8230; There&#8217;s just not a lot of definitive research out there that shows ‘if we just salt it and dry it&#8217;s going to achieve [enough] reductions.&#8217; So that&#8217;s why we cook jerky in the US.”</em></p>

<p><em>“I totally understand,” he said, “from a culinary standpoint&#8230; boiling is probably not what you want to do. I appreciate good jerky, but [pre-cooking jerky] can provide the safest system and still have pretty acceptable quality.”</em></p>
<p>We talked to Dr. Hanson about the temperature readings we got, with internal temperatures of 90-110 °F for the first hour of drying.</p>
<p><em>“If there&#8217;s danger in home jerky processing, that&#8217;s where it exists: those temperatures are near perfect incubation temperatures for some of the pathogens we&#8217;re talking about.“</em></p>
<p>And once the meat has dried, will a high-temperature dehydrator solve our problems then? Not really. Some moisture is required to kill pathogens like salmonella. As Dr. Hanson pointed out, <em>“There are some species that actually are more tolerant to heat at low humidities.”</em></p>
<p>So while any of these machines is able to effectively dry out meat that has been made safe by pre-cooking, we don’t recommend any of them as a risk-free means of turning raw meat directly into jerky — pretty much any dehydrator will fail that test.</p>

<p>We set up in our test kitchen late at night and measured both the sound level and the pitch of the fan noise produced by each dehydrator. (We’ve included samples from the kitchen’s microwave and fridge as well, for comparison; they were unplugged during the rest of the test.)</p>
<p>We measured noise level using the same sound-measuring methodology as workplace or environmental noise exposure standards. Sound level measurements are integrated over time with a formula that accounts for the non-linear way we respond to changing sound level, and with a “weighting” that simulates the way our ears respond more readily to high-frequency sound. (The result is a “Level Equivalent, A-weighted,” or LeqA). We used a 30-second measurement time since the noise from these machines is more steady than, say, traffic noise that’s measured over hours.</p>
<p>Our test equipment included a calibrated measurement microphone patched through the <a href="https://www.roomeqwizard.com/features.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REW audio measurement suite</a> on a PC. Frequency-response calibration of the mic was provided by Dayton Audio from the factory, and we verified the SPL calibration of the system against a Galaxy Audio CM-130.</p>

<p>We mounted the microphone on a stand at ear level in the middle of the test kitchen (about four feet from the countertop test position). Levels will be higher if you want to stand right beside the machine, of course, but these results are directly comparable with each other.</p>
<p>While on the whole a lower dB reading is desirable, low-frequency noise is also less annoying than high-frequency noise; frequencies above 500Hz (see the Presto and Hamilton Beach results) are significant because they overlaps with <a href="http://www.dpamicrophones.com/mic-university/facts-about-speech-intelligibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener">important parts of human speech</a>, and that makes it hard to have a conversation in the same room.</p>
<p>The L’Equip is a clear winner here (almost as quiet as the fridge), but when we compare its performance in the other categories&#8230; it’s pretty obvious that the machine is quiet because the fan is not moving much air.</p>
<p>Note that while it put out less noise energy overall than the Excalibur, the LEM sometimes made a resonant noise that might be more annoying to some. (Probably from two pieces of sheet inside vibrating against each other.) We waited a while to be sure it was making this noise while we recorded the audio test. This may be a flaw in the construction of the machine we received, or it may be consistent throughout the line; even with some buzzing the LEM is still far quieter than the Hamilton Beach or the Presto.</p>

<p>The five roomy trays use a grid spacing perfect for most home dehydrating applications. If you decide that you want fine mesh to hold seeds or berries, or a solid sheet to make fruit leather, finding or cutting a square piece of material is much easier than trying to make something fit the round machines.</p>

<p>The elephant in the room when we were testing these machines is the forty-year reputation of Excalibur dehydrators as the best of the best; LEM started out making meat-processing equipment for hunters in 1991, and they’re definitely the underdog.</p>
<p>Vertical spacing between the trays really distinguished the LEM 1152 from the Excalibur 3500. In our apple-drying test, slices that started to bend or wrinkle while drying would rub against the bottom of the tray above in the Excalibur (falling off the trays when we pulled them out), and by the end of the test it was clear that there were spaces which weren’t getting as much airflow in that machine — no such problems in the LEM.</p>

<p>The LEM also has a removable drip-tray in the bottom of the machine, which is a feature that seems obvious and downright necessary once you’ve used it. The fold-down door was also far easier to work with than the fiddly lift-off cover on the Excalibur, and you can see through it.</p>
<p>The LEM isn’t a perfect machine for making jerky all by itself, but no dehydrator is. If you’re using meat that has already been heat-treated (in moist or wet conditions) to a temperature that will kill the pathogens that could make you sick, the LEM will dry jerky quickly and evenly.</p>

<p>While two of the other machines we tested were quieter overall than the LEM, and the machine we bought buzzed a bit from time to time, it was quiet enough to use indoors (and didn’t drive us crazy the way the Presto did.)</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IUWH44Y/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LEM Products &#8211; 1152’s</a> horizontal airflow and sliding-tray design is far easier to work with than stacking dehydrators.</li>
<li>Great drying efficiency, evenness, and thermostat accuracy.</li>
<li>The 1152 wasn’t the quietest machine we tested, but performance comes from airflow.</li>
<li>LEM provides amazing features for the price when compared with the competition.</li>
<li>A removable drip tray! Brilliant!</li>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002SHNIW0/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Excalibur &#8211; 3500</a> is the machine that the enthusiasts all seem to know about and talk about. Excalibur basically invented the horizontal-flow design, and they offer a wide range of dehydrators and accessories. (the 3500 comes with a very thorough 194-page “Complete guide to food dehydration.”)</p>

<p>The 3500 is a good machine by any standard, and if it were priced competitively it would be an easier recommendation; Excalibur is banking on their reputation, though, and they make you pay dearly for every feature and upgrade. If you want to match functionality with LEM, the 3526CD (no longer available) with added analog-dial timer and clear door will bump the list price from an already-dear $199.95 to $269.95. Adding full digital control bumps it up to $299.95. In our testing we didn’t find these features necessary, but they’re definitely nice to have and even the cheapest model we tested included them.</p>

<p>Cost aside, the fact that the trays are so close together in the Excalibur 3500 is really what took our recommendation away. You could take out two trays to get more room, but the LEM just has better-chosen spacing for the drying jobs we did (though it gives the Excalibur a slight edge in the fruit-leather test.) Add in a clunky door and lack of a timer, and the Excalibur just wasn’t as nice to use.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002SHNIW0/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Excalibur &#8211; 3500</a> is very popular among dehydrator-enthusiasts with a long track record of reliable consistency.</li>
<li>The Excalibur performed very well in all our tests, edging out even the LEM in speed and consistency when drying fruit leather.</li>
<li>The closer spacing was a downside with larger items like apple chips, which got caught up on the trays above when we pulled them out and dried less evenly than in the LEM.</li>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012CG8N26/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 32100A</a> is tiny for a dehydrator, but it packs decent efficiency into its small footprint. If you want a cheap dehydrator you can store in a small cupboard and bring out every now and then to make snacks, this is it.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach dries food quickly, though not as quickly or evenly as our top pick, and you’ll probably want to move the bottom trays to the top and stir things around halfway through the cycle if you’re filling it up.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012CG8N26/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hamilton-beach-32100a-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hamilton-beach-32100a-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hamilton-beach-32100a-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hamilton-beach-32100a-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hamilton-beach-32100a-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hamilton-beach-32100a-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hamilton-beach-32100a-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hamilton-beach-32100a-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hamilton-beach-32100a.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Budget Pick: Hamilton Beach - 32100A</h3><p>It didn't beat the LEM in any performance categories, but is a fraction of the price and very compact.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012CG8N26/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The biggest problem we had with evenness in this machine (and in the L’Equip) is that the air can’t circulate evenly to the corners of the rectangular trays. This is especially apparent on the bottom tray, where there are spots that seem not to get much hot air at all. This will be a bigger problem for some tasks than others; in follow-up batches we found that if you can leave the bottom tray empty, it helps the evenness a lot.</p>
<p>With full digital control, five trays, and a set of tray liners, this machine takes the cake for value any way you slice it: watts-per-dollar, capacity-per-dollar, accessories-per-dollar… if you can live with the noise and a bit of babysitting cold spots, it would be cheaper to buy two of these than an equivalent Nesco machine.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Hamilton Beach &#8211; 32100A is a clear value winner for small batches.</li>
<li>Its compact size, front-panel controls and a see-through lid are very convenient for countertop use.</li>
<li>Not as consistent when you load it up; if you’re drying larger volumes of food you’ll definitely want our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IUWH44Y/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">top pick</a>.</li>
<li>This was the loudest machine we tested.</li>

<h2 id="the-others">The other machines we tested</h2>
<h3>The Presto Dehydro 06301</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/presto-stack.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We really liked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M2WIZCT/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Presto Dehydro</a>; it has a lot going for it.</p>
<p>From its efficiency and consistency, to its see-through lid and nesting trays (it takes up considerably less space in storage-mode than the Nesco), this is a good machine if you like the stacking design. There’s even a spool built into the base to wrap the cord around for storage.</p>
<p>That said, we wouldn’t choose it over the LEM for big jobs (like apple or zucchini harvest) and the more budget-friendly Hamilton Beach will do the same job if you just want to make a snack, while taking up even less of your cupboard.</p>
<p>The biggest downside to the Presto is really the noise it makes; it will drown out any conversation you try to have in the same part of your house.</p>
<h3>The Nesco FD77DT</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5966 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nesco-with-trays.jpg" alt="Nesco machine with trays" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nesco-with-trays.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nesco-with-trays-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nesco-with-trays-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nesco-with-trays-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nesco-with-trays-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nesco-with-trays-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nesco-with-trays-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nesco-with-trays-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nesco-with-trays-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nesco-with-trays-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Nesco American Harvest is, like Excalibur, a well-established player in this market.</p>
<p>The previous version of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JB0FB72/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FD77DT</a>, the “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0090WOCN0/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Snackmaster” FD75A</a>, is still the best-selling dehydrator on Amazon. The old model had an analog thermostat with no timer, the 77DT has full digital control; fan and heat output appear to be identical. Note that the analog model includes more trays and accessories for the same price as the bare-bones digital package.</p>
<p>Nesco has done well making the vertical-stack design work efficiently, but not quite as well as Presto has. Presto’s trays nest for storage, but Nesco mounts the fan on top and gives you a drip tray on bottom.</p>
<p>If we had to choose between only the two circle-shaped stacking dehydrators, it would really come down to a choice between quiet operation and drying efficiency; the LEM has much better capacity and drying efficiency than either.</p>

<p>We really wanted to like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VWUM2I/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">L&#8217;Equip</a>. It’s understated in design, but with precisely-crafted details, like a retractable cord and smooth-turning and intuitive rotary controls for the digital timer and thermostat.</p>
<p>It comes with more accessories than you’ll probably know what to do with (though the two small fruit leather trays are a bit underwhelming given the size of the machine.) Even the shape seems like a good compromise between the flexibility of stacking and the usability of square trays, basically giving you two decent-sized square areas on either side of the vent hole.</p>
<p>The best thing about this machine is also the worst: the fan is very, very quiet, but gives the worst performance for drying efficiency and consistency out of any machine we tested. As far as we can tell, the fan is just underpowered for all the drying area it has to cover. After we turned most of the machines off at the seven-hour mark in the apple test, we shuffled the trays and ran the L’Equip for another three and a half hours to get the corner slices dry — and there were still damp spots after that.</p>
<p>We liked the details of this machine enough to keep trying to give it a chance to shine, but however much we might like the way it looks, feels or sounds, there’s no excusing the poor performance. (Especially when it’s in the same price range as our top performer.) Based on the build quality of the Filter Pro we looked at other models from L’Equip, like the high-tech radiant-heat <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0167XS0HI/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">IR D5 model</a>… but the price pretty much rules that one out too.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Dehydrating is a great way to store or prepare food, and these machines all give you complete control over the process: nothing will go into your granola or fruit leather or jerky that you didn’t add yourself, and you can decide just how much heat you want to use to speed up the drying process.</p>
<p>Any of these machines will get food dry eventually and with a bit of care, but the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B014IK804K/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LEM Products 1152</a> does it quicker and more efficiently, and you can load it up without worrying about shuffling trays. It’s a much better value than any other machine with the same features, too.</p>
<p>If you don’t have nine pounds of zucchini and 20 pounds of apples to store every fall, you may be happier with the size and value of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012CG8N26/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach 32100A</a>, which is loud and not quite as consistent, but does a good job with small batches.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After comparing 12 different thermometers with 45 hours of research and over three years of long-term testing, we've confirmed our winner, the Lavatools - Javelin PRO Duo.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">E</span>yeballing your food isn’t the most effective or safest way to gauge doneness. Digital kitchen thermometers offer quick and easy cooking data. We conducted over 45 hours of research and performed a series of tests to determine which of 12 top products is worthy of being crowned best digital meat thermometer. All-around excellence earned the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F59K0IW/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lavatools &#8211; Javelin PRO Duo</a> our top pick. Its speed, accuracy and design make it the best food thermometer for everything from grilling the perfect cut of meat to confecting candy. After three years of long-term use, we still love it.</p>

<p>To narrow the many options to just nine top-notch digital thermometers, we began by looking at more than 50 sources and chose the 15 most credible to base our research off of. We read consumer reviews and subreddits, including r/Cooking, home and technology publications like Good Housekeeping and Wired, and blogs like Wise Bread and Lifehacker.</p>
<p>Our research indicated that the best digital thermometers feature accurate temperatures in hot and cold foods, wide temperature ranges that convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius, easy storage options, user-friendly interfaces, and helpful instruction manuals.</p>
<p>Some of the top nine are built specifically for the oven and feature small digital displays that sit outside the oven while a connected probe reads the temperature in the middle of the food.</p>
<p>These oven thermometers have alarms that alert you when the food reaches a specific temperature, which is helpful for the busy cook or someone who’d rather not set a timer to check for doneness.</p>
<p>Others, called instant-read thermometers, are made for taking the food’s temperature as quickly as possible. Within just a few seconds, they display an accurate reading — some down to a tenth of a degree.</p>
<p>After extensive research, we narrowed the many digital thermometer choices down to nine, which were all easy to use in a variety of foods, display temperatures in Fahrenheit and Celsius, and have a manufacturer’s warranty.</p>
<h3>Updates</h3>
<p><strong>When it came time for an update, we were hard pressed to find any real flaws in our top picks for new competitors to improve on.</strong> We focused on testing a new crop of bargain-priced instant read thermometers. We also checked out a fresh design for a wireless thermometer that doesn&#8217;t have the drawbacks of Bluetooth.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">The benefits of using a kitchen thermometer</h2>
<p>For such a small tool, a kitchen thermometer can significantly improve the quality of the food you prepare. It makes cooking more efficient and more accurate, while giving you peace of mind that your meal is cooked to perfection.</p>
<p>With a digital kitchen thermometer, there’s no need to cut open a piece of chicken, stick a toothpick in a cake, carefully observe the consistency of candy, or set a timer and hope your food is perfectly cooked when it goes off.</p>
<p>Kitchen thermometers are essential when cooking raw meat, so anyone who grills, roasts, or fries benefits from owning one, and if you have an old analog thermometer, the speedy accuracy of digital will be a step up.</p>
<h2 id="differences">Digital vs analog thermometers</h2>
<p>Thanks to digital thermometers, food temperatures are more accurate than ever. While analog thermometers have traditionally been used in kitchens, they haven’t offered much more than an approximate temp range, which can make cooking to medium-rare a challenging feat.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1907" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/digital-vs-analog-thermometer.jpg" alt="Analog and digital food thermometers" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/digital-vs-analog-thermometer.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/digital-vs-analog-thermometer-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/digital-vs-analog-thermometer-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/digital-vs-analog-thermometer-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/digital-vs-analog-thermometer-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/digital-vs-analog-thermometer-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/digital-vs-analog-thermometer-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/digital-vs-analog-thermometer-180x119.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/digital-vs-analog-thermometer-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
Digital thermometers, on the other hand, offer precise readings so you can hit the USDA’s minimum temperature recommendation to kill bugs like salmonella and e. coli, but not overcook your chicken breast. They’re also much more helpful than analog thermometers when facing finicky kitchen projects, like tempering chocolate or making cheese, which can easily go awry if the temperature reading is off.</p>
<p>Like most of today’s technology, digital kitchen thermometers have a range of features. Some of the thermometers we tested, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GRFHXVQ/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">like the Lavatools &#8211; Javelin</a>, were as simple as opening up the package and inserting the probe. Others were more complex, like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IJ1SQV2/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iDevices Kitchen Thermometer</a>, which involved downloading an app that uses a bluetooth connection to track the temperature on your phone or tablet from as far as 150 feet away.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-look-for">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>With so many thermometers on the market, it’s helpful to know what to look for to suit your kitchen needs. We recommend using the following metrics when shopping for a digital kitchen thermometer.</p>
<h3>Accuracy</h3>
<p>Above all, a digital kitchen thermometer should be accurate. Accuracy is the key to a tool that helps you cook food to the perfect temperature.</p>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<p>Speed is an important factor with a thermometer that claims to be instant, but it’s much less of an issue with oven thermometers. <strong>Look for an instant-read thermometer that stabilizes within three to 10 seconds</strong>. You’ll need the speed when reaching into a hot oven, over a grill, or into a pot to measure temperature.</p>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>A thermometer’s functionality can enhance your cooking experience. Know what you’re looking for before you start shopping. Whether you’re a cook who craves a simple, easy design or one who’s fascinated by the latest technology, there’s a thermometer for you.</p>
<p>The ability to switch from Fahrenheit to Celsius can come in handy for cooks who venture into global recipes. Some thermometers display temps to the tenth of a degree. Some digital displays even rotate, depending on the angle they’re held, like the <a href="https://www.thermoworks.com/Thermapen-Mk4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ThermoWorks Thermapen Mk4</a>.</p>
<p>Thermometers can come pre-programmed with minimum meat cooking temps and alert you when they’ve reached it. Others beep when they’ve stabilized, and some can even double as a timer if you’re monitoring time and temperature.</p>
<h3>Temperature range</h3>
<p>A wide temperature range is better if you plan to use a thermometer for more than just meat. A meat thermometer may run from about 32°F to 392°F, but an all-purpose one should have a wider range on the low end.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1909" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thermometers_temp-range.png" alt="thermometer temperature range" width="880" height="805" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thermometers_temp-range.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thermometers_temp-range-610x558.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thermometers_temp-range-360x329.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thermometers_temp-range-375x343.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thermometers_temp-range-414x379.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thermometers_temp-range-295x270.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thermometers_temp-range-180x165.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thermometers_temp-range-320x293.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Accessories</h3>
<p>The top nine thermometers we reviewed came with a variety of accessories like storage cases, magnets, detachable probes, and more.</p>
<h3>Manufacturer’s warranty</h3>
<p>Check out how long the warranty is good for, especially if you plan to get a lot of use out of your thermometer. The brands we tested range from one to five years.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Once we found our top thermometers, we dove into the testing process, creating qualitative and quantitative criteria on which to judge them:</p>
<ul class="toc">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul class="toc">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Accuracy</li>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Functionality</li>
<li>Usability</li>
<li>Temperature range</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Over ten hours of testing in the kitchen, we tested the top nine thermometers in ice water, boiling water, tempered dark chocolate, a whole roasted chicken, and a thick rib-eye steak.</p>
<h3>Accuracy Tests</h3>
[table id=227 /]
<h3>Test 1: Ice water</h3>
<p>Since not all thermometers can be calibrated by the user, the first test was designed to see how accurately the thermometers were calibrated in the factory.<br />
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F59K0IW/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Top Pick: Lavatools - Javelin PRO Duo</h3><p>The fast and accurate Javelin PRO nailed the temperature on our ice water test.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F59K0IW/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p><strong>Accurate thermometers should read exactly 32°F in ice-cold water</strong>. We filled a pot with an ice-to-water ratio of 3:1 and tested each probe by submerging it two inches into the water, stirring it gently without it touching the bottom.</p>
<p>The Javelin PRO Duo nailed it, with a reading of 32.0°F. While others got to within one degree, the Javelin PRO Duo and the premium-priced ThermoWorks were accurate to one tenth of a degree.</p>
<h3>Test 2: Boiling water</h3>
<p>We followed the ice water test with a boiling water test. This test can be tricky since water boils at different temperatures depending on altitude. At sea level, look for a temperature of 212°F, but the boiling temp drops with elevation gain. <a href="https://www.thermoworks.com/bpcalc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thermoworks has a calculator here</a>: Since we tested at 400 feet above sea level, at a pressure of 30.06 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch_of_mercury" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inHg</a>, we were looking for a reading of 211.53°F.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B00S93EQUK/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AlphaGrillers</a>,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KVLPUB2/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> EatSmart</a> and<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001GD1WHU/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Taylor &#8211; 147821</a> thermometers were all very accurate in boiling water, displaying within one degree of the actual temperature.</p>
<h3>Instant-read speed test results</h3>
[table id=226 /]
<p>We timed how quickly each of the instant-read thermometers came up to their calibrated temperature in each of the accuracy tests. We also tested with melted chocolate while we were tempering it — heating and cooling it to create a smooth texture. This process requires constantly observing the state of the chocolate and regular temperature readings.</p>
<p>We tested each of the thermometers at various stages in the tempering process: initial heating to 120°F, cooling to 82°F, and reheating to between 88°F and 91°F. Since the temperature of the chocolate is constantly changing — heating or cooling — the thermometers took longer to stabilize than they did with icy or boiling water.</p>
<p>The Javelin PRO came up with the fastest read in chocolate, at a mere 3 seconds, followed by the Lavatools &#8211; Javelin at 5.9 seconds. The <a href="https://www.thermoworks.com/Thermapen-Mk4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ThermoWorks &#8211; Thermapen</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KVLPUB2/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EatSmart</a> were quickest on average, though.</p>
<h3>Test 4: Roasted chicken</h3>
<p>For the three oven thermometers we performed a test on roasted chicken to see how they stacked up against each other. Since these thermometers are a bit more complicated than unfolding and reading the temperature, and because we already gauged their accuracy with the first two tests, we looked at ease of use and overall effectiveness.<br />

<p><strong>Straight out of the box, the Taylor &#8211; 147821 is the easiest to set up and start using.</strong> It doesn’t have pre-programmed temperature settings for different types of meat, but it does have a temperature guide on the back of the device for reference. Taylor, ThermoPro and iDevices give the USDA-standard 165°F for chicken, while the Supreme Home preset is all the way up at 175.</p>
<h3>Test 5: Thick rib-eye steak</h3>

In our first testing roundup, we used all nine thermometers to track the doneness of a rib-eye steak.</p>
<p>We inserted the probes of the oven thermometers horizontally into the middle of the raw steak, put the steak in a pan on the stove, and started tracking the rising temperatures of all three. We set the oven thermometers to medium-rare to see how useful the presets were with a real steak.</p>
<p>We also used the instant-read thermometers throughout the cooking process to test for speed, trying several different depths and locations in the steak as the temperature grew close to the USDA’s recommended internal temperature of 145°F for medium-rare beef.</p>
<p><strong>The quickest response among the instant-read thermometers was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NY8J010/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Polder Stable-Read Digital Instant-Read Thermometer</a></strong>, <strong>which stabilized in 4.8 seconds.</strong> Following that, the EatSmart Precision Thermometer gave a reading at 6 seconds and ThermoWorks at 6.8 seconds.</p>
<h2 id="the-best">Best overall: Lavatools &#8211; Javelin PRO Duo</h2>

<p>The best instant-read digital kitchen thermometer is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F59K0IW/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lavatools &#8211; Javelin PRO Duo</a>. In our kitchen tests, it was consistently accurate and quicker than most. It’s simple to use, easy to store, and works perfectly without needing re-calibration. It was the most accurate in the ice water test, down to a tenth of a degree, and it was the fastest in the chocolate test.</p>
<p>This thermometer really shines with its features; they’re simple to figure out and easy to use when cooking. <strong>One feature we particularly loved during testing is the ability to add a beep when the temperature stabilizes</strong>, so you don’t have to wonder if the thermometer has found the current temp yet. It then keeps displaying the temperature as it rises or falls, so it&#8217;s more helpful than a hold button.<br />
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F59K0IW/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javelin-pro.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Top Pick: Lavatools - Javelin PRO Duo</h3><p>Fast, accurate, feature-packed and easy to use, this digital meat thermometer excelled in our series of tests.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F59K0IW/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Javelin PRO also has one of the widest temperature ranges, from -40°F to 482°F, and also has the ability to show maximum and minimum temperatures within your current cooking session.</p>
<p><strong>This thermometer is water-resistant enough that you can safely rinse it off</strong>, <strong>and its magnetic back makes it easy to store.</strong> It features an anti-fog, LCD backlit screen but also has a power-saving mode, which can turn the backlighting off. It goes into sleep mode after an hour of inactivity, but it wakes right up if you move it. You can easily turn it off by folding down the probe, but we love the way this sleep mode saves batteries if you forget.</p>
<p>Priced at under $50, it comes with a three-year warranty as well as an easy-to-read manual with accuracy test instructions and a troubleshooting guide.</p>
<p><b>Key Takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Lavatools &#8211; Javelin PRO Duo is a quick, accurate thermometer with some great features that make it easier to use.</li>
<li>The Javelin Pro nailed our ice test, and was very accurate overall.</li>
<li>Getting the quickest read time during a tricky chocolate tempering test ensured we fell in love with this thermometer.</li>
<li>Waterproofing, battery saving, and an easy-read rotating screen are all great features that make this thermometer great.</li>
<li>The only real competition for this model is the $100 ThermoWorks. Lavatools doesn&#8217;t let you calibrate, but we don&#8217;t think most users will miss that.</li>

<p><b>Pair the Javelin PRO Duo with the</b><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001GD1WHU/?tag=ybdthrm-20"> <b>Taylor &#8211; 147821 Digital Cooking Thermometer with Wired Probe</b></a><b> for optimal accuracy in all your cooking tasks.</b> The Taylor thermometer functions as an easy-to-set timer and thermometer. We like that it’s versatile and conforms to your needs. Stand it up on your counter or stick it to the oven door, use the recommended meat temperatures, or set your own to suit your recipe.</p>
<p>At around $16, we were surprised at how well it performed. The Taylor was very accurate in ice and the most accurate oven thermometer in boiling water tests, where accuracy matters most for roasting and baking.</p>
<p>The response time on oven thermometers is usually slow, and this one is no different: It took about thirty seconds to stabilize after an extreme temperature change.</p>
<p>The display includes the basics: a timer, the set temperature you&#8217;re waiting for, and the thermometer’s current temperature reading. There are no presets for meat temperatures, but that means no extra buttons to get in the way.<br />

We've tested two diffent units and found them very accurate, but they won't take grill-flame heat. </p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001GD1WHU/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The timer buttons for setting hours and minutes won&#8217;t let you reduce time without pressing both buttons to reset from zero, but it&#8217;s handy to have if you like to keep your kitchen smartphone-free. (Or if you like to keep your smartphone kitchen-grease-free.)</p>
<p>You can also set the Taylor to alert you when it reaches the set temperature, or leave the alert off and simply observe the temp. All the important option switches like temperature scale and alert mute are physical toggle switches, so they don&#8217;t reset when you turn the thermometer off.</p>
<p>Even setting aside price, the simplicity of this thermometer is just hard to beat. You could spend more on a wireless unit like the ThermoPro or something with calibration options like the <a href="https://www.thermoworks.com/ChefAlarm">Thermoworks &#8211; ChefAlarm</a>, but for a simple oven thermometer we think the Taylor is just about perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Taylor &#8211; 147821 has all the features you need to monitor roasting, baking, or smoking.</li>
<li>In boiling water, this thermometer was the most accurate oven model we tested.</li>
<li>With an easy to read display and simple, reliable controls, there&#8217;s nothing about this thermometer to get in the way.</li>
<li>An added timer function is basic, but handy to have.</li>
<li>The maximum temperature on this model is 392 °F, so it&#8217;s not a good pick for a grill.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MSUJWDH/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ThermoPro &#8211; TP21</a> is a reliable, feature-packed wireless thermometer that&#8217;s still pretty affordable. The probe is also rated for grill temperatures, up to 700 degrees compared to the 400-500 degree limits of other oven thermometers. That makes it our pick for the best wireless oven thermometer.</p>
<p>After testing a Bluetooth wireless thermometer in our first roundup and being dissatisfied with all the complexity that comes along with that, we were relieved at the simplicity and reliability on offer here. It&#8217;s not just a bare-bones device, either: The ThermoPro has a display backlight that changes color as your food gets closer to the temperature you set.</p>
<p>The ThermoPro&#8217;s wireless range is impressive. We had to go to the other side of a neighbor&#8217;s garage before it started having any trouble updating the temperature reading consistently, a line-of-sight connection was strong well past the 300-foot listed range.<br />
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MSUJWDH/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/termoProTP21CTA-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/termoProTP21CTA-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/termoProTP21CTA-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/termoProTP21CTA-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/termoProTP21CTA-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/termoProTP21CTA-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/termoProTP21CTA-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/termoProTP21CTA-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/termoProTP21CTA.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Wireless for the Grill: ThermoPro - TP21</h3><p>With a rugged probe that will survive up to 700°F and a 300-foot wireless range, this is a good upgrade for anyone grilling in the backyard. The color-change screen backlight is a helpful feature, too.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MSUJWDH/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The wire hook/stand is handy for hanging the probe transmitter base on your oven or grill handle, but a magnetic backing would have made it even better. This model doesn&#8217;t allow calibration (which would be handy if the probe ever needs replacing) but it was within a few degrees of perfect in all our tests, which is close enough for just about anything you&#8217;ll be doing in the oven.</p>
<p>The timer on the TP21 is also less intuitive than the Taylor&#8217;s, since you have to cycle through all the temperature presets to find it. You also lose your seconds count on the TP21 when you set hours and minutes, where the Taylor always shows a seconds counter.</p>
<p>ThermoPro&#8217;s new probe style is a nice upgrade over typical fare, and They will replace it if it stops working in the first year, or for four years if you register on their site.</p>
<p><b>Key Takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The ThermoPro &#8211; TP21 is a wireless thermometer that will give you reliable connection all the way to your neighbor&#8217;s house.</li>
<li>Color-changing backgrounds on the screen warn you when you&#8217;re close to the set temperature.</li>
<li>This grill-friendly design reads all the way up to 700 degrees.</li>
<li>Accuracy isn&#8217;t the ThermoPro&#8217;s strong suit, but it&#8217;s close enough for most of us.</li>

<h3>A premium upgrade: ThermoWorks &#8211; Thermapen Mk4</h3>
<p>ThermoWorks has a great line of thermometers that covers every need &#8212; from basic instant-reads to a wifi-connected BBQ pit monitoring system &#8212; but we think the<a href="https://www.thermoworks.com/Thermapen-Mk4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ThermoWorks &#8211; Thermapen Mk4</a> is where their attention to detail really shines. This thermometer is the gold standard against which all other kitchen thermometers are judged.</p>
<p>ThermoWorks includes a certificate that demonstrates exactly how accurate each model is, theoretically always within ±0.7°F and traceable just like a laboratory or engineering instrument. It&#8217;s also the most expensive instant-read kitchen thermometer on the market, though it&#8217;s very competitive with other certified lab devices.</p>
<p>The fact that we saw a boiling water reading that was double the specified maximum error didn&#8217;t do this thermometer any favors, but you can manually calibrate or send the ThermaPen back under warranty if yours is out of spec.</p>
<p>ThermoWorks has a similar design to the Javelin thermometers and uses the same fold/unfold function to turn it off and on. ThermoWorks invented the rotating display and shake-to-wake sleep mode, and those features do make it easy to use. The instruction manual is a detailed 21-page lesson in operation, care, and getting accurate readings when cooking.<br />

It's fast, accurate and lets you change nearly any of its fancy features with buttons inside the waterproof battery compartment. There's only one drawback: the price.</p><a href="https://www.thermoworks.com/Thermapen-Mk4" target="_blank"><button>See Price at ThermoWorks.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>For most home cooks, though, removing the battery cover with a screwdriver to push a combination of small buttons for adjusting calibration or display settings is just too much. It&#8217;s great that this thermometer is out there for the most demanding gear nerds, but most of us don&#8217;t want to change the display settings on a thermometer, let alone calibrate one.</p>

<h3>AlphaGrillers</h3>
<p>AlphaGrillers is a small company selling a lot of thermometers. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B00S93EQUK/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AlphaGrillers &#8211; waterproof instant-read digital thermometer</a> packs a lot of features into an affordable package, and they&#8217;ve worked hard to stay ahead of the pack in this very competitive price bracket.</p>
<p>This thermometer is not as sophisticated as the Javelin Pro or ThermaPen. Its display doesn&#8217;t rotate for easy reading, and it doesn&#8217;t notify you when the temperature is stable. The AlphaGrillers also takes a pretty consistent six-to-eight seconds to read a change, much longer than the Javelin Pro and two seconds longer than the EatSmart.</p>
<p>The AlphaGrillers doesn&#8217;t disappoint for accuracy, though. The unit we purchased was dead-on for the boiling temperature calibration, which is exactly where accuracy matters most for a meat thermometer. The ice bath test wasn&#8217;t as close, reading almost a full degree low. That&#8217;s still well within the tolerances required for most of our cooking needs, and a lower error than most of the other thermometers had in their boiling-point read. If you do find that&#8217;s you&#8217;ve got an inaccurate unit, you can also manually calibrate this thermometer.<br />
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S93EQUK/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AlphaGrillersCTA-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AlphaGrillersCTA-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AlphaGrillersCTA-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AlphaGrillersCTA-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AlphaGrillersCTA-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AlphaGrillersCTA-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AlphaGrillersCTA-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AlphaGrillersCTA-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AlphaGrillersCTA.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Waterproof just in Case: AlphaGrillers</h3><p>AlphaGrillers designed this to be a reliable thermometer that's easy to clean. We still don't recommend dropping it in the sink, but they've got your back if water ever gets inside. Ours was also perfectly calibrated for hot items, which is exactly what you need in a meat thermometer.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S93EQUK/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The edge this thermometer has over our other runner-up, the EatSmart &#8211; Precision Elite, is that this is waterproof. Now, if you&#8217;re skeptical about the waterproofing on a $20 thermometer, we don&#8217;t blame you. We ran it under the tap for a full minute and didn&#8217;t see any sign of water ingress into the battery compartment. AlphaGrillers also has a good track record replacing failed or malfunctioning units for users who complain about faulty models. In a world where there are 20 or 30 listings for exactly this same thermometer with different labels, that&#8217;s worth seeking out.</p>
<h3>Lavatools &#8211; Javelin</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GRFHXVQ/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lavatools &#8211; Javelin</a> was off by quite a lot in the steak test, reading 150°F when the other thermometers were reading under 100°F. It did, however, function quickly and accurately in the other tests, and we liked the simplicity of the design.</p>
<p>Like the Lavatools &#8211; Javelin PRO Duo, it’s magnetic, turns on when it’s opened and off when it’s closed, has a wide temperature range and measures to the tenth of a degree. Another benefit is its lifetime warranty.</p>
<h3>Polder &#8211; Stable-Read Digital Instant-Read Thermometer</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NY8J010/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Polder’s Thermometer</a> is a super-simple tool that gets the job done. Like the Javelin PRO Duo, it has the ability to beep when it stabilizes, but it does take longer to do so.</p>
<h3>CDN &#8211; ProAccurate Thermometer</h3>
<p>Designed similarly to an analog thermometer, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0021AEAG2/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CDN &#8211; ProAccurate Thermometer</a> has a face that looks up instead of out, making it difficult to hold and read at the same time.</p>
<p>Since the initial reading of ice water was off by 1.9°, we tried to calibrate it by the instructions printed on the packaging, but we got an error message. It does have a five-year warranty, though, and we liked the pen-like protective case for the stem.</p>
<h3>ThermoPro &#8211; TP03A</h3>
<p>At less than $15, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IHHLB3W/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ThermoPro &#8211; TP03A</a> is a best-seller for obvious reasons. The response time is right in the middle of our tested results, but the accuracy was worse than average by quite a significant margin. It&#8217;s a usable thermometer, but if you pay around $7 more you can get a thermometer that&#8217;s much quicker and more accurate in the EatSmart.</p>
<h3>Other oven thermometers</h3>
<h3>iDevices &#8211; Kitchen Thermometer</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=22389&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB00IJ1SQV2%2F%3Ftag%3Dybdthrm-20&amp;dtb=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">iDevices &#8211; Kitchen Thermometer</a> is the most complex of the top nine, but it’s also the most interactive and fun. The box comes with a quick-start guide, but most of the instructions can be found in the manual within the app.</p>
<p>Recommended temperatures come pre-programmed in the app, and the user is notified on his or her smartphone when the temperature reaches the minimum setting, which is 165°F for chicken. You can also search for recipes, track the rising temperature of your dish, and share the results through the app.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1912" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/idevices-app.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/idevices-app.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/idevices-app-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/idevices-app-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/idevices-app-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/idevices-app-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/idevices-app-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/idevices-app-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/idevices-app-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/idevices-app-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/idevices-app-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The body of the iDevices &#8211; Kitchen Thermometer is magnetized for an oven or fridge, but it can also stand on a counter. And, with two wired probes leading back to the body, it’s the only thermometer we looked at that allows for simultaneously testing two locations.</p>
<p>That means you can monitor two separate dishes or different locations of the same dish — think turkey legs and turkey breast. It was also perfectly accurate in ice water right out of the box.</p>
<p>Once it’s set up, the iDevices app gives you a lot of information and it&#8217;s pretty cool to have full control from a touchscreen. But the time, complication and monetary investment (about $80) may turn away some shoppers.</p>
<p>The real weakness of this system is Bluetooth itself: different smartphones will have better or worse Bluetooth antennae, but the claimed range of 150 feet must require the planets to be in alignment as well as a clear line-of-sight path between your phone and the thermometer. Range and synchronization problems are the big complaints in every user review of the iDevices and Weber iGrill thermometers.</p>
<p>Weber has taken over the iDevices line and is now responsible for the app, and they&#8217;ve expanded the line with new iGrill models targeted at their core grilling and barbecuing customer base.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a devoted smartphone user who wants an app for everything, this will get you one step closer to your dream. Most of us are better off with a stand-alone thermometer.</p>
<h3>Supreme Home Cook &#8211; Oven &amp; BBQ Touchscreen</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O9GV906/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Supreme Home Cook &#8211; Oven &amp; BBQ Touchscreen Thermometer</a> was very accurate in the ice water test. That&#8217;s about all it has going for it, though &#8212; we didn&#8217;t have many favorable interactions with this device.</p>
<p>The instructions (on one sheet of paper) help the user decode the meanings of the one-letter labels on the touchscreen buttons and select the pre-programmed temperatures for poultry, fish, or red meat. That&#8217;s not a big problem by itself, but a typo made it very difficult to figure out how to change the taste setting of our rib-eye steak to medium-rare. Another quirk is that this device is programmed to set poultry at a surprisingly high 174°F.</p>
<p>Just setting a temperature manually requires awkward steps. You have to hold down the S-S button for two seconds. That&#8217;s not to be confused with the S-T button, which changes from Fahrenheit to Celsius scale. Also, each time it’s turned on, it automatically reverts to Celsius, which might annoy some.</p>
<p>The Supreme Home Cook’s screen, which gives you the alert temperature and the current cooking temperature, is slightly difficult to read at certain angles, and its flip-out kickstand doesn’t stabilize the body as well as the other thermometers.</p>
<h2 id="2019-update">2019 Updates</h2>
<p>For our update tests, we added some new budget-friendly options. We&#8217;re still very happy with the Javelin and the ThermaPen as the top instant-read thermometers on the market, but we wanted to see if a waterproof budget option could keep up.</p>
<p>The Taylor is also still our favorite oven thermometer, but we tested a new budget-friendly wireless option that&#8217;s more reliable that the Bluetooth design we tried in 2016.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Using both an instant-read along with an oven thermometer can help the accuracy and timing of your recipes, especially when cooking meat. The oven thermometer allows you to get close to your target temperature while the instant-read lets you take quick internal temperatures in several different locations of the food.</p>
<p>If you’re not roasting of baking with time-sensitive recipes, an instant-read thermometer alone should typically do the trick. Even though the EatSmart Precision Elite Food Thermometer had a faster average reading time in our testing, it didn’t have the accuracy, functionality, or features of our top recommendation, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F59K0IW/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lavatools &#8211; Javelin PRO Duo</a>. After clearly standing out in our tests, it has kept up in long-term testing, too, maintaining its accuracy and functionality in three years of additional usage.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Although a great thermometer, we came to the conclusion that the Thermapen shouldn't be the top choice for most people. It's an amazing product, but not really worth its $100 price point. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e took an in-depth look at nine of the best digital meat thermometers on the market, including the expensive-yet-popular <a href="https://www.thermoworks.com/Thermapen-Mk4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ThermoWorks Thermapen</a>. While the Thermapen is certainly among the best, we found there are better options for most homes, such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F59K0IW/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lavatools &#8211; Javelin PRO</a>. Read on to check out our review of the Thermapen, or take a look at our full review of the nine <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-digital-meat-thermometer/">best digital meat thermometers</a> on the market.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="finding-the-best">Finding the best digital meat thermometer</h2>
<p>We used a series of tests to rank each of the nine thermometers and determine which one was the best overall. These tests included the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temperature accuracy in freezing water</li>
<li>Temperature accuracy in boiling water</li>
<li>Temperature stabilization in tempered dark chocolate</li>
<li>Temperature stabilization and accuracy in a thick rib-eye steak</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as several other tests and metric comparisons.</p>
<h2 id="stand-out">What made the Thermapen stand out</h2>
<p><strong>The Thermapen sits at the very top of the price range</strong> for all of the digital thermometers we tested. While we aren’t quite sure that it’s worth the $100+ cost, there were still plenty of things we liked about the Thermapen.</p>
<h3>Temperature range</h3>
<p>The Thermapen led the field in the temperature range it could handle. During our testing, it was able to measure temperatures as low as -60°F, the lowest of all nine thermometers we tested (by about 20 degrees).</p>
<p>On the high end, the Thermapen was comparable to the other two top thermometers in this metric: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/EatSmart-Precision-Thermocouple-Thermometer-Technology/dp/B00KVLPUB2/?tag=ybdigsu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eat Smart thermometer</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/iDevices-IKT0002P5-Kitchen-Thermometer/dp/B00IJ1SQV2/?tag=ybdigsu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iDevices thermometer</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2328 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_temp-range.png" alt="digital meat thermometer temperature range" width="880" height="805" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_temp-range.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_temp-range-610x558.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_temp-range-360x329.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_temp-range-375x343.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_temp-range-414x379.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_temp-range-295x270.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_temp-range-180x165.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_temp-range-320x293.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>While this wide of a range isn’t needed by everyone &#8212; including those who are just using the thermometer to cook steak &#8212; it does add to the overall versatility of the thermometer, and is a significant value add for those who need to measure a wide range of temperatures in the kitchen.</p>
<h3>Ergonomics</h3>
<p>None of the thermometers we tested were particularly difficult to handle. However, one thing we really liked about the Thermapen was the fact that <strong>the display would automatically rotate depending on which direction the thermometer was being held</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead of needing to turn our head sideways to read the temperature, we could easily read the temperature from any direction.</p>
<p>According to the ThermoWorks website, this is a technology they have patented, which means if you want to look at your digital thermometer without looking sideways, you probably need to go with the Thermapen.</p>

<h3>Temperature speed</h3>
<p>The Thermapen was among the top performers among our instant-read finalists when we tested the speed with which each could find the correct temperature.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2329 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_instant-read.png" alt="digital thermometer read speed" width="880" height="659" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_instant-read.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_instant-read-610x457.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_instant-read-360x270.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_instant-read-375x281.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_instant-read-414x310.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_instant-read-295x221.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_instant-read-180x135.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_instant-read-320x240.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The Thermapen came in second place when measuring the temperature of ice water, boiling water, and steak. It also came in third place for measuring the chocolate. While these numbers aren’t particularly outstanding, they should be more than sufficient for most kitchen applications.</p>
<h2 id="what-not-liked">What we didn’t like about the Thermapen</h2>
<p><strong>The most significant thing we disliked about the Thermapen was the cost</strong>. At more than $100 (including shipping, tax, etc.), the Thermapen commands a significant premium over other digital food thermometers in the market, including the other 8 finalists we tested.</p>
<p>While a high price isn’t in and of itself a disqualifier, we felt that, in conjunction with the Thermapen’s performance, it is difficult to justify the cost of the Thermapen for most consumers.</p>
<h3>Good, but not the best</h3>
<p>As we mentioned above, the Thermapen performs reasonably well. That being said, it is neither the fastest, nor the most accurate thermometer we tested.</p>
<p>One of the major selling points that ThermoWorks uses to justify the cost of the Thermapen is the fact that <strong>it utilizes a “thermocouple” sensor instead of a “thermistor” sensor</strong>. This is supposed to increase the speed and accuracy of the thermometer.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Both the Javelin PRO and the Eat Smart thermometers performed better in each of those categories some of the time.</p>
<p>If the price point of the Thermapen were in the $40-60 range, we’d feel much more comfortable recommending it. However, for the price, we simply don’t think that it&#8217;s worth it &#8212; not when we consider our other finalists.</p>

<p>As we mentioned, the Thermapen performs well, but not as well as our top pick — specifically, the Lavatools &#8211; Javelin PRO.</p>

The probe is made from food-grade stainless steel, and its magnetic back makes it easy to store. Priced around $50, it comes with a three-year warranty.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F59K0IW/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<h3>Temperature range</h3>
<p>The Thermapen has a larger temperature range on both the high and the low end when compared to the Javelin PRO.</p>
<p>On the high end, the Thermapen works up to temperatures close to 600°F, while the Javelin PRO is effective up to about 475°F. On the low end, the Thermapen is functional in temperatures as low as -60°F, compared to the Javelin PRO which stops functioning at -40°F.</p>
<p><strong>Winner: Thermapen</strong></p>
<h3>Temperature accuracy</h3>
<p>Both the Thermapen and the Javelin PRO were essentially comparable with regard to temperature accuracy.</p>
<p>In our freezing water test, both thermometers registered 32°F, which is precisely correct. In our boiling water test, both thermometers registered 210°F, which is 1.5 degrees off from the correct measurement (at our elevation, water boils at 211.5°F).</p>
<p><strong>Winner: Tie</strong></p>
<h3>Temperature read speed</h3>
<p>Both the Lavatools Javelin PRO and the ThermoWorks Thermapen were among the best performers across this category.</p>
<p>However, the Thermapen was faster on three of the tests (ice water, boiling water, and steak), while the Javelin PRO was faster in the chocolate test.</p>
<p>While the edge does go to the Thermapen, it’s important to note that both thermometers were able to produce accurate readings very quickly. We consider the Thermapen’s edge to be marginal in real-world applications.</p>
<p><strong>Winner: Thermapen</strong></p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>The price of these products does change from time to time. However, in general the price of the Thermapen is about double what you’d pay for a Javelin PRO. At the time of testing, this meant spending $50 versus spending $100. Unless you’re working in a professional or commercial kitchen, the marginal improvements of the Thermapen are probably overkill.</p>
<p><strong>Winner: Javelin PRO</strong></p>
<h2 id="should-you-buy">Should you buy a Thermapen?</h2>
<p>While the <a href="https://www.thermoworks.com/Thermapen-Mk4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thermapen</a> is undoubtedly an excellent product, overall we found the value to be unequal to the price for most buyers. It is possible that some of the Thermapen’s value is in it’s longevity, and we will conduct long-term testing to see if that’s the case.</p>
<p>Based on our testing data and 30+ hours of use gave us a pretty clear indication that the Thermapen does not offer the best value, unless you have a specific need for a very wide temperature range (which reaches well below freezing), or if you really need to shave an extra second or two off your (already quick) reading.</p>
<p><strong>Unless there is a specific feature that the Thermapen offers that you must have, we think that the <a href="https://www.thermoworks.com/Thermapen-Mk4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lavatools &#8211; Javelin PRO</a> performs better, costs less, and is an overall better value.</strong></p>
