The Char-Broil gave us perfectly seared and evenly cooked steaks and juicy burgers and chicken. But if you want to upgrade, then the Weber’s superb build quality and impressive ignition and grease-management technology are worth the increased cost.</p>

<h2 id="compare">Compare the best gas grills</h2>
[table id=290 /]
<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected gas grills to test</h2>
<p>Many manufacturers of gas grills frequently update or improve their models, so we looked for gas grills that would not likely be replaced in a couple of years. Although these upgrades are often minor, we focused on grills that manufacturers had released in 2018-2019.</p>
<p>If you have a couple thousand in expendable cash, you could plunk it down on a high-end <a href="https://www.napoleon.com/en/us/grills" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Napoleon</a>, which has years’-long warranties. A Napoleon, however, may be out of the average consumer’s price range, so we instead we researched the moderately expensive Webers, one of the leaders in the industry.</p>
<p>Weber has several series of gas and charcoal grills — each with a lofty name, like Summit, Genesis and Master-Touch — and we chose to test the Spirit II, since its features are similar to less-expensive brands.</p>
<p>Our tester then personally checked out all of the grills sold at Home Depot and Lowe’s, and since we wanted an equitable test, we selected grills that we believed would be a fair match against the Weber. (For the record, we also considered grills sold at Target, but the selection only included older models.)</p>
<p>To be comparable with the Weber, the grills needed to have at least three burners, two side shelves, approximately the same size cook space (475 square inches) and at least 30,000 BTUs. (If you want to know more about BTUs — British Thermal Units — and their importance, check out our review of the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-portable-air-conditioner/#btucalculator">best portable air conditioner</a>.)</p>
<p>Finally, we kept to a budget of no more than $300 each for the other two finalists. Models with cabinets are more expensive, so we chose models that had carts instead. Both the Char-Broil Performance and <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Dyna-Glo-4-Burner-Open-Cart-LP-Gas-Grill-in-Black-DGF493PNP-D/302774519" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyna-Glo</a> are highly rated by consumers and are available in two to five-burner models. Oddly, Char-Broil’s price decreases with the larger models, and we chose the five-burner for a very reasonable $199 and the comparably priced four-burner Dyna-Glo.</p>
<h2 id="assemble">Assembling a gas grill</h2>
<p>First off, if there’s an offer (from whichever store you purchased the grill) for free assembly, grab it. Unless you really enjoy building things from nuts and bolts, be forewarned that assembling a gas grill requires two people and two hours of time. Lowe’s sells the Char-Broil fully assembled, so we paid the service charge for its delivery. Amazon usually charges for assembly, but for the Weber, it was free at the time we purchased it. However, since this service might not be available in your location, we decided to assemble the Weber and the Dyna-Glo ourselves to compare difficulty.</p>
<p>The Weber’s shipping weight is 116 pounds, and even with two people, it would be back-breaking to lift and carry the boxed Weber from the driveway to the backyard. So we unpacked and constructed it in the driveway. Although all of the pieces and hardware looked like we were about to put the disassembled Tin Woodsman back together, the Weber’s instructions were detailed and specific. Tools were required (not included), but everything fit perfectly into position.</p>
<p>Assembling the Dyna-Glo was a completely different experience. It weighs less than 65 pounds, because its materials are so much less substantial. The Dyna-Glo’s hood was encased in styrofoam for shipping, but it was dented in several spots. Metal splinters came off its side panels, and its framework was so flimsy, we worried it would not support the grill box. Surprisingly, it held, but the Dyna-Glo’s sturdiness didn’t compare well with the Weber’s.</p>
<h2 id="how-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Each grill had an igniter button, and following their manual’s lighting instructions, we preheated the grills to 500°F, which took between 10-15 minutes. We then cooked hamburgers, steak and chicken on each grill in the same way.</p>
<h3>Hamburgers</h3>

<p>We put four beef hamburgers on each quadrant of the cooking grate to determine whether the grill was hotter in the back, sides or front. We seared the burgers for three minutes, turned them and using a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-digital-meat-thermometer/">digital meat thermometer</a>, cooked them to medium-rare, between 140°F and 145°F. We let the burgers rest five minutes before cutting into them.</p>
<h3>Steak</h3>

<p>Next, we heated the grills back up to 500°F (there was always heat loss when the grill hoods were opened) and seared one-inch-thick New York strip steaks (seasoned only with Kosher salt and black pepper) on both sides for three minutes. We then lowered the heat and continued to cook them, turning frequently, until the digital meat thermometer hit 135°F. We took the steaks off the grill and allowed them to rest 10 minutes before cutting into them.</p>
<h3>Chicken</h3>

<p>We spatchcocked a whole chicken, cut it in half and seasoned each half with Kosher salt and black pepper. Then we turned off two or four burners, depending on how many burners each grill had, and cooked the chicken with indirect heat by putting the chicken on the unlit burners for 30 minutes. When the leg and thigh were cooked through, we transferred the chicken to the lit burner and crisped up the skin until it was golden brown.</p>
<h2 id="best-value">Best value: Char-Broil &#8211; Performance</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/Char-Broil-Performance-Black-And-Stainless-5-Burner-Liquid-Propane-Gas-Grill-with-1-Side-Burner/1000523547" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Char-Broil &#8211; Performance &#8211; 463347519</a> five-burner gas grill that we tested had a couple of minor design flaws, but otherwise it grilled everything virtually the same as our upgrade pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JTCMKQ/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Weber Spirit II &#8211; E-310</a>, and actually bested the Weber in our steak competition with a better sear. At only $199, it’s a fantastic value for this well-made and sturdy grill that we believe will last you several grilling seasons.</p>
<p>Let’s get the design flaws out of the way. Its temperature gauge is located on top of the hood, so we couldn’t easily see the temperature without getting closer and looking directly down at the gauge. Second, the hood has a stainless steel handle that gets searingly hot when grabbed near the curvature close to the lid.</p>
<p>Physically, the Char-Broil has some of the same features as the Weber: porcelain-coated cast-iron cooking grates, recessed porcelain-coated flame tamers — which vaporize grease and force excess grease to drip below — and a tapered drip pan that funnels grease to a small tray underneath the fire box.</p>
<p>The Char-Broil took five minutes longer to heat up than the Weber and Dyna-Glo, but when it hit 500°F, it maintained that temperature and distributed the heat evenly throughout its 475-square-inch cooking space.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with grilling, then you know it’s vital to monitor how quickly food is cooking and, if necessary, adjust the heat or move food to the upper rack so it doesn’t burn. We didn’t need to do either with the Char-Broil. The heat stayed consistent, and there were no flare-ups or hot spots. It wasn’t quite “set-it-and-forget-it” cooking, but it was definitely stress-free.</p>

With consistent heat distribution, the Char-Broil can sear steak and burgers and also slowly cook chicken to juicy and crispy perfection.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JZ9QY4R/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The hamburger we placed in the rear of the cooking space cooked a little faster than the burger in the front, but we simply switched them, and they finished at the same time as the burgers on the sides. The indirect-heat method worked very well with the chicken, which was cooked through and juicy. The steak was a wonder: It seared beautifully, and the fat crisped to a delicious golden brown.</p>

<p>The five-burner Char-Broil also has a side burner with 10,000 BTUs, which can be used for sauteing onions or peppers or making a pan sauce for your grilled meats and vegetables. It measures 53 inches wide and 26 inches deep, so if it’s too large for your patio, the Char-Broil &#8211; Performance is also available in several sizes and styles, like a compact <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HID4Y7Q/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">two-burner with cabinet</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JZV24HV/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a stainless steel four-burner, cart-style</a> (like the model we tested), and for $400, a <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/Char-Broil-Performance-Stainless-6-Burner-Liquid-Propane-Gas-Grill-with-1-Side-Burner/1000713050" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six-burner with side burner</a> and a 15,000 BTU sear burner.</p>
<p>If you’re considering buying a Weber, but you can’t justify its high price, the Char-Broil &#8211; Performance is an excellent, more affordable option.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Char-Broil &#8211; Performance- 463347519 is a well-made and sturdy propane-gas grill with some of the same features as a comparable Weber, but it’s half the price.</li>
<li>It maintained and evenly distributed heat over its entire 475-square-inch cooking area during our tests.</li>
<li>The Char-Broil &#8211; Performance seared steak and burgers to perfection and slow-cooked chicken so it had juicy meat and crispy skin.</li>
<li>A couple of minor design flaws — a misplaced temperature gauge, for one — aren’t deal-breakers.</li>
</ul>

<p>On grill forums, diehard Weber fans state that any Weber — charcoal or gas — is the best grill money can buy. Other people, however, question why Webers are much more expensive than other grills. We were intrigued as to what made a Weber grill so special.</p>
<p>We selected the moderately expensive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JTCMKQ/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Weber Spirit II &#8211; E-310</a> to test, and its performance was excellent, but it did not surpass the Char-Broil. Weber’s build quality, however, can’t be beat, so if you can afford a Weber — and the latest models with infrared are pretty pricey — then we can easily recommend the Weber Spirit II &#8211; E-310 as our upgrade pick.</p>
<p>Free assembly was offered when we bought on Amazon, but if it’s not available where you live, or if you really want to get a sense of how well a Weber is constructed, try assembling it yourself. A Weber’s parts and materials are hefty, and even when we had it together, rolling it to the patio was like pushing a wheelbarrow of bricks. Our advice is to build it where it will live.</p>
<p>Weber aggressively markets their patented GS4 technology, consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infinity Ignition, which Weber guarantees will light every time</li>
<li>Flavorizer bars, similar to Char-Broil’s flame tamers</li>
<li>Tapered burners, which heat evenly across the entire 529-square-inch cooking space</li>
<li>Grease-management system, again similar to Char-Broil’s, in which a tapered pan forces the grease to drip into a tray with a replaceable foil inset.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Spirit also has a unique device that attaches to the propane tank and indicates the level of propane gas inside the tank. The temperature gauge is located on the front of the hood, so it’s easy to see the grill’s internal temperature (when the lid is closed) even from across the patio.</p>
<p>The Spirit heats up fast and maintains the temperature, until the hood is opened to flip or turn the food you’re grilling. Each time we lifted the hood, the grill’s internal temperature dropped 100 degrees. Once the hood was closed again, the grill rapidly reheated.</p>

But you’re paying for superb construction and high-end technology that deliver excellent cooking results. If durability, design and performance are what you expect from a grill, then the Weber Spirit II is for you.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JTCMKQ/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>There was almost no difference between the Spirit and the Char-Broil in cooking results. We did notice, however, that the Spirit was slightly hotter in the back of the grill and less hot on the left side. We accommodated this discrepancy by shifting food towards the center or far right, when we wanted to sear the steak.</p>
<p>Overall, we were impressed by the Spirit’s design and can understand why Webers have a passionate following. The Spirit — and all Weber models — are built to last in most climates, and anecdotally, its devotees claim their Webers are still going strong after ten years, which is remarkable, considering many grills collapse into rust when exposed to the elements for a year or two.</p>
<p>The Spirit II series is also available in the same price range as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JTFDG7/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">red two-burner</a>, and for $150 more, a sleek and modernistic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0098HR1FI/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">black three-burner</a> with a cabinet.</p>
<p>Weber’s new Genesis II series is nearly double the price of the Spirit II series for a three-burner grill, but its additional features include a side burner, stainless-steel grates (instead of porcelain-enameled) and Weber&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H6193C8/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iGrill 3 smart technology</a> that allows you to monitor the grill&#8217;s internal temperature with an app.</p>
<p>For its durability, design and performance, we think the Weber is worth the high price tag.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s expensive, but the Weber Spirit II &#8211; E310’s build quality and technology make this grill a clear upgrade from other starter models.</li>
<li>Weber’s advanced GS4 grill system includes an igniter that’s guaranteed to light every time, even heat distribution, grease management to prevent flare-ups and an indicator that shows the level of propane remaining in your tank.</li>
<li>The Spirit II &#8211; E310, like all Webers, is a heavy-duty grill designed to last for decades in most climates.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Dyna-Glo-4-Burner-Open-Cart-LP-Gas-Grill-in-Black-DGF493PNP-D/302774519" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyna-Glo &#8211; DGF493PNP-D</a> four-burner gas grill is only $20 less than the Char-Broil &#8211; Performance, but the difference in build quality and performance was noticeable. The Dyna-Glo is a popular grill sold by Home Depot, but in reading online reviews, it’s clear that people are buying it for a single season and hoping it will last through the winter to maybe get a second summer out of it. That’s a fair assessment; its lightweight and cheaply finished materials would soon rust if the grill was left outside in the rain and snow.</p>
<p>During our testing, we had frequent grease flare-ups, which upon inspection, were caused by the Dyna-Glo’s flame tamers: they’re too narrow and positioned directly under the cooking grate. Consequently grease drips off the cooking food onto the burners rather than the bottom of the firebox. We needed to keep a close watch that the sudden bursts of flame didn’t burn everything we were grilling.</p>
<p>The back of the grill was much hotter than the front, so we continually re-positioned the food to prevent it from overcooking. Overall, grilling on the Dyna-Glo was more hands-on and a less pleasant experience than it was with the Char-Broil and Weber. If you’re looking for an inexpensive grill, we recommend the far superior Char-Broil &#8211; Performance instead.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you’re new to grilling or you’re looking to replace the grill you have, we recommend the <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/Char-Broil-Performance-Black-And-Stainless-5-Burner-Liquid-Propane-Gas-Grill-with-1-Side-Burner/1000523547" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Char-Broil &#8211; Performance</a> series as the best gas grill for the money. We tested the five-burner, but the Char-Broil Performance is available in other sizes to suit your needs or space requirements.</p>
<p>It’s sturdily made, heats and cooks evenly and makes it easy to grill like a pro,</p>
<p>If you want to upgrade, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JTCMKQ/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Weber Spirit II &#8211; E310</a> lives up to the company’s storied reputation. Like all Weber grills — both charcoal and propane gas — the Spirit is heavy-duty and built to last. Its high-end infinity ignition system, evenly distributed heat and grease management are worth the splurge if you grill everyday.</p>

<p>Copper cookware is arguably the type of cookware most cherished by professional chefs and skilled home cooks.</p>
<p>Julia Child firmly believed that every serious-minded cook should own at least one copper pot or pan. She discovered the benefits of cooking with copper during her years in France, where she purchased the thirty copper pots and pans now on display at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C. Julia cooked with those beloved pots for 45 years on all of her television programs, because <a href="https://www.copper.org/consumers/arts/2010/may/Julia_Child_Copper_P.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">copper allows for the precision that French cookery requires</a>.</p>
<p>Centuries before Julia filmed her first episode of The French Chef, the ancient Romans discovered that copper heats faster and more evenly than other metals, because of copper’s heat and electrical conductivity, which is second only to silver. Copper also cools very quickly, so once the copper pan is removed from the heat source, its temperature rapidly drops, which helps prevent a delicate sauce from overcooking or separating.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Copper is highly reactive: </b>A reactive metal like copper conducts heat very efficiently, but it also reacts with acidic foods. Tomatoes, vinegar and lemon can absorb not only a metallic flavoring but the metal itself.</p>
<p><b>Copper pots and pans are lined with nonreactive metal: </b>Copper cookware has been traditionally lined with nonreactive tin, which is not affected by acidic foods. With extended use over many years, tin does darken and wear away, so a tin-lined copper pan needs to be eventually re-tinned, or copper will leach into food, which our bodies can’t process and eliminate.</p>
<p>In recent years, copper pots and pans have been lined with stainless steel. Stainless steel, of course, is a hard, durable metal, but it lacks tin’s conductivity. Stainless liners are often coated with a nonstick material like PTFE (Teflon is the name brand), which, as we discussed in our reviews of <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-nonstick-pan/">nonstick pans</a> and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-nonstick-cookware/">nonstick cookware</a>, can be hazardous if the pan gets too hot.</p>
<p>Tin, on the other hand, is naturally nonstick and has low toxicity. For copper cookware, it&#8217;s the preferred metal for lining.</p>
<p><b>Copper cookware can’t be used for all cooking methods: </b>Tin has a melting point of 450° F, so a tin-lined copper pan should <i>never</i> be used for high-heat searing. For steaks, burgers and other foods you want browned, use a cast-iron pan instead. Copper is best for low-heat cooking, such as sauces, seafood, omelettes and other egg dishes.</p>
<p><b>Copper pots are expensive: </b>A copper saucepan from such well-known manufacturers as Mauviel and Falk runs about $450, and an entire cookware set can be as high as $2,000.</p>
<p>However, vintage pieces are available online. We purchased an authentic omelette pan, made in France, on Ebay for $40. Though vintage copper cookware will probably need polishing and retinning, it is much more affordable than buying copper cookware brand new.</p>

<p>Copper-core cookware is made primarily from more common metals, with a four- or five-layer base composed of a thin layer of copper sandwiched between layers of aluminum and/or stainless steel. The copper-core cookware that is made primarily of stainless steel is approximately triple the price of aluminum cookware.</p>
<p>The copper layer improves stainless steel’s heat conductivity and distribution, and the stainless steel makes the cookware more durable. Copper-core cookware also withstands higher temperatures and, because of the stainless-steel base, can be used on induction cooktops.</p>
<p>Copper-core cookware that is composed primarily of aluminum is considerably less expensive and usually has a non-stick surface.</p>
<h3>Copper-infused ceramic-coated</h3>
<p>This type of inexpensive, nonstick cookware is very popular, thanks to aggressive infomercials by two rival companies, Red Copper and Copper Chef. Their cookware is made of lightweight aluminum and is coated with a ceramic that they claim is infused with copper and can handle higher temperatures than 100% copper cookware.</p>
<p>Both companies market their cookware as all-purpose pans for searing, broiling, braising and frying: cooking methods that should never be used with copper.</p>

<p>We decided to see how well a copper-core pan, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002QB9TPS/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper</a>, and a copper-infused ceramic-coated pan, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BDU01TU/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Copper Chef</a>, fared against the real thing, a vintage tin-lined copper pan that we purchased on eBay.</p>
<p>The oval copper pan, generally used for cooking omelettes and fish, was manufactured in France, and although we don’t know when, it was obviously a much-used pan in someone’s kitchen. Its tin lining was scratched and had darkened to a gray patina, and the copper was spotted and tarnished.</p>
<p>Using a home remedy of Kosher salt, vinegar and flour, we rubbed the mixture onto the copper, and its years of neglect magically wiped off. Though our pan didn’t look quite new again, it was still a pretty pan that helped us understand why people would pay a small fortune for new copper cookware.</p>
<p>We conducted several simple but illustrative cooking tests. We used no oil or butter, and everything was cooked at medium heat.</p>
<p><b>Fried eggs: </b>We cracked whole eggs into the center and far edge of each pan and noted whether the center egg cooked faster than the side egg, or whether they both cooked at the same time. We also tested the pan’s nonstick capability by turning the eggs over and then scrambling the yolk and uncooked white.</p>
<p><b>Pancakes: </b>We used a <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21014/good-old-fashioned-pancakes/" target="_blank" rel="&quot;noopener">basic recipe for pancakes</a> and poured a pancake into the center and two pancakes on either side of the pan. Similar to the egg test, we were looking for evenly cooked pancakes. When we flipped the pancakes, we noted how the pancakes had browned and if they slid out of the pan without effort.</p>
<p><b>Hamburger: </b>We pan-fried a ⅓-pound, ¾-inch-thick hamburger made of 93% lean grass-fed organic beef. Each burger was fried for five minutes on each side. We were looking for an evenly browned and crisp exterior with a medium-rare interior.</p>

<p>The Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper was an admirable competitor, but our traditional 100% copper pan was the winner. As mentioned earlier, copper pans are famous for heat conductivity, and our vintage copper didn’t disappoint. The copper heated up quicker than the Anolon and Copper Chef, and after a couple of burnt pancakes, we turned down the heat source to medium-low, since it clearly didn’t need to be as high as the other two pans did.</p>
<p>Across the board, results were perfect, although the copper did require precision in controlling the heat level. Since this particular pan is intended for cooking omelettes, we poured in a couple of beaten eggs and were amazed by how rapidly it cooked and how easily the omelette could be folded and rolled. We don’t know how old our copper pan is, but it’s remarkable that its tin lining’s held up so well.</p>
<p>By the time we got to the hamburger, the pan was very hot, so we removed it from the cooktop and adjusted the heat. Our copper pan is oval, so its edges hang over the cooktop’s round heating element. We thought that the edges of the pan would be less hot; but we were wrong. We leaned the burger against the curved sides of the pan, and the burger cooked as well as it did in the center of the pan.</p>
<p>Clean-up was simple: once the pan cooled, we washed it with warm soapy water, and food residue came off with no scrubbing needed (harsh scrubbing erodes the tin lining). Copper can spot easily from water droplets, so all copper cookware must be towel-dried, and it should <i>never</i> be put into the dishwasher.</p>
<p>Copper pot and pans aren&#8217;t for everyone or for every type of food. You need to continually adjust the heat level to prevent food from overcooking or burning. But with trial and error and some basic culinary skills, you’ll soon learn to cook with copper cookware and turn out meals like a professional — and dare we say, like the French Chef herself.</p>

<ul>
<li>100% copper has superb heat conductivity, so it heats up fast, and heat distribution, so food cooks evenly on all surfaces of the pan.</li>
<li>Traditional copper pans are lined with tin, which is naturally nonstick and holds up for many years. New copper cookware is lined with stainless steel, which isn’t nonstick and doesn’t conduct heat as well as tin.</li>
<li>Copper is very expensive, and if you can’t afford to buy it new, you can find vintage copper pans online for much less and restore them.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002QB9TPS/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper</a> cookware is for people who don’t want to invest in the real thing nor deal with copper’s fussy upkeep. The cookware has only a super-thin layer (0.6 millimeters) of copper sandwiched between anodized aluminum layers, but the skillets we tested did perform very similarly to our authentic copper pan.</p>
<p>The Anolon has some heft to it, thanks to the magnetic stainless steel base, which also makes the pans induction-friendly. The 10-inch skillet weighs in at almost 3 pounds, and the 8.5-inch skillet is lighter at 1 pound. The 10-inch skillet isn’t really suited to flipping flapjacks and omelettes, unless you’ve got wrist strength.</p>
<p>That quibble aside, the pans gave great results. The copper layer worked in conjunction with the aluminum layers to evenly distribute heat over the entire surface of the pan. The stainless-steel base prevented the pan from heating up as rapidly as the vintage copper, but once the pan was hot, it was easier to regulate its heat level.</p>
<p>Pancake batter poured in the center and sides of the pan cooked evenly at the same time, and when we turned the pancakes, they were golden brown with crispy ridges. Fried eggs stuck a little, but when we flipped and scrambled the yolks and uncooked whites, they released easily. The hamburger also browned evenly, and similar to the copper pan, when we pressed the burger to the sides of the pan, it continued to sizzle.</p>

The Nouvelle Copper gave us great results and is a fraction of the cost.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002QB9TPS/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>In our review of <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-nonstick-pan/">the best nonstick pan</a>, we chose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001B1CJME/?tag=ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon &#8211; Advanced</a> as the best because it was 100% nonstick during our tests. The Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper is coated with Autograph 2 &#8212; Dupont&#8217;s high-end nonstick coating &#8212;  but the manufacturer improved the pan’s overall design by recessing the handle-rivet heads on the inside, so they’re flat and also nonstick. The rivets in other nonstick pans are raised, and food particles get wedged between them, which we found annoying to remove.</p>
<p>Cleanup was a cinch; however, the attractive copper band on the pan’s base (a quarter-inch ring where the copper layer is exposed) needs to be routinely cleaned and polished, or it will stain and tarnish.</p>
<p>On the negative side, even with meticulous care, nonstick coating loses its effectiveness after two or three years of regular use, and the pans will need to be replaced. So, there’s no reason to spend a lot on any nonstick pan. The Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper 10-inch and 8.5-inch skillets are sold as a set for only $46, which we think is a great price for an alternative to copper cookware.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>The well-priced Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper is made of a copper layer sandwiched between durable anodized aluminum with a stainless-steel base, so it can be used on any cooktop, including induction.</li>
<li>The pans we tested heated slower than the copper pan we tested, but once hot, heat was evenly distributed across the surface and sides of the pans.</li>
<li>The Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper has a high-end nonstick coating, which, unlike copper cookware, eventually loses its effectiveness, and the pans will need to be replaced.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BDU01TU/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Copper Chef &#8211; KC15057-02000</a> copper-infused ceramic-coated pans are advertised as the only pans you’ll ever need for any cooking method. Don’t you believe it. There are hundreds of photos posted by dissatisfied consumers depicting their Copper Chef pans with burnt-on food that won’t wash off and pans blackened from high heat.</p>
<p>Copper Chef’s pans are made of very lightweight aluminum, and their interiors and exteriors are sprayed with a ceramic coating that purportedly contains copper. It’s impossible to find online how much copper infuses this coating, but our best guess is it’s negligible. According to advertising, the copper-infused coating will increase the pan’s conductivity as well as make it nonstick.</p>
<p>Testing proved otherwise. The pans have a thick aluminum disk on the bottom, which is supposed to distribute heat over the entire surface of the pan. It doesn’t. The bottom of the pan certainly gets hot, but no heat radiates past the circumference of the disk, leaving the sides of the pan cool. The hamburger cooked in the direct center of the pan, but when we moved it to any side, it steamed but didn’t brown.</p>
<p>The pan also has a convex surface that creates a gutter along the sides into which any liquid flows. Consequently, egg whites dribbled into the gutter, creating egg tendrils, and pancake batter pooled, producing oblong and  unevenly cooked pancakes.</p>
<p>A major problem with marketing a pan as all-purpose is that high heat destroys nonstick coating, which should never be used for broiling meat or frying French fries. Copper Chef claims that their cookware can withstand temperatures up to 850°F. Since most ovens can only be set to 550°F, this marketing ploy is ridiculous. It comes as no surprise that so many consumers are enraged when food soon clings to their destroyed Copper Chef pan.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Copper Chef pans are pretty cheap, so if you want to try it out, buy a single pan instead of a set.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>In our matchup between an authentic 100% copper pan, a copper-core pan and a copper-infused ceramic-coated pan, it was a tie between the real copper and the copper-core Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper.</p>
<p>Copper is justifiably famous for its heat conductivity and distribution, and in our testing, the 100% copper pan cooked everything beautifully and quickly, even at medium-low heat. Cooking with copper, though, does take some getting used to, and copper cookware requires periodic maintenance to keep it shiny and the metal lining nonstick. It&#8217;s also extremely expensive, but it’s easy to find affordable vintage copper pieces, like we did, online.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002QB9TPS/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper</a> gave us similar results as the vintage copper pan. It didn’t heat up as fast, but when hot, heat was distributed over the surface and sides of the pan, and food was evenly cooked. The Anolon&#8217;s high-end nonstick coating was, for the most part, nonstick. Cleanup was easier with the Anolon, and for two skillets at $46, it’s well priced.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Nonstick pans are incredibly popular, but their composition and nonstick coating are controversial. Since nonstick pans are made of hardened aluminum and painted with several layers of nonstick coating, we read opinions and reviews that argued for and against using nonstick cookware.</p>
<p>To no one’s surprise, the majority of pro-nonstick websites we consulted are dedicated to cooking, such as Epicurious, Bon Appetit, The Food Network and Cook’s Illustrated. Their reviews of nonstick pans avoid entirely the health issues that are possibly linked to aluminum pans and nonstick coatings. In fact, they focus instead on the health benefits of using nonstick pans, because you don’t need to add oils and fats except as a flavoring.</p>
<p>Research into whether using nonstick pans is linked to health issues is ongoing. We did learn, however, of certain precautions you should take, which we followed during our testing.</p>
<p>We moved on to subreddits /r/cooking and /r/askculinary for opinions about the best nonstick pans and compared them to hundreds of Amazon reviews. We then culled together a list of the nonstick pans that were considered the best by experts and consumers alike. We had already reviewed <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-nonstick-cookware/">the best nonstick cookware</a>, so we turned our attention to 10-inch skillets, which most chefs agree are the right size and weight for cooking several eggs or pancakes at one time.</p>
<p>Because there are a variety of heating elements in today’s kitchens, we narrowed our selection to nonstick pans that are designed for use on gas, electric and induction cooktops. Not all of the nonstick pans we wanted to test are sold individually, so we also decided to test nonstick-pan sets that included a 10-inch skillet along with a smaller or larger pan.</p>
<p>Even properly cared for, nonstick coating doesn&#8217;t hold up longer than two years. There&#8217;s really no reason to spend a lot on a nonstick pan if you&#8217;re going to have to replace it. So we selected nonstick pans that were $40 or less.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs a nonstick pan?</h2>
<p>Nonstick pans have been in use since the 1950s, and if you’re a cook, it’s a pretty safe bet that you’ve cooked with one or two in your lifetime. If you’ve been using a nonstick pan for a while, it’s also quite likely that it looks like it’s been through a war; it’s scratched, peeling, warped, banged up and you need to slather it up with butter to keep food from sticking.</p>
<p>We’ve been using nonstick pans for many years, and we’ve been cooking everything, at all levels of heat, in them. Little did we know that a nonstick pan was not designed for cooking all kinds of food. How often have you preheated a nonstick pan on high and seared a ribeye or salmon steak? If you’re like us, countless times, and that’s a surefire way of diminishing the lifespan of a nonstick fry pan.</p>
<p>You’re actually quite limited as to what you can cook in a nonstick pan. Steaks, sautes, stir fries — anything that needs high heat — should be cooked in a cast-iron skillet or stainless-steel saute pan. With both of these pans you want stuff to stick, because those browned bits (also called <i>fond </i>) can be whisked into a flavorful gravy or sauce.</p>
<p>Most nonstick pans are made from hardened aluminum, which has excellent heat conductivity, so they need less heat to cook food. Nonstick pans are thus ideal for delicate food that cooks quickly, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fried eggs</li>
<li>Scrambled eggs</li>
<li>Omelettes</li>
<li>Pancakes or crepes</li>
<li>Delicate fish filets, such as sole or flounder</li>
</ul>
<p>Every home cook should have at least one nonstick pan in the kitchen cabinet for this type of gentle, rapid cooking. If you’re looking to switch out your old pots and pans for new ones, our review of the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-nonstick-cookware/">best nonstick cookware</a> includes saucepans, stock pots and saute pans.</p>
<h2 id="what-is">What is nonstick coating?</h2>
<p>Traditionally, nonstick coatings are made from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), otherwise known as the famous (and infamous) brand name Teflon. It’s a paint that’s sprayed on the pan usually in three coats. The pan is then heat-cured to make sure the coating stays intact.</p>
<p>Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was a chemical commonly used for spraying the PTFE coats evenly. Although PFOA was initially deemed safe for home cooks using the pan, it did have harmful effects on the health of people working near or at the facility where the pan was manufactured and the PFOA applied.</p>
<p>In 2006, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency linked perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) to a number of health issues, including cancer, and urged manufacturers to cease using PFOA by 2015. Since 2013, most companies have complied. All of the nonstick pans we tested were PFOA-free.</p>
<h3>Is nonstick coating safe?</h3>
<p>As we discussed in detail in our review of <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-nonstick-cookware/#what-is-it">nonstick cookware</a> about safety concerns, nonstick coatings can be harmful if the pan is improperly used. If an empty nonstick pan is left on an open flame long enough and heats to 662 ºF or higher, the PTFE begins to disintegrate. In those conditions, fine particles and noxious gasses are released and, if inhaled, can cause severe internal issues.</p>
<p>This off-gassing is particularly harmful — if not fatal — to birds, so many manufacturers now label packaging with a warning about using a nonstick pan in the vicinity of pet birds or parrots.</p>
<p>Nonstick coatings are generally considered safe if you follow these precautions:</p>
<p><b>Don’t preheat an empty pan:</b> Most nonstick pans are made of heavy aluminum, which can hit the 662ºF danger point in a few minutes. Always have food or liquid in the pan, and keep it moving as it cooks.</p>
<p><b>Cook at medium or medium-low heat: </b>Nonstick pans are designed to distribute heat evenly, so you don’t need to crank up the heat past medium for food to cook.</p>
<p><b>Ventilate your kitchen: </b>Whether you use your stove’s ventilator or simply open a window, keep the air flowing while you cook. You could also run an air purifier, like the one <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-air-purifier/">we recommend in our best air purifier review</a>, in your kitchen.</p>
<h2>How to take care of a nonstick pan</h2>
<p>Many complaints on Amazon about nonstick pans are that the nonstick coating scratches and flakes and stops working so that everything cooked sticks. People are also confused by the term “lifetime warranty” and try to return the pan a year after they purchased it.</p>
<p>Lifetime warranty is a vague term used by manufacturers to sell their product. It doesn&#8217;t mean that a nonstick pan will last the lifetime of the owner, nor does it refer to the pan&#8217;s lifetime, since that&#8217;s impossible to calculate.</p>
<p>A nonstick pan may hold up for 10 or 15 years, but the nonstick coating itself won&#8217;t last more than two years. There are a few best practices, however, you can follow that will help the nonstick coating last as long as possible.</p>
<p><b>Never use metal utensils with your nonstick cookware: </b>Although several manufacturers claim their nonstick pan is scratch-proof, take it with a grain of salt. Only use wood or silicone utensils.</p>
<p><b>Don’t shock the pan in water: </b>Any heavy-duty pan will warp from rapid change in temperature. After you’re done cooking, let the pan cool down before washing it.</p>
<p><b>Clean your pan with a scratch-proof pad or sponge: </b>Nonstick coatings are sensitive to steel wool, scouring pads and abrasive powder. Instead, use a nonscratch sponge like the one we recommend in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-kitchen-cleaning-sponge/#the-best-scratch">review of the best kitchen cleaning sponges</a>.</p>
<p><b>Wash and dry the pan by hand: </b>Ignore the manufacturer’s claim that its nonstick pan is “dishwasher-safe.” Abrasive detergent powder and heat will damage the pan’s nonstick coating in no time. All of the nonstick pans we tested were easily wiped clean with a paper towel or damp sponge. Dry the pan by hand to keep rust from forming.</p>
<p><b>Never use an aerosol cooking spray: </b>Cooking-oil sprays burn at a lower temperature than oil, and their burnt-on residue is almost impossible to remove without using a scouring pad.</p>
<p><b>Store your pans properly: </b>Hang your pans, or store them in dividers in your cabinet. If you don’t have the space in your kitchen and need to stack your pans, line the interior and edges with microfiber cloths or <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-paper-towels/">paper towels</a>.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Flat, smooth surface: </b>Some nonstick pans have a convex surface — a slight dome in the center — which allows the pan’s metal base to expand as it heats and prevents warping. One of the most common criticisms of nonstick pans is that convex surfaces cause runny foods, such as eggs or pancake batter, to dribble down the center of the pan and into the pan’s sides. So you want a pan that has a smooth, almost slick, surface and flat bottom, which sits evenly on your cooktop.</p>
<p><b>Size:</b> Nonstick pans range in size from eight inches to 12.5 inches. If you want to cook an omelette or more than two eggs or pancakes at one time, we recommend a 10-inch pan. The 10-inch pan gives you enough room to flip eggs or pancakes. The larger pans certainly accommodate more food, but you’ll need a larger heating element to properly heat the entire pan.</p>
<p><b>Weight and grip: </b>How much a pan should weigh and how you want it to fit in your hand are completely subjective choices. But we recommend that a pan should be light enough to flip an omelette or — if you’re skilled or daring — a sunny-side-up egg with a couple of quick flicks with your wrist. Almost all of the 10-inch pans we tested weighed under two pounds, which is light enough to easily maneuver the pan. The Tramontina was a few ounces heavier, and it was more difficult to move the pan around.</p>
<p><b>Shape: </b>The best 10-inch nonstick pans are French skillets, which have a flat, smooth bottom and low, flared sides that give you easy access for flipping eggs, pancakes or fish.</p>
<p><b>Handle: </b>A French skillet has a long handle that’s slightly shorter than the diameter of the pan. This length allows you to flip food with a quick jerking motion of your wrist and elbow. The handle should either have a silicone covering (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001B1CJME/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon Advanced</a>) or be made of stainless steel (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PCI71TS/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips</a>) to protect your hand from the intense heat generated by the pan.</p>
<p><b>Price: </b>Some beautiful nonstick pans are available with high price tags; they’re not worth it. When the nonstick coating stops working (and it will), you’ll feel less pain replacing a $40 pan than you would an expensive one.</p>

<h3>Heat distribution</h3>
<p>We dusted flour over the bottom of each pan and turned the heat on low. As the flour browned we could tell how evenly the pan heated up. If the flour browned at the same time from center to edge, heat distribution was good. Only two of the finalists — the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001B1CJME/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B55RQBO/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Circulon </a> — browned the flour evenly. The other pans browned from the center and then radiated out to the edges or browned in spots.</p>
<h3>Fried eggs</h3>
<p>Most people who purchase a nonstick pan want to cook without oil. Because we wanted to test whether a pan’s coating was truly nonstick, we didn&#8217;t use oil in any of our cooking tests. Once the pan was heated, we cracked an egg in the center of the pan and another on the side furthest from the handle.</p>
<p>When the egg whites firmed up, we turned them over and noted any sticking. Finally, we attempted to shake the pan to release the eggs; if this failed, we gently eased the eggs out of the pan and again noted how much they stuck.</p>
<h3>Scrambled eggs</h3>

<p>We whisked two eggs together and poured them into the pan. We immediately began moving them with a silicone spatula from the edges to the center. Because the eggs were in constant motion, most of the pans performed well. We had the most trouble with the Circulon, since the concentric circles trapped and browned the eggs between the ridges.</p>
<h3>Pancakes</h3>

<p>We used this <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21014/good-old-fashioned-pancakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basic recipe for pancakes</a> and poured circles of batter into the pan: one in the center, one close to the handle and two on the opposite side of the handle. We noted whether the center pancake cooked faster than the pancakes near the handle and sides of the pan. We also attempted to flip the pancakes without using a spatula. Only if the pancake stuck did we use a silicone spatula to release them from the pan.</p>
<h3>Filet of sole</h3>
<p>We wanted a very delicate fish that could easily stick and fall apart. We put a thin three-ounce filet of sole into the pan for 30 seconds and then attempted to turn it over. This test proved to be the tell-all, as the fish stuck slightly or a lot to some pans and broke into pieces as we turned it over.</p>
<p>Two pans, however, were the clear champs: our top pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001B1CJME/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon</a>, and our top pick for a nonstick-pan set, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003IKMR96/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; Chef’s Classic</a>. Both pans lightly browned the fish and were 100-percent nonstick. We turned the fish, and the filets were left intact.</p>

It&#8217;s 100-percent nonstick, and the 10-inch skillet was one of the lightest that we tested, so flipping eggs and pancakes was as effortless as Julia Child made it look.</p>
<p>The Anolon &#8211; Advanced is composed of anodized aluminum, which means it’s been manufactured with an electrochemical process that hardens the aluminum and makes it extra durable. It’s triple-coated with Autograph 2, a top-of-the-line Teflon derivative from Dupont&#8217;s spin-off company Chemours.</p>
<p>The Anolon has low sides and a smooth, flat surface, so it sat completely flat on our cooktop. It has excellent conductivity and was one of the fastest of the pans to heat up — in a mere 15 seconds — at medium-low. Hovering our hands over the pan, we could feel the heat radiating upward over the entire pan.</p>
<p>We cracked the eggs in the center and side, and both cooked at exactly the same rate. Thanks to the Anolon’s entirely flat surface, the eggs didn’t move, giving us the ideal bulls-eye shape. We turned the eggs over, and when the yolk was cooked (in about five seconds), we gently shook the pan, and the egg easily slid onto a plate in a compact package.</p>

<p>Everything cooked in a flash. Scrambled eggs came together in about 30 seconds and slid off onto the plate. Pancakes were golden brown in seconds. Again, we simply shook the pan, and the pancakes released. The sole filet was perfect: lightly browned, and since none of it stuck to the pan, we could lift and serve the filet intact.</p>
<p>The 8-inch handle is covered in silicone, which is easy to grip, and protects your hand from the pan’s intense heat.  The Anolon was ridiculously easy to clean; once it had cooled, we simply wiped it with a paper towel in between tests and washed it with a damp sponge when we were done.</p>
<p>The 10-inch skillet is sold separately and as a set with a 12-inch skillet. The larger pan performed exactly the same, but because its handle is too short, we found it less easy to maneuver on and off the stove top.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s actually much cheaper to buy the set than it is to buy the 10-inch skillet separately.  Because of the larger pan&#8217;s slight design flaw, we can&#8217;t recommend the Anolon as a set. But the 10-inch skillet outperformed all other finalists, and so, by itself, the Anolon 10-inch skillet is the best nonstick pan.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001B1CJME/?tag=ybdnspan-20">Anolon &#8211; 82074 Advanced</a> 10-inch French skillet has a smooth, flat surface with three coats of high-end nonstick coating that makes it truly 100-percent nonstick.</li>

<p>Cuisinart really stepped up their game with their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003IKMR96/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; 722-911NS Chef&#8217;s Classic</a> nonstick pan set. This high-end — but affordable — set includes a 9-inch skillet and an 11-inch skillet. Their stainless-steel, stay-cool handles are the appropriate length for the dimensions of the pans, which makes them both feel well balanced— unlike Anolon&#8217;s larger pan — and easy to maneuver.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart pans are triple-coated with a Teflon derivative called QuanTanium. Each QuanTanium layer is reinforced with titanium and ceramic particles, which Cuisinart claims give the pans maximum protection from wear and tear.</p>
<p>Visually, the Cuisinart &#8211; Chef’s Classic pans are stunners. Their glossy, mirror finish on the exterior has a professional look, and if you have the room for it, you would feel compelled to hang them over your stove.</p>
<p>Looks aren’t everything, of course, and the Cuisinart’s performance was on par with the Anolon. The pans&#8217; conductivity and heat distribution weren&#8217;t quite as good as the Anolon, since it took nearly a minute for them to fully heat, and the flour browned quicker in the bottom two-thirds of the pan.</p>
<p>When we cracked the eggs into the center and upper third of the pan, however, they cooked exactly the same in a minute. The cooked eggs released onto a plate with just a gentle shake.</p>

<p>Pancakes browned evenly, and with some bravado, we flipped them up and over, just like you might see on a cooking show. The sole filet cooked perfectly and effortlessly released from the pan.</p>
<p>On the negative side, the Cuisinart pans have a slightly convex surface, so egg white dribbled down into the sides of each pan.  Scrambled eggs also ran a bit into this gutter. However, though we had to move the eggs out of the sides, they cooked evenly and slid out onto a plate.</p>
<p>Cleaning was easy, and although the mirror glaze did not discolor from the high heat, we did notice a couple of slight spots on the bottom of the pan, which we scrubbed off. The Chef’s Classic pans are dishwasher safe, but Cuisinart does state that the pans will eventually lose their mirror finish with repeated dishwasher cleaning.</p>
<p>Cuisinart only sells the 9-inch and 11-inch pans as a set. The Chef’s Classic are so well-priced for such high-quality nonstick pans, you’re really getting two great pans for the price of one.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0170TFNXM/?tag=ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">All Clad &#8211; E785S264</a> nonstick pan set includes an 8-inch skillet and a 10-inch skillet. Both are similar in construction to the Anolon, but the All Clad pans are designed like classic saute pans: Low, straight sides and long handles. These features allow for searing meat and making pan sauces, but those tasks are more appropriate for a cast-iron skillet or stainless-steel pan.</p>
<p>The All Clad pans have convex surfaces, so the eggs and pancake batter ran into the side gutters and cooked too quickly. The pans’ nonstick coating was actually quite effective, however, and although the fish filet stuck slightly, it released without falling apart.</p>
<p>Both pans cleaned easily, but we did notice that food particles got stuck in between the pan and the rivets that connected the handle to the pan.</p>
<p>The All Clad is substantially more expensive than the Cuisinart set, which we believe to be better pans at a better price.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PCI71TS/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; Nonstick Pro Fry Pan</a> is a nicely constructed and well-balanced 10-inch skillet. It feels substantial in the hand yet also easy to maneuver. The stay-cool metal handle is contoured for a comfortable grip.</p>
<p>OXO markets their proprietary nonstick coating as German-engineered and PFOA-free. With some research, we learned that there are indeed German-engineered nonstick pans, and some may use ceramic or other non-PTFE materials, but OXO’s nonstick pans still have a Teflon-like coating.</p>
<p>OXO’s nonstick coating, however, isn’t really as effective as OXO makes it out to be. The pan’s heat distribution seemed off: The half closest to the handle was hotter than the opposite half. Everything cooked faster on the handle side so food stuck: It wasn’t a lot of sticking, but just enough that egg and fish wouldn’t release from the pan without prying them free.</p>
<p>OXO charges more for their kitchen tools and appliances, which are usually excellent. In this case, however we don’t feel that this nonstick pan’s performance merits its high price.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CY3MRDS/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Calphalon -1943286 Classic Fry Pan</a> is a well-made, anodized aluminum 10-inch pan with a dual nonstick coating. All of the other pans we tested had three layers, and since Calphalon is perhaps one of the most recognized companies for nonstick cookware, it seems odd for this pan to have only two coatings. Calphalon makes its own nonstick coating, which is PTFE-based — basically, it’s Teflon — but it did not perform better than other similar coatings.</p>
<p>Heat distribution originated from the center of the pan and radiated outward, so everything we cooked on the edges browned less. The Calphalon took longer to heat up, but once it did, it was blistering hot, and food stuck. The pan has a stainless-steel handle, which should be cool, but the one-third of the handle connected to the pan was too hot to touch.</p>
<h3>Circulon &#8211; Symmetry</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B55RQBO/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Circulon &#8211; 87507 Symmetry French Skillet</a> set includes a 9-inch pan and an 11-inch pan. Both have a silicone-encased 8-inch handle, which is too short for the larger and substantially heavier pan.</p>
<p>Like all Circulon pans, the Symmetry French Skillet has raised circular ridges on its surface that the manufacturer claims help release food from the pan. However, in all of our tests, everything — except for the pancakes — stuck in between the ridges.</p>
<p>The Circulon had even heat induction and distribution, so the entire surface of the pan heated at the same time. We had success with the pancakes, which were easy to flip, but the fish stuck and fell apart when we tried to turn it. The circular ridges were most annoying with the fried and scrambled eggs, which got stuck between the grooves and browned too fast.</p>
<p>Cleaning was also a challenge. The sides of the pan wiped clean with a paper towel, but we had to scrape out the food bits trapped inside the ridges.</p>
<h3>Tramontina &#8211; Professional Restaurant Fry Pan</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23156" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tramontina.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1335" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tramontina-1000x668@2x.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tramontina-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tramontina-768x513.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tramontina-885x591.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tramontina-810x541.jpg 810w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tramontina-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tramontina-1000x668.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tramontina-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tramontina-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tramontina-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tramontina-320x214.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tramontina-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tramontina-885x591@2x.jpg 1770w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tramontina-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tramontina-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tramontina-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tramontina-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tramontina-320x214@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We were excited to try out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009HBKQ16/?tag=ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tramontina 10-inch skillet</a>, which was recommended by Wirecutter as the best nonstick pan. After testing the Tramontina, however, we were left scratching our heads wondering why Wirecutter praised it so highly.</p>
<p>It’s certainly a well-designed skillet, made of heavy-gauge aluminum and a long stainless-steel handle that’s further protected by a silicone sheath. At two pounds, however, the Tramontina was the heaviest of the 10-inch skillets we tested and difficult to maneuver.</p>
<p>Tramontina’s directions suggested massaging the pan with a little vegetable oil before cooking, but it didn’t do a thing; eggs, pancakes, fish and even the flour stuck.</p>
<p>It took somewhat more effort to clean the Tramontina, and the pretty-but-unprotected satin exterior finish on the bottom of the pan began to discolor during our test period. The Tramontina is reasonably priced, but its performance did nothing to win us over.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Competition is fierce for luring consumers to purchase pans that are purportedly “100-percent” or “totally” nonstick. We discovered from our testing, however, that many nonstick pans simply don’t work, unless you slather them with butter and oil, which completely defeats their purpose.</p>
<p>The best nonstick pan has a smooth, flat surface, a long handle either made from stainless steel or encased in silicone and even distribution of heat across the entire pan. The best nonstick pan, by far, is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001B1CJME/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon Advanced</a>.</p>
<p>In every test, everything we cooked on the Anolon Advanced was easily released by a simple shake of the pan, thanks to its high-quality nonstick coating. It has superb heat distribution to cook food evenly and quickly. The Anolon Advanced is dishwasher-safe, but it wipes clean in seconds with a paper towel or damp sponge, so there’s no need to risk damaging the pan’s nonstick coating in the dishwasher.</p>
<p>The best nonstick pan set is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003IKMR96/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; Chef’s Classic</a>, which includes a 9-inch skillet and an 11-inch skillet. The pans have a beautiful mirror finish and look like chef’s pans you might see in a fancy restaurant. The Cuisinart pans were also perfectly nonstick and easy to clean. They’re very reasonably priced — we’d even say budget-priced — for such high-quality pans.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e submerged, froze, microwaved, baked and machine-washed ten of the most popular food storage containers to find which one could keep food fresh longest. The best glass food storage container is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075GRTNN6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; Smart Seal</a>. Its unique lid with a soft silicone gasket ensures a leakproof and airtight seal. A lightweight and less expensive option is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a>. Made out of sturdy BPA-free Tritan plastic, this attractive set is also 100-percent leakproof and looks like new even after repeated use.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>There are literally hundreds of food storage containers that you could buy online and at practically any store. There’s a very good chance that you’ve got cabinets, drawers and pantries stuffed with them and that they’re stained, warped and damaged from microwaving leftovers. You probably want to throw them out, but what do you buy as replacements?</p>
<p>To narrow our selection, we started by reading customer reviews on Amazon. The reviews pointed us in the direction of food storage containers that stand up to years of heating and reheating, radical changes in temperature and dishwashing.</p>
<p>We also checked out reviews from reputable cooking websites and recommendations from health and diet websites. Parents of schoolchildren had lots of opinions about which containers are best for school lunches, as did people who do weekly meal prep dietary or workout regimen.</p>
<p>Finally we divided our finalists into those that were plastic and those that were glass — five of each — since the number of consumers who prefer one to the other is about equal.</p>
<p>Although glass containers last longer than plastic containers, glass containers are also prone to chip, particularly around the edges where the top snaps on. There are also complaints that glass containers can explode in the oven. We had some highly rated glass containers on our list, but we eliminated those that tended to chip and shatter.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs food storage containers?</h2>
<p>There’s a wide variety of uses for food storage containers. Whether you cook for yourself or a family brood, you may have leftovers you wish to enjoy the next day. Other people cook in bulk and freeze food for a month or longer. In both cases, you need a storage container that is airtight and leak proof so it will keep food fresh and, if frozen, frost-free.</p>
<p>It’s also important for some people that the container can be removed from the refrigerator or freezer and go directly into the oven. In this case, the container must be borosilicate glass that can withstand high heat without shattering.</p>
<p>Pot-luck dinners are popular in many communities, so a large, sturdy container with a secure lid is ideal for transportation. Parents of school children pack their lunches in food storage containers to be carried in backpacks. In this case, it’s important that the container be leak-proof, since its contents can easily shift sideways or upside down.</p>
<p>Meal prep containers are food storage containers in specific amounts for people who are dieting or on a workout regimen. Oftentimes, meal prep containers are divided in half to apportion two types of food in a single container.</p>
<p>Food storage containers aren’t just for food; people who do their own home repair use them for storing various sizes of screws, bolts, nails and other hardware.</p>
<h2 id="health">Health concerns about using plastic</h2>
<p>You’re probably aware of two chemicals associated with plastic containers: BPA and phthalates. BPA (Bisphenol A) is a chemical used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastic, which is the type of plastic used in most food containers.</p>
<p>When heated in a microwave, BPA leeches into the food or liquid, and although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration stated the low levels of BPA are safe, research suggests there are possible health effects on the brain and behavior of infants and children.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/sya-bpa/index.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The National Institute of Environmental Sciences recommends</a> avoiding products that are not labeled BPA-free and not microwaving products made of polycarbonate plastic.</p>
<p>Phthalates are chemicals used to make plastic pliable. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/Phthalates_FactSheet.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state</a> that although phthalates have affected the reproductive system of lab animals, research continues as to how phthalates affect humans.</p>
<p>If you prefer to use plastic food containers, buy those that are labeled “BPA-free” and “Phthalate-free.” However, additional research is being conducted about whether such products are actually harmful as well.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Plastic vs. glass: </b>Both have pros and cons. Plastic containers come in a variety of shapes and sizes, large and small, and they’re lightweight, so you can carry them in a backpack or shoulder bag. If they’re leakproof and airtight, food and liquids won’t spill out if the container is dropped or accidentally turned upside down or sideways.</p>
<p>Plastic containers are also significantly cheaper than glass containers. For $20, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PSKSG1M/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids</a> comes with 24 various sizes of containers and lids.</p>
<p>The downside to plastic containers is that they simply don’t last. Mostly everyone microwaves food in a plastic container and then tosses it into the dishwasher. After our testing, all of the plastic containers were stained to some extent, and most were pitted and scratched.</p>
<p>Glass food storage containers are heavier and more expensive. However, they’re also far more durable than plastic and much easier to clean. If you’re concerned about BPAs and phthalates, you can rest assured that a glass container is healthier. All of the glass containers we tested had plastic lids, so these should not be microwaved or run through the dishwasher.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’re ecologically mindful, glass is one of the best options.</p>
<p><b>Silicone gasket:</b> Many of the food storage containers we tested had a silicone gasket inserted into the inner lip of the lid where it connects to the top of the container. When the lid is locked into place, the silicone gasket forms a tight seal.</p>
<p>Our two winners — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075GRTNN6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO &#8211; Smart Seal</a> — had gaskets that were twice as thick as the other finalists, so their lids floated on top of the containers. When the latches are locked, a vacuum seal is created, thus ensuring both were leakproof and airtight.</p>
<p>Food particles can get trapped between the gasket and the lid’s lip, and silicone tends to retain food odors and must be periodically soaked in a vinegar-water solution. You’ll want a silicone gasket that can be removed for cleaning and easily reinserted.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075GRTNN6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO &#8211; Smart Seal</a> was, by far, the easiest silicone gasket to remove. The lid has side tabs that allow you to pull out the gasket and then snap it back on. (In fact, its design reminded us of the Instant Pot, which we loved in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-pressure-cooker/">review of the best pressure cookers</a>.)</p>
<p><b>Stacking/Nesting: </b>Whether you have a big or small kitchen, ample cabinet or drawer space is a premium. Glass food storage containers aren’t great for stacking or nesting, because sometimes a smaller container gets stuck in a larger one. Many plastic containers are designed for nesting, but you run into trouble with all of the bothersome lids.</p>
<p>Of the containers we tested, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PSKSG1M/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids</a> were the easiest to nest, and their interlocking lids prevent your rummaging around the bottom of drawer trying to find the right size.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Leaks</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/testing-leakproof.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We filled each container two-thirds full with water and secured the lid. Then we vigorously shook each container for one minute over paper towels and noted any leaks. Almost all of the manufacturers advertised their container as leakproof, and for the most part, they were. The Pyrex and Sistema don’t claim to be leakproof, and they weren’t; water leaked from their corners. But Prep Naturals was supposed to be leakproof, and water also poured out.</p>
<h3>Airtight seals</h3>
<p>Airtight containers hold in moisture and keep out odors from other foods in the refrigerator.  For this test we made sure that each container was completely dry. Then we placed one sheet of toilet tissue into the bottom of the container and sealed it. Next, we filled a three-gallon bucket with water colored with food dye and plunged each container one at a time into the bucket, holding it under for one minute. After that, we flipped the container upside down and submerged it for another minute. We then withdrew the container from the bucket, unsealed the lid and noted whether the toilet tissue was wet or dry.</p>
<p>All of the manufacturers claimed their containers were airtight. Not surprisingly, the same three that were not leakproof — Pyrex, Sistema and Prep Naturals — were also not airtight.</p>
<h3>Lid sealing</h3>
<p>The majority of food storage containers that we tested were sealed by aligning a silicone gasket inside the lid with the edge of the container, then locking it with hinged latches on all four sides. Four exceptions were the Pyrex and the Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids, which simply had snap-on lids, and the Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance and Sistema, both of which had two latches on the longer sides of the container.</p>
<p>We tested the lids and latches by opening them and closing them repeatedly and noted whether or not they were easy to snap on and release.</p>
<h3>Staining</h3>
<p>Plastic food containers are notorious for being stained by tomato-based foods, such as spaghetti sauce, and curries with turmeric. We began this test by filling each container three-quarters full with marinara and then froze them overnight in the freezer. The next day, we defrosted the containers with lids askew in the microwave until the marinara was boiling. When the sauce had been completely defrosted, we allowed each container to fully cool before dumping the marinara out.</p>
<p>As expected, all of the plastic containers and their lids were stained. The Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance, however, was only slightly stained. All of the plastic lids for the glass containers — except for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075GRTNN6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO &#8211; Smart Seal</a> — were also stained.</p>

<p>After we microwaved the frozen marinara in the plastic containers, we checked each one over for signs of warping. None were affected by the long microwaving. Two glass containers, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N90AWNF/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1790</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LN7X92K/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glasslock</a>, warned to not microwave their plastic lids. Since their lids were exactly the same as the other glass containers, we ignored the dire warning. Other than staining, neither were affected by the microwave.</p>

<p>If you read consumer reviews online, you’ll see some terrifying photos of glass food storage containers that have exploded in the oven. Borosilicate glass is resistant to sudden high changes of temperature, because it doesn’t expand like regular glass.</p>
<p>Still, all manufacturers advise putting borosilicate glass containers — especially from the refrigerator or freezer — into a preheated oven. This seems to defy logic, but when a glass container is put into a cold oven and then the heat is turned on, the heating element initially radiates heat unevenly, which doesn&#8217;t allow the glass to expand properly and will cause it to crack or shatter.</p>
<p>For our test, we removed the plastic lids from each glass container filled with frozen marinara and put the containers into a preheated 350℉ oven. All of the glass containers reheated the marinara in the same amount of time, and none shattered.</p>

<p>The dishwasher undoubtedly does the most damage to plastic food containers and lids. We followed manufacturer instructions and loaded the glass containers into the lower part of the dishwasher and the plastic containers and all the lids into the upper rack. We then set the dishwasher on a heavy-duty wash cycle.</p>
<p>All of the glass containers cleaned beautifully. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> was the only plastic food container and lid that showed no signs of damage. The other plastic containers were deeply stained and pitted, the worst being the Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids.</p>
<h3>Odor retention</h3>
<p>Plastic food containers and silicone tend to retain food odors, so after dishwashing, we did a sniff test. Only the Vremi, the silicone container, smelled strongly of marinara sauce. The silicone gasket in the Glasslock lid didn’t retain food odor but instead had an acrid chemical odor.</p>
<h3>Retesting latches and leakproof capability</h3>
<p>Amazon reviewers frequently complain that after dishwashing and microwaving, the latches are too difficult to close, and we found this to be true only with the Glasslock and OXO. However, we opened and closed the OXO’s latches several times, and they worked normally again. Although the Vremi’s silicone container held up in the dishwasher, one of its plastic lid’s latches had cracked after a single wash.</p>
<p>Finally, we repeated our leakproof test to see if freezing, microwaving and dishwashing had any structural effect on the containers. The same three that failed the first time — Pyrex, Sistema and Prep Naturals — leaked again. But this time the 1790 also leaked.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> 14-piece set is made of Tritan, a BPA-free plastic that resembles glass, but it’s shatter resistant and more durable than other plastics. The seven lids for the seven containers are also made of Tritan, which allow you to see their contents from all sides in the refrigerator. The set includes a large 9.6-cup container, two medium 3.2-cup containers and four small 1.3-cup containers.</p>
<p>Each container in this attractive set is rectangular with flat lids that are slightly recessed, so you can stack them in the refrigerator without fearing they’ll topple.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, a thick silicone gasket inside the inner lip of the lid floats on top of the container. When you press down on the lid, air is expelled out of the container through the lid’s vent holes with a whoosh. The two small latches on the long sides snap shut and create an airtight seal, which proved to be 100-percent leakproof.</p>

<p>The containers also have one-quarter-inch extensions at opposite ends, which stay cool when you lift the hot container out of the microwave.</p>
<p>Online instructions advise that turmeric will stain the Tritan plastic but tomato-based sauces will not. Our marinara sauce did stain the container and lid very slightly, but it was much less than on other containers we tested.</p>
<p>The Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance made it through the heavy-duty dishwashing cycle and showed no signs of pitting or scratching. Except for the rosy tint left by the spaghetti sauce in the container’s beveled edges, the container and lid looked brand new.</p>
<p>The only thing we didn’t like about the Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance is that the silicone gaskets cannot be removed from the lids. The gasket bends so you can scrub underneath its ridges, but to completely avoid odor retention, the entire lid would need to be submerged in cleaning solution.</p>
<p>Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance is reasonably priced for such a high-quality product. It’s available in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNEJSO/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">6-piece</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNEIC6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">10-piece</a> sets, and you can also buy various sizes individually if you need more of one size than another. The 1.3-cup size, which is perfect for packing school lunches or snacks, are available in a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077M4T91S/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">very affordable two-pack</a>.</p>
<p>Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance proved resistant to microwaving and dishwashing, and we believe it will outlast all of the other plastic food containers we tested.</p>

<p>Glass containers are much easier to clean than plastic, and you don’t have to worry about BPAs and phthalates. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075GRTNN6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; Smart Seal</a> was our favorite of the glass containers. It’s made of borosilicate glass, so it can withstand changes in temperature and go from the freezer to the microwave or a preheated oven.</p>
<p>What made OXO stand out from the other finalists is the thick silicone gasket that’s set into a channel in the lid. The gasket is made of soft silicone and floats on top of the container, so when you press down, not only does it make an airtight seal, the latches are easy to lock into place. The silicone gasket slips right off for cleaning and slides back into the lid’s channel with no effort.</p>

<p>The OXO performed perfectly in all our tests. It was leakproof, airtight, and the marinara sauce heated evenly in the microwave and oven.

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C6LRW61/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fullstar &#8211; 12-Pack</a> has five different sizes in rectangular, square and round shapes. They’re made of regular polypropylene plastic like the other containers we tested, so after microwaving and dishwashing they got stained and pitted. Its silicone gasket is embedded in the lid’s channel, and it needed to be precisely lined up or the latches wouldn’t close properly.</p>
<p>The Fullstar was leakproof and airtight and remained so after our testing. The container survived the microwave and dishwasher, but its lid warped and became convex.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PSKSG1M/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; 2063704 Easy Find Vented Lids</a> was one of our early favorites. Like traditional Rubbermaid or Tupperware, the lid snaps on top of the container and is then removed with a corner tab. We found the lids very easy to open and close. A square vent, which snaps up and down, is intended for releasing steam in the microwave. The Rubbermaid was the only plastic container that had a lid designed for the microwave.</p>
<p>The Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids design was leakproof, even with the vent. Surprisingly, it was even airtight. But the marinara sauce proved its downfall. After microwaving and dishwashing, the container was deeply stained and massively pitted. Although the lid still closed easily, and the container was still leakproof, it was clear that the Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids wouldn’t last.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NSJ88V8/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sistema &#8211; Klip-It</a> are rectangular, divided containers for storing two different food items. The small size, which comes in a pack of three, are quite tiny, and can only really fit baby carrots and small grapes inside. The 4-cup container is a good size for school or work lunch, and the 8-cup container is for storing leftovers. Two problems plague the Sistema containers: They’re not leakproof or airtight, so if you’re toting something with liquid, expect to find it pooled in the bottom of your bag. Also, the dividers aren’t high enough to reach the lid, so liquid or sauce on one side easily leaks into the opposite side.</p>
<p>We really wanted to love the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071JVT2HC/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vremi &#8211; VRM020376N silicone</a> containers. Their four rectangular sizes are in bright primary colors, and because the containers are made of silicone, they collapse to one-third of their fully expanded height. We researched several silicone containers, and most buckle when you secure the lid, resulting in an explosion of anything liquid inside. The Vremi containers, however, have a rigid lip, so after some practice, we were able to snap on the lid without the sides buckling in.</p>
<p>Sadly, the Vremi was neither leakproof nor airtight, and after its round through the dishwasher, one of the lid’s latches had cracked, and the container reeked of marinara. Great idea but poorly executed.</p>
<h3>Glass</h3>

<p>None of the glass containers showed any signs of damage from the freezer, microwave or dishwasher. The plastic lids, however, differentiated one from the other.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LN7X92K/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glasslock &#8211; 11339</a> was leakproof and airtight, but its hinges were stiff to close. The smaller ends snapped on and off without too much struggle, but there was more resistance from the hinges on the long side of the container. We had to press down very hard to get the hinges to secure. Although the glass container itself is fine, someone with weak hand strength would be frustrated by these lids.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N90AWNF/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1790 &#8211; Glass Meal Prep Containers</a> did well in our tests. The latches were easy to lock and unlock, and when sealed, they were leakproof and airtight. 1790’s label warnings about the glass containers are a bit scary; it’s a long list of don’ts, some in capital letters. The containers are made of durable borosilicate glass, yet the manufacturer states that hot glass could shatter if the container is placed on a countertop, metal surface or sink.</p>
<p>We were justifiably nervous about what to do with the hot 1790 when we removed it from the oven. We opted for the marble counter, and thankfully, no explosion occurred.</p>
<p>After dishwashing, the 1790’s lid was stained and slightly pitted. The latches still closed easily, but now the seal was no longer leakproof.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075BLP5XV/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prep Naturals</a> is a popular brand with people who use the containers for meal prep. The containers are divided in two, so you can store two different portions of food in them. Since the dividing glass wall doesn’t reach the lid, anything that’s liquid on one side will leach into the other side. When sealed, the Prep Naturals were neither leakproof nor airtight; so much water had been absorbed by the tissue, we had to squeeze it out. After dishwashing, the lid was stained and pitted, and the latches were difficult to snap shut. As for cleaning, food particles were trapped between the gasket and the lid and could not be removed.</p>
<p>We tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0157G34AY/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pyrex &#8211; 1123268 Simply Store</a> set, because it was frequently mentioned by Amazon reviewers as their long-time favorite. It passed the freezer, microwave and oven tests, and its lid was not harmed by the dishwasher. From the beginning, however, the lid was difficult to snap on, and we had to pry it off before it would release from the container. Naturally, we thought this would indicate that the Pyrex would be airtight and leakproof. But the Pyrex performed just as poorly as the Prep Naturals.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Plastic food containers are great for storing food in the refrigerator or freezer and for carrying lunch or leftovers to work or school. They’re less expensive than glass, but as our tests showed, microwaving and machine-dishwashing damages both the containers and their lids. You’ll probably want to replace them after a few months of use.</p>
<p>An exception was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; 1977447 Brilliance</a>, our top pick for plastic food container. The Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance was 100-percent leakproof and airtight, and although it stained very slightly — much less than the other plastic containers we tested — its durable Tritan plastic retained clarity and structure over the course of our rigorous tests. It’s a quality product for a reasonable price.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to worry about potential health hazards from plastic, our favorite glass food storage container was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075GRTNN6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; Smart Seal</a>. The OXO is more expensive than other glass containers (not to mention plastic containers), but its unique removable silicone gasket ensures a perfect seal. The OXO is leakproof, airtight, freezer-, microwave- and dishwasher-safe and will hold up for years.<br />

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>When we looked around for opinions of high-end knife enthusiasts, it was clear that value is a very relative scale among knife buyers. In <a href="https://www.kitchenknifeforums.com/threads/beater-most-used-knife.30087" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this thread on Kitchen Knife Forums,</a> a &#8220;beater&#8221; is a $240 handmade piece for one enthusiast, while for another it&#8217;s a dollar-store knife that he customized with his collection of sharpening gear.</p>
<p>Our researcher for this review has been collecting and using knives of all sizes since he got his first Wenger Swiss Army &#8220;MacGyver knife&#8221; at age five or six. Though he long ago gave up his dream of becoming a bladesmith himself, he&#8217;s made a few cooking knives. He grew up around a lovely set of Henckels, and he&#8217;s been peripherally aware of the movings and shakings in the kitchen cutlery world.</p>
<p>Studying reviews from Cook&#8217;s Illustrated, Serious Eats and Wirecutter gave us a list of must-test blades, but also quickly shaped a bell curve for our assessment of the best kitchen knives for the money.</p>
<p>We also made a deep dive into online discussion among the chefs at Cheftalk and the never-ending knife discussions on reddit and the Kitchen Knife Forums.</p>
<p>Then, to take a step back from the hype, we talked to some more wizened experts for their takes on what a cook really needs in a knife.</p>
<p><strong>After consulting with <a href="https://martellknives.com/pages/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dave Martell</a> (long-time kitchen knife sharpener, knife maker and owner of the Kitchen Knife Forums) and Chef David Hendricksen, <a href="https://www.artinstitutes.edu/academics/culinary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national culinary director for the Art Institutes Culinary School</a>, we put together a list of criteria and began comparing retail offerings.</strong></p>
<p>We analyzed the stats and reviews of 39 models and narrowed that group down to 12 finalists. We settled on three groups, each with slightly different goals and priorities:</p>
<p><b>Budget knives:</b> These finalists are a set of rough-and-ready blades with molded handles that were as cheap as $13. Utility knives like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001FEJ0WO/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this one from Kiwi brand</a> are often the real workhorses in professional kitchens, but we wanted to show options more refined than that. We included plastic-handle knives from Victorinox and Wüsthof because they&#8217;re so well-regarded by other reviewers, but we also included a much cheaper knife from Mercer to get a fair comparison of what&#8217;s possible on a shoestring budget.</p>
<p><b>Mid-tier knives:</b> These are knives you can give to a friend as a wedding gift without blowing a $50 budget, but also without being embarrassed by cheap-looking molded handles. The ideal knife in this category is also a great starter blade for someone who wants to up their fine-cooking game but has no intention of learning about steel types or mirror-polished edges.</p>
<p><b>Upgrade knives:</b> We opened up the purse strings a little bit to see what you get for slightly more than a mid-tier knife. A $40 knife should already cut well if you keep it sharp, so we looked specifically for better, harder steel that will hold a razor-sharp edge longer than ordinary knives do.</p>
<p>Knife nerds of all stripes will probably protest that we aren&#8217;t even testing $100 or $200 knives (not to mention the hallowed Kramer designs or other $300+ options you&#8217;ll find at fine retailers). But if you&#8217;re going to shell out more than $100 for a knife, you should really feel it in-hand for yourself.</p>
<p>We can steer you through the important specs and pitfalls of mass-manufactured knives, but it&#8217;s very difficult to tell you what your favorite balance, edge profile and handle shape are going to be. At price brackets above $100, those are the refinements you should be looking for, more a matter of taste than qualities we can list on a chart.</p>

<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>We talked to two kitchen knife experts to narrow down a list of the most important characteristics in a knife. Dave Martell runs the kitchen knife forums, and they get a lot of requests for knife recommendations from new members. We came up with these core questions that you need to ask yourself to make a good knife choice:</p>
<p><strong>Intended use: </strong>What&#8217;s the most important job for your knife? Will you be slicing meat? Chopping root vegetables? Will you ever split an acorn squash? A knife you use for eight hours every day might have different features than something you only use for half an hour every week.</p>
<p><strong>Profile: </strong>Do you want the edge of the knife to be in full contact with the cutting board to get more control, or do you want to &#8220;rock&#8221; it through the food to get more power?</p>
<p><b>Edge geometry: </b>Every knife collector has a preference for the final edge shape. To sum it up, there are basically two paths: First, there are thick, obtuse edges that are robust and easy to re-sharpen. Those more interested in maximum slicing precision prefer thin, acute edges that will slice like a laser but chip more easily if you abuse them. Thin edges also take longer to re-sharpen, and often require practiced skill with a bench stone.</p>
<p><strong>Handle size, shape and materials:</strong>  A handle you hate with a great blade in it will still be a knife you hate. Do you have big hands? Do you prefer a certain way of gripping a knife? Sadly, it&#8217;s hard to tell which handles you&#8217;ll like best from a picture, but you can see the relative sizes in our lineup photos.</p>
<p>Only after you&#8217;ve answered questions about those preferences does Martell suggest looking into other factors. Here are some commonly-mentioned attributes:</p>
<p><b>Balance: </b>If you like to move quickly and make rapid cuts, a light knife with neutral balance can feel more nimble. If you want more power and you&#8217;re cutting for long sessions, you might prefer a blade-heavy knife that keeps weight on the cutting board. An eight-inch blade typically has a neutral or handle-heavy balance, while longer knives will be more and more blade-heavy.</p>
<p><b>Full tang or hidden tang:</b> The steel your knife&#8217;s handle is attached to is called the tang. If you can see the line of steel extending the full length and width of the handle, it&#8217;s called a full tang. It&#8217;s cheaper for manufacturers to cut the tang short and mold a handle around it, though plenty of lovely and expensive knives are made with partial or hidden tangs. The biggest influence of this choice is on balance and weight: a full tang means more weight in the handle and moves the balance point closer to you.</p>
<p><b>Stamped vs. forged:</b> Thirty years ago, if a blade was stamped or cut out of a sheet cookie-cutter style it was usually a sign of a very cheap knife, while all the &#8220;good&#8221; knives were forged to shape from a bar or rod. These days, that distinction is entirely gone. Both forged and stamped-and-welded knives are now made with bolsters, and stamped or laser-cut steel is used in some of the very best collector&#8217;s knives.</p>
<p><b>Steel hardness and toughness:</b> If a manufacturer chooses to make their knives harder, the edges will last longer, but that also makes them more prone to chipping and makes sharpening take longer. Most popular knives are kept on the softer side so a bent-over edge can be burnished back to shape with a honing steel. <a href="#stability-test">See our tests below</a> for a look at how big that difference can be when an edge is thinned out.</p>
<p><b>Steel alloy and wear resistance: </b>Steel is mostly just iron with a pinch of carbon, but other alloying elements can make it even better for certain tasks. More carbon means the steel can get harder, and more chromium adds stain resistance, but in high-carbon stainless the chromium and other elements like vanadium also form extra-hard carbides. Carbides help the steel resist wear, but they make thin edges more prone to breaking. Finding a balance of all these elements and managing heat treatment carefully is how the master bladesmiths stay ahead of the curve.</p>
<p><b>Surface texture:</b> Hammered finishes can show off the connection that your knife has with the smith who forged it. That said, there are plenty of lovely hand-hammered blades that are then carefully polished flat, so a hammered finish is almost always a decorative choice. The texture doesn&#8217;t add anything to the function of the knife unless the pattern is dramatically deep, in which case it might help keep food from sticking to the blade.</p>
<p><b>Patterned blades: </b>Pattern-welded steel is made up from layers of steel that have been stacked, folded and welded together. This specialized material is often called &#8220;Damascus&#8221; steel because of the resemblance to Wootz steel from India and the Middle East, though it&#8217;s made more like <a href="https://youtu.be/gxwWf-MfZVk?t=1156" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Japanese tamahagane</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTMkTEpYPA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nordic pattern-welding</a>. The advantages of these methods are entirely obsolete now that we have precise control over steelmaking, but many collectors still love the look and the tradition behind the pattern.</p>
<p><b>Layers vs. monosteel:</b> Many smiths in Japan prefer to make blades that have layers of softer metal on the sides. Smiths we talked to agree that there&#8217;s no specific benefit to the end user unless you especially want a high-carbon steel core with stainless sides to make maintenance easier.</p>
<p><b>Hollows and stick-resistant finishes:</b> There are a few different ways to approach food sticking to the blade. A true Granton edge (invented by Granton Cutlery) for slicing meat is actually wavy all the way to the edge, something you basically never find on a chef&#8217;s knife. Other manufacturers will grind out hollows in the side of their blades and sometimes call them &#8220;granton edges.&#8221; In Japanese cutlery, you&#8217;re more likely to see hand-forged divots or a dished-out grind profile called &#8220;urasuki&#8221; that keeps food from sticking. We didn&#8217;t buy any chef&#8217;s knives with textured blades, but <a href="#food-release">see our testing results below</a> for what we found out about food release when slicing with chef&#8217;s knives.</p>
<h2 id="budget">How much should you spend?</h2>
<p>So far as performance and value goes, there&#8217;s often a big gap between a mass-produced $100 knife and a handmade $300 specialty piece. When choosing a really high-end knife, you can often pick and choose important factors: A steel with specific characteristics, attractive handle materials and a profile or sharpening style that matches your intended use.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have specific preferences and you want to get the most for your money, though, the difference between a mass-produced $40 knife and most $100 knives is surprisingly small. In some ways this is a testament to the quality of modern $40 knives: Steel quality, factory sharpening and heat treatment are pretty well standardized at this level, with few exceptions. It&#8217;s not the best performance possible, but that mostly means you&#8217;ll just have to sharpen more frequently. Check out our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-knife-sharpener/">kitchen knife sharpener review</a> to see what the options are.</p>
<p>A $100 knife isn&#8217;t doing very much extra to pull out ahead; most are made from the same steels on the same production lines as their budget brethren. You&#8217;ll often get a more prestigious name, and a nicer-looking handle, but the cutting edge itself will usually be identical between a plastic-handle knife and a $150 model.</p>
<p>In German knives, you&#8217;ll typically see a bigger performance improvement by having an expert cutler re-sharpen a $40 knife to a thinner edge than you would by paying for an up-market model from the same manufacturer. <strong>The days when a forged knife from a German manufacturer was clearly superior to their budget line are long gone; the differences are now mostly in handles.</strong></p>
<p>Above $140 you can find the best-selling brands used by chefs who make a long-term investment in their tools: the ubiquitous <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074SVJKDZ/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Henckels</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000N5H2XU/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003B66YKA/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shun</a>, as well as premium-steel offerings from newer brands like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017AED3F2/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Yaxell</a>. The steel in German-made knives typically won&#8217;t be any different than most $40 knives even at this price, but if you look carefully you should be able to find steels that get harder than the ubiquitous German X50CrMoV15 (also called 1.4116) Stainless.</p>
<p>If you want hand-forged, you can sometimes find good, basic knives at less than $200. You won&#8217;t get anything really artisanal, like the alluring &#8220;hamon&#8221; line from careful edge-hardening, until you go above $200-300.</p>
<p>Dave Martell sharpens and sells some very expensive, very beautiful knives, but he warns people not to get caught up in the hype and miss the bigger picture: &#8220;Too many people get hung up on what steels are used and what fancy crap has been added to lure you in. <strong>What matters so much more than that is if the knife is made to perform for its intended task.</strong> If that isn&#8217;t addressed first then what steel the knife is made from will have little meaning.&#8221;</p>
<h2 id="knife-types">What is a chef&#8217;s knife?</h2>
<p>The tradition of the chef&#8217;s knife goes back for centuries, but we learned when talking with our experts that the prototype for nearly every modern chef&#8217;s knife can be traced through the designs used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabatier">two different Sabatier families</a> in Thiers, France, in the 19th Century. The curve of the edge has morphed and evolved slightly as we&#8217;ve developed specific chopping and slicing techniques, but chef&#8217;s knives all feature a &#8220;dropped&#8221; edge that gives your fingers room when you&#8217;re chopping on a cutting board.</p>
<p>The recent influx of Japanese cuisine, Japanese chefs and cross-pollination between Japanese and German manufacturing technique has heavily influenced popular trends in chef&#8217;s knives.</p>
<p>To summarize trends: German manufacturers pioneered the use of stainless steel that is easy to take care of, but not very hard. You can use a honing steel on most Western chef&#8217;s knives and bring back a fairly sharp edge by burnishing and re-aligning the steel that rounds off or rolls over, but it won&#8217;t stay that sharp for more than a day or so of chopping veggies. You can keep using the steel to bring back the edge, but eventually it gets too thick to cut effectively and needs thinning.</p>
<p>In contrast, Japanese chefs expect extra-hard steel finished to a mirror-polished edge, often with a chisel-shaped asymmetrical bevel rather than the same sharpening angle on each side of the blade. <strong>The edges can be thinner, since the expectation is that chefs will be making careful, precise cuts with gyuto knives, while heavy-handed vegetable chopping is reserved for a cleaver-style knife.</strong> These edges last longer, but the hard steel doesn&#8217;t respond well to burnishing with a honing rod, so you&#8217;ll need to learn how to sharpen them yourself or send them away.</p>
<p>Both the German kochmesser and the Japanese gyuto shape are still inspired by the French Sabatier knives. The biggest difference is in handles. German knives tend to have a full-width steel &#8220;tang&#8221; sandwiched between riveted handle &#8220;scales,&#8221; while the traditional &#8220;wa&#8221; handle in Japan is a single, round piece of outer material with a skinny tang inside that you can&#8217;t see. Another characteristic feature of European designs is the bolster, a thickened section of steel that covers the transition from blade to handle.</p>
<p>These days, most Japanese manufacturers also make the Western-style &#8220;yo-handle gyuto&#8221; with the familiar full-tang-and-rivets construction. (The Misono and Tojiro we tested are perfect examples.) Ironically, Wa-handle designs are now very popular among American and British custom knife makers.</p>
<h3>Chopping, slicing and edge thickness</h3>

<p>Another big difference between popular chef&#8217;s knives today is in their belly and edge thickness. <strong>When you look at a blade in profile, a larger radius in the arc of a knife edge is basically the definitive trait of a German chef&#8217;s knife.</strong> More of that &#8220;belly&#8221; curve makes the knife better suited to rocking motions against the cutting board. If the arc is flatter, the knife will have more board contact and can slice long sections with a push or slicing motion.</p>
<p>The thickness of steel behind the final sharpened bevel is probably the biggest influence on the way a knife handles. If you want a stiff blade that can help you crunch through hard root vegetables with its weight, or something that will chop through chicken leg bones, a thicker blade is what you&#8217;re looking for. On the other hand, if you&#8217;re trying to slice ripe tomatoes without squashing them, thinner &#8220;laser&#8221; knives will present less drag and resistance as they slide through.</p>
<h3>How long is too long?</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re slicing something like a large roast, a longer blade will help you work efficiently, cutting as deeply as possible with each stroke. If you&#8217;re mostly chopping carrots, though, you usually don&#8217;t need to make any slicing movement and you can easily cut all the way through with one motion, whether rocking or push-cutting. A dedicated vegetable knife is usually shorter, from five to seven inches, while a dedicated slicer is often as long as 12 inches.</p>
<p>Most home cooks want a chef&#8217;s knife that&#8217;s good for both types of cutting, so the real question is your cutting board. If you&#8217;re limited to an eight-inch cutting board, you might want to look for seven-inch versions of these chef&#8217;s knives just so you&#8217;ll have an easier time maneuvering. If you&#8217;ve got a beautiful 24-inch butcher-block, a 10-inch knife will have plenty of room to maneuver and will be able to mince a large pile of veggies more quickly.</p>
<p>Chef Hendricksen puts it a slightly different way: &#8220;Big knives scare people and an 8-inch is a good size to get work done and not be so intimidating. It’s the starter knife I recommend. If someone is proficient with an 8-inch, they should be able to use other sizes.&#8221;</p>
<h2 id="grip-tips">How should I hold a chef&#8217;s knife?</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re just starting out with a chef&#8217;s knife, you might be unsure about the best way to hold it. So long as you keep your fingers clear of the edge, there&#8217;s nothing specific that you need to learn other than how comfortable the knife feels in your hand while making the cuts or slices you need.</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pushcut.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Slicing by pushing or drawing the edge of the knife through the food you&#8217;re cutting is one of the most efficient ways to use a sharp knife, especially when you&#8217;re cutting something soft or tricky to hold.</p>
<p><strong>Most chefs favor the &#8220;pinch&#8221; grip with the blade itself between thumb and knuckle: This angle is just right so that the back-and-forth slicing movement comes from the strength of your arm, not your wrist or fingers.</strong></p>
<p>Knives with smaller bolsters and simple handle shapes are generally easier to use in this grip, and the Japanese &#8220;wa-handle&#8221; is becoming very popular partly for this reason.<br />
As you can see from the video above, a blade with a deep belly curve almost gets in its own way when push-cutting into the board or making short, quick slices. A flatter edge profile is usually preferred, since the whole edge will finish the cut against the cutting board at the same time.</p>
<p>That said, if you&#8217;re making really long draw-slices, like julienne or matchstick cuts, extra curvature can make things easier (think of a pizza cutter).</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/rock-chop.mov" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>When chopping, even just small, precise chops where the blade rocks against the cutting board, many prefer to keep their fingers wrapped securely around the handle. You don&#8217;t need anything fancy to chop well, but if you&#8217;re putting a lot of force into your chop for stringy or hard materials, a contoured or cushioned grip can be nice.<br />
The bigger difference here comes from blade shape: A full, rounded &#8220;belly&#8221; makes rocking the knife that much easier.</p>
<h2 id="stainless-vs-carbon">Can stainless steel be good enough?</h2>
<p>About 100 years ago, cutlery manufacturers started using chromium-rich &#8220;stainless&#8221; steels in knives. The appeal is obvious: Stainless steel prevents tough-to-clean rust spots, and the chromium layer that forms naturally on the surface of stainless steel also keeps the steel from leaving a metallic taste in food.</p>
<p>Without careful heat treatment, though, stainless steel is less ideal for knife edges than simple carbon steels or specialized &#8220;tool steels.&#8221; Early stainless steel had a terrible reputation for being soft, and even with modern heat treatment methods the old recipes for 420 and &#8220;surgical&#8221; stainless are often derided as &#8220;junk.&#8221;</p>
<p>New alloys with more and more carbon appeared on the scene and allow the steel to get harder than that early stainless steel, and as more carbon is added the chromium and other elements also combine with it to create hard, wear-resistant carbide grains within the steel.</p>
<p><strong>With more extreme carbide-rich alloys, steel is more wear-resistant, but also more prone to chipping when edges are thin.</strong></p>
<p>The industry standard is x50CrMoV15 stainless steel (also listed as 1.4116 or frequently as &#8220;German stainless&#8221;), with a middling amount of carbon and usually a hardness of only 55 or 56 on the Rockwell scale compared to 59 or low 60s for other knives and tools. This low hardness prevents chipping, and ensures you can still easily sharpen the edge by running it across a steel honing rod to bend or scrape it back to shape.</p>
<p>Those who seek to push the envelope look to other alloys that allow thinner edges and better wear resistance. AUS-8 and its evolved cousin, VG-10, are the gold standards for Japanese stainless knives.</p>
<p>Often considered an ideal balance of toughness and wear resistance, VG-10 has just enough carbon to allow more hardness and wear-resistant carbides that will give a busy chef a few days more between sharpening touch-ups.</p>
<p>The big name to look out for if you&#8217;re seeking a specific alloy is AEB-L (the trademark from Austrian steel mill Böhler-Uddeholm) and 13c26 (from Swedish mill Sandvik.) This steel was formulated for use in razors; it&#8217;s basically the finest-grained stainless steel out there, which means edges resist chipping even when the steel is extra hard.</p>
<p>Sadly, we didn&#8217;t find any affordable knives to test that use AEBL, though rumor has it that&#8217;s what Zwilling uses it in their little-known <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074T3R6VS/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Diplome chef&#8217;s knife</a> and Misono uses it in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Misono-UX10-Gyutou-8-2-21cm/dp/B000XSX8IA/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">frequently-sold-out UX10</a>.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t mind the staining and want something as easy as possible to sharpen, Carbon steel knives are still available, both from European and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G5HBRW2/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Japanese</a> factories. If anything, they&#8217;re easier to find now than they were 10 years ago due to growing interest among chefs and enthusiasts.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re buying a high-end piece, makers like Bob Kramer, Murray Carter and Dave Martell will often use carbon steel with a refined and customized heat treatment to get top performance from a knife. You&#8217;re going to want to clean a knife like that very diligently anyhow, so the lack of stain-resistance is often less of a concern. Some chefs even cherish the dark patina that develops on their prized carbon steel blades.</p>
<p>For the most part, the real advantage that carbon steel used to have over stainless — namely, a heat treatment that makes knives hard enough for extra-thin edges that aren&#8217;t brittle — is missing in mass-produced carbon steel blades. Factory-made blades in the West are almost always tempered on the softer side to maximize toughness and to make sharpening easier. Bringing modern stainless steels to an equivalent level of performance is now common practice, and you don&#8217;t gain much by stepping back in time.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We spent three months using these knives in a home kitchen. We made Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners, stew and soups, and diced over fifteen pounds of onions.</p>
<p>We bought a five-pound bag of carrots and chopped them with wet hands to see how the grip of each knife changed in stressful situations. We also sliced yams to see how the knives fared in hard vegetables with enough cross-section that thicker blades will wedge stuck.</p>
<h3>Slicing Performance</h3>
[table id=229 /]
<p>In the kitchen, easy slicing is the quality that&#8217;s most important. Even if you have a knife that&#8217;s perfect in every other way, a blade that won&#8217;t slice through food is just going to stay in a drawer.</p>
<p>One feature of kitchen knives that&#8217;s often talked about, but rarely quantified, is the thickness of a blade. <b>We measured each blade with a micrometer to check the thickness at the spine as well as the thickness immediately behind the edge, where it can start to wedge in food if it&#8217;s too thick. </b>Thinner blades slice better but are also more flexible, which is a slight liability if you&#8217;re using a lot of force when cutting hard root vegetables.</p>
<p>Weight is another consideration: A light blade is easier to lift and move quickly, but a heavier blade can help you chop and slice efficiently. We also checked how far toward the tip or handle the balance point is, measuring from the heel of the blade. There&#8217;s no perfect weight or balance for a knife, as that&#8217;s definitely a matter of preference, so we hope our chart will help demonstrate the differences if you can&#8217;t hold the knives for yourself.</p>
<p>The standout performers in slicing tests are thin blades with extra-thin edges. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000UAPQGS/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tojiro &#8211; DP</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079S3G9KZ/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nexus &#8211; BD1N</a> are great slicers, as we expected, but the thin edge of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002R1CGV6/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mercer &#8211; Renaissance</a> was a nice surprise. It used to be that budget knives were just flat pieces of sheet steel sharpened on one edge, but all the blades we tested are ground across the whole blade to make an elegant, thin wedge. Even the most disappointing knife in this group can cut tomatoes without squashing them, so long as it&#8217;s kept sharp.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XT4GJO/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Misono &#8211; Molybdenum Steel Gyuto</a> is a rare exception to the thinner-is-better rule: The asymmetrical edge that it comes with is ideal for some push-cutting tasks once you get used to it, but for peeling, carving and other tasks where you need to control the width of the section you&#8217;re slicing off, it steers your hand quite a lot.</p>

The way some vegetables stick to a knife blade when you&#8217;re cutting thin slices can be annoying. We compared all of these chef&#8217;s knives with an old santoku-style chopping knife that has hollows ground into the side of its blade, and we&#8217;re reassured that these features are nearly always a placebo at best. The one spec that seems to matter here is the cross-section of a blade&#8217;s cutting edge: the thickest edges we tested did seem to stick less than the thinner blades.</p>
<p>There are specialized slicing knives that have specific features to &#8220;hack&#8221; this problem, but they&#8217;re generally not as versatile as a regular chef&#8217;s knife. If you&#8217;re slicing roast all day a true Granton edge is probably worth looking into, and if you&#8217;re making paper-thin veggie slices for delicate displays you should check out the specialized Japanese &#8220;usuba&#8221; knife style.</p>

<p>After measuring the initial sharpening angle with a goniometer and checking factory sharpness on our BESS tester for the sake of posterity, we killed the edges on a sharpening stone and then re-sharpened them, first by hand to get a feel for how easy each steel sharpens, and then with the winner of our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-knife-sharpener/">knife sharpener review</a>, the Chef&#8217;sChoice &#8211; 1520, on its 15 degree setting.</p>
<p>We also used fine-grained ceramic stones on the Spyderco &#8211; Sharpmaker to deburr and polish the edges after sharpening. We stropped the edges occasionally with a chromium oxide-loaded leather paddle to see how easy it was to keep an ultra-sharp edge on each steel.</p>
<p>We checked sharpness again after our cutting sessions to see which steels have the best edge retention. The VG-10 on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000UAPQGS/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tojiro &#8211; DP Gyuto</a> definitely lived up to its reputation as full-strength Japanese steel, both because of how long the edge lasts and because of how much longer it took to sharpen.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079S3G9KZ/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BD1N steel in the Nexus</a> is a strong performer in a different way: easier to sharpen, slightly less wear resistant. We&#8217;re not able to provide a controlled edge retention test, but we think it&#8217;s well worth a little bit less wear resistance to get easier sharpening.</p>
<p>After our edge stability and repair tests, the Nexus earned our pick for the best real-world performance, but if you&#8217;re cutting into something more abrasive that wears the edge instead of rolling it, you may prefer the VG-10 steel in the Tojiro or Greater Goods knives.</p>

<h3 id="stability-test">Edge stability</h3>
<p>A test of wear resistance is common among knife enthusiasts looking to sort out which steels and heat treatments are superior for cutting abrasive material like cardboard or rope. For a veggie slicer, though, abrasive wear isn&#8217;t the primary reason your edge goes away: Instead, pressing the edge into the cutting board (not to mention bone or glass serving dishes) rolls over or chips away the micron-thick edge.</p>
<p>Steel is hardened by heat treatment that changes the structure on a molecular level. When steel is hard, it will still flex just as much as soft steel of the same thickness. (Springs are very hard, but also very thin.) The opposite of hardness is not flexibility, but toughness, more precisely called ductility.</p>
<p>A ductile or tough blade will spring back and forth up to a point, but when you flex it past what its strength can handle a tough blade will permanently bend instead of snapping. Tough steel can even be bent back to shape, though it is weakened. <strong>Put another way, hard steel can stand up to slightly more pressure on the edge than soft steel before it&#8217;s damaged, but when you push it past the limit harder steel will be more likely to chip.</strong></p>
<p>A fine grain in the molecular structure of the steel allows a thin edge to be hard (so it resists that bending or &#8220;rolling&#8221; sideways when pushed to the limit) without being brittle. Metallurgist Roman Landes <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=sko_PQAACAAJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popularized the term &#8220;edge stability&#8221; in his research</a> to determine which steels are best at holding a thin edge.</p>
<p>Whatever knife you settle on, choosing an edge angle when sharpening that&#8217;s appropriate for what you&#8217;re cutting is crucial to keeping your knife sharp. Hard material like bone requires a higher edge angle than raw fish does. If you can get a hard-yet-stable steel that doesn&#8217;t chip on the materials you&#8217;re cutting, though, you can make the edge thinner.</p>
<p>You can measure hardness with the Rockwell test, where a calibrated instrument presses a diamond tip into the steel. It&#8217;s tricky, though, to get a consistent reading on thin, wedge-shaped blades (and impossible on laminated blades with soft outer layers). We looked for another test that would directly measure the ability of a knife edge to withstand abuse.</p>
<p>We consulted with metallurgist <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Larrin Thomas</a> to design a test, inspired by Landes&#8217;s methods, that would show differences in the ways our knives resist both rolling and chipping. Larrin is working on his own set of tests for comparing steels, but he suggested adapting the &#8220;brass rod test&#8221; popularized by bladesmiths like the late Wayne Goddard.</p>

<p>Our test uses a steel rod held by one end at a fixed distance above the edge of a table; the knives were clamped to the table so that the rod rested on the edge at a 30-degree angle. We experimented with weights to find the limits of representative steels. <strong>At 15 pounds of weight hanging from the 30-degree rod, soft steels bent into a divot, while brittle steels (like a sample of the ultra-wear-resistant CPM-S90V alloy from one of our tester&#8217;s utility knives) broke away in a pretty serious chip.</strong></p>
<p>We took a representative set of our kitchen knives in the different steels (and from different price levels) and thinned out the edge to a uniform 12 degrees per side. This is a more acute edge than any commercial sharpening device will make, but it&#8217;s a good benchmark for what you can get when hand-sharpening to maximize slicing ability.</p>
<p>The results are translated to an out-of-five scale in our chart, but we measured each deformation with calipers and again by measuring the width in a macro photograph.</p>
<p>The harder blades made from high-carbon alloys like AUS-8, BD1N and VG-10 were the most resilient in this test, with the smallest deflections from the rod pressing against the edge. This should translate well into resistance to the kind of damage your knife gets from bones, plates and scraping against the cutting board.</p>
<p>We were surprised not to see any damage in the form of chips in this test, since in hard-but-tough tool steels like CPM-M4 (a popular pick for &#8220;blade sport&#8221; cutting competitions against rope and wood) we had already seen minor chipping when we set up the controls for the test. These kitchen knives, even the ones on the harder end of the scale, are probably tempered specifically to resist chipping.</p>
<p>The softer German-style knives all bent over pretty severely in this test, with bent sections averaging at more than 1 mm. This means that a 12-degree edge (which is close to the factory setting for many of these knives) is probably too acute for general-purpose use with these knives. Our test is quite extreme compared to slicing onions, but it&#8217;s a real test of relative strength.</p>
<p>The best score was from the Nexus at only 0.45 mm of damage, and the Tojiro close behind at 0.50 mm. These edges have enough strength that you could sharpen to an even more acute edge if you want razor-blade levels of slicing performance. (<a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-straight-razor/">The straight razors we&#8217;ve reviewed</a> go as low as 7 degrees, which is definitely too thin an edge for these knives.)</p>
<h3>Sharpening and repair</h3>
<p>After testing and photographing the deformations in the knife edges, we ran them across a carbide pull-through sharpening device (the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NB5EGEW/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brod &amp; Taylor &#8211; Classic</a>) to see which steels are easy to repair. This process straightens out the deformation from our test, but only if the thin steel edge is ductile (or &#8220;tough&#8221;) enough.</p>
<p>The softer German steel in most knives is tempered enough that it reshapes easily with the Brod &amp; Taylor or a steel &#8220;honing&#8221; rod. Of the harder blades (which aren&#8217;t typically sharpened in this fashion), the finer grain in the AUS-8 steel from Misono and the BD1N steel from Nexus also survived realigning to a straight edge. With the more wear-resistant VG-10 blades from Tojiro and Greater Goods, when we sliced some phone book paper after the repair procedure, small chips were easy to feel.</p>

<p>If you want to use waterstones for sharpening, an edge that resists wearing away against your cutting board and an edge that&#8217;s easy to sharpen have basically opposite qualities. VG-10 takes more work to sharpen than these other steels, and it&#8217;s more fragile, but it&#8217;ll hold that edge for longer. VG-10 isn&#8217;t as difficult to work with as some crazy-carbide-content alloys used in high-end pocket knives, but still, forget about maintaining it with just a steel.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re ready to invest in a set of fast-cutting water stones for freehand sharpening, or <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-knife-sharpener/">a powered sharpening device like our pick for best sharpener</a>, VG-10 is a great steel. The hardness we saw in these tests hasn&#8217;t lead to fragility you should worry about. But, if you want something that you can maintain for months with just a honing rod or a strop, a tougher steel will definitely be a better pick.</p>
<p>The Nexus uses new BD1N steel, which is a great compromise. This knife should resist chipping and other severe edge damage much better than VG-10. It can be maintained with a honing steel, but we still think a sharpener like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G8R4XSW/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spyderco Sharpmaker</a> is a good idea for keeping the edge in tip-top shape.</p>
<h3>Stain resistance</h3>
<p>We smeared each of the knives with lemon juice and mustard, and after we cleaned the knives a day later, there was no staining or etching left behind. These steels are all have enough chromium in the mix to meet the classic &#8220;stainless&#8221; definiton, so it&#8217;s not a surprising result.</p>

<p>If you want a knife that can hold a sharp edge for longer but is still easy to sharpen, look no further than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079S3G9KZ/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nexus &#8211; BD1N 8&#8243; Chef&#8217;s Knife</a>. This is a knife designed and manufactured exclusively for CutleryandMore.com. While there are a few other blades on the market made with similar specs, this one comes in at about half the price.</p>
<p>The accepted wisdom in cutlery design has always been that you can only have hard or tough knives, not both. The Nexus doesn&#8217;t do anything magical — there are limits to how much abuse this knife can take, and it won&#8217;t hold its edge forever — but this knife will require less work to maintain in the long run, and for a home cook that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>
<p>The important distinction this knife achieves with its BD1N steel is that you get great edge stability (it won&#8217;t blunt as quickly from slamming into a cutting board or hitting a bone) while also being fairly easy to sharpen. The VG-10 steel used in Tojiro&#8217;s fan-favorite DP series is also impressively resilient, but it takes more work to sharpen when it eventually wears down.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re accustomed to using a &#8220;honing&#8221; steel with your knives, the Nexus will actually let you carry on to a certain extent without damaging the edge the way you would most wear-resistant Japanese knives. You&#8217;re still better off using a waterstone or even an <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-knife-sharpener/">electric sharpener</a> for maintenance, but if you see rolled-over divots in the edge, the Nexus will tolerate repair strokes to reset the edge.</p>

<p>The handle of the Nexus is made from G-10, the same fiberglass-reinforced resin that circuit boards are cut from. This stuff is basically indestructible unless you hit it hard enough to crack it. We don’t recommend washing any knife in the dishwasher, but this material will stand up to that abuse as well as any other handle.</p>
<h3>What about flaws?</h3>
<p>There are a few reasons you might not like the Nexus, and they&#8217;re considerations you should take seriously.</p>

<p>First, the knife we bought had an obvious blemish along the spine that probably came from a slip when someone was &#8220;crowning&#8221; that edge with a nice, smooth rounded finish. <strong>This is a forgivable blemish on a $60 knife, but if you get one with a mark like this you could probably get it exchanged.</strong> We should note that other reviews are quite favorable regarding finish quality.</p>
<p>Second, the handle isn&#8217;t our favorite. It&#8217;s rounded and polished, which isn&#8217;t a bad thing, but the tapered shape doesn&#8217;t always lend itself to a secure grip. Even if you&#8217;re a pinch-grip acolyte who cares more about the bolster than the handle, the lack of meat at the front half of the handle feels less comfortable for extended use than many of the others we tested.</p>
<p>Finally, this blade feels even thinner than it actually is. We were surprised when we checked and found that the spine thickness is greater than that on the Greater Goods &#8211; 0556; it feels more whippy when you&#8217;re trying to <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/video/jacques-p%C3%A9pin-peeling-crushing-and-chopping-garlic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smash garlic into a paste the way you remember Jacques Pépin doing it</a>. This feeling mostly comes from the narrow transition area right in front of the handle, typical for a &#8220;yo-gyuto&#8221; East-meets-West handle style.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079S3G9KZ/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nexus &#8211; BD1N</a> is an innovative and affordable knife that stands out from the pack.</li>
<li>A few scuffs mar an otherwise excellent finish.</li>
<li>This is a new blade steel that keeps an extra-fine edge without being fragile.</li>
<li>G-10 handle material will withstand anything, though the polished finish is a bit slippery.</li>
<li>The weight and grind are a good compromise; neither a clunky beater nor a fragile laser.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L2I4SM4/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greater Goods &#8211; Nourish 0556 Japanese Damascus Steel 8&#8243; Chef&#8217;s Knife</a> is a budget-friendly knife made to match all the specs and features that used to be exclusive to high-end Japanese cutlery.</p>
<p>Pattern-welded steel wrapped around the VG-10 core doesn&#8217;t cut any differently or make it a better tool, but it&#8217;s a distinctive look some people love. <strong>The consistent finish overall is also notable at this price, with no grinder marks or scuffs showing anywhere.</strong> The wood-grain pattern of the steel layers will also hide scratches better than a plain, polished blade, but the &#8220;road&#8221; of core steel next to the edge has been polished to a mirror finish. It&#8217;s only an imitation of traditional Japanese craftsmanship, but it looks very impressive.</p>
<p>What makes this cut better than an average chef&#8217;s knife is that hard, wear-resistant core. This is the same Hitachi VG-10 steel that&#8217;s used by Miyabi, Shun and other better-known Japanese factories in their top-shelf knives. VG-10 has enough carbon that it can get very hard, and alloying elements like vanadium help it resist wearing down for longer than simpler steels.</p>
<p>If you like knives that are light and nimble, this isn&#8217;t a top pick. At 8.6 ounces, it&#8217;s the second-heaviest knife we tested, and the balance point is more than a half-inch behind the bolster. It&#8217;s not unwieldy, and one tester found the weight reassuring, but if you&#8217;re spending long days in the kitchen a blade-heavy design will usually make work easier.</p>
<p>The handle design is deliberately modern, rather than mimicking a classic shape, but it works very well. Unlike some knives, the handle isn&#8217;t contoured in an awkward way; there&#8217;s a gentle taper to the rounded-square cross section. The handle material is polyoxymethylene (POM) plastic  — not exactly high-end, but it&#8217;s a reliable, durable choice that serves very well on quite a few more expensive knives.</p>
<p>Greater Goods chose a balanced blade grind and a rounded edge profile for this knife, and that means it&#8217;s a versatile kitchen tool. It won&#8217;t slide through tomatoes quite as easily, but it also feels less flimsy than the Misono, Tojiro and Nexus knives. It&#8217;s one-thousandth of an inch thinner behind the edge than the Victorinox, with the same thickness at the spine.</p>

The thickness and weight hold it back from being the best slicer, but it's versatile and very attractive mounted on the included magnetic wall holder.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L2I4SM4/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p><strong>As good as all of those specs are on paper, using steel from Japan isn&#8217;t the same thing as having Japanese mastery in heat-treating.</strong> This blade had 0.7 mm divots after our edge stability tests, compared to the 0.5 mm dents that Tojiro allowed with the same steel.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s still well above the soft German steels at over 1.0 mm, but we&#8217;ll speculate that the Chinese factory is deliberately making it softer than the Japanese like it. Sadly, running a conventional hardness test is impossible: The standard Rockwell hardness tester pushes a diamond point into the side of a flat piece of steel, and the other steel layers on the sides of these knives would make that measurement meaningless.</p>
<p>We wish that Greater Goods had tried to get a harder heat treatment instead of spending on the pattern-welded steel and polishing. All things considered, though, it&#8217;ll hold an edge for longer than any other knife we&#8217;ve seen at this low price.</p>
<p>A downside to VG-10 is that you can&#8217;t really bring back a damaged edge with a honing steel the way you can with a softer edge. VG-10 will just make a ragged razor-ribbon at the edge when you try to burnish it.</p>
<p>Instead, you&#8217;re much better off sticking with abrasive sharpening: Waterstones are the traditional choice, but a motorized pull-through sharpener that uses abrasive wheels (like our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-knife-sharpener/">top knife sharpener picks</a>) also works quite well. Make sure to use a sharpener with a 15-degree edge angle, and put masking or packing tape on the sides of the blade to prevent scratching the decorative finish.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re extra-diligent about knife care, the Spyderco Sharpmaker is a great choice for weekly touch-ups and requires less of a learning curve than benchtop stones. That said, you&#8217;d definitely want to buy the optional coarser-grade diamond or CBN abrasive rods for repair sharpening if you manage to chip a VG-10 knife; you&#8217;d be sharpening for a very long time with the included medium-grit stones.</p>
<p>The fact that this knife includes a well-designed magnetic mounting puck also means this kit has everything you need to outfit a minimalist kitchen. The versatility of the blade style, comfortable handle and low price make this knife an easy recommendation.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000UAPQGS/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tojiro &#8211; DP Gyuto</a> is a perennial favorite among the kitchen knife enthusiasts on the web. A few years ago this knife was even less expensive, but mainstream popularity has brought the price up and made it less of a standout value. The popularity isn&#8217;t all negative, though, since this knife is easy to find.</p>
<p>Tojiro tied for the thinnest knife we tested, just 0.012&#8243; behind the edge. The factory edge was one of the sharpest we tested, and it slices both soft and hard vegetables very well.</p>
<p>The Tojiro isn&#8217;t going to impress anyone next to a Shigefusa or other hand-finished custom knife, but it has no major flaws. Tojiro only does the bare minimum to smooth rough edges and make the handle comfortable, but it&#8217;s a solid version of the classic East-meets-West design. The heel of the blade is left as a sharp 90-degree corner, which some people prefer, but it&#8217;s also easy to round off on a sharpening stone if you&#8217;re worried about accidentally snagging it on something.</p>
<p>Tojiro doesn&#8217;t say what the handle is made from. It seems to be some kind of layered composite like Micarta, and the very slightly raised edges on the rivets mean it&#8217;s probably a tiny bit less stable during humidity changes than the G-10 material used on the Nexus.</p>

Hard VG-10 steel gives you a long-lasting edge if you take care of it, and it's extra-thin for easy slicing. The soft layers on the side are easy to scuff, though.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000UAPQGS/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If there&#8217;s a downside to the Tojiro, it&#8217;s maintenance. <b>The VG-10 steel has alloy elements that resist wear, which means you won&#8217;t have to sharpen it as frequently, but you&#8217;re going to have to work harder to sharpen it when that time comes.</b> There are plenty of solutions on the market to getting this blade back to a keen edge, like <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-knife-sharpener/">our favorite electric knife sharpener</a>, but if you want to take a shot at hand-sharpening with a waterstone it&#8217;s just that much more work than the other knives we tested.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using the Tojiro in the kind of kitchen where people are sometimes cutting against ceramics and metal, you&#8217;re going to be spending even more time sharpening a blade like this. The Nexus resists damage a tiny bit better and is easier to repair.</p>

<p>The other downside to Tojiro&#8217;s steel choice is that they layer a softer steel on either side of the extra-hard core. This looks kind of neat, but that softer steel is vulnerable to scratches. If you&#8217;re using a magnetic knife bar or an electric sharpener, be prepared to see scratches and &#8220;snail-trail&#8221; marks.</p>
<p>Like the Nexus, this is a blade that&#8217;s too thin for some jobs; it&#8217;s a symmetrical edge grind, but it&#8217;s a refined slicer more than than a work-horse chopper. If you&#8217;re accustomed to full-bellied chef&#8217;s knives for rocking up and down on the cutting board, this shape will take some getting used to.</p>
<p>The price is also less of a bargain than we&#8217;d like. If you&#8217;re chasing Japanese-style slicing performance, this is probably still the best place to get it, but the Greater Goods will be a more comfortable knife for many home cooks at a much better price.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000UAPQGS/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tojiro &#8211; DP</a> is a great pick for a first Japanese-style blade.</li>
<li>This is an excellent blade for careful work, but less forgiving than our top pick if you&#8217;re enthusiastic about chopping.</li>
<li>The hard VG-10 edge steel is sandwiched between soft side layers, and they scuff easily.</li>
<li>Other Japanese knives can be had at a better value, but this model is easy to find.</li>

<p>Mercer is one of the most popular knife brands in culinary schools, mostly because they sell prepackaged kits that make one-stop shopping easy and affordable for students. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002R1CGV6/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Renaissance Chef&#8217;s knife</a> is Mercer&#8217;s full-tang, half-bolster styling, with a look and construction quality that matches the Classic series from Wüsthof but at a significantly lower price.</p>

The edge is thin and sharp, and the finishing work is impeccable at any price.

<p>Mercer gets a bad rap among enthusiasts who prefer the hard steel of Japanese knives, but if you&#8217;re looking for a softer, easy-to-maintain knife anyhow, the Renaissance keeps up with the best sub-$100 knives from the European manufacturers.</p>
<p>Chef Hendricksen gave the low-cost Mercer knives his vote for a great way to save money and build a set that focuses on your needs: &#8220;I’ve used all sorts of knives. I have been very happy with the Mercer tools. Chefs often have an advantage over others where they can talk to the reps from the knife companies about the intended use and preferences. The reps know that marketing will only last so long and the tools need to do the job. Remember that knives are tools and it’s the cook that makes the food.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Also best knife set for the money: Mercer</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MRU46DS/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mercer&#8217;s basic block set</a> is attractive and a good value if you actually want every knife it includes. Most of the knives we included in this roundup are available in sets, but Mercer has the widest range of options and the best price for a starter set.</p>

The six-piece set is still more than most people need, and a block-sized bread knife is shorter than we like, but this is a giftable, complete set.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MRU46DS/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079RVH887/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nexus Chef-and-paring knife set</a> is a close value contender in our estimation, but we don&#8217;t think the other knives in their line are the same bargain as the chef&#8217;s knife. (You&#8217;re not wearing the edge of your bread knife away against the cutting board, after all.) If you want to mix-and-match your knives, the Nexus pair might be a perfect place to start, but if you want to build a full block with the same styles, Mercer offers a better value.</p>

The worst thing about block sets is that they give you an excuse to just pull out a different knife, even a knife that&#8217;s badly suited to the task at hand, because you&#8217;ve already been using your favorite knife and it&#8217;s dirty. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with having multiple tools that can do the same job, but most of us don&#8217;t need a three-inch, five-inch and six-inch knife in the same set. Fortunately, Mercer makes it easy for you to buy their knives one at a time, still for a great price.</p>
<p>One of our knife experts, Dave Martell, sums up knife blocks like this: &#8220;I say put your money into a few really nice knives vs. a whole bunch of mediocre ones.&#8221; Most people will be served best by a simple set with the 8&#8243; chef&#8217;s knife (or the 10&#8243; if you&#8217;ve got room on your cutting board), along with a paring knife and a 10&#8243; or longer serrated bread knife. Martell&#8217;s personal standards for &#8220;really nice&#8221; are probably different than most of ours, but the principle applies if your budget is $50 or $1,000.</p>
<p>Martell also recommended getting a good non-serrated slicing knife for carving, while culinary instructors like Chef Hendricksen like to see a boning knife as a part of a first set. Being able to get knives that fit the way you cook is key.</p>
<p><strong>The option to buy knives that are longer than eight inches is the best reason not to buy a knife set: Manufacturers only started making chef&#8217;s knives, slicers and bread knives in eight-inch lengths because it&#8217;s so much cheaper to make (and ship) a knife block if it only needs to hold eight-inch knives.</strong> The bread knife is the big let-down in the Renaissance block set: it&#8217;s only 8 inches. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016BRBYBE/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Mercer &#8211; Millennia bread knife</a> doesn&#8217;t have a matching handle, but for sawing through a thick loaf the longer 10-inch edge really does help.</p>
<p>One perk of buying one at a time is that you can pick and choose from other manufacturers, too. You could combine Mercer&#8217;s bread knife with the Nexus for chopping veggies and a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003VME12M/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tojiro Yanagiba</a> for slicing, for example. But if you want a matched set you can still add all the essentials and a few specialty tools from the Mercer &#8211; Renaissance line without spending $300+ like you would with more recognizable brands.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t get your knife set with a block, where will you store them? Wall-mounted magnetic knife storage is an option that doesn&#8217;t take up counter space, and can hold basically any combination of knives you prefer. We&#8217;ve bought <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016ISHAC8/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this bar from Modern Innovations</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DCBTEZK/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this set with hooks from Unique Effects</a>. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JLCHFTQ/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">This walnut strip from Kurouto</a> is also a good buy &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t have an ugly logo on the front the way some wooden strips do.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002R1CGV6/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mercer &#8211; Renaissance</a> knives perform just as well as the big German brands at one third the price.</li>
<li>The fit and finish on the chef and paring knives is perfect.</li>
<li>Mercer&#8217;s softer steel and thicker edges are easy to maintain, though not as impressive as thinner knives.</li>
<li>If you want a matched set, the Renaissance series is easy to get with just the pieces you need.</li>

Misono is one of the mainstays of knifemaking in Seki, Japan. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XT4GJO/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Misono Molybdenum series</a> (named for the notable alloying element in the steel) is their least-expensive line, but it&#8217;s finished with the same attention to detail as their more expensive models.</p>
<p>This knife performed very well in our slicing and edge stability tests. <strong>If you&#8217;re looking for an extra-thin blade, this one won&#8217;t disappoint.</strong> The AUS-8 steel is a popular choice for Japanese cutlery; it’s not as wear-resistant as the VG-10 in the Tojiro, but that also means it&#8217;s easier to sharpen.</p>

If you're looking for something elegant, Misono executes this laser-thin slicer very well.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XT4GJO/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>This is another Japanese blade with a sharp corner at the heel; if you&#8217;re not expecting a knife to have a sharp edge there, be careful not to catch it on towels when drying. It&#8217;s quite easy to round the corner on a cheap sharpening stone if you&#8217;re of the opinion that it shouldn&#8217;t be so pointy.</p>
<p>The one caveat with this knife (and many other Japanese knives) is that it&#8217;s sharpened to an asymmetrical edge: We measured 17 degrees on the left side, 25 degrees on the right. <strong>This means it will &#8220;steer&#8221; slightly to the right if you try to make a long, smooth push-cut, kind of like the way an airplane wing creates lift when slicing through the air.</strong> For careful chopping and slicing most food, it works well, but it made some cuts, like peeling potatoes, far more difficult.</p>

Mercer makes <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000PS2XI4/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">an entire line of Millennia knives</a> for students, commercial kitchens and anyone else who just needs a cheap knife that&#8217;s easy to maintain. We&#8217;re not going to soften our critique of this knife — the price is low for a reason. These knives use bottom-of-the-barrel X30Cr13 steel that&#8217;s even cheaper than the X50CrMoV15 steel used by the big names in mass-produced knives. About the best thing that can be said about this steel is that it&#8217;s very easy to sharpen.</p>
<p><strong>That said, the difference between this $15 knife and the OXO or IKEA knife is that it&#8217;s actually comfortable to use.</strong> The edge is just as thin as the Wüsthof and Victorinox, so this a great slicer when it&#8217;s fresh off the sharpener. For slicing through raw yams, this budget-friendly knife actually has top slicing performance.</p>

They're not glamorous, but if you keep them sharp they do their job well. The handle is comfortable without getting in the way, and the factory sharpening is set up perfectly for most chopping chores.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000PS2XI4/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The handle on the Millennia is both cushioned and grippy. Pinching the textured sides of the bolster area isn&#8217;t quite the same as pinching the sides of the blade in a chef&#8217;s pinch-grip, but it&#8217;s right at the balance point and gives good control while remaining comfortable. It&#8217;s a much easier handle to get used to than the Wüsthof, and this one won&#8217;t get in the way when sharpening.</p>

<h3>Victorinox &#8211; Fibrox</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008M5U1C2/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fibrox chef&#8217;s knife</a> has topped budget-knife lists for as long as we can remember, and it&#8217;s a nice knife that knows how to find its place in a busy kitchen.</p>
<p>If the Fibrox were as cheap as it used to be, it would have ranked higher, but Victorinox has started enforcing a &#8220;minimum advertised price&#8221; policy with online retailers. <strong>When you can easily buy the Mercer &#8211; Renaissance in the same steel with a nicer full-tang handle and bolster for $10 less, it&#8217;s hard to say that the Victorinox is a good value, let alone a bargain.</strong></p>
<p>Made from the same plain old X50CrMoV15 steel that&#8217;s used by the rest of the European cutlery industry, about the only thing that&#8217;s remarkable about this knife is the grip. The Fibrox material feels grippy and soft without feeling sticky like rubber or silicone grips. The molded bolster is still too far forward for easy use with an electric sharpener, but it&#8217;s not as bad as the Wüsthof.</p>
<h3>Wüsthof &#8211; Pro Cook&#8217;s Knife</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008GRUNOC/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wüsthof &#8211; Pro Cook&#8217;s Knife</a> is one of the more unique designs in the budget bracket. The belly radius of the edge is fuller than most, which makes it good for rock-chopping. The blade is sharpened well and ground to a nice, thin edge, and there&#8217;s a buffed wavy-mirror polish on the sides of the blade that give it a bit of distinction.</p>
<p>The handle is a grippy, rubbery material that&#8217;s molded to stay in your hand no matter what. That said, the molded bolster gets in the way if you prefer a pinch-grip, and it prevents sharpening all the way to the heel if you&#8217;re using an electric sharpener.</p>
<p>Like the Victorinox, this could be a good budget pick if it were actually budget-priced. When we bought our test lineup it was twice as expensive as the Mercer &#8211; Millennia, and only $7 less than the traditional looks and construction of the Mercer &#8211; Renaissance. If you find one on sale for $20, it&#8217;s a good utilitarian knife, but don&#8217;t expect more than that.</p>
<h3>Tramontina &#8211; Pro Chef&#8217;s Knife</h3>
<p>Tramontina makes their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073BYNFKV/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pro Chef&#8217;s knife</a> with a drop-forge process just like all the big-name manufacturers used to do fifty years ago. These methods and styling have largely disappeared from Germany as automation has made stamping and welding cheaper (and cleaner) than forging, but the giant old-world presses are still pounding away in Brazil.</p>
<p>This is the thickest, heaviest knife we tested. The blade is actually ground thinner behind the edge than the other Euro-style knives from Wüsthof, Victorinox or Mercer, but the spine is thick and the full bolster brings the balance point almost an inch toward the handle side. The out-of the box sharpening was below-average, though this steel is as easy to sharpen as any you&#8217;ll find.</p>
<p>If you like having a full bolster (for… opening cans?) and a heavy knife for smashing through vegetables, this isn&#8217;t a bad choice. The steel is finished just a touch harder than the other Euro-style knives, which was a nice surprise, but the fit and finish is not good enough to earn it a recommended pick. At this end of the price range, we still think most people will prefer the Mercer &#8211; Renaissance.</p>
<h3>OXO &#8211; Good Grips Pro</h3>
<p>We like many OXO products, but their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019ZP6VPS/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Good Grips &#8211; Pro Chef&#8217;s knife</a> is a great example of form before function. All of the specs are there: full tang, half-bolster, quality German steel and a profile that&#8217;s good for rock-chopping. Despite the smooth molded handle and flawless finish, though, the crisp spine and bolster edges just aren&#8217;t comfortable in extended use.</p>
<p>Worse still, the OXO has the thickest blade of any we tested. Slicing yams, even after re-sharpening the edge, was just too much work. The one positive quality of this blade is that the thick edge angle helps keep veggies from sticking to the face of the blade when making thin slices of cucumber and potato.</p>
<h3>IKEA &#8211; 365+</h3>
<p>The new <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10283522/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA 365+ chef&#8217;s knife</a> is like many IKEA products: a good attempt that isn&#8217;t executed as well as it could have been. We&#8217;d heard <a href="https://en.ikea-club.org/item/90131068.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good things about a past IKEA knife</a>, but the new 365+ just tries to look like a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005OL44/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Global G2</a> without actually feeling good in the hand.</p>
<p>Sadly, the IKEA handle is just too narrow to be comfortable over extended cutting sessions. Worse, there was a telltale brown scorch mark near the tip, evidence that someone overheated the edge when sharpening. The edge is thick, too, so slicing performance was subpar.</p>
<p>The premise of a $20 one-piece knife in &#8220;molybdenum-vanadium&#8221; stainless made us hopeful, but whoever IKEA chose to make this knife for them did not follow through. If you like stainless handles and want to try thinning out this blade on a waterstone, at least it wouldn&#8217;t be an expensive experiment.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>A kitchen knife is a tool that can become an extension of your hand, turning raw ingredients on a cutting board into food that you can enjoy cooking. Knife buying doesn&#8217;t have to be complicated, but finding a good balance of cost, easy maintenance and materials that will hold a sharper edge for longer can really turn your kitchen chef&#8217;s knife from a tool you loathe into a tool you love.</p>
<p>We set a fairly low budget for our lineup in this review, since most people will be much better served spending more on a sharpening tool than on a high-end knife that&#8217;s still going to become dull after a month of use.  Check out our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-knife-sharpener/">knife sharpener review</a> for solutions that will keep your blades at peak performance.</p>
<p>We really love the performance of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079S3G9KZ/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nexus 8&#8243; Chef&#8217;s knife</a>, and we think it&#8217;s an excellent buy. In a unique feat, the innovative use of a brand-new steel means this edge is both durable and easy to sharpen. <strong>The handle materials are bomb-proof, and the blade is ground to a high-performance slicing edge.</strong></p>
<p>For those of us who don&#8217;t need more than a solid, versatile knife to use in a small kitchen, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L2I4SM4/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greater Goods &#8211; Nourish 0556</a> is an even better value. It&#8217;s made from top-tier Japanese steel, but the weight and handle design help it feel comfortable and secure even in novice hands. It&#8217;s a great-looking blade at a great price, and the included magnetic mounting stud makes this a one-stop purchase for a first step into better knife skills.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>There are basically two types of microwave bacon cookers on the market, both of which we tested. One type has a rack onto which the bacon is draped so it’s lifted off the tray and the other type is simply a plastic tray with raised ridges. The companies that manufacturer bacon cookers all boast that their design quickly crisps up bacon in the microwave with little or no mess.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/5funoa/does_anyone_cook_bacon_in_the_microwave/?st=jgy1hz83&amp;sh=5de47f68#bottom-comments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bacon connoisseurs on Reddit</a>, however, generally dismiss microwaved bacon as lacking both the flavor and texture of traditionally cooked bacon. We combed through reviews online, but most are advertisements. Our best resource proved to be the thousands of Amazon reviews and photographs posted by consumers who documented their results (including the bacon cookers melting in their microwaves).</p>
<p>We focused on finding microwave bacon cookers that had consistently high ratings and stood out as less gimmicky than the many cookers on the market.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-cook-bacon">How to cook bacon</h2>
<p>Cooking bacon perfectly crisp in a skillet isn’t as easy and is more time-consuming than you may think. A cast-iron skillet is generally considered to be the best type of pan for any frying. Although the cast-iron skillet has superb heat distribution, you still need to regulate the heat at a low temperature for frying bacon. The low-and-slow method allows the bacon’s fat to render and crisp and the bacon meat to cook evenly and not turn rubbery.</p>
<p>There are, of course, many ridged pans, square pans and grill pans for cooking bacon, but we prefer oven-cooked bacon. Once you’ve laid out the bacon (you can cook up to a pound) in a foil-lined baking sheet and pop it into the oven, it’s virtually stress-free and hands-off for the next 15 to 20 minutes. The bacon comes out crispy and chewy — cleanup is a cinch. And while you might consider using a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-toaster-oven/">toaster oven</a>, cooking bacon in a microwave is a faster alternative.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-microwave-bacon">How to microwave bacon</h2>
<p>You could simply microwave bacon on a microwave-safe plate sandwiched between paper towels. We tried out this method before testing the microwave bacon cookers and it gave us rubbery bacon with bits of paper towel stuck to it.</p>
<p>Depending on the microwave cooker, you can cook between four (the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0049WV8S8/?tag=ybdbac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Joie Piggy</a>) and 12 slices of bacon (the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002HSFB2/?tag=ybdbac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Makin’ Bacon</a>) at a time. Substantial shrinkage occurs during the cooking, so you can lay as many slices on the tray as it can hold without crowding them. Also, avoid overlapping the slices as this will cause uneven cooking.</p>
<h3>Cooking time</h3>
<p>The majority of microwave ovens have a range of 600 watts to 1200 watts and the microwaves with higher wattage will cook food more quickly and evenly. Most of the bacon cooker instructions are based on your using a 1000-watt microwave oven.</p>
<p>All of the microwave bacon cookers we tested advise cooking the bacon for one minute per slice. However, because of the variance in wattage of microwaves, there’s really no hard rule to follow. For lower-wattage microwaves, you need to add approximately 10 to 15 seconds per slice; conversely, for higher-wattage microwaves, you need to subtract 10 to 15 seconds per slice.</p>
<p>Turkey bacon is literally and figuratively another animal altogether. Turkey bacon is chopped turkey with oil added that’s been compressed into bacon-like strips. It doesn’t have the high-fat content of pork bacon and needs approximately half the time to cook.</p>
<h3>How to get crispy microwaved bacon</h3>

<p>You can get crispy microwaved bacon, but it’s a bit by trial and error. All of the cookers (or trays) we tested are supposed to produce crispy bacon. Our results were decidedly mixed and more often than not we ended up with crisped fat and bacon-meat jerky that would put the strongest teeth to the test.</p>
<p>We recommend initially undercooking the bacon; for example, program three minutes for four slices of bacon. After that, turn the bacon over, then reprogram the microwave at 30-second increments, continually checking the bacon until it’s as crispy as you like. Also remember that if the fatty sections of the bacon are golden brown, the bacon will crisp up as it cools.</p>
<h3>Should you use paper towels?</h3>
<p>If the microwave bacon cooker has a lid (like the Joie Piggy), then it’s not necessary to cover the bacon with a paper towel. Otherwise, we recommend covering the bacon with a paper towel to absorb the significant grease splatter. It’s not necessary to line the cooker with a paper towel since all of the cookers we tested are designed to capture and drain rendered bacon fat.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>During our testing, we learned that there are several important features about the design of a microwave bacon cooker that you should consider.</p>
<p><b>Dimensions: </b>Before purchasing a microwave bacon cooker, measure the inner dimensions of your microwave to ensure that the cooker you buy can actually fit. The rack-style bacon cookers are compact enough to fit any size microwave. The tray-style, however, can be either square or rectangle and depending on its length, it might not turn properly on your microwave’s turntable.</p>
<p><b>BPA-free plastic: </b>Since the bacon comes in contact directly with the cooker, make sure that it is made of BPA-free plastic.</p>
<p><b>Gutter design: </b>Since the purpose of the bacon cooker is to drain off as much fat as possible, look for a design that keeps the bacon elevated enough so it doesn’t sit in the captured fat. We found that the rack-style bacon cookers were the most efficient. However, the unique design of the OXO Good Grips, with its kickstand that raises the tray so the fat drains into the gutter, is also excellent.</p>
<p><b>Ease of storage: </b>The rack-style bacon cookers are the easiest for storage. The racks can be removed, laid in the tray and stored compactly in a cabinet.</p>
<p><b>Build quality: </b>Microwaving any plastic item has a long-range effect on its stability, so look for a bacon cooker that is made of a sturdier plastic.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We used Costco’s Kirkland Signature Bacon for our tests and its slices can be wider than other kinds of bacon. The number of slices that we tested at one time was dependent on the size and shape of the bacon cooker.</p>
<p>For the ridged-tray-style bacon cookers — the OXO, Joie Piggy and Nordic Ware — we had to lay out the bacon horizontally across the ridges, so the bacon stays elevated. Consequently, the ridged-tray cookers could hold only four or five slices at one time.</p>
<p>We were able to fit up to 12 slices on the rack-style bacon cookers — the Presto &#8211; Power Crisp, Emson &#8211; Bacon Wave and Makin’ Bacon — but due to the bacon width, we avoided overcrowding by testing nine slices at a time.</p>

<p>We followed the instructions for each bacon cooker and programmed the microwave for the recommended cooking times. In each case, the recommended time was too long, since we used a 1700-watt microwave. As a second attempt, we decreased the power level and cooking time for subsequent tests to determine whether a lower power and time combination would affect results.</p>
<p>For our third round of tests, we cooked only three slices to see if the bacon cooked differently than when the cooker was loaded to capacity.</p>
<p>We also wanted to test how well turkey bacon cooked on each cooker, and since there’s less fat in turkey bacon, we cut the cook time in half. We got excellent results from the Presto and the OXO.</p>
<p>Finally, we tested whether or not each bacon cooker was dishwasher safe by washing them in the upper rack of the dishwasher.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016N3PGQK/?tag=ybdbac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Presto &#8211; Power Crisp</a> is a microwave bacon cooker that has three sturdy plastic racks over which the bacon is draped. As the bacon cooks, the fat drips into a tray underneath the racks. The bacon cooks into a V-shape, which easily slides off the rack. Although the bacon isn’t straight like traditionally fried bacon, it was evenly cooked with a nice crunch.</p>
<p>The Presto &#8211; Power Crisp can hold up to 12 slices of bacon, depending on the width of the bacon. The instruction manual recommended 40 to 90 seconds per slice and we programmed the microwave for five minutes to avoid over-cooking. The bacon was only half-done after that time, so we cooked it for three-and-a-half minutes more. The fat was beautifully rendered and crispy, and the meat was chewy without being rubbery.</p>

<p>For our next test, we cooked three slices for three minutes. We prefer our bacon extra crispy, so we added 30 seconds more and again, it was perfect. As recommended by the manufacturer, we covered the bacon with a paper towel and it absorbed all grease splatter without the paper towel sticking to the bacon.</p>
<p>The tray into which the racks are inserted is made of heavy-duty black plastic that remarkably stayed cool to the touch. The grease poured easily out of the tray without dripping and the entire cooker is dishwasher safe.</p>
<p>Of the rack-style microwave bacon cookers we tested, the Presto &#8211; Power Crisp is one of the least expensive and its superior design and construction gave us the best results.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Presto &#8211; Power Crisp’s design allows more bacon fat to drip off the bacon into a cool-to-the-touch tray underneath.</li>
<li>The three stand-up racks cook the bacon into an unconventional V-shape but also produced the crispiest bacon of all the cookers we tested.</li>
<li>The racks can be stored in the tray, so this cooker easily fits in a kitchen drawer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="runner-up">Runner-up: OXO Good Grips &#8211; Bacon Crisper</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06W2MHM7W/?tag=ybdbac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; Bacon Crisper</a> is double the price of most of the bacon cookers we tested, but it has two unique design elements that we think are worth it. It’s a tray-style bacon cooker with a deep gutter for catching rendered bacon fat. A ridged removable silicone insert fits into the hard plastic tray, which prevents grease from leaking into the tray and is incredibly easy to clean.</p>
<p>The second feature we love is that the tray has a kickstand, which raises the tray to an approximately 45-degree angle. As the bacon cooks, the rendered fat drains and runs off into the gutter.</p>

<p>During our tests, the raised tray had positive and slightly negative effects on the bacon. On the positive side, most of the bacon fat drained away, leaving the bacon very crispy. On the other hand, so much fat had been rendered that the bacon meat of a couple slices was chewier than the other slices.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the OXO is a bit expensive for a microwave bacon cooker, but overall it consistently gave us evenly cooked bacon that nearly matched our top pick.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The OXO Good Grips &#8211; Bacon Crisper’s elevated tray and silicone insert drains virtually all the rendered bacon fat.</li>
<li>It consistently makes crispy and evenly cooked bacon.</li>
<li>It’s more expensive than most other cookers, but the unique design elements are worth it.</li>

<h3>MSC International &#8211; Joie Piggy Microwave Tray</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0049WV8S8/?tag=ybdbac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Joie Piggy</a> — also called the Joie Oink Oink — is a 9-inch by 8-inch curved rectangle tray with slightly raised serpentine ridges. It comes with a vented pink cover with an impossibly cute pig-head handle. Its small size only fits four bacon slices at a time.</p>
<p>It performed well in our tests; the bacon was crunchy and chewy. The tray’s tiny handles, however, made it difficult to remove the hot tray from the microwave. When we lifted the lid, we found that there had been substantial grease splatter since the tray lacks a drainage receptacle. Consequently, we had to dab the collected grease off the top of the bacon with a paper towel.</p>
<p>The Joie Piggy is dishwasher safe, which is fortunate since the excess splatter thickly coated the inside of the lid.</p>
<h3>Emson &#8211; Bacon Wave</h3>
<p>This best-selling “As Seen On TV” product is an interesting concept. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0016P1AFM/?tag=ybdbac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bacon Wave</a> is a molded BPA-free tray with three grooved rows, into which the bacon is inserted horizontally. The bacon is then held into place with two plastic skewers inserted through at both ends. The skewer needs to be inserted high enough through each slice to elevate it above the tray.</p>
<p>The packaging claims that the Bacon Wave can cook up to 14 slices, which seems possible, but it’s also ridiculously time-consuming to weave the skewers precisely to hold the bacon upright. As the bacon cooked, shrinkage pulled the slices tightly together and the fat dripped into the tray as intended. However, there was also a lot of grease was absorbed by the paper towel on top.</p>
<p>In our three tests of the Bacon Wave, the fat was well-rendered, but the bacon did not crisp and had the consistency of jerky.</p>
<h3>Cameron Products &#8211; Makin’ Bacon</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002HSFB2/?tag=ybdbac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Makin’ Bacon</a> is a small plastic griddle pan that resembles a toy. (It was, after all, created by an eight-year-old girl.) Three t-bars are inserted into three holes and the bacon is draped over them. The website claims that 16 pieces can be cooked at one time, which is certainly an exaggeration.</p>
<p>The vague instructions claim that six slices can fit on one spindly t-bar. However, the most we could fit was 12 pieces crowded together. Since they kept sliding off, we reduced the number to three per bar, but the ends flopped at the bottom of the tray.</p>
<p>We cooked the bacon per the instructions — six minutes for nine slices — but half were crisp and half were rubbery. Also during the cooking, a couple of the slices had curled and slipped off the t-bar and were lying in the accumulated fat. We continued to cook the bacon in 30-second increments until done. We did get bacon that was crispy in spots, but mostly it was very chewy.</p>
<p>The frying-pan design makes it simple to pour out the accumulated grease and all parts are dishwasher safe.</p>
<p>Although our winner has a similar design, we did not get the same results. The Makin’ Bacon comes apart easily for convenient storage, but it seems cheaply made and a bit on the pricey side for what it is.</p>
<h3>Nordic Ware &#8211; 60150 (Not Recommended)</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00080QJXE/?tag=ybdbac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nordic Ware &#8211; 60150</a> is a tray-style bacon cooker onto which bacon slices are laid across the ridges. Differing from the other ridged-tray cookers we tested, the ridges are in a V-shape, which is supposed to allow the rendered fat to drain down a center gutter into a reservoir at the bottom of the tray. It’s a nice idea, but it limits how many slices can actually fit. We managed to squeeze in six slices.</p>
<p>The Nordic Ware has a serious design flaw:  the tray measures 10 inches by 12 inches, which makes it too long to use in a standard microwave. Our large microwave has a center circular revolve with a 14-inch diameter, but the Nordic Ware has a 15-inch diameter and cannot turn. Consequently, we had to manually stop the microwave, turn the tray and restart the microwave.</p>
<p>Results were actually quite good; the bacon had both crunch and chew. But since the Nordic Ware is not dishwasher safe, it’s simply too inconvenient to use.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The best way to cook bacon is undoubtedly in the oven. But if you want to enjoy healthier bacon with less fat, a microwave bacon cooker will make it fast and easy. Over the course of our research and tests, we learned that a lot depends on how the cooker is designed. All of the bacon cookers we tested gave us good to excellent results, but two stood out as particularly well-designed and convenient to use.</p>
<p>Our top pick — the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016N3PGQK/?tag=ybdbac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Presto &#8211; Power Crisp</a> — can cook up to 12 slices at a time in about 12 minutes. Its efficient stand-up racks allow the rendered bacon fat to drip into the tray beneath, leaving the bacon crispy and evenly cooked. It also makes disposal of bacon fat easy and is completely dishwasher safe.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06W2MHM7W/?tag=ybdbac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; Bacon Crisper</a> is our runner-up and its unique design with a raised tray and silicone insert made tasty bacon and clean-up a cinch. It’s about double the price of our top pick, but if you don’t mind spending a little more, it’s worth the price.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent 36 hours researching and testing to determine which bread machine bakes the best bread. After weeks of baking follies, foibles and triumphs, the tried and true <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0067MQM48/?tag=ybdbrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Zojirushi &#8211; BB-PAC20</a> earned our pick for best bread machine. While it is the most expensive machine in our lineup, this machine is solid, consistent and offers advanced features that take automatic bread-baking over the top. At a quarter of the cost of a Zojirushi, our runner-up <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003GXM0EM/?tag=ybdbrm-20">Oster &#8211; CKSTBRTW20</a> offers many of the same features packed into a smaller, lighter and friendlier package. Used by novices and experts alike, we learned how these handy appliances make breadmaking easy and enjoyable.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Every YBD article starts with extensive online research. That means we spend a lot of time on subreddits like /r/Breadit and reading blogs specializing in bread. We scanned websites like Amazon, Target and Walmart to find useful intel within casual user reviews. A little more digging took us deeper into niche communities like /r/Frugal, /r/homestead and /r/ketorecipes for recommendations off the beaten path.</p>
<p>Like the microwave and waffle machine, the bread machine has inspired many dedicated cookbooks. Our research includes a couple of titles that offer in-depth studies such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/155832156X/?tag=ybdbrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>The Bread Lover&#8217;s Bread Machine Cookbook</i></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1887624201/?tag=ybdbrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Easy Breadmaking for Special Diets</i></a>. Professionally-trained baker and author of the former, Beth Hensperger gives us an expert’s perspective in her writing. In her book, there’s an exhaustive chapter dedicated to describing the many features of bread machines, providing a decent starting point for home baking.</p>
<p>YouTube reviews provided a sometimes-entertaining source of bread machine reviews and tips, both professional and amateur. Seeing reactions and answers to common issues from home bakers helped us determine which features were important. We factored in these notes with the general list of available bread machines to narrow down the finalists.</p>

<h2 id="the-history">The history of bread machines</h2>
<p>While breadmaking dates back a staggering 30,000 years, the single-loaf home bread machine has only existed since 1986, the year it was invented in Japan. That makes for about 29,968 years of laborious bread making sans machine. Two years later, it hit American stores in 1988 with a retail cost hovering around $300 each! By 1996, annual sales of bread machines zoomed up to $400 million! These newly-minted home appliances have enjoyed a comfortable spot on wedding registry wishlists ever since.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-them">Why use bread machines?</h2>
<p>The basic process for bread making starts with mixing flour, salt and yeast, followed by laborious kneading, rising, more kneading, shaping, rising again and finally baking. In total, it is a long and arduous process that takes <i>at least</i> two to four hours depending on the type of bread. The length of time to use a bread machine is about the same, but the bread machine mechanizes the tiring work of kneading and timing.</p>
<p>We’ll come right out and say that bread machines may not be as foolproof as you expect. Depending on how carefully you read instructions, there’s a good chance you might nail it on the first try. But it’s important to remember that there is a craft and science to bread baking. That being said, bread machines undoubtedly increase your chances of success.</p>
<p>Bread making can be sensitive and reactive to your environment, so proportions of wet and dry ingredients can vary by the season. Fresh ingredients (especially yeast) and proper measuring are crucial to bread machine success. While it is a simple formula, it may take some tinkering and learning to achieve that perfect loaf.</p>
<p>Experienced bread makers have familiarized themselves with the proper look and texture of a successful dough; some able to bake without measuring, relying on feel alone! If you’re a little bit curious, adventurous and willing to learn, bread machine baking is a great way to learn about this ancient staple and the fascinating chemistry behind it.</p>
<h3>All the hard work</h3>
<p>What the bread machine does best is take over the labor of kneading. The machine also automatically brings itself to ideal proofing temperature, which makes consistent results easier. With or without a bread machine, home bakers must be cognizant of temperature and humidity, which can affect the consistency of the dough. With the bread machine however, you can pretty much let it go after ensuring the dough is the right consistency in the first 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Bread machines are an obvious choice for beginners and novices, but many experienced bakers also find them useful for doing everything up until the baking, at which point they remove the dough from the machine to shape and bake in their own oven. This affords one Reddit user “the benefit of not having to clean your counters before and after making bread every single time.”</p>
<h3>Not just for beginners</h3>
<p>Believe it or not, Washington State University’s famous Bread Lab uses bread machines extensively for recipe testing. Even more, The King Arthur Blog (which calls Bread Lab their home), champions bread machines for making brioche bread. The high content of butter and eggs makes for a very sticky and notoriously difficult dough to make by hand. They ran an experiment between a bread machine and a stand mixer and posted the superior results of their beloved Zojirushi.</p>
<h3>Specialized diets</h3>
<p>Bread machines are invaluable for making this staple food tolerable for the estimated 15 million Americans with food allergies. Most of our finalists even have specific settings for gluten-free recipes. <i>Easy Breadmaking for Special Diets</i> provides bread recipes for the following diets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gluten-free</li>
<li>Milk- and lactose-free</li>
<li>Egg-free</li>
<li>Sugar-free</li>
<li>Yeast-free</li>
<li>Low-sodium</li>
<li>Heart-healthy</li>
<li>High-fiber</li>
<li>Low-fiber</li>
<li>Diabetic</li>
<li>Low-carb</li>
<li>Low-calorie</li>
</ul>
<p>One gluten-intolerant commenter from the <a href="https://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/zojirushi-home-bakery-virtuoso-bread-machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">King Arthur Flour blog</a> says, “GF bread in the grocery store is pretty pitiful and… is always frozen.” She finds great success with her bread machine, declaring her homemade bread, “by far better than anything that I could buy in a store.”</p>
<h3>Cost-benefit of baking vs. buying?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/cost-of-bread-baking-vs-buying-bread-1446664" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Spruce</a> reports that the cost for materials to make a simple loaf of French bread is about $1.58. The cost of a store-bought loaf will run about $2.50 with more artisanal bread costing around $4.00-$5.00. With an inexpensive bread machine costing at least $50, you would recoup after at least 50 basic loaves or 17 artisanal.</p>
<p>For those really looking to pinch pennies, the /r/Frugal subreddit suggest finding used bread machines at the thrift store. You would, of course, runs the risk of bringing home a defective machine which would invariably complicate troubleshooting.</p>
<h3>For your health</h3>
<p>Other common motivators for home baking are health, satisfaction and joy. There were about 20 ingredients in the aforementioned store-bought loaves versus four to six in a homemade loaf. Don’t want “<i>sodium stearoyl lactylate</i>” inside that loaf of yours? How about the lowercase-challenged “<i>DATEM</i>”? They sound more like the ingredients to make an R2-D2 but nonetheless find themselves on the call sheet for Wonder bread — as in, “<i>I wonder what I’m eating?” </i></p>
<p>For hobbyists, savings is less of a reason than the very satisfying process of creating food from scratch. In an interview with <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/baking-for-others-psychology_us_58dd0b85e4b0e6ac7092aaf8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HuffPost</a>, associate professor of psychological and brain sciences at Boston University, Donna Pincus, says, “baking has the benefit of allowing people creative expression.” The same article also links baking to self-expression, communication, mindfulness, altruism and stress relief.</p>
<h3>The life-changing magic of freshly baked bread</h3>
<p>The bread machine can be a serious tool for seasoned bakers and beginners alike. The benefits of using a bread machine outweigh the stigma that comes with labor-saving devices. Aside from cost-benefit and health reasons, at the basest level, it’s truly hard to beat the intoxicating smell and taste of a fresh loaf.</p>
<p>Kick off those low-carb shoes and fall in love with bread again. Let’s start with what to look for.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Preprogram options: </b>Most bread machines come with preset programs for all of the main options like Basic, Wheat, Dough, Cake, etc. If you are shopping specifically for gluten-free baking, T-fal &#8211; PF311E ActiBread replaces the standard options in favor of an exclusively gluten-free menu.</p>
<p><b>Bread loaf size: </b>The average loaf size is a medium 1.5 lbs. For reference, the average sized store-bought loaf weighs 1 pound. Larger-capacity machines will bake up to 2.5-pound loaves.</p>
<p><b>Bread loaf shape:</b> A common complaint about bread machines is the unfamiliar tall loaf shape, which could make for awkwardly large sandwiches that don’t fit in small sandwich bags or toasters. A simple solution is to cut it in half, but if this is a dealbreaker for you, consider the only “traditional” loaf option: Zojirushi &#8211; BB-PAC20.</p>
<p><strong>Delay timer/keep warm:</strong> All of our finalists have this feature but vary in max time. This setting allows you to load up the machine the night prior and wake up to freshly baked bread. A word of warning: This feature should only be used with non-dairy recipes to avoid spoilage.</p>
<p><strong>Variable crust color settings:</strong> This feature allows you to choose the “brownness” of your crust.</p>
<p><strong>Size and weight:</strong> These machines can take up a lot of space. Alternatively, you can put your machine away after each use, but then you should consider its weight.</p>

<p><strong>Viewing window:</strong> Being able to see whether the loaf has fallen flat earlier on in baking or rising could save waiting time. Panasonic &#8211; SD-YD250 was the only machine without a window, leaving us biting nails until the very end of the cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Convection or conventional:</strong> Convection ovens use a fan to spread heat more efficiently. In the case of bread machines, this potentially means darker, crustier bread. Cuisinart &#8211; BMKR-400PC is the only convection option in our lineup, and indeed its results were more dark and crusty.</p>
<p><strong>Fast bake option:</strong> If you need to sacrifice taste for time, the fast bake cycle does just that. This option is available for all of our finalists. Be careful to use the correct type of yeast!</p>
<h2 id="how-they-work">How do bread machines work?</h2>
<h3>Basic function</h3>
<p>A breadmaker does all the mixing, kneading and baking in one self-contained unit. For all it does, the technology is quite basic. There is an axle and motor which spins a removable kneading paddle and a heating element, which in turn heats up the loaf tin. An electronic interface controls the different programs available for different types of bread.</p>
<p>By controlling temperature for rising and proofing dough, the bread machine acts like a proving drawer or proofing box, bringing your dough to ideal temperatures for yeast activity (between 70 and 120 °F). This is an especially useful feature for those who live in very cold places.</p>
<h3>Loaf tin</h3>
<p>The loaf tin is the heart of the bread machine, where the magic happens. It’s a removable non-stick pan where your ingredients mix and mature into a fully-baked loaf. They all vary slightly in design and quality but work the same way. Inside, your robot kneading hands (the paddle) attach to the bottom. After proofing and baking, you remove the tin and shake out the finished loaf.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12497" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison.jpg" alt="Three loaf tins compared side by side" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Convection or conventional?</h3>
<p>The convection option for bread machines is not common. Out of our six finalists, only the Cuisinart &#8211; BMKR-400PC gives us the option. Essentially, convection ovens use a fan to spread heat more efficiently, resulting in quicker baking.</p>
<p>As the fan faces the side of the tin, Cuisinart’s machine doesn’t suffer from common convection-baking issues like drying out or undercooking the inside. However, it baked quicker and gave us a slightly darker and “crustier” crust. Some user reviews recommended using the <i>Light</i> crust color setting to achieve <i>Medium</i> results.</p>
<h3>Next-level bread machine usage</h3>
<p>By far, the most popular use of bread machines by hobbyists and advanced home bakers is the dough setting. Panasonic, Zojirushi and Cuisinart manuals show an impressive array of baked goods that are <i>not </i>in the shape of a bread machine tin. Cinnamon rolls, pizza, baguettes, dinner rolls, pretzels, bagels and braided masterpieces burst from bread baskets in full color! How do we go from our brown rectangles to these picturesque beauties?</p>
<p>The answer lies in the obscure “dough” setting. Once a home-baker starts Googling about bread recreationally, a world of possibilities opens up. /r/Breadit users share this tip like they are imparting sage wisdom unto a young padawan who only knows the first trick. Of course, mastery takes some practice.</p>
<p>We made pizza dough and all of a sudden, pre-made dough seemed laughable. Our bread-machine-dough pizza turned out just as great as any store-bought variety and was easier than going to the store. Pretty soon, recipes like dinner rolls just might become a weeknight staple: Simply interrupt the cycle to shape the prepared dough before returning it to the tin (or your own oven) for the final bake.</p>
<h3>All about yeast</h3>
<p>To understand more about baking, one must understand yeast. In 1868, the Fleischmann brothers developed the first commercial yeast made of grain, barley malt and brewer’s yeast. This dried yeast quickly replaced the more complicated use of natural starters and yeast which requires continuous maintenance and “feeding” like a live creature.</p>
<p>Today, the types and names of available yeast are confusing. We found some conflicting information, especially between “rapid”, “quick” and “instant” varieties. Ultimately though, there are three main types:</p>
<p><b>Active dry yeast:</b> This is the “tortoise” of yeasts, likely what previous generations of home bakers are accustomed to. It rises the slowest, but longest. ADY is made of larger granules than other types and should be activated by dissolving with warm water (about 110°F) before use. This proofing process sheds off dead cells from high heat drying process to reach the living yeast. In their testing, <a href="https://blog.kingarthurflour.com/2016/01/29/yeast-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">King Arthur Flour blog</a> reports that it has the most neutral taste while <a href="https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/6620-yeast-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cook’s Illustrated</a> found its flavor to be “less clean,” potentially due to the dead cells.</p>

<p><strong>Instant/highly active yeast (“Quick-rise” or “RapidRise&#8221;):</strong> The “hare” of yeasts reportedly work 50% faster than active dry yeast. The main difference is that it’s created using a much <a href="https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/6620-yeast-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gentler heating process</a> so that all of the granules remain active. Thus, it is more potent and requires fewer steps to use. It can be added directly to dry ingredients without “activating” with water. Its granules are smaller and contain enzymes and other additives to aid in quicker rise. <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-difference-between-active-dry-yeast-and-instant-yeast-54252" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Kitchn</a> reports you can also skip the first rise and go straight to shaping.</p>
<p>King Arthur Blog draws distinction between “Instant yeast” (SAF’s <i>Saf-Instant</i>) and “Highly active yeast” (Fleishmann’s <i>RapidRise Instant Yeast</i>, Red Star’s <i>Quick Rise Instant Dry Yeast</i>). The latter adds buzzy adjectives like, “quick” and “rapid,” <i>in addition to </i>“instant,” which is very confusing. The difference may be due to <a href="https://noshon.it/tips/active-dry-yeast-vs-instant-yeast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">different amounts of activators</a> added to help with faster rising. Their testing shows a difference in rising speed, but the finished results were neck and neck. KAF narrowly prefers what they consider “Instant yeast.”</p>
<p><b>Fresh, compressed or cake yeast:</b> This is closest to Fleischmann’s nineteenth-century formulation and contains a higher water content than active and instant yeast. It is 100% alive and thus highly perishable, requires refrigeration and has a sensitive expiration date. It produces the most carbon dioxide during fermentation and requires no proofing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/6620-yeast-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cook’s Illustrated</a> prefers instant yeast for its, “potency of fresh yeast with the convenience of active dry.” In our testing, we too opted for an instant in SAF’s <i>Saf-Instant</i> yeast. However, the different types can be used interchangeably with some adjustment.</p>
<h3>Our first lesson: Yeast shalt not touch salt</h3>
<p>In our haste and excitement, we followed instructions and still came out with 3-inch-high loaves of bread. In our first pair of machine manuals, we saw no warning to keep the yeast away from the salt. In went the ingredients and perhaps after the longest 3.5 hours of our bread baking lives, complete and utter failure: two dense and deceptively-delicious-smelling failure piles.</p>
<p>Furious internet exploration revealed our fatal mistake. Salt kills yeast! This time we perused all of the bread machine manuals and saw different ways of preventing contact between the two. Some gave no mention, only directing to add ingredients in a certain order. Some gave a warning. A little understanding could have prevented this altogether. Now we know.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>

Each bread machine had its own character reflected in (or because of) design choices. Taking into consideration steps before, during and after engaging baking cycles, we graded each in the following criteria:</p>
<p><b>Countertop appeal:</b> Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but YBD staff thought there’s a margin of objectivity that is also influenced by function and branding. More simply, would we grow tired of seeing this every day in our kitchen?</p>
<p><b>Documentation:</b> Instruction manuals and starter recipes were key in overall user experience. Our ranking rewarded easy-to-read guides and docked points for confusion.</p>
<p><b>Warranty:</b> Buyer reviews often give firsthand accounts of warranty claim experiences. The responsiveness of each brand plays into their reputation for reliability and dependability. It is often clear if there are egregious issues within a product line and our warranty score represents an overall impression along with the duration of the warranty.</p>
<p><b>Stability:</b> Because we found multiple reports of some machines creeping across the counter during the kneading phase, we paid close attention to unit stability.</p>
<p><b>Loaf pan design:</b> Bread machine pans are generally very similar but vary in shape, size, weight and how they lock into the machine. Subtle differences or quirks may compound over time for better or for worse. Did the handle get in the way? Were there any sharp edges? Did weightiness make loaf removal more difficult?</p>
<p><b>Paddle design:</b> The second-most-handled element after the pan is the paddle. We graded these based on material, shape and how they interlocked with the loaf pans.</p>
<p><b>Overall construction quality:</b> Looking past the distraction of branding and packaging, we tried to get a sense of construction quality by examining materials, weight and the design of interlocking components. The last factor was especially important for the longevity of the machine.</p>
<h3>Performance and operation</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12491" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-performance.png" alt="Chart comparing performance qualities" width="2000" height="1658" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-performance.png 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-performance-610x506.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-performance-768x637.png 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-performance-885x734.png 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-performance-1500x1244.png 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-performance-295x245.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-performance-1000x829.png 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-performance-360x298.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-performance-375x311.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-performance-414x343.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-performance-320x265.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-performance-885x734@2x.png 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The performance ratings are the meat and potatoes of our reviewing process. Here, design and function meet. The proof, as they say, is in the <i>bread</i> pudding.</p>
<p><b>Programming and interface:</b> The programming of a bread machine is implemented by a digital interface. We look at everything from button type and placement to screen legibility and ease of comprehension.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12494" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup.jpg" alt="Close-up of programmable interface" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><b>General ease of use:</b> This is a comprehensive score that addresses every aspect from the point of view of a novice user from the first measure of flour to finished loaf.</p>
<p><b>Versatility:</b> Bread machines are touted for their versatility, stretching the boundaries of what it means to be a “unitasker.” We count the number of preset programs and thumb through recommended recipes to arrive at this score.</p>
<p><b>Quietness:</b> At the end of the day, the noise level of your bread machine may make all the difference. When we had three running at a time, the grades for this category quickly became clear. Depending on your intention and the location of your kitchen, your bread machine has the potential to become either a nuisance or an alarm clock.</p>
<p><b>Pan removal:</b> Twist, pull or both? Removing a hot bread pan from the machine has a slight learning curve for each machine, varying in the process, ease and feel. Placement and swing of the handle make a difference as well.</p>
<p><b>Paddle removal and cleanup:</b> We noticed some loaves came out of the tin more easily than others and can attribute that to paddle removal. Cleaning the paddles is easily the most arduous task of bread machine baking, apart from sweeping up flour and breadcrumbs. While the paddles rarely got stuck inside our loaves, this nonetheless prolonged the overall cleanup process, adding the task of surgical paddle removal.</p>
<h3>The taste test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12492" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-results.png" alt="Chart comparing bread baking test results" width="2000" height="1658" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-results.png 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-results-610x506.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-results-768x637.png 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-results-885x734.png 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-results-1500x1244.png 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-results-295x245.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-results-1000x829.png 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-results-360x298.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-results-375x311.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-results-414x343.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-results-320x265.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BreadMachine-results-885x734@2x.png 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Finally, what we have all been waiting 3.5 hours for: the taste test! We baked each loaf nearly simultaneously, so we were able to do a side-by-side testing of bread right out of the oven and after a few hours of rest.</p>
<p><b>Taste:</b> We used identical recipes in order to determine if the aforementioned criteria and price made any difference at all. Texture, crunch and balance of flavors round out the factors for this grade.</p>
<p><b>Look:</b> Visual appeal always plays into the taste and so it will in our taste test as well. The look of a loaf always indicates the success (or fail) of a bake. Size also plays a role in texture and crumb.</p>
<p><b>Crumb:</b> Otherwise known as “hole structure,” this is a useful visual indication of the process a loaf has undergone. Larger and varied holes mean that the dough was properly kneaded and aerated, and thus better puffed up for a delicate loaf.</p>

<p><strong>Crust:</strong> The color of crust can be adjusted on our finalists, allowing choice of <i>light, medium </i>or <i>dark. </i>We chose <i>medium</i> for the purposes of testing and examined each loaf for evenness of color and relative darkness.</p>

<p><b>Paddle impression in bread:</b> One of the main complaints of using bread machines is the unsightly impression left by the paddles of the bread machine. This compresses the bottom areas near the paddles as well, making it slightly denser than normal. We noticed that some machines made more of a mark while some consistently slid out cleanly.</p>

<p>It’s not a huge surprise that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0067MQM48/?tag=ybdbrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zojirushi &#8211; BB-PAC20</a>, affectionately referred to as “Zo” by its fans, wins out. It is also the most expensive machine and it’s obvious why. The bread pan feels like it could survive a few lifetimes. The most unique feature, however, is the bread shape: those yearning for “traditional” regular height sandwiches will want to splurge on this workhorse of a machine.</p>

Thoughtfully engineered with well-made parts, the Zo is built for heavy duty usage.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0067MQM48/?tag=ybdbr" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Because of superior construction quality and thoughtful design, the Zo comes out on top in our design ranking. Its bread pan was the sturdiest by far, an important win since it is the most handled element of a bread machine. It earns a full score in stability as its horizontal orientation and weight keep it squarely in place during operation while others wiggle considerably.</p>
<p>When it comes to taste, it tied for first with the Panasonic. Both machines came up with consistent results across repeated bakes. The unique loaf-pan shape requires dual blades, adding a little bit of inconvenience as you have to clean two, but the consistent mixing may be worth it.</p>
<p>Bread scientists at Bread Lab at Washington University shamelessly <a href="https://blog.kingarthurflour.com/2015/02/17/successful-loaves-from-your-bread-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorse</a> their Zo any time there is mention of bread machines. It has our vote of confidence as the bread machine most likely to outlast other machines.</p>
<p>The biggest drawback is that it wasn’t the quietest of the machines, producing substantial sound during kneading phases. Second is its larger footprint, size and weight which in a previous paragraph would describe its positive traits! There are trade-offs, so it depends on what your needs are. If you need a longstanding, well-engineered and well-made machine and have counter space to spare, Zojirushi &#8211; BB-PAC20 is the one.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Zojirushi &#8211; BB-PAC20 wins top scores in all three categories, but it comes at a cost. It is the most expensive bread machine but has the highest potential to outlast other finalists as it has the highest quality of construction.</li>
<li>It is the only machine that produces a familiar size and shape loaf instead of the awkwardly tall “bread machine” look.</li>
<li>This machine is most stable of the finalists, but it is also one of the heaviest and largest and will take up precious counter space.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="most-cost-efficient">Cost-effective pick: Oster &#8211; CKSTBRTW20</h2>

<p>If the Zo won our minds, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003GXM0EM/?tag=ybdbrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oster &#8211; CKSTBRTW20</a> won our hearts. Although much lighter in weight and smaller in size, the Oster delivered consistent loaves and scored high in taste.</p>
<p>Encased in an off-white plastic case, this machine is friendlier and less industrial looking than the Zo. Its lighter weight affords easier mobility (if you need to move it into storage after use), but invariably allows visible shaking during kneading. The tradeoff is that it is much quieter than the more stable Zojirushi and Panasonic. Surprisingly, our test scores show that despite its visible wobble, the Oster stayed in place just as well as the competition.</p>

<p>The controls and buttons on the Oster were simple and easy to access. A blue on light is as obvious and indicative as the use of the machine is itself. The lid is removable and easy to clean in the case of the occasional over-risen loaf. The bread pan is nothing to write home about, but it works just fine.</p>
<p>In general, the loaves coming out of this machine were nice, with light and airy texture. Most importantly, its slightly more developed flavor separated it from the other budget option, the Hamilton Beach. Although it was the cheapest finalist, it held up well against machines more than double its cost.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Oster &#8211; CKSTBRTW20 was the quietest machine we tested.</li>
<li>As the least-expensive finalist, we were surprised to see it outperform the more expensive machines.</li>
<li>The small weight, footprint and price make the Oster a great candidate for beginners and people in smaller kitchens.</li>
<li>The small size and weight makes it ideal for storage or limited counter space.</li>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005QFL0/?tag=ybdbrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; SD-YD250</a>, with its high marks in taste, eluded us in the beginning. It looked as though the box came straight out of a time machine from the ‘90s. And it was loud. We can’t recommend this one for the noise-averse or light sleepers. It was so loud that we questioned whether or not it was fully working, but each time it answered with consistent top quality loaves.</p>
<p>We liked the look and feel of the paddle and loaf tin. As the third-most-costly machine, we expected it to have a high-quality build, and it does. The aesthetic design leaves a little to be desired; a tall, off-white rectangular box that says very little. The membrane-type buttons are resistant to flour and easy to wipe.</p>
<p>The instructions manuals are satisfactory, and the dedicated recipe book has a lot of nice pictures, but we can’t shake the blast-from-the-past feel we get from the overall branding. It’s an interesting contrast to see our freshly baked loaves living in the moment next to the vintage styling of the recipe book. It takes us out for a moment, but a bite into the bread takes us right back!</p>
<h3>Cuisinart &#8211; BMKR-400PC</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009VELTQ/?tag=ybdbrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; BMKR-400PC</a> struck us as the stunner in the group, covered in sleek brushed metal with black and chrome highlights. The convection feature also sets it apart from most other bread machines: convection ovens use a fan to more efficiently spread heat, and the Cuisinart did yield lovely browned crusts, even on the <i>medium</i> crust setting.</p>
<p>A few user reviews reported mix results, some saying they ended up with burnt bread. <a href="https://www.cooksillustrated.com/equipment_reviews/1586-bread-machines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cook’s Illustrated</a> reported that it overheated in their results so they left it out of testing. Our results were darker than the rest but were still delicious. The higher temperature resulted in a slightly thicker crust.</p>
<p>Costing almost $150 at the time of writing, this machine is the second most expensive. It certainly has a cool “industrial” look, but the construction quality left a bit to be desired. The metal casing is thinner than you would expect, certainly less robust than the Panasonic. The door and hinges just feel a little bit on the flimsy side, raising concern over how long this machine would last with heavy use.</p>
<p>If counter space is an issue, look elsewhere. Like the Zojirushi, the Cuisinart is a beast of a machine in dimensions, though not nearly as heavy as the former.</p>
<p>The nail in the coffin is its noise level, rated just above the broken-sounding Panasonic. Even with its good looks, we would be hard-pressed to justify shelling out the premium <i>dough</i> for this machine.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MVSRIDG/?tag=ybdbrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">T-fal &#8211; PF311E Actibread</a> puts all its money on being <i>the</i> bread machine for the gluten intolerant. This was a minor inconvenience as we failed a loaf trying to find an equivalent setting for “basic white” bread. Actibread gives us fifteen program settings and not a single one is “basic” of anything. We admire its radical commitment to this diet, although it proved slightly inconvenient for our testing purposes.</p>
<p>By flipping through the alternative recipe book, we found the closest thing to “basic white” was a setting for “gluten-free cake”. The results turned out pretty great, despite the experimental status.</p>

<p>In our repeated testing, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005EPRF1I/?tag=ybdbrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 29882</a> struggled to keep up with the rest. Its middling rank in design and performance gave out entirely after below-average taste test scores. We aren’t entirely certain why the bread wasn’t as good. It was serviceable, and many sandwiches were made. Taking a stab at reverse-engineering the bread, we’d guess that the kneading fell just short.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it was the off-gassing on the first round of loaves that was offputting. The manual had warned of this happening, instating doubt considering the other machines didn’t have the same problem. The plastic smell went away after the first loaf, but perhaps it had left an impression.</p>
<p>Our third guess is that the interior temperature of the machine might be off. One thing is for sure, this vaguely-sporty black plastic box left us in question and in doubt. For a task as complicated as bread making, choose a machine that inspires confidence.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>There’s no denying the magical appeal of the alchemy that is bread making. With your machine, you can transform mostly-inert powders and liquids into this magical food form of love. For hobbyists, these romantic ideas swirl with the practical outcome of consistent, controlled results. While yes, you will save some money baking your own bread versus going to the store, there is an intangible benefit and that can’t be expressed better than “joy.” There’s something special about using your time and effort creating something from scratch to nourish yourself and others.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected pressure cookers to test</h2>
<p>We began our research by reading many websites and blogs devoted entirely to electric pressure cookers and viewing YouTube videos that demonstrated their functions and recipes. The reasons that most consumers cited for purchasing an electric pressure cooker are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast cooking time</li>
<li>Ease of use</li>
<li>Safety</li>
<li>Capacity</li>
<li>Ease of cleaning</li>
</ul>
<p>Since 2015, Instant Pot has emerged as the dominant electric pressure cooker brand. Introduced in 2010, Instant Pot now has well over 25,000 reviews on Amazon and nearly 1 million followers on Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest.</p>
<p>There are now many different electric pressure cookers to choose from, each claiming to have new features and improved functionality over the Instant Pot. We avoided testing those that had a high proportion of low ratings and repeated customer complaints.</p>
<p>Generally, pressure cookers have a 6- or 8-quart capacity. We read comments that people chose to buy a 6-quart model that could cook smaller portions but also have the capacity to accommodate a whole chicken. People who bought an 8-quart model wanted to cook larger portions for freezing and canning.</p>
<p>We decided to test a range of food — from eggs to pot roast — in portion sizes that a family of two or four might actually cook. So, we only tested cookers with a six-quart capacity.</p>
<p>Our criteria for selecting stove top pressure cookers was different. Stovetop models are made of aluminum, stainless steel or a bi-metal composite. Aluminum tends to easily dent and ding, so we opted for the heftier and more durable stainless steel. We also decided to test the pressure cookers that could be used on gas, electric and induction cooktops.</p>

<h2 id="why-buy">Why buy a pressure cooker?</h2>
<p>The pressure cooker was invented in the mid-17th century. Since then, chefs and home cooks worldwide have used pressure cookers to transform tough cuts of meat into tender, juicy morsels in half the time. Beef stew, for example, which in an oven or stovetop takes three hours to be edible, takes less than an hour in a pressure cooker.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why you might want to purchase a pressure cooker:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressure cookers cut cooking time for everything by about two-thirds. So you could easily come home from work, toss a chicken into the pressure cooker, and have dinner ready 30 minutes later.</li>
<li>Nobody wants to cook roasts in summer. A pressure cooker doesn’t heat up the kitchen, and if you use an electric pressure cooker, you can set it and forget it.</li>
<li>Imagine you get home and you’ve got a family to feed, but you forgot to defrost the pork chops. You can put those rock-solid chops into a pressure cooker, and by increasing the cook time by 10 minutes, you’ll have it on the table in no time.</li>
<li>Beans are a fiber-rich and nutritious addition to our diets, but the traditional method calls for soaking them overnight. You can combine dried beans and a few cups of water in a pressure cooker, and 50 minutes later, they’re done perfectly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How does pressure cooking work?</h2>
<p>A traditional pressure cooker works somewhat like a covered pot when you increase the temperature of the liquid to cook the food inside. However, a pressure cooker has a heavier lid equipped with a rubber gasket that clamps onto the top of the pot.</p>
<p>Once heat is applied, the trapped steam builds pressure to approximately 15 pounds per square inch (psi), thus increasing the temperature of the liquid in the pot above the boiling temperature of water 212 ℉ to 250 ℉. The higher temperature cooks the food faster.</p>
<p>The increased pressure also infuses moisture and liquid into the food, which softens the fibrous or connective tissue (in beef chuck, for example) and tenderizes it.</p>
<p>Once cooking time is completed, and before the lid can be opened, pressure must be released in one of two methods. For softer foods, like vegetables and eggs, the pressure valve on top of the lid is unlocked, which releases the built-up steam inside the cooker in a geyser-like rush. For meats and beans, the pressure valve is kept locked, which allows the pressure to decrease naturally on its own in about 20 minutes.</p>

<p>The electric pressure cooker was invented in 1991, and since then, three generations of it have been introduced to the public, each of which has newer technology. Mechanical timers, delayed cooking features and advanced programmability have all made each generation a little easier to use. Since Instant Pot’s launch in 2010, electric pressure cookers have become extraordinarily popular.</p>
<p>Most of the electric pressure cookers on the market today are multi-functional, and you can easily program the cooker for stews, beans and rice by simply pushing a button. The electric pressure cooker is programmed to automatically set the amount of pressure and cooking time, so you can truly set it and forget it. Also, once the cooking was completed, all of the pressure cookers we tested automatically shifted to a “keep warm” mode, which comes in handy if you’re not ready to eat.</p>
<p>Stovetop pressure cookers are just as fast and efficient as an electric model, but heat and pressure levels must be manually maintained throughout the cooking. It still takes only about 30 or 40 minutes for a pot roast to cook in a stovetop pressure cooker, but you need to watch over it while it cooks.</p>

<p>We tested electric pressure cookers that had multiple pre-programmed functions for both pressure cooking and slow cooking. At first look, you might assume you can do more with a 12-button model than one with seven buttons. However, two of the electric pressure cookers we tested — the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MZZXO4W/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Power Pressure Cooker XL</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B016RYKKL6/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">T-fal &#8211; CY505E</a> — had terrible user manuals, rendering it difficult to figure out what their extra buttons did without a lot of experimentation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Instant Pot and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000MPA044/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; CPC-600</a> had excellent step-by-step instructions for each of their features. We decided that more buttons don’t necessarily make a better pressure cooker.</p>
<p>Another important feature is the ability to change the pre-programmed function before or during the cooking. For example, this would be helpful when the meat/stew function may be pre-programmed for 20 minutes, but the piece of beef you’re cooking only needs 15 minutes.</p>
<p>All of the pressure cookers enabled us to cancel one program and restart a different program. <b>But we could change cook time and pressure levels only with the </b><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FLYWNYQ/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Instant Pot</b></a><b>.</b> The other pressure cookers locked the program in place once the function button was pressed.</p>
<h3>Speed to pressurize</h3>
<p>All of the electric pressure cookers we tested claimed that they could turn out a fully cooked meal in 20 or so minutes. That’s only half true. It may take 20 minutes to cook, but it could take another 20 minutes for the cooker to build up pressure, or “come to pressure” as it’s commonly called. If you’re using the natural-release method (letting the pressure dissipate without opening the release valve) you need to add 20 minutes more.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12187" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed.png" alt="pressure cooker speed data" width="2000" height="1716" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed.png 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed-610x523.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed-768x659.png 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed-885x759.png 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed-1500x1287.png 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed-295x253.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed-1000x858.png 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed-360x309.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed-375x322.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed-414x355.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed-320x275.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pressure-cooker-speed-885x759@2x.png 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The speed with which the cooker pressurizes depends on the volume of the contents in the cooker’s inner pot. For example, a 3-pound chicken will generally take approximately 15 minutes to come to pressure, while dried beans or rice will take half that time.</p>
<p>We timed how long it took for each pressure cooker to pressurize for every test. Stovetop pressure cookers were fastest; they took between 3-½ and 7 minutes. Timing varied with the electric pressure cookers, but Instant Pot had a substantial lead over the others by pressurizing several minutes sooner.</p>
<h3>Ease of cleaning</h3>
<p>The majority of stovetop pressure cookers are made of stainless steel (for durability) or aluminum (for heat conduction), but unless they have a ceramic coating or a bimetal base, scorched or overdone food particles can be difficult to clean off.</p>
<p>Generally, electric pressure cookers are a lot easier to clean. Each electric pressure cooker we tested had an inner pot made of stainless steel, which, even after repeated uses, maintained its sheen. We did take exception with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MZZXO4W/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Power Pressure</a>’s inner pot, which seemed to be lesser-grade stainless steel with a non-stick coating. This one did begin showing signs of wear.</p>
<p>The inner pot is the only piece of the electric pressure cookers that is dishwashable. The main body of the cooker, the lid and the lid’s inner silicone gasket must be manually cleaned after each use to maintain a secure seal. The T-fal-CY505E is the only model we had trouble cleaning, because of an odd design choice: its lid is attached by a hinge to the cooker body and cannot be removed, which limited how well we could clean it.</p>

<p>We wanted our tests to cover a variety of typical foods people might cook with a pressure cooker. So, we tested cooking:</p>
<ul>
<li>A whole 3-pound fryer chicken</li>
<li>A 3-pound beef pot roast</li>
<li>1 cup of black beans</li>
<li>1 cup of long-grain rice</li>
<li>Hard- and soft-cooked eggs</li>
</ul>
<p>Except for the eggs, each product was minimally seasoned with salt and pepper and cooked in the recommended liquid (usually one cup) for the time instructed in each user manual. Because many people are new to using a pressure cooker, we followed each recipe in the manuals precisely to determine how accurate they were the first time we tried them.</p>
<p>We took a different approach with the eggs by cooking them at 3 minutes (soft), 5 minutes (cooked with jammy yolks) and 6 minutes (firm yolks). However, the shortest cooking time that both the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MZZXO4W/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Power Pressure Cooker XL </a>and <a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B016RYKKL6/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">T-fal &#8211; CY505E</a> could be manually programmed was 5 minutes, so we couldn’t test them for the 3- and 6-minute eggs.</p>
<p>We considered the following questions while testing each of the pressure cookers:</p>
<p><b>Ease of use:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Were programs/functions clearly designated?</li>
<li>Could we figure out how each program worked without consulting the user manual?</li>
<li>Did the user manual provide sufficient instruction for each program?</li>
<li>Were recommended cook times and recipes easy to understand?</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Safety: </b>We examined the cooker’s lid, silicone gasket, lid-locking capability and pressure-escape valve to ensure safety when the cooker was turned on. For the stovetop pressure cookers, we experimented several times with securing the lid to ensure that it was properly and tightly sealed.</p>
<p><b>Performance: </b>We recorded how long it took for each pressure cooker to come to pressure. <b> </b>Once the cooking time completed, we checked how well the food was cooked, its consistency and taste.</p>
<p><b>Convenience: </b>Manufacturers claim that you could replace your <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-slow-cooker/">slow cooker</a> and rice cooker with their multi-function electric pressure cooker. We determined whether their claims were viable. (In almost all cases, we would not recommend throwing your rice cooker in the trash.)</p>

<p>It became clear during our testing that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FLYWNYQ/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Instant Pot &#8211; DUO60</a> was the one to beat. It’s the only pressure cooker we tested that gave us exceptionally luscious meats and perfectly cooked rice, beans and eggs with almost no learning curve. All of the other pressure cookers had either too many or too few buttons, and even though we followed their instruction manuals precisely, food was often over-cooked or, more problematically, under-cooked.</p>

From rice to beans to roast, Instant Pot gave us superior results across the board. In other words, it's worth the hype.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FLYWNYQ/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Instant Pot does exactly as advertised: an entire meal can be prepared in one pot. The saute function sears at three heat levels (221 ℉, 320 ℉ and 338 ℉) for light to dark browning, the meat/chili function pressure cooks and tenderizes the toughest cuts of meat, and the automatic “keep warm” function kicks in when the programmed cooking cycle completes.</p>
<h3>Cooking results</h3>
<p>We used the meat/stew, bean/chili, poultry, rice and saute functions for our tests. Each pre-programmed setting can be adjusted to add more time or pressure, but we found that generally, the settings were spot-on accurate. The chicken was very juicy, flavorful and tender in 20 minutes; after an hour the pot roast sliced easily and held together and unsoaked beans were perfectly cooked in 50 minutes.</p>
<p>Instant Pot’s claim that it replaces a number of kitchen appliances, like a rice cooker, has merit. Instant Pot’s rice function produced excellent rice, each grain individual and only slightly sticky. Every other pressure cooker gave us rice that was soft and very sticky, similar to Chinese take-out rice.</p>
<p>Food expert and chef Alton Brown recently wrote about <a href="https://altonbrown.com/pressure-cooker-eggs-recipe/">the science behind easy-to-peel hard-boiled eggs</a> from a pressure cooker. It’s somewhat tricky to get them just right in a stovetop pressure cooker since you need to continually monitor the pressure and timing.</p>
<p>However, cooking eggs in the Instant Pot couldn’t be easier. We manually programmed Instant Pot to 3 minutes for soft-boiled eggs, 5 minutes for hard-boiled eggs with soft, almost jammy, yolks and 6 minutes for a fully cooked hard-boiled egg. Each test gave us perfectly cooked eggs at the desired consistency.</p>
<p>The Instant Pot has other functions that we didn’t test: multigrain, porridge and yogurt. These unique functions allow you to cook wild rice, steel-cut oatmeal and make a large batch of yogurt from scratch.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>A feature that we like is how easily the Instant Pot seals. Once you’ve inserted the sturdy stainless steel inner pot, you lock the lid in place, by clicking it clockwise. The Instant Pot emits musical tones to let you know you’ve sealed it securely. For the other pressure cookers, we needed to carefully align arrows on the lid and casing, which was less foolproof.</p>
<p>The other pressure cookers we tested hissed and spat a little steam during cooking. The Instant Pot, however, was completely silent, a testament to the efficacy of its sealing.</p>
<p>The Instant Pot’s inventor, Robert Wang, took years to experiment with and test his invention, and his research and development are evident in the Instant Pot’s user-friendly functionality and thoughtful design. The other electric pressure cookers we tested were either the same price or a little cheaper than the Instant Pot, but none of them proved to be as reliable or easy to use. We recommend spending a few dollars more for this superior kitchen appliance.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Instant Pot &#8211; DUO60’s exceptional user interface and accurate pre-programmed functions make pressure cooking easy and stress-free.</li>
<li>Dual pressure settings allow you to select high pressure for tenderizing and cooking tough cuts of meat or low pressure for delicate foods and vegetables.</li>
<li>Unique to Instant Pot, ten safety mechanisms safeguard lid closure, pressure build-up, overheating and vent blockage.</li>
<li>Instant Pot was the only electric pressure cooker we tested that cooked meats, rice and beans equally well.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000MPA044/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; CPC-600</a> doesn’t have Instant Pot’s “bells and whistles,” but its much simpler functions still gave us great results. The Cuisinart has only three buttons: Menu, Time and Start/Cancel. The Menu button allows you to select high or low pressure, browning, saute, simmer and keep warm.</p>
<p>We found Cuisinart’s instruction and recipe booklets to be the best of all the pressure cookers we tested. The instruction booklet is written clearly with easy-to-follow step-by-step instructions. The flip side of the booklet is a collection of recipes and cook times for meats and vegetables. The recipes are not only interesting (for example, “Veal Shoulder Roast Stuffed with Sage Mushrooms” and “Not The Same Old Three-Bean Salad”) but very detailed as well.</p>
<p>The pressure value needs to be installed, and admittedly, we had trouble with the Cuisinart coming to pressure at the first try. We reinstalled the pressure value and discovered that it was quite sensitive and occasionally needed to be nudged to retain pressure. Other than this minor issue we had no problems operating the Cuisinart.</p>

Its browning function might be even better than our top pick Instant Pot's.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000MPA044/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>For all of the tests, the Cuisinart came to pressure quickly, usually between four and 12 minutes.</p>
<p>Chicken, beans, eggs and rice turned out almost exactly as they had in the Instant Pot.</p>
<p>The recipe book calls for pressure-cooking pot roast for a substantial 99 minutes (the longest time that the Cuisinart can be programmed). As instructed, we allowed a natural release, but the beef was somewhat under-cooked. We set the roast for an additional 15 minutes, and this time, it came out fork-tender.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart has an excellent browning function. It’s hotter than the saute function, and it gave the beef and chicken a rich golden-brown color that we didn’t get with the other pressure cookers, including the Instant Pot.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart isn’t as expensive as Instant Pot, and if you don’t think you’ll need all the extra functions and just want a reliable pressure cooker, then the Cuisinart is an excellent choice.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Cuisinart &#8211; CPC-600 has a simple interface and the essential functions for simple and accurate pressure cooking.</li>
<li>It has a unique browning function for meats and poultry that most other pressure cookers lack.</li>
<li>Cuisinart’s instruction and recipe booklets are the best of all pressure cookers we tested. Instructions and recipes are clearly written with detailed easy-to-follow step-by-step instructions.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EXLOW38/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">T-fal &#8211; P25107</a> stovetop pressure cooker is constructed of heavy-gauge stainless steel, which proved very efficient in rapid pressurizing and evenly distributing heat. Despite its terrible user’s guide, the T-fal stovetop is a viable option if you prefer a more hands-on method for pressure cooking or don’t want to incur the expense of an electric pressure cooker.</p>
<p>The T-fal is outfitted with an accurate operating valve that controls pressure. It’s labeled 1 (low pressure) for delicate foods and vegetables, 2 (high pressure) for meat and frozen food, and it has a steam symbol for slow release. As with other stovetop pressure cookers, running a stream of cold water over the pressure cooker causes a rapid release.</p>

<p>The user’s guide has a single page of two skimpy tables for cooking times, mostly for vegetables, rice and beans. In keeping to our test conditions, we followed the guide’s recommendations and crossed our fingers.</p>
<p>Our first test was cooking rice. During the build-up of pressure, condensation appeared around the handle joints and dripped onto the cooktop. The user’s guide recommends 5 minutes for rice, and although we were initially uncertain that it had come to full pressure, we got the hang of waiting for the bobbin to hiss and pop up before beginning timing.</p>
<p>The rice was an unqualified success, slightly sticky with individual grains, and the most like rice cooked in a saucepan.</p>
<p>The T-fal didn’t leak condensation in subsequent tests, and pressure remained constant (with our continual monitoring of the heat).</p>
<p>We had excellent results using the recommended times in the user’s guide: chicken (16 minutes) was cooked through and juicy, beans (4 minutes, pre-soaked) were soft with a perfect bite to them, the eggs (5 minutes) were tender with slightly jammy yolks and the pot roast (40 minutes) held together with minimal shredding.</p>
<p>The T-fal &#8211; P25107 is well-priced for such a quality product. If you’re looking to buy a traditional stovetop pressure cooker, we recommend you consider purchasing this one.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The  T-fal &#8211; P25107’s heavy-gauge stainless steel construction is efficient in rapid pressurization and even heat distribution.</li>
<li>The user’s guide recommended cooking times are accurate and produced excellent results in all of our tests.</li>

<h3>Power Pressure Cooker XL</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MZZXO4W/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Power Pressure Cooker XL </a> is manufactured by Tristar Products, a company better known for exercise and beauty products “as seen on TV.” Despite the substantial number of complaints posted on Amazon, there is a higher proportion of excellent-to-good ratings for this pressure cooker. Generally, we found it performed well, but there are several negatives about the Power Pressure Cooker that don’t justify its high price.</p>
<p>From the outside, it physically resembles Instant Pot. But that’s where the comparison stops. The Power Pressure’s stainless steel inner pot has a non-stick coating, which comes in contact with food. Undoubtedly this will wear down from repeated high-heat use, and when chipped, it’s hazardous.</p>
<p>Before first use, the manual instructs running the cooker through the canning cycle. (We weren’t ever sure why, as no other pressure cooker manual advises doing this.) To do so, the manual instructs filling the inner pot two-thirds full of water; the pot, however, is marked in fifths. Right from the start, it’s a matter of guessing, a pattern that continues with the recipes.</p>
<p>The manual’s recipe for chicken was unnecessarily confusing. According to instructions, the chicken should be browned using the chicken/meat button, then covered and programmed for 30 minutes with the soup/stew function. The cooker’s timer immediately counted down with no indication that pressure was building, and in fact, after 30 minutes, there was no pressure to release. We were unsure whether the chicken had been pressure cooked or stewed instead.</p>
<p>The chicken/meat function browned both the chicken and beef well, but although the chicken turned out tender and juicy, the pot roast was dry, stringy and inedible.</p>
<p>Another negative factor is that the pre-programmed times for each button can’t be adjusted upward or downward. The least amount of time is 5 minutes, using the Rice/Risotto button, so it was impossible for us to complete the egg test (cooking them for 3, 5 and 6 minutes). As it was, the yolk of the 5-minute egg was overcooked and rubbery.</p>
<p>Unlike the Instant Pot, the Power Pressure has a special canning feature and separate instruction manual. We experimented with the canning function and found that it works as advertised. However, this additional feature doesn’t justify the Power Pressure’s price, which, depending on where you purchase, is the same as (or even higher than) the Instant Pot.</p>
<p>The Power Pressure Cooker simply isn’t as well designed as the Instant Pot and could easily discourage a first-time user from cooking with it on a regular basis.</p>
<h3>T-fal &#8211; CY505E (not recommended)</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B016RYKKL6/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">T-fal &#8211; CY505E</a> is loaded with features and functions that none of the other electric pressure cookers have. These include oatmeal (identical to the Instant Pot porridge function), baby food, bake, reheat and DIY Chef, a function that supposedly allows you to program time, temperature and pressure.</p>
<p><b>All of these would seem to be excellent additions,</b> <b>except that T-fal doesn’t include any instructions for how to program them</b>. This was especially irksome with the DIY Chef function since it would be the only function that allows manual programming.</p>
<p>Many consumer complaints cite the uselessness of T-fal’s instruction booklet; some people get quite bitter about it. We researched online, and other than a duplicate of the print version, we found no documentation for explaining how to use T-fal’s additional features.</p>
<p>T-fal made an odd design choice in permanently attaching the lid to the body of the unit with a hinge, presumably to ensure sealing. However, not only did we find it awkward and troublesome to shut securely, the lid was also impossible to clean thoroughly.</p>
<p>Since there were limited instructions for use, we had to guess what might work for each test. We began by browning the chicken, but an error message kept popping up. We checked the troubleshooting page of the manual and learned the message meant the lid isn’t shut. We triple-checked the lid, but the error message still flashed.</p>
<p>We decided to program the pressure cook function for 30 minutes. It took over 15 minutes to come to pressure. Once the program completed, we unlocked the release valve for a quick release. However no steam was emitted, and the lid still wouldn’t budge until 25 minutes later.</p>
<p>Regarding test results, the chicken was juicy and tasty, but the dark meat was under-done. We tried rice twice, and both times (9 minutes and 6 minutes), it stuck together in clumps.</p>
<p>We used soups/stews to brown the pot roast and cooked it using the pressure cook function. The beef turned out dry, stringy and tasteless.</p>
<p>Since 5 minutes was the lowest time we could program, we couldn’t complete the three tests for eggs. The five-minute eggs had chalky yolks and chemical-tasting whites.</p>
<p>The only food to be well-cooked was the beans, which came out soft and flavorful.</p>
<p>If T-fal improved the instruction manual, they might have a viable product. But as the T-fal CY505E costs only slightly less than the Instant Pot, we recommend going for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FLYWNYQ/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Instant Pot</a> instead.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005FYF4F2/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Presto &#8211; 01365</a> required minimal assembly before we could begin testing. Unlike T-fal, Presto offers detailed instructions for operation, maintenance and cleaning. It’s made of stainless steel, but it seems light-weight, and during our tests, we found that heat distribution was uneven.</p>
<p>The Presto is easy to seal by simply pushing down on the lid until air is forced out and clamping it shut. The Presto came to pressure quickly, between 4 and 8 minutes, but it was necessary to continually regulate the heat to sustain pressure. As food cooks, steam is released through a pressure regulator, which bobs on top of a valve and indicates high or low pressure. It takes some practice to figure out whether heat needs to be lowered or raised.</p>
<p>As we did with all the pressure cookers, we followed the cooking time recommended in Presto’s instruction and recipe booklet. Unfortunately, the recipes aren’t as accurate as the operating instructions. Rice was soft but gummy. The beans were only half-cooked at the recommended time, so we brought them back to pressure and cooked them an additional 3 minutes.</p>
<p>The recipe instructed cooking a 3-pound chicken for 16 minutes, which proved insufficient time, as both the inner chicken breast and thigh were raw. For the pot roast, the manual recommends 45 minutes and a natural pressure release (which added 10 minutes to cooking time). The beef shredded too easily and was dry and stringy.</p>
<p>There’s only a few dollars’ difference between the Presto and the T-fal stovetop pressure cooker. The T-fal, however, is a better product that gave more consistent results.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>A pressure cooker can definitely change the way you cook. By cutting cooking time by half or even two-thirds, a pressure cooker gives you the opportunity to enjoy a favorite, long-simmered dish in an hour or less.</p>
<p>Electric pressure cookers are certainly more convenient than stovetop models, but we found that many on the market have extra functions than unnecessary. There’s always a learning curve with a new appliance, but with too many bells and whistles, it will take a while to learn how to use them.</p>
<p>Our top pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FLYWNYQ/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Instant Pot &#8211; DUO60</a>, is an affordable and extremely user-friendly electric pressure cooker. It turned out perfectly-cooked food in all of our tests. For performance, functionality and convenience, Instant Pot can&#8217;t be beat. Our runner-up, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000MPA044/?tag=ybdprsr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; CPC-600</a>, has far fewer functions, but it has all the essentials.</p>
<p>If you want an electric pressure cooker that’s just for pressure cooking, then the Cuisinart is a great and somewhat less-expensive choice.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>In the 1970s you could pretty much count on finding a slow cooker in every kitchen. The slow-cooker revolution let working parents cook a full meal all day unattended without worrying about the house burning down. With the recent advent of <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-pressure-cooker/">electric pressure cookers</a> (for example, Instant Pot), you might think that slow cookers are less popular. But defying the odds, sales of slow cookers have actually increased substantially, thanks in part to a global market.</p>
<p>Factors contributing to sales growth are portability, programmable functions and low power consumption. Based on our research of consumer posts on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/4x8khb/looking_for_recommendations_for_a_programmable/?st=jfedvjmc&amp;sh=f49cf069" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reddit</a>, Consumer Report’s buying guide and Amazon, as well as information gleaned from other review sites, we chose to test a wide range of newer models with add-on features and less-expensive models with basic functions.</p>

<h2 id="why-buy">Why buy a slow cooker?</h2>
<p>Since the 1970s, when the Crock-Pot was introduced, the slow cooker has been a must-have kitchen appliance. It’s particularly helpful for working parents who don’t have time during the workweek to fix a meal for the family.</p>
<p>Today there’s a broad range of slow cookers you can buy. The simpler models haven’t changed much since the 1970s, but newer models are programmable and can also be Bluetooth capable. Fancy or simple, they all share the same desirable characteristics that make the slow cooker one of the most purchased kitchen appliances in the world.</p>
<p><b>Convenience: </b>This is the number one reason why people buy a slow cooker. The ingredients for a recipe can be layered in the stoneware or ceramic pot (and refrigerated) the night before or in the morning. Plug it in, set it on low and eight hours later, you’ve got a luscious beef pot roast or whole chicken and vegetables ready to serve.</p>
<p><b>Low power consumption:</b> The slow cooker is undoubtedly a cost-efficient way to cook. On average, the slow cookers we tested ranged between 180 watts and 320 watts. (The Cuisinart is the highest at 1,350 watts.) In comparison, an electric oven can use a significantly higher 2400 watts. <a href="http://energyusecalculator.com/electricity_oven.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Using this calculator</a> to calculate energy consumption at 10 cents per kilowatt hour, an electric oven used for a four-hour period could cost approximately $1 per day. A slow cooker (using the average wattage of the models we tested) at 250 watts for eight hours would cost only 19 cents per day. Even the higher wattage Cuisinart consumes half the energy of an electric oven.</p>
<p><b>Portability:</b> A slow cooker is ideal for a holiday meal, a family get-together, potlucks and even a tailgating party, since you can cook the food in one location and transport it, still warm, to another location. A slow cooker is also <a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/95914/jewish/Food-Preparation-on-Shabbat.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved by Jewish religious leaders</a> for partially cooking, warming and serving the traditional cholent stew during the Sabbath (when all cooking is forbidden).</p>
<p><b>Economy:</b> Most slow cookers are inexpensive and as noted above are cheap to operate. But a slow cooker could also reduce your grocery bill since you can buy less-choice, tough cuts of meats, which the slow cooker simmers to incredible tenderness.</p>

<p><b>Capacity:</b> Slow cookers come in a number of sizes, ranging from a capacity of 1.5 quarts to 8 quarts. The user manuals of the slow cookers we tested advise filling the slow cooker to a maximum of three-quarters full, so capacity is important for what you plan to cook and for how many people. Most manufacturers recommend a 5- or 6-quart model for a family of four, and it can easily accommodate a whole chicken, beef roast or pork shoulder for pulled pork. If you plan to cook chili, soup or stew for a crowd or in bulk quantities for freezing, then the 7- or 8-quart model would be best.</p>
<p><b>Removable inner pot:</b> Slow cooker inner pots are round, oval or oblong, and most are ceramic or stoneware. If you want to make desserts in a slow cooker, a circular cake pan or springform pan can fit into a round inner pot. However, for chili, soups and stews, we found that the heat was better distributed in the oval or oblong inner pot and required less stirring.</p>
<p><b>Sealing/locking lid:</b> A glass lid that seals with a rubber gasket and locks onto the slow cooker maintains a consistent internal temperature in the inner pot. A sealing/locking lid is also essential for transporting the inner pot without spillage.</p>
<p><b>Programmable controls:</b> Newer models have digital controls, which can be programmed to schedule time and temperature settings. The programmable models are especially convenient for all-day cooking, automatically switching from the cook mode to the keep-warm mode and preventing overcooking.</p>
<p><strong>“</strong><b>On” light:</b> Surprisingly, very few slow cookers have an “on” light. None of the manual models we tested had an “on” light, so we didn’t know if the slow cooker was functioning unless we touched the sides of the slow cooker’s housing. Some digital models have an “on” light or a “ready” light to indicate that the inner pot has reached the programmed temperature.</p>
<p><b>Browning/sauteing function:</b> The majority of slow cooker inner pots are oven-safe, but they aren’t stovetop-safe, so meat and vegetables should be browned or sauted in a separate pan. A browning function isn’t essential, but it does give you the ability to brown a roast without washing a second pan.</p>

<p>Depending on the recipe and what you’re cooking, a slow cooker needs to rapidly reach and exceed 140 ℉ — the <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/danger-zone-40-f-140-f/CT_Index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“danger zone” where salmonella bacteria can grow</a> — and continue to increase in temperature to no higher than 210 ℉ for a period of four-to-eight hours. If the temperature exceeds 210 ℉ and hits the boiling point at 212 ℉, the food will cook too quickly and dry out.</p>
<p>On the keep-warm setting, the slow cooker must also sustain a temperature not lower than the “danger zone,” below 140 ℉, to inhibit bacterial growth.</p>
<p>To ensure food safety, modern slow cookers are much hotter than the 1970s slow cookers, so anything you cook in a slow cooker can easily overcook. It’s a good idea to actually take your slow cooker’s temperature to know whether you need to change a recipe’s timing.</p>
<p>We filled all of our slow cookers halfway and set them on low. Over the next four hours, we used an <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-digital-meat-thermometer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instant-read thermometer</a> to check temperatures every hour. Some slow cookers have hot spots around the edges of the inner pot, closest to the heating element, and these hot spots will cook food faster than the food in the center of the inner pot.</p>

<p><b>The </b><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008YEXC22/?tag=ybdslow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Cuisinart &#8211; MSC-600</b></a><b> was the only slow cooker that hit above the danger zone in the first hour. </b>By 90 minutes, all of the slow cookers — except the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D68QHSG/?tag=ybdslow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Proctor-Silex &#8211; 33042 </a>— were between 147 ℉ &#8211; 152 ℉. The Proctor-Silex didn&#8217;t clear the danger zone until after the second hour. At this point, the internal temperature of a large piece of beef or a whole chicken would not have reached above 140 ℉, <strong>so there would be a risk of bacterial growth.</strong></p>
<p>By the third hour, all of the slow cookers’ temperatures had spiked 20 degrees. By the fourth hour, all — except for the Cuisinart — increased by another 10 degrees. The Cuisinart stayed consistent at 199 ℉, a good temperature for the low setting.</p>
<p>For our final water test, we turned up the setting to high. Within 30 minutes, all of the slow cookers hit over 200 ℉ with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X5XJ9FG/?tag=ybdslow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; SC1007D</a> at boiling (212 ℉), which is much too hot. The Cuisinart reached its high temperature at 209 ℉ and sustained it for the next hour.</p>

<p>For our performance tests, we selected pinto beans and pot roast because they ran the gamut of different preparation, heat levels and cooking times. Many online recipes suggest heating up the slow cooker at high for one hour and then adjusting it to the low setting for the remainder of the cooking time. However, we decided it would be a fairer test of performance to cook at its low and high settings without making any adjustments to temperature.</p>
<p>We soaked one pound of pinto beans per slow cooker overnight, drained them and combined the beans with enough water to cover them by two inches. Each slow cooker was set at low, and we took the temperature at the center and the edges of the inner pot every hour. At the third hour of cooking, we began to test the beans for level of doneness.</p>
<p>We intentionally didn’t stir the beans so we could determine whether the beans in the center of the pot cooked differently than those around the edges of the pot. (Under normal non-test conditions, the beans should be stirred.)</p>
<p>Slow cookers have always been marketed as a “set-it-and-forget-it” appliance. Theoretically, you could layer meat and vegetables in the slow cooker, set it on low and leave it unattended for eight hours. However, our results showed that unless you occasionally stirred or checked on what you’re cooking, you would wind up with chewy, undercooked or overcooked food.</p>
<p>For the pot roast test, we cut three-pound pieces of beef chuck, approximately two inches thick, from the same large piece of beef. We seasoned each three-pound roast with Kosher salt and black pepper and added enough beef broth to fill each slow cooker halfway. We set the slow cookers on high and recorded the temperatures of the liquid at one-hour intervals. Once the roasts were done (approximately 4-½ to 5 hours), we adjusted the setting to warm for an additional hour to test how the cooked roasts might be affected.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008YEXC22/?tag=ybdslow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; MSC-600</a> outperformed all of the slow cookers we tested. It maintained an ideal temperature range of between 199 ℉ and 210 ℉, which evenly cooked the beans at the low setting and produced a tender and juicy pot roast at the high setting.</p>
<p>Perhaps in an attempt to attract consumers not quite ready to dip into the Instant Pot pool, Cuisinart is marketing this 6-quart slow cooker as a three-in-one “multi-cooker,” which we believe is an overstatement. In reality, it’s a slow cooker with the additional functions of steaming and browning, both of which certainly elevate it above simpler models.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart has a brushed stainless-steel housing with a blue backlit LCD display and buttons for selecting slow cook, brown/saute, steam, start/stop and plus and minus increments for time and temperature. We found it very easy to program (without needing to consult the user’s manual) and can be adjusted at any point during the cooking time.</p>

<p>Its oval heating element is raised from the bottom of the housing unit and approximately runs the length and width of the inner pot. The inner pot is composed of sturdy but lightweight aluminum, which is coated with xylan, a nonstick coating manufactured by <a href="https://www.whitfordww.com/industrial/commercial-bakeware.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whitford Worldwide</a>. (There are concerns posted on Amazon that the coating is Teflon, <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/teflon-and-perfluorooctanoic-acid-pfoa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long exposure to which is known to cause health issues</a>. However, we confirmed with Cuisinart’s customer service that the inner pot is coated with xylan and not Teflon.)</p>
<p>The Cuisinart’s inner pot has BPA-free plastic cool-to-touch handles. It is the only inner pot of the slow cookers we tested that didn’t require us to use pot holders to remove it from the housing. The Cuisinart comes with a steaming rack and, like all slow cookers, a heavy glass lid. Our only criticism of the Cuisinart’s design is that the lid doesn’t lock onto the inner pot, so you need to devise a way to prevent spillage during transport. (One online suggestion is bungee cords.)</p>
<p>The Cuisinart maintained an optimal temperature range in all of our tests. For the beans (cooked at the low setting), once it reached 198 ℉, the temperature was sustained for three hours. The temperature in the center of the pot was minimally less by one or two degrees, a difference that did not affect the cooking. The beans were done after 5-½ hours, and they were all evenly cooked without any uncooked, hard beans mixed in.</p>
<p>The pot roast test was a real make-or-break for all of the slow cookers. The Cuisinart had the edge over the others, thanks to its excellent browning/sauteing function, which can be programmed up to 400 ℉, the hottest of all the slow cookers we tested.</p>
<p>Browning occurs at 280 ℉-330 ℉, so the Cuisinart can achieve similar results to those of a saute pan. Although many slow cooker recipes suggest that browning meat isn’t necessary, we found that it made a big difference in flavor.</p>
<p>The pot roast was done at four hours, and it was tender and beefy-tasting. We switched the temperature setting to warm, and because the Cuisinart’s warm setting is the lowest temperature (165 ℉) of all the slow cookers we tested, the roast did not dry out and stayed juicy an hour later.</p>
<p>The nonstick coated aluminum pot was easy to clean and is dishwasher-safe. We had a bit of trouble with cleaning stains from the heating element, and we noticed pinpricks of rust on the housing’s stainless steel after repeated use. It’s not a deal-breaker, but the stainless steel does need to be maintained.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart’s user manual and recipe booklet were by far the most complete and extensive, with recipes ranging from breakfast to entrees to sauces to desserts. (We did question, however, why anyone would want to wait 3 hours for oatmeal or breakfast strata to cook.)</p>
<p>The Cuisinart MSC-600 is a bit more expensive than the other slow cookers we tested, but for ease of use, performance and design, it is undeniably superior to the rest.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Cuisinart &#8211; MSC-600 has well-calibrated settings that quickly reach the programmed temperatures and sustain them throughout cooking.</li>
<li>The Cuisinart is the only slow cooker we tested that had a browning/sauteing function, which adds substantial taste to slow-cooked meats, such as roasts and stews. It also saves time since you only have one pot to wash.</li>
<li>Its non-Teflon-coated aluminum inner pot heats evenly without any hot spots and is easy to clean.</li>
<li>The Cuisinart has an attractive stainless steel housing with an easy-to-read blue LCD display and simple programmable functions.</li>

<p>If you don’t mind giving up the Cuisinart’s digital programming feature, the manually-controlled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MR0FFPS/?tag=ybdslow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chefman &#8211; RJ15-5-N</a> is a great option for about half the price. The Chefman has an attractive and unique stoneware crock with a nonstick, non-chemical (<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/teflon-and-perfluorooctanoic-acid-pfoa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PFOA-free and PTFE-free</a>) coating that is oven-safe — and the only inner pot of the slow cookers we tested that is stovetop-safe. The stoneware crock can be used for reheating food in the oven and for simmering or reducing sauces on a stovetop’s open flame.</p>
<p>In other respects, the Chefman is very similar to most slow cookers. It’s oval-shaped, has a tempered-glass lid and manually controlled settings for low, high and warm. The lid doesn’t have a locking device, so it can’t be readily transported elsewhere other than from the kitchen to the dining room table. The heating element is built within the stainless steel housing, so it gets very hot and can’t be touched without pot holders.</p>

<p>During our tests, the Chefman was a little slow at the low setting to reach the temperature above the danger zone, but at the high setting it hit 206 ℉ within 90 minutes and increased just a few degrees to 210 ℉, which it then sustained for three hours. The Chefman’s temperature range at high was comparable with the Cuisinart and kept the liquid at a steady simmer without ever boiling.</p>
<p>The pinto beans completed cooking in six hours, and although a few from the center of the pot were not as well-cooked as those around the edges of the pot, they were flavorful. The Chefman’s pot roast was on par with the Cuisinart’s — tender, juicy and beefy. Its warm setting was a little high at 206 ℉, but even at that temperature, the roast didn’t dry out.</p>
<p>The Chefman’s housing was easy to clean, and the stoneware crock and lid are dishwasher-safe. The pot roast left slight staining in the crock, but this can be cleaned with a paste of water and baking soda.</p>
<p>The Chefman is about the same price or even a bit less expensive than the other slow cookers we tested that didn’t perform nearly as well. So if you don’t mind having to manually control temperature and time, we can recommend the Chefman as an excellent alternative to the more high-end Cuisinart.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Chefman &#8211; RJ15-5-N is the only slow cooker we tested that can be used in the oven for reheating food and on a stovetop open flame for simmering and reducing sauces and gravies.</li>
<li>Its attractive and unique chemical-free stoneware crock evenly distributes heat and maintains temperatures for its settings.</li>
<li>The Chefman is well-priced for such a high-quality slow cooker.</li>

<p>Another slow cooker that comes with bells and whistles is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NAPBT3E/?tag=ybdslow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Crock-Pot &#8211; SCCPVC600AS-B</a>, a 6-quart slow cooker, and it’s also highly rated on Amazon. This Crock-Pot has simple digital programming with an easy-to-read LCD display that flashes between heat setting and remaining time to the program.</p>
<p>The Crock-Pot ran a bit cool overall, not exceeding 200 ℉ on the low setting and 206 ℉ on the high setting. The beans were done in five hours, but they were inconsistently cooked; some were soft, others were mealy. The pot roast took 5-½ hours, and although the bottom half of the roast was juicier, it was still tender and quite flavorful.</p>
<p>During our first tests, we experienced a couple of issues, so we decided to test a second unit to determine whether our first unit was faulty or not.</p>
<p>With the first unit we noticed a strong, acrid smell emitting from the Crock-Pot’s housing. There are some complaints from Amazon reviewers about this prevalent odor, and the Crock-Pot company claims that it will lessen over time. However, even after repeated washings, the first unit’s odor did not dissipate and added an unpleasant metallic flavor to the beans and pot roast.</p>
<p>We had better success with the second unit. We again smelled the distinctive odor during the water test, but it lessened after each subsequent use and did not affect the food.</p>
<p>The second issue we had was with the Crock-Pot’s automatic stirring attachment. It has its own power source, so the Crock-Pot itself is plugged into the stirring motor. It’s equipped with two paddles: a four-pronged metal paddle for stew and a wide plastic paddle for soup and chili.</p>
<p>The stirrer can be programmed to stir at 30-minute intervals. It’s a great idea, if only it worked. After the first unit failed to stir, we tested the second unit, and it also failed to stir at the programmed time. The stirrer has a “pulse” button, which lets you stir without using the program, and this worked fine both times.</p>
<p>Crock-Pot has other programmable models without the automatic stirring attachment, which might be more reliable for the same midrange price.</p>

<p>This is a basic, round, no-frills 4-quart slow cooker. Its dishwasher-safe ceramic pot and glass lid fit into a metal housing with manual controls. As the housing heats up, it gets very hot and can’t be touched.</p>
<p>At the low setting, it took over two hours for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D68QHSG/?tag=ybdslow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Proctor-Silex &#8211; 33042 </a>to surpass the 140 ℉ danger zone, and then it didn’t reach a temperature at which food would actually cook until four hours later. One can imagine coming home to a stew after a day at work and finding it half raw.</p>
<p>The beans and pot roast test results were wildly divergent. It took the Proctor-Silex 11-½ hours to cook the beans through.</p>
<p>However, the pot roast surprised us by being one of the best we cooked. It took a bit longer at the Proctor-Silex’s high setting — six hours — but it shredded easily and had lots of meaty flavor.</p>
<p>One advantage to the Proctor-Silex’s cooler temperature is that the keep-warm setting is 189 ℉, which was enough to keep the roast hot, but not overcook it.</p>
<p>The Proctor-Silex is a bit more expensive than our runner-up, the Chefman. It’s not a bad little slow cooker at its high setting, but it&#8217;s too-low temperature doubles the cooking time of recipes that need a low setting, such as soups and stews.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X5XJ9FG/?tag=ybdslow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; SC1007D</a> is an oval, 7-quart slow cooker with a stoneware inner pot that fits into a metal housing with models that are decorated with three different retro designs. The housing’s plastic handles are cool-to-the-touch, although, like other slower cookers, the inner pot’s handles cannot be touched without pot holders. The Black+Decker also has the same basic, manual settings of low, high and warm.</p>
<p>The tempered glass lid is not secured, and throughout cooking, as the liquid boiled, the lid rocked up and down, leaking built-up condensation into the lip of the stoneware pot and into the food. After we finished testing, we noticed that this condensation had dripped down into the housing unit and stained the heating element.</p>
<p>The Black+Decker runs very hot (209 ℉-212 ℉), which caused rapid evaporation of the cooking liquid, so we needed to add more liquid to prevent the beans from drying out. The beans were done in six hours, with beans in the center much harder than those along the edges of the inner pot. These results indicate that you would need to occasionally stir anything you’re cooking to ensure it all cooks the same.</p>
<p>The high heat cooked the pot roast in 4-½ hours, but because it maintained the temperature at the boiling point for two hours, the beef was bone dry.</p>
<p>The Black+Decker is about five dollars less than the Chefman, but it’s certainly not worth the small savings.</p>
<h3>Hamilton Beach &#8211; 33969 Set ‘n Forget</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EZI26GO/?tag=ybdslow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 33969 Set ‘n Forget</a> shows up on a lot of “the best of” lists, but we were less impressed, particularly with its digital programming, which we found to be difficult to use.</p>
<p>Settings are programmed by pushing a series of buttons, and once the program begins, it can’t be changed. So if the temperature is too high or too low, or if you want to adjust the time, you need to cancel the program altogether and reprogram the new settings.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach has a couple of excellent features. A rubber gasket lines the inside of the glass lid, which keeps the lid snugly secured during cooking. The lid has two vent holes to prevent condensation forming. The Hamilton Beach is also transportable without leaks, thanks to two clips on either side of the lid that snap onto hooks on either end of the pot.</p>
<p>Its unique feature is a meat probe, which can be programmed to automatically switch the cooker off when the meat reaches the designated internal temperature. This feature works for a large roast and a whole chicken; however, the probe simply isn’t long enough to get into the center of a smaller piece of meat. So it’s a nice feature, but unless Hamilton Beach extends the length of the probe, it’s pretty useless.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach also runs too hot on both high and low settings. After six hours, the beans were soft around the edges of the inner pot and only half-cooked in the center of the pot. Those beans that were fully cooked tasted delicious. The high setting boiled the pot roast for nearly three hours, resulting in dry, stringy beef.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach is about $50, approximately half the price of our top pick, the Cuisinart, and although it might make an attractive addition to your countertop, it just doesn’t perform as well.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The slow cooker has come a long way since the 70s, but some companies haven’t changed their model very much since then. We think that with all of the technology available, it makes sense to buy a digital slow cooker that ensures a constant temperature, is easy to program and gives consistent cooking results.</p>
<p>Three of the six slow cookers that we tested were digital, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008YEXC22/?tag=ybdslow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; MSC-600</a> was undoubtedly the best. Its unique additional feature of a browning/sauteing function is a real bonus for adding rich flavor to roasts and stews. The Cuisinart does not get too hot — an issue with almost all slow cookers — and it maintains the programmed temperature for hours at a time. It’s a bit more expensive, but we feel the Cuisinart is worth it.</p>
<p>Of the three manually controlled slow cookers, we preferred the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MR0FFPS/?tag=ybdslow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chefman &#8211; RJ15-5-N</a> to the others. Its nonstick, chemical-free stoneware crock is both oven-safe and stovetop-safe, and it maintained temperature settings like the Cuisinart. At half the price, if you don’t mind losing the digital programming, the Chefman is a worthy pick.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>orking with a professional chef, we tested five of the top electric smokers, smoking over 40 lbs of pork butt, 25 lbs of baby back ribs and 20 lbs of chicken. We found the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JGF97D0/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Masterbuilt &#8211; 20071117</a> to be the best electric smoker overall, producing succulent, flavorful and tender smoked meats that could easily rival professional results. At nearly double the price, our runner-up is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002VGE36S/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smokin&#8217;-It &#8211; Model #1 Electric Smoker</a>.</p>

<h2 class="collapse" id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>We began our research by reviewing the top-rated electric smokers on Amazon. From there, we compared those reviews with the recommendations made on dozens of online meat-smoking forums, such as The Smoke Ring, Smoked-Meat.com and SmokingPit.com. We also consulted with barbecue experts Jeff Phillips at Smoking-Meat.com, Steven Raichlen at Barbecue! Bible.com and Meathead Goldwyn at AmazingRibs.com to get pro tips on smoking.</p>
<p>The meat-smoking community is vast, the majority of which is based in the U.S. Midwest and South, and opinions are divided about electric smokers. Many barbecue professionals and enthusiasts profess that an electric smoker can’t give the finely balanced and nuanced smoke flavor that a charcoal grill can. However, they also admit that an electric smoker does indeed produce delicious food.</p>
<p>We refined our selection to the electric smokers that were durable, reliable, sturdily-constructed, easy to clean and user-friendly, especially for the beginner. We also gave extra points if the smoker’s manufacturer had a long-term warranty and helpful customer service.</p>

<h2 class="collapse" id="types-of-smokers">Types of electric smokers</h2>
<p>There are four types of smokers you can buy: electric, charcoal, propane and wood pellets.</p>
<p><b>Charcoal smokers:</b> The most commonly used smokers for enthusiasts and barbecue competitions are charcoal fueled. Charcoal smokers generally come in three shapes and sizes: an upright cabinet (like a mini-refrigerator), upright bullet (oval or egg-shaped) and horizontal (similar to a propane grill).</p>
<p>The charcoal slowly burns wood chunks or water-soaked wood chips, which are arranged around and on top of the charcoal. In a vertical smoker, the smoke is funneled upward to the meat; in a horizontal smoker, the smoke is funneled across the meat. These smokers require frequent maintenance of the charcoal during a typical four-hour smoking period to regulate heat and smoke.</p>
<p><b>Wood pellet smokers:</b> These are horizontal electric smokers that are fueled by cylindrical wood pellets, which are automatically fed from a hopper into a burn pot. When the smoker is ignited, an electric rod in the bottom of the burn pot heats the pellets to smoking. Both the heat and smoke can be regulated so they are evenly distributed inside the smoker. Pellet smokers have increased in popularity, but they’re expensive.</p>
<p><b>Propane smokers:</b> These are vertical, lightweight cabinets that are fueled by propane and are designed for easy portability to campsites. The propane fuels a burner that ignites wood chips or chunks to smoking. Heat and smoke can be regulated by adjusting how much propane flows from the propane tank. Propane smokers are relatively inexpensive, but their narrow size limits food capacity, and they generally perform poorly in cold or windy weather.</p>
<p><b>Electric smokers:</b> These are built for beginners who want to smoke meats without the fuss of a charcoal smoker. Electric smokers are vertical cabinets with a heating element in the bottom of the cabinet. Wood chips are loaded into a vented metal box, which sits atop the heating element. The heating element is programmed to the desired temperature, which is automatically maintained by an internal thermostat. In the better models, the smoke can be regulated by a damper at the top of the cabinet.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="how-a-smoker-works">How an electric smoker works</h2>
<p>Electric smokers can be either analog or digital. Analog smokers are controlled by an on/off switch and a manual thermostat. Digital smokers are push-button on/off with a digitally programmed temperature setting. (Some have a digital timer as well.)</p>
<p>After the smoker has preheated, the wood chips are loaded, and they begin to smoke in about 15 minutes. The meat is then loaded onto the racks and the thermostat lowered for slow cooking. Depending on the weight and cut of the meat, this can take 90 minutes to three or four hours. The best electric smokers are well-insulated so when the door is locked, no smoke can escape except through a tube or damper at the top or side of the cabinet.</p>
<p>Wood chips smoke for approximately 30 minutes. Depending on how much smoke flavor you want, more chips can be added at intervals by opening the cabinet (in most cases, front-loading) and refilling the wood chip box.</p>
<p>The majority of electric smokers have a water bowl, which is filled to a prescribed level before the heating element is turned on. The water provides moisture inside the cabinet to prevent the meat from drying out as it smokes and cooks.</p>
<p>Some digital smokers have an internal meat probe (inserted when the meat is loaded onto the racks), which automatically shuts the smoker off when the meat’s programmed internal temperature is reached. If there is no internal meat probe, then the meat’s temperature needs to be checked manually to assure it is fully cooked.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="how-to">How to smoke meat</h2>
<h3>The science of smoking meat</h3>
<p>The method for preserving and flavoring meat by smoking dates back to the primitive era. All red meats are composed of muscle, fat and connective tissue, such as collagen. Some cuts have higher percentages of fat and connective tissue, so they need to be cooked at lower and slower temperatures for a longer period to dissolve and thus tenderize the meat.</p>
<p>If the animal’s muscle was exercised regularly &#8211; for example, the leg or thigh &#8211; there will be a higher content of connective tissue, which makes the meat tough. If less exercised &#8211; like the tenderloin &#8211; the meat will have less connective tissue and will need minimal cooking to be tender.</p>
<p>The gas chemicals released from hardwood smoking, combined with a low cooking temperature (between 225-250 °F), break down the meat’s connective tissue, As the fat and collagen dissolve, they moisten and tenderize the meat. It’s a technique that’s similar to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/braising-and-stewing-techniques-and-tips-995847" target="_blank" rel="noopener">braising</a>, but smoking also creates a rich brown exterior layer, known as the Maillard Reaction, cherished by meat-smoking enthusiasts.</p>
<p>The interior pink layer beneath the browned surface of smoked meats is known as the <b>smoke ring</b>, which is a result of the wood’s released gasses binding with the meat’s water composition. This chemical reaction creates a pink ring, usually ¼-inch deep, that indicates the smoke has penetrated the meat. In the barbecue world, achieving that perfect pink ring just beneath the crusty “bark” (exterior) of smoked meat is <a href="https://barbecuebible.com/2014/07/11/science-smoke-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered the hallmark </a>of a barbecue master.</p>

<p>The rule of thumb for what woods to use for smoking meat is that it should be a hardwood, like oak, apple or maple. Any conifer, such as pine, redwood or cedar, should be avoided, since they release toxins when heated, and the smoke can taint the meat.</p>
<p>Fruit and nut tree woods add a mild and sweet flavor and are great for chicken and fish. Hardier woods, such as hickory and mesquite, produce bold and rich flavors, so you want to use a meat that can hold up to their strong smokiness, like beef and lamb.</p>
<p>Hickory is used most often for smoking bacon. It’s an aggressive flavor that you might not want for a loin or chop. Smoking forums recommend nut and fruit woods, such as pecan or pear, which give a milder smoke flavor to chicken and pork.</p>
<p>You could also try blending different woods; for example 70 percent apple wood with 30 percent mesquite. When it comes down to it, you can experiment and dictate the smoke’s flavor to your personal taste.</p>
<h3>Wood chips v. bisquettes</h3>
<p>The wood used for electric smokers can be either wood chips or bisquettes. They are available in an extensive variety of hardwoods.</p>

<p><b>Wood chips</b></p>
<p>The majority of electric smokers on the market use wood chips, which are readily available online or in hardware and barbecue stores. A small portion of wood chips is loaded into the smoker’s wood-chip box, which is set on top of the heating element.</p>
<p>Overall the smokers we tested use dry wood chips only. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JGF97D0/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Masterbuilt,</a> however, allows you the choice of either dry chips &#8211; for an intense smoke and flavor &#8211; or soaked chips &#8211; for less smoke and a lighter flavor. After about 30 minutes, the wood chips cease smoking and burn to black shards or ash. If you want more smoke flavor, you would add another portion of chips, and continue to do so until the meat is fully cooked.</p>

<p><b>Bisquettes</b></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bradleysmoker.com/product/bradley-original-electric-food-smoker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bradley Original Smoker</a> is one of the few electric smokers that uses bisquettes, which are discs about two inches in diameter and one-half-inch thick, composed primarily of compactly pressed sawdust. The bisquettes burn for approximately 20 minutes, and they produce a milder smoke than wood chips.</p>
<p>Bradley Smoker is the only manufacturer of the bisquettes (the method is a closely guarded secret), and they sell plain hardwoods and hardwoods flavored with herbs or beer.</p>
<p>Bisquettes are more expensive than wood chips, and several smoking forums and videos will instruct you on how to make your own. It’s an involved process that requires woodworking skills, but the forum contributors claim that their DIY bisquettes cost pennies and burn the same as the Bradley Smoker bisquettes.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Digital vs. analog: </b>Two of the five smokers we tested were digital &#8211; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JGF97D0/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Masterbuilt</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SMRXYCE/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Char-Broil</a> &#8211; and they were the easiest to program temperature and time settings. There is a slight difference in price between the digital and analog models, but paying more for a digital model for its ease in programming is worth it.</p>
<p>An exception is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002VGE36S/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smokin&#8217;-It #1</a>, which is nearly twice the price of our top pick, the Masterbuilt, but it stands out as a superior analog model.</p>
<p><b>Cabinet material:</b> The cabinets of the two best-performing models, Masterbuilt and Smokin&#8217;-It #1, are made of reinforced high-grade stainless steel, which proved very effective in retaining smoke and moisture and were much easier to clean than the other smokers made of lower-grade steel.</p>
<p><b>Door lock and seal: </b>The rubber gasket lining the smoker door isn’t enough for sealing the door. A strong lock is essential for heat and smoke retention, and each of the smokers we tested had a different type with a wide variance of effectiveness.</p>
<p>Smokin&#8217;-It #1 doesn’t have any gasket, but its heavy-duty latch system uses a compression fit that tightly seals the door. We experienced the worst smoke leakage with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000Y1RNFK/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smoke Hollow &#8211; 30162E</a>, which had a thin gasket and a small, weak latch that barely held the cabinet door shut.</p>
<p><b>Internal meat probe: </b>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SMRXYCE/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Char-Broil</a> was the only smoker we tested that had a built-in programmable meat probe, and it was accurate in gauging the meat’s internal temperature. For the other smokers we needed to manually check the meat’s internal temperature at intervals. Remote control meat probes are not expensive, so we recommend purchasing one if it is not included in the smoker.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Seasoning the smoker</h3>
<p>Before testing could begin, we needed to “season” the electric smokers. In this case, seasoning doesn’t mean applying herbs and spices to the meat. It’s a preliminary preheating of the smoker that burns off any residue from manufacturing, packing and shipping. Because there are potentially toxic substances, such as paint and machine oil, clinging to the inner cabinet’s walls, it’s essential to season your smoker before you smoke any food.</p>
<p>When seasoning a cast iron skillet, you apply a thin coat of oil and then heat the skillet in a hot oven. The oil bakes into the skillet and leaves a protective coating, which then allows you to simply wipe the skillet clean without soap and water.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to seasoning an electric smoker. It’s a simple process. The smoker is heated to 275 °F for three hours, and wood chips are inserted for the last 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Other cooks on forums advise applying a thin coat of oil to the inner cabinet’s walls, which, after heating, leaves a protective finish. However, except for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000Y1RNFK/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smoke Hollow</a>, instruction manuals for the smokers we tested did not recommend oiling their cabinets before heating.</p>
<p>We followed Smoke Hollow’s manual and seasoned the cabinet with canola oil. After we completing our testing, we discovered that the cabinet was permanently stained and impossible to clean.</p>

<p>We wanted to smoke meats that represented the most popular types and cuts people cook, so we could get a good feel for results with each machine.</p>
<p>Beef brisket and pork ribs are undoubtedly the most popular meats that people smoke. Brisket, however, is <a href="http://www.thesmokerking.com/page1a.html#.WdvXJWhSzIU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered something of an art form</a> in barbecue. The cut and quality of the brisket, its preparation, smoking time and whether the smoker is fueled by wood, charcoal or propane affect the quality of the finished smoked meat.</p>
<p>Pork ribs, pork butt (for pulled pork) and chicken need less preparation and minimal attendance during smoking, which would allow us to continually monitor how well or poorly the smoker was functioning.</p>

<p>Debates rage among BBQ cooks and enthusiasts about when and if to slather a wet sauce (or mop) over ribs or chickens before and during smoking. We decided that a wet sauce would disguise how each of the smokers flavored the meats, so we opted for a dry rub.</p>
<p>Similar to a marinade, a dry rub needs to be applied several hours &#8211; if not a full night &#8211; before you smoke the meats. A major component of a dry rub is salt, which penetrates deeper than a marinade does and intensely flavors the interior of the meat the longer you keep it on.</p>
<p>We scoured online forums for the best dry-rub recipes for pork butt, pork ribs and chicken. They all have ingredients in common &#8211; salt, pepper, paprika, sugar and garlic &#8211; but they differ in proportions. Paprika adds almost no discernible flavor and simply colors the meats the beautiful burnished brown desired by meat-smoking enthusiasts.</p>
<p>We used the following dry rub recipes for our testing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/north-carolina-pulled-pork-242247" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pork butt</a></li>
<li><a href="https://barbecuebible.com/recipe/memphis-style-ribs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pork ribs</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/patrick-and-gina-neely/applewood-smoked-chicken-recipe-1945085" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicken</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>U.S.D.A. recommendations</h3>
<p>Since smoking involves cooking meats at low temperatures, the U.S. Department of Agriculture advises certain precautions for avoiding illness from food contamination, which we adhered to during our testing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thaw meat in the refrigerator, never at room temperature.</li>
<li>Once the meat is thawed, apply the dry rub and let it marinate in the refrigerator, never on the counter.</li>
<li>Use two thermometers when smoking meats, one for the smoker itself and the second for monitoring the meat’s internal temperature. All of the smokers we tested had thermostats, but we also used an oven thermometer to compare the accuracy of the smokers’ thermostats. We maintained the smoker temperature at 225-240 °F. (The U.S.D.A advises no lower than 225 °F.)</li>
<li>Cook pork to the internal temperature of 145 °F and chicken to 165 °F.  We frequently checked internal temperatures with an instant-read thermometer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Texture and flavor</h3>
<p>We followed the U.S.D.A. recommendations for internal temperatures, and the chicken was fully cooked in 90 minutes, the pork ribs in two hours and the pork butt in three to three-and-one-half hours. Next, we let the chicken and pork ribs rest 30 minutes and the pork butt 45 minutes before slicing so the juices could be reabsorbed into the meat.</p>
<p>Overall, the chicken was the most successful. Each of the smokers produced a well-seasoned, tender and juicy chicken with a crisp and richly browned skin. We smoked the chicken with applewood, and generally, the smoke flavor was light. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002VGE36S/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smokin&#8217;-It</a>’s chicken was exceedingly juicy, but the skin had a strong smoke flavor, which we didn’t find appealing.</p>
<p>We had mixed results with the pork ribs and pork butt. All the smokers gave us flavorful and nicely smoked pork, but tenderness and juiciness were inconsistent. The Masterbuilt and Smokin&#8217;-It gave us the best pork butt, and Smokin&#8217;-It’s ribs were superior to the rest.</p>
<h3>Cleanup</h3>

<p>During the smoking and cooking process, the meat’s fats and connective tissue melt and splatter inside the smoker’s cabinet and onto the racks, drip pan, wood-chip holder and water bowl. The grease &#8211; deeply colored by the dry rub sugar and seasonings &#8211; and the soot produced by the burning wood stain the smoker. Smoker enthusiasts often refer to this stain as the “patina.&#8221; Even with proper curing, your smoker will never look like new again.</p>
<p>Manufacturers advise simply wiping the smokers down with paper towels, but we did not find this was the most effective way to clean the baked-on grease and soot. Cleaning products are too abrasive and can destroy the smoker’s “patina”, so after some research, we found the best cleaner to be a 50-50 solution of distilled vinegar and water.</p>
<p>Masterbuilt’s reinforced, high-gauge stainless steel prevented staining and the vinegar-water solution was effective in dissolving the greasy splatter. The smoke slightly burnished the cabinet, but in this case, it actually was a patina. Smokin&#8217;-It had minor staining, but it was also very easy to clean.</p>

<p>For convenience, ease of use and consistent results, we recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JGF97D0/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Masterbuilt &#8211; 20071117 </a>as the best electric smoker overall. Right out of the box, we knew we had a winner. The smoker cabinet is well-constructed and sturdy, and the few pieces that needed to be installed &#8211; cabinet feet, digital read-out, shelves, water bowl and drip-pan &#8211; were individually and meticulously packaged. The assembly was a snap, taking all of 15 minutes.</p>
<p>The Masterbuilt comes with four chrome-plated shelves (approximately 14 inches by 16 inches each), which, according to their website, can hold a total of 80 pounds of meat. However, the internal cooking space of the cabinet is 721 square inches and can realistically fit only 40 pounds of meat. We do not recommend crowding more than 40 pounds since it could hinder both cooking and smoking.</p>
<p>As with all the smokers, the Masterbuilt needed to be seasoned by heating the cabinet to 275 °F  for three hours. The digital display is user-friendly, and setting the temperature and timer are simple. We tested the accuracy of all the smokers with an oven thermometer, and the Masterbuilt’s built-in thermostat was on-the-nose accurate.</p>
<p>The smoker has a patented side-loading wood chip feeder, which allows you to add more chips without opening the cabinet’s front door and releasing heat and smoke. The wood chips (only ½ cup) are placed in the loader, which you then insert into a hole near the bottom of the cabinet. With a slight twist of the wrist, the loader dumps the chips into a tray on top of the heating element, and they begin to smoke within 15 minutes.</p>

Also, its reinforced high-gauge stainless-steel cabinet makes it exceptionally easy to wipe clean.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JGF97D0/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The chips stop smoking after about 45 minutes, which was enough time to thoroughly smoke and flavor chicken and pork ribs. (Cooking took another 45 minutes.) The pork butt needed double the time to smoke, so for the butt, we loaded an additional ½ cup of chips half-way through the three-hour smoking time. The loader only holds ½ cup of wood chips, so if you prefer a more smoked meat, you can add chips each time the prior load stops smoking.</p>
<p>All of the meats we smoked were beautifully browned, lightly smoked and delicious. What set the Masterbuilt apart from the others, however, is the exceptional moistness and tenderness of the smoked meats, especially the pork butt, which could be sliced as a juicy roast or easily shredded for pulled pork.</p>
<p>Cleaning the smoker couldn’t be easier. Due to the reinforced high-gauge stainless steel cabinet, smoke and grease didn’t stain it as deeply and permanently as they did with the other smokers.</p>
<p>Finally, the Masterbuilt is very affordable. The current price on Amazon as of this writing puts the Masterbuilt considerably lower than the other smokers we tested and just a few dollars higher than the much inferior Smoke Hollow. For such a superior product, the Masterbuilt’s value simply cannot be beat.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Masterbuilt &#8211; 20071117 is an incredible value for its many features, such as user-friendly digital programming, a perfectly calibrated internal thermostat and evenly distributed heating.</li>
<li>Its patented side-loading chip feeder allows you to add wood chips without opening the cabinet door and releasing heat and smoke.</li>
<li>The Masterbuilt was the only electric smoker we tested that gave us consistently tender and juicy meats with well-balanced smoke flavor.</li>
<li>The cabinet’s 720-square-inch interior allows you to smoke 40 pounds of meat at one time.</li>
<li>Its high-grade stainless steel cabinet prevents permanent staining and is easy to clean and maintain.</li>

<p>Our runner up, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002VGE36S/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smokin’-It &#8211; Model #1</a>, is the smallest model of the Smokin’-It electric smokers, which are known for their high-end construction, thoughtful design and features that no other electric smokers have, such as a compression-fit door latch and heavy-duty casters, sturdy side handles and extra-long 12-foot power cord for easy portability.</p>
<p>As with the Masterbuilt, the Smokin&#8217;-It #1 needed virtually no assembly, and once the casters and interior parts were installed, it was ready to be seasoned with the hickory blocks that were included with the smoker.</p>
<p>The  Smokin’-It #1 is a 13”x17”x12” box, entirely made of heavy-gauge stainless steel. Although its internal capacity (468 square inches) is less than the other smokers we tested, there’s still plenty of space to smoke a couple of chickens or a medium-size turkey.</p>
<p>The wood-chip housing slides over the heating element, which evenly distributes the chips across the depth of the cabinet. The efficient rheostat accurately heats the smoker up to 250 °F, and the heavy-duty latch system securely seals the smoker’s door by a compression fit so there is no dissipation of heat or smoke.</p>
<p>Although there are virtually no instructions for operation included, you can find plenty of information on Smokin&#8217;-It’s website. One suggestion is to line the smoker with foil for easier clean-up. This was unusual advice, since other smokers warned that doing so could cause irregular heating. The foil, however, had no effect on how the Smokin&#8217;-It distributed heat in our testing, and cleaning up afterward was indeed a cinch.</p>

<p>Unlike the other smokers we tested, a water tray isn’t required. According to the Smokin&#8217;-It forum, the cabinet is 90-percent air-tight, which substantially diminishes the meat’s natural moisture from evaporating. We were skeptical, but both the chicken and pork butt were exceedingly juicy and the baby back ribs were the best of all the ribs we smoked in the other smokers.</p>
<p>The Smokin&#8217;-It #1 is certainly a quality product, but it’s $170 more than our top pick, the Masterbuilt &#8211; 20071117.  However, the company’s three-year warranty for parts and workmanship and the smoker’s unique certification by NSF International for commercial kitchen use could be incentives for spending more for this electric smoker.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>

<h3>Bradley Smoker &#8211; BTIS1 Original Smoker</h3>

<p>Since our review, Bradley made a minor change to their BTIS1 model by moving a heat control knob from the door to the generator panel. But other than that the <a href="https://www.bradleysmoker.com/product/bradley-original-electric-food-smoker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bradley Original Smoker &#8211; BS601</a> is exactly the same. The Bradley performed well, but as we noted earlier, it uses compressed-sawdust bisquettes, which can be costly, considering how many the smoker burns through in one smoke session.</p>
<p>The Bradley is different from the other smokers in that the smoke generator and the main cabinet are not integrated and are joined together by two power cords. Initially, the cabinet wasn’t heating properly, so we contacted the company’s excellent customer service who helped resolve the issue by advising us to simply “jam in” the power cords. (We did, and it worked!)</p>
<p>The bisquettes are automatically advanced through a feed hole from the smoke generator into the cabinet one at a time every 20 minutes. As the next bisquette pushes through, the charred remains of the previous bisquette fall into a water bowl. The generator reliably advanced the bisquettes, but during our testing, the charred bisquettes backed up and spilled over the water bowl onto the drip pan.</p>
<p>The generator also controls regulation of heat, and although the thermostat registers 300 °F, even turned up high, the smoker struggled to hit 250 °F.</p>
<p>Ribs smoked in the Bradley were alternately dry and moist, but both the pork butt and chicken were evenly cooked, juicy and lightly smoked. However, whereas the Bradley’s pork butt sliced beautifully as a roast, it wasn’t as shreddable for pulled pork as it had been in the Masterbuilt and Smokin’-It tests.</p>
<p>The Bradley’s internal cabinet is lined with polished chrome, and from the middle of the cabinet upward, it was relatively easy to clean and restore its mirror-like sheen. The bottom half of the cabinet, however, was stained by smoke, which could not be removed.</p>
<h3>Char-Broil &#8211; Deluxe Digital</h3>

<p>We got mixed results from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SMRXYCE/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Char-Broil &#8211; Deluxe Digital</a>. It’s equipped with some great features, such as a digital timer, thermostat, remote control and internal meat probe, The meat probe, in particular, as we noted above, is especially handy, since you can program the smoker to shut off when the meat reaches the desired internal temperature. We double-checked internal temperatures with an instant-read thermometer, and the Char-Broil was always accurate.</p>
<p>The instruction manual advises how much to fill the wood-chip box for smoking time. For example, one-quarter filled for two-to-four hours, which did not prove accurate since the chips were blackened shards that had ceased smoking after 90 minutes.</p>
<p>The Char-Broil produced beautifully colored and nicely smoked chicken, but both the pork butt and ribs were chewy. We resorted to wrapping them in foil and cooking them longer to achieve the results we got from the other smokers we tested.</p>
<p>Clean-up was challenging and messy. The removable pieces can be soaked in hot soapy water, but the cabinet and tempered-glass door are difficult to clean without using harsh cleaners and a lot of elbow grease.</p>
<h3>Smoke Hollow &#8211; 30162E</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000Y1RNFK/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smoke Hollow &#8211; 30162E </a>was trouble from the get-go. First, it needed to be completely assembled, which was difficult due to improperly bored holes and bolts pre-tightened too tightly. The puny door latch couldn’t sufficiently seal the cabinet, so smoke seeped out throughout the smoking process.</p>
<p>During our tests, black greasy liquid dripped from the bottom corners. We inspected the cabinet and discovered its inner aluminum lining had buckled, another factor attesting to the smoker’s shoddy build.</p>
<p>The Smoke Hollow’s temperature regulator is erratic, and since the smoker’s flimsy temperature gauge broke early on, we needed to manually monitor the cabinet throughout the smoking process to ensure a low temperature was maintained.</p>
<p>As to results, the chicken and ribs had good smoked flavor, but were dry. The pork butt could be sliced, but even after four hours, it was still not tender enough to shred for pulled pork.</p>
<p>Clean-up was even more challenging that it had been for the Char-Broil, especially in the corners where the black grease had collected underneath the cabinet’s buckled lining.</p>
<p>After our tests, we thought we might have received a dud or it had been damaged in shipping, but we re-reviewed comments on Amazon and saw many customers experienced the same issues we had with the Smoke Hollow that they had purchased.</p>
<p>Smoke Hollow is slightly less expensive than the other smokers we tested, but it’s cheaply made and not worth the price.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Hardline barbecuers probably aren’t going to change their opinion of electric smokers. But for the rest of us, electric smokers really do give great smoked meats that a professional might be hard-pressed to challenge.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the most reliable, durable and best-value electric smoker is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JGF97D0/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Masterbuilt &#8211; 20071117</a>, which will give you evenly smoked and cooked meats that are mouth-watering, succulent and delicious. Its numerous features &#8211; user-friendly digital programming, accurate thermostat, patented side-loading chip feeder &#8211; put the Masterbuilt ahead of the other smokers we tested.</p>
<p>If you want to spend a bit more money on a high-quality smoker, then we recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002VGE36S/?tag=ybdsmkr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smokin&#8217;-It #1</a>. It’s the only electric smoker that’s been NSF-certified for commercial kitchen use, and the manufacturer’s three-year warranty for parts and workmanship simply can’t be beat.</p>
