								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e tested some highly rated automatic tea makers and iced tea makers and selected the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FQTZ6P3/?tag=ybdtea-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BTM500</a> as the best automatic tea maker for hot tea and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00921MFKG/?tag=ybdtea-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Takeya &#8211; 11171</a> as the best iced tea maker.</p>
<p>We’ve used an <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-electric-kettle/">electric tea kettle</a> for years, but an automatic tea maker eliminates the fussiness from the tea-making process, especially if you brew loose tea leaves. The tea infuser is integrated into the kettle, so you simply push a couple of buttons, and in under 10 minutes, you have a perfectly steeped and piping hot cup of tea.</p>
<p>An iced tea maker funnels the hot tea into a pitcher of ice, and again, in a few minutes, you have a pitcher of iced tea to cool you off on a hot summer day.</p>
<h2>Important features to consider</h2>
<p>If you’re looking to buy an automatic tea maker for hot tea, the best ones have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programmed settings for your favorite type of tea, including brew temperature and time, and steep temperature steep time</li>
<li>A separate timer for alerting you when the water has reached optimal temperature for adding the tea and a second alert when the tea has finished steeping</li>
<li>Stainless steel trim can help match other kitchen appliances</li>
<li>A borosilicate glass pitcher, which can withstand extreme changes in temperature</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e squeezed thirty pounds of oranges, lemons and limes to find the best citrus juicer, and we chose <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0185NWN62/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Urban Trend &#8211; Tango</a> as the best manual citrus juicer. Its ergonomic design and two interchangeable reamer cones make this hand-held juicer ideal for a quick glass of fresh OJ as you’re running out the door. We also like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011KGTVIY/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dash &#8211; JB065AQ </a>as the best electric citrus juicer for its seven pulp modes, ease of cleanup and great price.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected citrus juicers to test</h2>
<p>If you’re dedicated to the juicing life, then you may already own a high-end juice extractor or blender like Vitamix, which we reviewed in our article about the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-blender/">best blenders</a>. You could easily spend hundreds of dollars on a high-end model, but for this review, we focused on the small citrus juicers — manual and electric — in the $10-$25 price range.</p>
<p>After reading consumer reviews, we narrowed our search down from dozens of almost identical juicers to juicers with a unique feature, such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0185NWN62/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Urban Trend’s interchangeable reamer cones</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073PVYM62/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bnunwish’s twist-and-squeeze lid</a> or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C22MYGM/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sunhanny</a> that can also separate an egg. Sometimes, simple is best, so we also chose to test the type of metallic handheld juicer, like the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O525UL8/?tag=ybdjuice-20">IMUSA</a>, that you see used in every bar and restaurant,</p>
<p>There are several inexpensive electric juicers available, and we wanted to see if they were actually more convenient and user-friendly than the manual juicers. The primary advantage to using an electric citrus juicer is that you’re able to adjust how much (or little) pulp will be processed into the juice. The three electric juicers we tested had different modes for pulp adjustment, but only our top pick, Urban Trend, was effective.</p>

<p>We tested the manual citrus juicers by squeezing Navel oranges, limes and lemons and measured how much juice was extracted. On average, the Navel oranges produced ¼ cup of juice, limes produced two tablespoons and lemons produced three tablespoons.</p>
<p>Factors we considered were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was squeezing juice effortless, or did the juicer need a lot of hand strength?</li>
<li>Did fruit pips and pulp get lodged in the juicer’s filter?</li>
<li>Was the juicer easy and quick to clean?</li>
</ul>
<p>For the electric juicers, we doubled the amount of fruits squeezed with the manual juicers, since their receptacles were designed to hold 25–32 ounces of juice. The electric juicers produced the same amount of juice per fruit, but two of the juicers’ filters were clogged by pulp and pips after juicing a single orange.</p>
<p>We also considered whether the pulp-adjustment feature worked, how easy the juicers were to clean and if it was indeed more convenient to use an electric juicer over a manual juicer.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011KGTVIY/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dash &#8211; JB065AQ</a> beat the other two electric citrus juicers because it had, by far, the easiest pulp adjustment: a small lever on the container’s handle with seven choices for filtering pulp that can be adjusted any time while juicing.</p>
<p>The Dash has two reamer cones that nest and lock into place on top of the 25-ounce container. Halved fruit is placed on top of the reamer, and by pressing down, the juicer automatically starts; releasing pressure, it automatically stops. The Dash isn’t the quietest of the juicers we tested, but it won’t wake up sleeping housemates on Saturday morning either.</p>
<p>Like most electric juicers of this type, you can whiz through a bag of oranges in a couple of minutes. However, what we liked most about the Dash was that the pulp didn’t clog up the filter. Although the Black+Decker and the Cuisinart have larger capacity, it didn’t really matter, because we were continually stopping to unclog the filter, so it took longer to juice oranges. (This wasn’t an issue with lemons and limes, which have little pulp.)</p>

<p>The smaller reamer cone was better shaped for lemons than for limes, but by simply moving the halved lime around the reamer — rather than holding it in place — all of its juice was extracted.</p>
<p>It comes with a lid so you can store squeezed juice in the refrigerator. Although the manufacturer claims the Dash can be machine washed, it’s made of plastic, and high-heat drying in a dishwasher will most likely damage it.</p>
<p>This isn’t a heavy-duty or sophisticated juicer, but its compact size and affordable price make it a good choice for a small kitchen, dorm room or camper.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to operate and easy to clean, the Dash &#8211; JB065AQ also effectively squeezes juice down to the skin in seconds.</li>
<li>It has an excellent pulp-adjustment control that can be changed any time during juicing.</li>
<li>The Dash’s reamer cones nest and snap into the juice receptacle for compact storage.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0185NWN62/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Urban Trend &#8211; Tango</a>’s ergonomic design gave this finalist the edge over the other two manual citrus juicers we tested. It has two interchangeable reamers: one for oranges and grapefruit and another for lemons and limes. Each fits snugly into a ladle-shaped container that can hold 8 ounces (1 cup) of juice. The container has a non-slip base that stabilizes the juicer on a countertop or table.</p>
<p>Each head has a handle that snaps into the container’s handle, and the two halves form a handle that fits into the palm of your hand. As with all manual juicers, the halved fruit is twisted on top of the reamer, and pulp and seeds are trapped in the reamer’s filter while juice is strained into the container.</p>
<p>The Tango’s orange/grapefruit reamer was particularly effective in getting down to the orange’s skin and juicing every bit of fruit. The lemon/lime reamer was great with lemons, since its pointed shape fit perfectly into the halved fruit. Halved limes are more rounded, so we had to move the fruit around the reamer, but this took only seconds, and the reamer extracted two tablespoons of juice, which is the usual amount of juice that can be squeezed from a lime.</p>

<p>The Tango’s filters are narrow enough on both reamers that seeds don’t get stuck in between, and with a quick rinse, the juicer is clean. The orange reamer nests on top of the lime reamer, so the entire juicer can fit into any drawer.</p>
<p>The Tango is perfect for juice on the go. If you want a glass of fresh OJ before rushing off to work, this juicer will get it done with little effort in under a minute.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Urban Trend &#8211; Tango has two interchangeable reamers that squeeze out every drop of juice from fruit.</li>
<li>Its container has a non-skid base so the juicer won’t move on a countertop or table when you’re squeezing the fruit.</li>
<li>The reamers nest into the container, so the Tango can be stored in any kitchen drawer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bnunwish &#8211; AABK03</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073PVYM62/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bnunwish &#8211; AABK03</a> manual juicer is a tall 16-ounce cup with a reamer-cone insert that has a webbed filter for catching pulp. The halved fruit is placed on top of the reamer, and the juicer’s lid goes on top of the fruit. You rotate the lid, pressing down, and when it connects with the cup, the fruit has been completely squeezed of juice. The Bnunwish actually extracted quite a lot of juice from all of the citrus fruits, but it was a pain to clean. Pulp got trapped in the webbing, and although a tool is included, it took too much time to pick out the pulp. For a single serving of juice, it wasn’t worth the effort.</p>
<h3>Sunhanny</h3>
<p>We confess that we wanted to test the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C22MYGM/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sunhanny</a> because of its Amazon video that shows it can not only juice citrus fruits but also separate an egg. The Sunhanny has several pieces, and since no instructions were provided, we watched the video again to learn how to use it.</p>
<p>The Sunhanny’s odd petal-shaped piece for juicing oranges fits on top of the reamer, which then locks into the juicer’s 2-cup container. The Sunhanny worked very much like the Urban Trend &#8211; Tango, but lemon pips lodged into its reamer, which has slits like its pulp filter.</p>
<p>To separate an egg, the reamer is inverted, and when you crack an egg into it, the egg white is supposed to drip into the container. Sadly, it didn’t work, and half of the egg white clung stubbornly to the yolk.</p>
<h3>Black+Decker &#8211; CJ650</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M9J34LL/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; CJ650</a> has only one reamer cone, which easily extracted juice from oranges. But the cone was too wide for lemons and limes, and they slipped off if we didn&#8217;t hold them firmly in place.</p>
<p>The pulp-adjustment switch is inside the filter, and once a setting is selected, it can’t be changed until juicing is complete. We tried each of the Black+Decker’s three pulp-adjustment settings; every time, after juicing only one orange, the filter got clogged with pulp and juice.</p>
<h3>Cuisinart &#8211; CCJ-500</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VS32HA/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; CCJ500</a> has three settings that can be adjusted by turning the reamer cone but only when the juicer is unplugged. The reamer cone itself has an unnecessary filter, so pulp got stuck in both the cone and filter, and juice just pooled in the pulp.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart has an additional feature we did like. Once the fruit is completely juiced, you can press down on the juicer’s lid, and it will spin a little more juice out of the collected pulp. However, like the Black+Decker, the filter gets clogged after juicing a single orange, which makes the juicer a hassle to clean. We don’t feel the Cuisinart’s inconvenience justifies its high price.</p>
<h3>IMUSA USA &#8211; Victoria 70009</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O525UL8/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">IMUSA USA &#8211; Victoria 70009</a> is one of the most common and basic manual juicers. The IMUSA comes in three sizes for oranges, lemons and limes and is made of two aluminum cups with handles that are painted orange, yellow or green. We tested the size for oranges.</p>
<p>Half of a cut fruit is placed into one cup, which has slits for straining seeds, and the other cup is pressed down by gripping the handle.  Pulp isn’t extracted but is compressed instead, and it does require some hand strength to squeeze out juice.</p>
<p>This type of juicer is great for squeezing juice for a couple cocktails or adding some acidity to a sauce or saute. But if you need to squeeze more than two or three fruits at a time, it’s time-consuming and tiring.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The small and inexpensive citrus juicers that we tested squeezed lemons and limes equally well. Squeezing a glass of orange juice, however, was more of a challenge, especially — and surprisingly — for the electric juicers.</p>
<p>Our pick for best electric citrus juicer is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011KGTVIY/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dash &#8211; JB065AQ</a>. The Dash juicer has seven settings for adjusting how much pulp is filtered into the juice that can be changed any time while you’re juicing. It’s easy to use, doesn’t clog with excess pulp, and clean-up is a snap. At less than $15, it’s also a great value.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0185NWN62/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Urban Trend &#8211; Tango</a> is our top pick for manual citrus juicer. It’s a simple, plastic, handheld juicer with two interchangeable and stackable reamer cones that squeeze out every last drop of juice. It has a smart, ergonomic design that fits comfortably in your hand, and its non-skid base prevents slippage when you&#8217;re squeezing juice on a countertop or table.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected containers to test</h2>
<p>Whether you’re looking to reorganize your kitchen cabinets or pantry or want to prevent pests from burrowing into flour, sugar and other baking ingredients, dry food storage containers that are functional and airtight are essential.</p>
<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, Tupperware was the most recognized brand for food storage containers, and even today, it’s still used as a generic term for all plastic containers. Although Tupperware expanded globally, the company’s sales are primarily made by private parties, while its competitor, the less-expensive Rubbermaid, can be purchased virtually anywhere.</p>
<p>We previously <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-food-storage-container/">reviewed food storage containers</a> that are made for refrigerating, freezing and reheating food, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a>, was our top pick for plastic containers.</p>
<p>For this review of containers for storing dry goods, we added Brilliance&#8217;s line of containers and another well-reviewed Rubbermaid product to our list to see how they held up to other highly rated containers. Amazon reviewers give a lot of love to certain containers, so we selected those that had at least a 4.3-star rating.</p>
<p>Since not everyone wants to use plastic, we decided to test acrylic and glass containers as well to determine whether they were better than plastic for storage of dry goods. The majority of dry food storage containers are sold as sets of three or more different sizes, and even though many may be bought separately, it’s more cost-effective to purchase them as a set.</p>

<p>Every container we tested was heralded as airtight, which is especially important for storing flour, sugar and rice, since they are prone to infestation by Indian-meal moths, more commonly known as pantry moths.</p>
<p>To test whether a container was airtight, we sealed a piece of toilet tissue inside each container, locked its lid and then plunged it into two gallons of water. We held the container under water and revolved it several times. When we removed the container from the water and unsealed the lid, if the tissue paper was wet, the container wasn’t airtight. Only three of the seven storage containers we tested were 100 percent airtight.</p>
<p>Overall, dry food storage containers are either tall rectangles or cylinders. Some were slender modulars, no taller than 10 inches, designed to fit in most kitchen cabinets. Although they would look attractive on a countertop, these containers were too narrow to hold a five-pound bag of flour or to allow scooping flour out with a one-cup measuring cup.</p>
<p>Some people might only want containers for beans, rice and pasta, but we leaned heavily toward those that stored baking ingredients in a shape that allows easy access.</p>

<p>Not only were the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LWS0LK9/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Progressive &#8211; Prepworks ProKeeper</a> containers airtight, they’re truly unique from the others we tested — or any other containers we’ve seen. Although the ProKeepers could be used for storing any food item, each container in the six-container set is designed for storing a specific dry-goods product.</p>
<p>For example, the 15-cup flour container can hold an entire five-pound bag of flour, and it has a built-in leveler for leveling flour from a measuring cup, which easily fits into the container. The brown-sugar ProKeeper includes a terra-cotta disc that, when moistened, prevents brown sugar from hardening. The powdered-sugar ProKeeper has a sifting spoon, and the two mini containers each have a shaker for herbs, spices or cupcake sprinkles.</p>
<p>Progressive sells other containers for coffee, cereal, grains and pasta separately, and each has an individual feature, such as a coffee scoop or a wide-mouth pour spout for the cereal container. The herb ProKeeper is ingenious: washed herbs drain into a basket, and excess water drips into the lower part of the container, which can then be emptied through a built-in drain hole.</p>

<p>Each container is made from <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-food-storage-container/#health">BPA-free</a> crystal-clear plastic, and lids are latched shut and sealed with a silicone gasket that can be removed for cleaning.</p>
<p>The containers were perfectly airtight, <i>except</i> for the white sugar container, which we found frustrating, because of a small design flaw. The white sugar ProKeeper has a pour spout, and although all other ProKeepers have a ¼-inch-thick silicone gasket for sealing their lids, the sugar container’s is thinner and doesn’t secure the spout cover tightly enough.</p>
<p>The white sugar container is large enough to store four pounds of sugar, so it’s a shame the clever pour spout didn’t work better in keeping contents airtight. However, the sugar container could certainly be used for storing beans or pasta or other dry foods that aren’t plagued by pantry pests and another of the airtight ProKeepers used for storing white sugar instead.</p>
<p>The six-piece set is slightly more expensive than other sets, but the superb design features and bonuses, like the terra cotta disc, are worth the added cost.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Progressive &#8211; Prepworks ProKeeper six-piece set is the most unique and well-designed container system that we tested.</li>
<li>Each one has features for a specific ingredient, such as flour, brown sugar or cake toppings.</li>
<li>In testing, the ProKeepers were completely airtight, except for the sugar container, which has a pour spout that didn’t seal.</li>
<li>Other containers for coffee, grains, herbs and pasta are also available individually.</li>

<p>The thoughtful design of the Progressive &#8211; Prepworks containers gave them a slight edge over our runner-up, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076N6DLFJ/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> four-container set. In our review of food storage containers, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> won best plastic food storage container for refrigerating, freezing and reheating food, because of its durability, ease of opening/closing and its 100% airtight seal, thanks to a thick, built-in silicone gasket.</p>
<p>Other than size and shape, there’s no difference between the Brilliance all-purpose containers and the Brilliance dry food storage containers that we tested for this review. The dry food set is, however, better suited for pantry storage, taking advantage of vertical space with taller containers.</p>
<p>The eight-piece set — each lid counts as a piece — includes a 9.25-inch-tall, 16-cup container that holds a five-pound bag of flour, a 12-cup container for sugar, a 9.25-inch-tall and narrow 6.6-cup container for pasta (which is a half-inch too short for uncooked spaghetti) and a squat, rectangular 3.2-cup container.</p>

<p>The small 3.2-cup container brought the Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance set down a notch in our rating, since it’s just a regular food-storage container and is too small for standard pantry items. However, additional sizes, including a container tall enough for spaghetti, are available to purchase either in sets or individually.</p>
<p>The eight-piece set is modestly priced, but it’s likely you’ll need to add to it for storing more than three dry food products in your kitchen or pantry. Still, the Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance containers are one of three containers we tested that you can completely rely on to keep pantry goods fresh and pest-free.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance containers are made of durable and crystal-clear Tritan plastic, easy to open and close and are 100 percent airtight.</li>
<li>The three larger containers are great for storing dry pantry goods, such as flour, sugar and rice.</li>
<li>The smaller container in the set is too small for pantry items, but it’s still excellent for refrigerated food storage.</li>
<li>The Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance set is well-priced, but you’ll probably need to buy other pieces individually to store more pantry goods.</li>

<h3>Bellemain &#8211; Acrylic Canister Set</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZXY51MA/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bellemain &#8211; Acrylic Canister Set</a> is the only other set we tested that was airtight. Honestly, we were surprised, because they’re very lightweight and their chrome latches are thin and wobbly. The containers look like glass Mason jars and would be an attractive addition to a kitchen counter. They’re supposedly unbreakable, but the lids and latches might not survive being accidentally knocked to the floor.</p>
<p>Because they’re airtight, the Bellemain will keep flour and sugar fresh, but they’re only large enough for scooping out a half-cup. If you wish to store dried food items, such as beans, lentils and short pasta, these glass containers would be a decent alternative to plastic containers.</p>
<h3>OXO Good Grips &#8211; POP Containers</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D78X2V6/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; POP Container</a> set includes two tall, narrow canisters, two small narrow canisters and a squat square. None are large enough to hold flour and sugar or wide enough for scooping with a measuring cup.</p>
<p>The POP lids are a great idea. They secure by pushing down on a large button in the center of the lid, which lowers the silicone seal into the lip of the container; pushing the button again releases the seal. Unfortunately, the seal isn’t airtight, and during our test, water seeped into the canister. If water can find its way in, so can bugs. The POP container set was the most expensive set we tested, and even though they look nice, they just don’t work.</p>
<h3>Brabantia &#8211; Glass Storage Containers</h3>
<p>There aren’t many glass containers available, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JFWP6EO/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brabantia</a> is highly rated on Amazon. They’re not made of heavy-duty glass, like a Mason jar, but have a similar weight to an all-purpose wine glass. They have pretty colored lids in neutral Martha-Stewart-ish tones that are interchangeable. They’re too small for holding more than a pound of flour or sugar, and because they’re not airtight, we could see them being used for storing cotton puffs or Q-tips.</p>
<h3>Chef’s Path &#8211; Food Storage Container Set</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L6MH96Z/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chef’s Path</a> seven-piece set includes containers of four different heights, one of which is designed specifically for spaghetti. However, because they’re all only four-inches wide, they’re useless for storing flour or sugar, unless you want to scoop it out with a tablespoon. Since this is a modular design, the lids fit all the containers. The Chef’s Path lids secure with a vertical latch that can be closed on either side of the lid. A very thin silicone band isn’t enough to seal the container, and during our tests, water flooded in. The Chef’s Path containers have a sleek, modern design, but they aren’t airtight.</p>
<h3>Rubbermaid &#8211; Modular Containers</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003BKGJ1A/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; 1776464 Modular Containers</a> are basic containers for a kitchen cabinet or pantry; they won’t be sitting pretty on your counter. The rectangular Modulars are wide and deep enough for scooping out flour and sugar, and the bright-red lids are interchangeable. Frequent criticism of the Rubbermaid Modulars is that the lids are ill-fitting and difficult to snap on. It does take a bit of effort, and we assumed the seal was secure. However, like most of the containers we tested, the Rubbermaid Modulars failed to be airtight.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Dry food storage containers need to be functional and airtight, but only two of the seven products we tested were both.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LWS0LK9/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Progressive &#8211; Prepworks ProKeepers</a> were each specifically designed for storing a particular ingredient. The flour container is wide enough for scooping and has a built-in leveler; the container for brown sugar includes a terra cotta disc that prevents brown sugar from drying out.</p>
<p>Only the white-sugar container had a design flaw that made it not completely airtight; all other containers in the six-canister set were 100% airtight. We also like that Progressive has matching containers for coffee, cereal, grains and herbs in its product line.</p>
<p>A close runner-up is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076N6DLFJ/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> four-container set. These durable and attractive Tritan plastic containers are perfectly airtight and wide enough for scooping and measuring. The set includes a small container that’s better suited for refrigerated food storage, but like Progressive, Rubbermaid also sells other Brilliance containers that are intended for particular food products.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e submerged, froze, microwaved, baked and machine-washed ten of the most popular food storage containers to find which one could keep food fresh longest. The best glass food storage container is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075GRTNN6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; Smart Seal</a>. Its unique lid with a soft silicone gasket ensures a leakproof and airtight seal. A lightweight and less expensive option is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a>. Made out of sturdy BPA-free Tritan plastic, this attractive set is also 100-percent leakproof and looks like new even after repeated use.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>There are literally hundreds of food storage containers that you could buy online and at practically any store. There’s a very good chance that you’ve got cabinets, drawers and pantries stuffed with them and that they’re stained, warped and damaged from microwaving leftovers. You probably want to throw them out, but what do you buy as replacements?</p>
<p>To narrow our selection, we started by reading customer reviews on Amazon. The reviews pointed us in the direction of food storage containers that stand up to years of heating and reheating, radical changes in temperature and dishwashing.</p>
<p>We also checked out reviews from reputable cooking websites and recommendations from health and diet websites. Parents of schoolchildren had lots of opinions about which containers are best for school lunches, as did people who do weekly meal prep dietary or workout regimen.</p>
<p>Finally we divided our finalists into those that were plastic and those that were glass — five of each — since the number of consumers who prefer one to the other is about equal.</p>
<p>Although glass containers last longer than plastic containers, glass containers are also prone to chip, particularly around the edges where the top snaps on. There are also complaints that glass containers can explode in the oven. We had some highly rated glass containers on our list, but we eliminated those that tended to chip and shatter.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs food storage containers?</h2>
<p>There’s a wide variety of uses for food storage containers. Whether you cook for yourself or a family brood, you may have leftovers you wish to enjoy the next day. Other people cook in bulk and freeze food for a month or longer. In both cases, you need a storage container that is airtight and leak proof so it will keep food fresh and, if frozen, frost-free.</p>
<p>It’s also important for some people that the container can be removed from the refrigerator or freezer and go directly into the oven. In this case, the container must be borosilicate glass that can withstand high heat without shattering.</p>
<p>Pot-luck dinners are popular in many communities, so a large, sturdy container with a secure lid is ideal for transportation. Parents of school children pack their lunches in food storage containers to be carried in backpacks. In this case, it’s important that the container be leak-proof, since its contents can easily shift sideways or upside down.</p>
<p>Meal prep containers are food storage containers in specific amounts for people who are dieting or on a workout regimen. Oftentimes, meal prep containers are divided in half to apportion two types of food in a single container.</p>
<p>Food storage containers aren’t just for food; people who do their own home repair use them for storing various sizes of screws, bolts, nails and other hardware.</p>
<h2 id="health">Health concerns about using plastic</h2>
<p>You’re probably aware of two chemicals associated with plastic containers: BPA and phthalates. BPA (Bisphenol A) is a chemical used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastic, which is the type of plastic used in most food containers.</p>
<p>When heated in a microwave, BPA leeches into the food or liquid, and although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration stated the low levels of BPA are safe, research suggests there are possible health effects on the brain and behavior of infants and children.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/sya-bpa/index.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The National Institute of Environmental Sciences recommends</a> avoiding products that are not labeled BPA-free and not microwaving products made of polycarbonate plastic.</p>
<p>Phthalates are chemicals used to make plastic pliable. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/Phthalates_FactSheet.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state</a> that although phthalates have affected the reproductive system of lab animals, research continues as to how phthalates affect humans.</p>
<p>If you prefer to use plastic food containers, buy those that are labeled “BPA-free” and “Phthalate-free.” However, additional research is being conducted about whether such products are actually harmful as well.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Plastic vs. glass: </b>Both have pros and cons. Plastic containers come in a variety of shapes and sizes, large and small, and they’re lightweight, so you can carry them in a backpack or shoulder bag. If they’re leakproof and airtight, food and liquids won’t spill out if the container is dropped or accidentally turned upside down or sideways.</p>
<p>Plastic containers are also significantly cheaper than glass containers. For $20, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PSKSG1M/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids</a> comes with 24 various sizes of containers and lids.</p>
<p>The downside to plastic containers is that they simply don’t last. Mostly everyone microwaves food in a plastic container and then tosses it into the dishwasher. After our testing, all of the plastic containers were stained to some extent, and most were pitted and scratched.</p>
<p>Glass food storage containers are heavier and more expensive. However, they’re also far more durable than plastic and much easier to clean. If you’re concerned about BPAs and phthalates, you can rest assured that a glass container is healthier. All of the glass containers we tested had plastic lids, so these should not be microwaved or run through the dishwasher.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’re ecologically mindful, glass is one of the best options.</p>
<p><b>Silicone gasket:</b> Many of the food storage containers we tested had a silicone gasket inserted into the inner lip of the lid where it connects to the top of the container. When the lid is locked into place, the silicone gasket forms a tight seal.</p>
<p>Our two winners — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075GRTNN6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO &#8211; Smart Seal</a> — had gaskets that were twice as thick as the other finalists, so their lids floated on top of the containers. When the latches are locked, a vacuum seal is created, thus ensuring both were leakproof and airtight.</p>
<p>Food particles can get trapped between the gasket and the lid’s lip, and silicone tends to retain food odors and must be periodically soaked in a vinegar-water solution. You’ll want a silicone gasket that can be removed for cleaning and easily reinserted.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075GRTNN6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO &#8211; Smart Seal</a> was, by far, the easiest silicone gasket to remove. The lid has side tabs that allow you to pull out the gasket and then snap it back on. (In fact, its design reminded us of the Instant Pot, which we loved in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-pressure-cooker/">review of the best pressure cookers</a>.)</p>
<p><b>Stacking/Nesting: </b>Whether you have a big or small kitchen, ample cabinet or drawer space is a premium. Glass food storage containers aren’t great for stacking or nesting, because sometimes a smaller container gets stuck in a larger one. Many plastic containers are designed for nesting, but you run into trouble with all of the bothersome lids.</p>
<p>Of the containers we tested, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PSKSG1M/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids</a> were the easiest to nest, and their interlocking lids prevent your rummaging around the bottom of drawer trying to find the right size.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Leaks</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/testing-leakproof.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We filled each container two-thirds full with water and secured the lid. Then we vigorously shook each container for one minute over paper towels and noted any leaks. Almost all of the manufacturers advertised their container as leakproof, and for the most part, they were. The Pyrex and Sistema don’t claim to be leakproof, and they weren’t; water leaked from their corners. But Prep Naturals was supposed to be leakproof, and water also poured out.</p>
<h3>Airtight seals</h3>
<p>Airtight containers hold in moisture and keep out odors from other foods in the refrigerator.  For this test we made sure that each container was completely dry. Then we placed one sheet of toilet tissue into the bottom of the container and sealed it. Next, we filled a three-gallon bucket with water colored with food dye and plunged each container one at a time into the bucket, holding it under for one minute. After that, we flipped the container upside down and submerged it for another minute. We then withdrew the container from the bucket, unsealed the lid and noted whether the toilet tissue was wet or dry.</p>
<p>All of the manufacturers claimed their containers were airtight. Not surprisingly, the same three that were not leakproof — Pyrex, Sistema and Prep Naturals — were also not airtight.</p>
<h3>Lid sealing</h3>
<p>The majority of food storage containers that we tested were sealed by aligning a silicone gasket inside the lid with the edge of the container, then locking it with hinged latches on all four sides. Four exceptions were the Pyrex and the Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids, which simply had snap-on lids, and the Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance and Sistema, both of which had two latches on the longer sides of the container.</p>
<p>We tested the lids and latches by opening them and closing them repeatedly and noted whether or not they were easy to snap on and release.</p>
<h3>Staining</h3>
<p>Plastic food containers are notorious for being stained by tomato-based foods, such as spaghetti sauce, and curries with turmeric. We began this test by filling each container three-quarters full with marinara and then froze them overnight in the freezer. The next day, we defrosted the containers with lids askew in the microwave until the marinara was boiling. When the sauce had been completely defrosted, we allowed each container to fully cool before dumping the marinara out.</p>
<p>As expected, all of the plastic containers and their lids were stained. The Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance, however, was only slightly stained. All of the plastic lids for the glass containers — except for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075GRTNN6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO &#8211; Smart Seal</a> — were also stained.</p>

<p>After we microwaved the frozen marinara in the plastic containers, we checked each one over for signs of warping. None were affected by the long microwaving. Two glass containers, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N90AWNF/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1790</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LN7X92K/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glasslock</a>, warned to not microwave their plastic lids. Since their lids were exactly the same as the other glass containers, we ignored the dire warning. Other than staining, neither were affected by the microwave.</p>

<p>If you read consumer reviews online, you’ll see some terrifying photos of glass food storage containers that have exploded in the oven. Borosilicate glass is resistant to sudden high changes of temperature, because it doesn’t expand like regular glass.</p>
<p>Still, all manufacturers advise putting borosilicate glass containers — especially from the refrigerator or freezer — into a preheated oven. This seems to defy logic, but when a glass container is put into a cold oven and then the heat is turned on, the heating element initially radiates heat unevenly, which doesn&#8217;t allow the glass to expand properly and will cause it to crack or shatter.</p>
<p>For our test, we removed the plastic lids from each glass container filled with frozen marinara and put the containers into a preheated 350℉ oven. All of the glass containers reheated the marinara in the same amount of time, and none shattered.</p>

<p>The dishwasher undoubtedly does the most damage to plastic food containers and lids. We followed manufacturer instructions and loaded the glass containers into the lower part of the dishwasher and the plastic containers and all the lids into the upper rack. We then set the dishwasher on a heavy-duty wash cycle.</p>
<p>All of the glass containers cleaned beautifully. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> was the only plastic food container and lid that showed no signs of damage. The other plastic containers were deeply stained and pitted, the worst being the Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids.</p>
<h3>Odor retention</h3>
<p>Plastic food containers and silicone tend to retain food odors, so after dishwashing, we did a sniff test. Only the Vremi, the silicone container, smelled strongly of marinara sauce. The silicone gasket in the Glasslock lid didn’t retain food odor but instead had an acrid chemical odor.</p>
<h3>Retesting latches and leakproof capability</h3>
<p>Amazon reviewers frequently complain that after dishwashing and microwaving, the latches are too difficult to close, and we found this to be true only with the Glasslock and OXO. However, we opened and closed the OXO’s latches several times, and they worked normally again. Although the Vremi’s silicone container held up in the dishwasher, one of its plastic lid’s latches had cracked after a single wash.</p>
<p>Finally, we repeated our leakproof test to see if freezing, microwaving and dishwashing had any structural effect on the containers. The same three that failed the first time — Pyrex, Sistema and Prep Naturals — leaked again. But this time the 1790 also leaked.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> 14-piece set is made of Tritan, a BPA-free plastic that resembles glass, but it’s shatter resistant and more durable than other plastics. The seven lids for the seven containers are also made of Tritan, which allow you to see their contents from all sides in the refrigerator. The set includes a large 9.6-cup container, two medium 3.2-cup containers and four small 1.3-cup containers.</p>
<p>Each container in this attractive set is rectangular with flat lids that are slightly recessed, so you can stack them in the refrigerator without fearing they’ll topple.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, a thick silicone gasket inside the inner lip of the lid floats on top of the container. When you press down on the lid, air is expelled out of the container through the lid’s vent holes with a whoosh. The two small latches on the long sides snap shut and create an airtight seal, which proved to be 100-percent leakproof.</p>

<p>The containers also have one-quarter-inch extensions at opposite ends, which stay cool when you lift the hot container out of the microwave.</p>
<p>Online instructions advise that turmeric will stain the Tritan plastic but tomato-based sauces will not. Our marinara sauce did stain the container and lid very slightly, but it was much less than on other containers we tested.</p>
<p>The Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance made it through the heavy-duty dishwashing cycle and showed no signs of pitting or scratching. Except for the rosy tint left by the spaghetti sauce in the container’s beveled edges, the container and lid looked brand new.</p>
<p>The only thing we didn’t like about the Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance is that the silicone gaskets cannot be removed from the lids. The gasket bends so you can scrub underneath its ridges, but to completely avoid odor retention, the entire lid would need to be submerged in cleaning solution.</p>
<p>Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance is reasonably priced for such a high-quality product. It’s available in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNEJSO/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">6-piece</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNEIC6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">10-piece</a> sets, and you can also buy various sizes individually if you need more of one size than another. The 1.3-cup size, which is perfect for packing school lunches or snacks, are available in a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077M4T91S/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">very affordable two-pack</a>.</p>
<p>Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance proved resistant to microwaving and dishwashing, and we believe it will outlast all of the other plastic food containers we tested.</p>

<p>Glass containers are much easier to clean than plastic, and you don’t have to worry about BPAs and phthalates. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075GRTNN6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; Smart Seal</a> was our favorite of the glass containers. It’s made of borosilicate glass, so it can withstand changes in temperature and go from the freezer to the microwave or a preheated oven.</p>
<p>What made OXO stand out from the other finalists is the thick silicone gasket that’s set into a channel in the lid. The gasket is made of soft silicone and floats on top of the container, so when you press down, not only does it make an airtight seal, the latches are easy to lock into place. The silicone gasket slips right off for cleaning and slides back into the lid’s channel with no effort.</p>

<p>The OXO performed perfectly in all our tests. It was leakproof, airtight, and the marinara sauce heated evenly in the microwave and oven. Although the glass container emerged sparkling clean from the dishwasher, the plastic lid was moderately stained. A big plus, however, is that the silicone gasket could be removed for washing.</p>
<p>OXO’s glass containers are a little more expensive than the others we tested, but the OXO’s sturdy lid and latches made the strongest seal and were the easiest to clean.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C6LRW61/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fullstar &#8211; 12-Pack</a> has five different sizes in rectangular, square and round shapes. They’re made of regular polypropylene plastic like the other containers we tested, so after microwaving and dishwashing they got stained and pitted. Its silicone gasket is embedded in the lid’s channel, and it needed to be precisely lined up or the latches wouldn’t close properly.</p>
<p>The Fullstar was leakproof and airtight and remained so after our testing. The container survived the microwave and dishwasher, but its lid warped and became convex.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PSKSG1M/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; 2063704 Easy Find Vented Lids</a> was one of our early favorites. Like traditional Rubbermaid or Tupperware, the lid snaps on top of the container and is then removed with a corner tab. We found the lids very easy to open and close. A square vent, which snaps up and down, is intended for releasing steam in the microwave. The Rubbermaid was the only plastic container that had a lid designed for the microwave.</p>
<p>The Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids design was leakproof, even with the vent. Surprisingly, it was even airtight. But the marinara sauce proved its downfall. After microwaving and dishwashing, the container was deeply stained and massively pitted. Although the lid still closed easily, and the container was still leakproof, it was clear that the Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids wouldn’t last.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NSJ88V8/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sistema &#8211; Klip-It</a> are rectangular, divided containers for storing two different food items. The small size, which comes in a pack of three, are quite tiny, and can only really fit baby carrots and small grapes inside. The 4-cup container is a good size for school or work lunch, and the 8-cup container is for storing leftovers. Two problems plague the Sistema containers: They’re not leakproof or airtight, so if you’re toting something with liquid, expect to find it pooled in the bottom of your bag. Also, the dividers aren’t high enough to reach the lid, so liquid or sauce on one side easily leaks into the opposite side.</p>
<p>We really wanted to love the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071JVT2HC/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vremi &#8211; VRM020376N silicone</a> containers. Their four rectangular sizes are in bright primary colors, and because the containers are made of silicone, they collapse to one-third of their fully expanded height. We researched several silicone containers, and most buckle when you secure the lid, resulting in an explosion of anything liquid inside. The Vremi containers, however, have a rigid lip, so after some practice, we were able to snap on the lid without the sides buckling in.</p>
<p>Sadly, the Vremi was neither leakproof nor airtight, and after its round through the dishwasher, one of the lid’s latches had cracked, and the container reeked of marinara. Great idea but poorly executed.</p>

<p>None of the glass containers showed any signs of damage from the freezer, microwave or dishwasher. The plastic lids, however, differentiated one from the other.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LN7X92K/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glasslock &#8211; 11339</a> was leakproof and airtight, but its hinges were stiff to close. The smaller ends snapped on and off without too much struggle, but there was more resistance from the hinges on the long side of the container. We had to press down very hard to get the hinges to secure. Although the glass container itself is fine, someone with weak hand strength would be frustrated by these lids.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N90AWNF/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1790 &#8211; Glass Meal Prep Containers</a> did well in our tests. The latches were easy to lock and unlock, and when sealed, they were leakproof and airtight. 1790’s label warnings about the glass containers are a bit scary; it’s a long list of don’ts, some in capital letters. The containers are made of durable borosilicate glass, yet the manufacturer states that hot glass could shatter if the container is placed on a countertop, metal surface or sink.</p>
<p>We were justifiably nervous about what to do with the hot 1790 when we removed it from the oven. We opted for the marble counter, and thankfully, no explosion occurred.</p>
<p>After dishwashing, the 1790’s lid was stained and slightly pitted. The latches still closed easily, but now the seal was no longer leakproof.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075BLP5XV/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prep Naturals</a> is a popular brand with people who use the containers for meal prep. The containers are divided in two, so you can store two different portions of food in them. Since the dividing glass wall doesn’t reach the lid, anything that’s liquid on one side will leach into the other side. When sealed, the Prep Naturals were neither leakproof nor airtight; so much water had been absorbed by the tissue, we had to squeeze it out. After dishwashing, the lid was stained and pitted, and the latches were difficult to snap shut. As for cleaning, food particles were trapped between the gasket and the lid and could not be removed.</p>
<p>We tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0157G34AY/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pyrex &#8211; 1123268 Simply Store</a> set, because it was frequently mentioned by Amazon reviewers as their long-time favorite. It passed the freezer, microwave and oven tests, and its lid was not harmed by the dishwasher. From the beginning, however, the lid was difficult to snap on, and we had to pry it off before it would release from the container. Naturally, we thought this would indicate that the Pyrex would be airtight and leakproof. But the Pyrex performed just as poorly as the Prep Naturals.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Plastic food containers are great for storing food in the refrigerator or freezer and for carrying lunch or leftovers to work or school. They’re less expensive than glass, but as our tests showed, microwaving and machine-dishwashing damages both the containers and their lids. You’ll probably want to replace them after a few months of use.</p>
<p>An exception was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; 1977447 Brilliance</a>, our top pick for plastic food container. The Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance was 100-percent leakproof and airtight, and although it stained very slightly — much less than the other plastic containers we tested — its durable Tritan plastic retained clarity and structure over the course of our rigorous tests. It’s a quality product for a reasonable price.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to worry about potential health hazards from plastic, our favorite glass food storage container was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075GRTNN6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; Smart Seal</a>. The OXO is more expensive than other glass containers (not to mention plastic containers), but its unique removable silicone gasket ensures a perfect seal. The OXO is leakproof, airtight, freezer-, microwave- and dishwasher-safe and will hold up for years.<br />

<h2 id="why-buy">Why buy a KitchenAid stand mixer?</h2>
<p>Simply put, it’s the best. We rigorously <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stand-mixer/">tested five highly rated stand mixers</a>, and the KitchenAid Artisan was the clear champion over the others. If you’re a daily baker or a holiday baker, any KitchenAid stand mixer is an essential appliance for your kitchen.</p>
<p>All KitchenAid stand mixers combine heavy-duty steel construction with a powerful motor. Depending on its size and wattage, a KitchenAid makes short work of any tedious baking task, such as blending thick cookie dough stuffed with mix-ins or kneading pizza dough.</p>
<p>Any KitchenAid stand mixer has been built to last a lifetime. We’ve worked with the KitchenAid Pro 600 for nearly 15 years, and it’s still churning out and humming along as well as the first day we flipped the on switch.</p>
<p>These are workhorses; and like the proverbial workhorse, they’re solid and heavy. The Artisan and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004SGFW/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Classic </a> — both are the compact, tilt-head style —  weigh in at 23 pounds. The Professional is a hefty 29 pounds. So you really need to have some kitchen-counter real estate where the KitchenAid can live, since it’s too heavy to hoist it up to a cabinet.</p>

<p>All KitchenAid stand mixers have a unique built-in that no other stand mixer has: a power hub. This portal on the mixer’s head allows you to plug in 15 attachments, ranging from a pasta roller to a spiralizer, <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-spiralizer/">like the spiralizers we reviewed</a>, to an ice cream maker, one that&#8217;s smaller and just as functional as those we reviewed in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-ice-cream-maker/">best ice cream maker</a> article.</p>
<p>Finally, you’re probably aware that a KitchenAid stand mixer is more expensive than other stand mixers. You’ll spend between $200 to $325 on a KitchenAid stand mixer, but with all of the available attachments that can do practically any cooking-prep job, you’ll push your culinary skills to new levels.</p>

<p>KitchenAid has been manufacturing stand mixers for 100 years, and during that century, they’ve given several facelifts to their models. There are three core models that KitchenAid occasionally updates: the Classic, the Pro 600 and the Artisan. (KitchenAid also makes a very large Commercial mixer, but these are really intended for bakeries or home-baking businesses.)</p>
[table id=265 /]
<h3>Classic</h3>
<p>The Classic Series has a tilt-head design, meaning the head of the mixer swivels back, which allows easy access to the mixing bowl. The Classic’s mixing bowl is 4.5 quarts and has no handle. The bowl is slightly tapered and locks into the bottom of the mixer’s stand. The Classic has 10 variable speeds controlled by a side lever.</p>
<p>The Classic has 275 watts and is a planetary-motion mixer, which means the attachments revolve while the bowl remains stationary. Although the Classic’s wattage is somewhat less than the Artisan and Pro 600, all KitchenAid stand mixers have been engineered to use wattage for creating exceptional torque — the force needed to rotate an object — which is particularly needed for kneading bread or pizza dough and mixing dense cookie dough.</p>
<p>The Classic has 59 touch points per rotation; every time the wire whisk, dough hook or flat beater (included with all KitchenAid mixers) revolves around the bowl, it will touch the bowl 59 times. The more touch points per rotation, the less you will need to scrape the sides of the bowl.</p>
<p>True to its name, the Classic is only available in two colors, white and silver.</p>
<h3>Artisan</h3>
<p>The Artisan has all of the same features of the Classic, but its power is boosted to 325 watts. The Artisan has a 5-quart tapered bowl with a handle that also locks into the stand. The same accessories are included, but the Artisan’s flat beater has a raised silicone edge, which virtually eliminates scraping the bowl. Like the Classic, the Artisan also has a 10-speed motor and 59 touch points per rotation.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to match your appliances with your kitchen, the Artisan comes in a veritable rainbow of 44 colors.</p>
<h3>Pro 600</h3>
<p>KitchenAid&#8217;s Pro 600 Series shares some core features with the Classic and Artisan models. It differs, however, in that it has a bowl-lift design. The 6-quart bowl latches onto two side arms and the back of the stand. A lever raises the bowl to the attachment; when mixing is complete, the bowl lowers back to the base.</p>
<p>The Pro 600 is also larger, heavier, and its wattage is amped up to 575. With 67 touch points per rotation, the wide whisk and flat beater (one-third larger than the Classic and Artisan) and the elongated dough hook miss nothing in the bowl.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Since we already tested the Artisan in our stand mixer review, we repeated the same tests with the Classic and Pro 600.</p>

<p><b>Egg whites:</b> For each mixer, we put two room-temperature egg whites into the bowl and started the mixer at its lowest setting. When the egg whites began to foam, we increased the speed to the highest level and timed how long it took for the egg whites to reach a meringue consistency.</p>

<p><b>Cream: </b>The Artisan easily whipped one cup of chilled heavy cream to fluffy peaks. We repeated the test with the Classic and Pro 600 by whipping the cream at its lowest setting and gradually increasing to the highest and timed how long it took for the mixer to whip the cream.</p>
<h3>Cake batter</h3>
<p>We used “The Great British Baking Show” judge <a href="https://www.bbc.com/food/recipes/mary_berrys_perfect_34317" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Berry’s recipe for genoise</a>, or sponge cake, which serves as the base for an assortment of iced and jelly-filled cakes. We made this recipe many times during our initial testing, and it’s especially good for showing how well (or poorly) the stand mixer whips the ingredients together to create a light and airy cake with a soft crumb.</p>
<h3>Cookie dough</h3>
<p>As we discovered from our prior tests, cookie dough can cause havoc with almost all stand mixers. Depending on the shape of the bowl and length of attachments, oftentimes mixins just aren’t mixed in enough. This failing was more than apparent with the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stand-mixer/">Cheftronic &#8211; SM986 and Cuisinart SM-50 </a>, both of which left mixins in the bottom of their deeply tapered bowls and short attachments.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/super-chunky-cookies-3362198" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recipe </a> we used is a dense dough jammed full with chocolate chips, peanuts and M&amp;Ms. This test really showcases the motor’s ability to create the torque needed to thoroughly blend these heavy ingredients into a cohesive dough.</p>
<h3>Pizza dough</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/kneading-dough.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>This is the most challenging test of all. It’s a <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/pizza-dough-recipe-1914764" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standard recipe for pizza dough</a> that we’ve made dozens of times. Earlier models of stand mixers had an extenuated dough hook that was curled like a pig’s tail. The latest models have dough hooks that are about one-third shorter and have a more traditional hook shape.</p>
<p>In our previous tests, only the Artisan blended and kneaded the dough effortlessly. The other mixers struggled to make a cohesive dough with the new dough hook, and the strain on their  motors caused the mixers to shake and rattle like the Northridge Earthquake.</p>

<p>The 5-quart, tilt-head <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006WNOZ/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KSM150PS Artisan</a> stand mixer won <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stand-mixer/#best">best overall in our review of stand mixers,</a> and it’s our top pick again. The Artisan is the most popular of KitchenAid’s stand mixers, and it’s easy to understand why. The Artisan is about 20 percent smaller than the Pro 600, and the tilt-head design makes the mixer more compact so it can fit underneath most kitchen cabinets.</p>
<p>At 375 watts, the Artisan has plenty of power to tackle bread, pizza and chunky cookie dough. The usual attachments are included: A wire whisk, flat paddle and dough hook. The flat paddle and dough hook are nylon-coated for easy cleaning.</p>
<p>We found the Artisan’s pouring shield especially useful when we added flour to the pizza dough. It fits over the mixing bowl and allows you to add dry or wet ingredients while the mixer is mixing. The pouring shield eliminated spills and concentrated the flour into a spout, which the dough hook efficiently turned into the vortex of the mixture.</p>

It’s fast, versatile and very user-friendly.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006WNOZ/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Artisan has a slightly tapered stainless steel bowl, and its attachments have been designed specifically to reduce the need for scraping ingredients down the sides of the bowl.</p>
<p>The Artisan performed perfectly in all of our tests. It whipped the egg whites and cream to firm peaks in one minute and smoothly blended the cake batter, which baked light, airy and delicate. The Artisan had no problems mixing together the cookie dough, although there were a few M&amp;M bits in the bottom of the bowl. The hook attachment is less curlicue than the Pro 600’s, but the Artisan nevertheless mixed and kneaded an elastic ball of pizza dough in five minutes.</p>
<p>The Artisan is so easy to use you’ll find yourself baking like a professional in no time. Like all three KitchenAid stand mixers, the Artisan is expensive. But if you’re new to baking or you’re someone who wants to bake more than cupcakes and Christmas cookies, the Artisan is an investment you should make.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The KitchenAid Artisan is a tilt-head-style stand mixer and compact enough to fit under most kitchen cabinets.</li>
<li>The Artisan has plenty of power to handle dense bread and cookie dough.</li>

<p>If you’re an ardent baker and an all-day baking binge is a regular past time, then the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002Y5X9W/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; Pro 600 </a> is your best choice. It’s only about $50 more than the Artisan, but we feel the substantially increased power, rock-solid construction and excellent ease of use is worth that small difference in price.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, the Pro 600 is a big piece of machinery. It’s made entirely of metal, so it’s quite heavy — 29 pounds — and once you’ve unpacked the Pro 600, it’s not going anywhere. Look elsewhere if your kitchen counter space is limited.</p>
<p>Like all KitchenAid stand mixers, the Pro 600’s 575-watt motor has direct drive transmission, which means that its system of (all-steel) gears directly transfers power to whatever you’re mixing in the bowl. There’s less power consumption, and it mixes everything faster.</p>
<p>The proof, of course, is in the pudding &#8212; or the cake batter. The Pro 600 beat the other two KitchenAid stand mixers by 15 to 20 seconds in every challenge, due, in part, to its wire whisk and flat paddle being one-third larger. When the bowl is lifted into place, the attachments touch the bottom of the bowl and the sides. With its 67 touch points, every last ounce of ingredient is whisked or beaten.</p>

<p>The results? Egg whites were beaten to meringue consistency in 55 seconds, the cream was fluffed to peaks in a minute. The cake baked light and airy with a delicate and moist crumb, and the cookies had a cake-like texture, which made us want to eat the entire batch in one sitting. (We restrained from doing so, barely.)</p>

<p>The Pro 600’s dough hook recalls what Captain Hook wore at his wrist. Its elongated, curlicue shape reaches the bottom of the bowl, so when we started the mixer at its lowest setting, the hook gently mixed the ingredients with no splatter. We increased the speed to 2 (there are 10 levels) and watched in amazement how the hook gathered everything together into a dough ball. Not once did we need to scrape the sides of the bowl.</p>
<p>We increased the speed to 3 and allowed the mixer to do its work, kneading the pizza dough until it was smooth and elastic. It really doesn’t get easier. As we did in our prior tests — and you shouldn’t do this at home — we increased the speed to its highest level while the mixer was kneading the dough. The bowl vibrated, but the heavy-metal stand held its ground and stayed in place.</p>
<p>KitchenAid intuited that most people will not store the Pro 600 in a cabinet, and so they’ve designed them in 22 different shades to fit any kitchen’s color scheme. If you prefer a vintage look, a tempered-glass mixing bowl is available.</p>
<p>The Pro 600 is the most expensive of the three KitchenAid stand mixers. The Pro 600 won’t fit everyone’s budget, and if you don’t have spacious countertops, you should consider the Artisan instead.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The KitchenAid &#8211; Pro 600 is a sturdily constructed, high-power kitchen workhorse and makes short work of any baking mixing task.</li>
<li>Its 6-quart bowl allows you to make several loaves of bread or up to 13 dozen cookies in a single batch.</li>
<li>The Pro 600&#8217;s bowl and attachments are designed to virtually eliminate any hand-mixing or scraping of the bowl.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s the most expensive of the KitchenAid mixers we tested, but if you bake everyday, it&#8217;s a worthwhile investment. The Pro 600 is built to last for years.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004SGFW/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; K45SS Classic</a> is the least expensive stand mixer in the KitchenAid line. It’s well-made and performed almost as well as the Artisan. However, in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stand-mixer/">review of stand mixers</a>, we recommended the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000308BUI/?tag=ybdmix-20">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 63232</a> as an alternative to the Artisan. Since it’s about $25 less than the Classic and on a par with the Artisan, if you’re looking for a budget-priced stand mixer, consider the Hamilton Beach.</p>
<p>The Classic has 275 watts and at 4.5-quarts, its bowl is slightly smaller than the Artisan. It has the same attachments, but it lacks a splatter shield. (We checked KitchenAid’s website, and a separately purchased splatter shield for the Classic is not available.) In many respects, the Classic is identical to the Artisan; however, we did notice some minor differences in its performance.</p>
<p>The Classic whipped the egg whites and cream about 15 seconds slower, which is hardly a deal breaker. However, at its highest speed, the motor fluctuated and seemed to slow down for a second. We tested this several times, and the slight fluctuation was consistent. Since we only tested one model of the Classic, this issue might pertain only to the model we tested.</p>
<p>The Classic’s flat beater doesn’t have the silicone edge that the Artisan has, so it couldn’t reach all of the ingredients. This was the only KitchenAid mixer that made us scrape the bowl. We mixed ingredients thoroughly, but the cake rose unevenly with divets on the surface. Minor discrepancies can always happen in baking, but the cake’s texture was noticeably less airy and light.</p>
<p>The cookies mixed together quickly (42 seconds), but we couldn’t increase the speed past level 3 without the ingredients splattering. When we removed the dough, about one-quarter cup of M&amp;Ms were left behind in the bottom of the bowl. The pizza hook was just as effective as it was in the other models, and the Classic produced an elastic dough in a few minutes.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>You really can’t go wrong buying a KitchenAid stand mixer. They’re solid, built to last and can perform heavy-duty mixing, blending, whipping and kneading in a few effortless minutes. For someone who enjoys baking on a weekly or even daily basis, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002Y5X9W/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KP26M1X Pro 600</a> is your best bet for handling high-volume baking.</p>
<p>If you’re a first-time baker or a seasoned professional, the smaller, less-expensive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006WNOZ/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KSM150PS Artisan</a> has plenty of power for both daily and occasional baking. The Artisan matches the Pro 600’s performance, but its tilt-head design makes it more compact so it can fit many kitchen-counter spaces.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>When we looked around for opinions of high-end knife enthusiasts, it was clear that value is a very relative scale among knife buyers. In <a href="https://www.kitchenknifeforums.com/threads/beater-most-used-knife.30087" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this thread on Kitchen Knife Forums,</a> a &#8220;beater&#8221; is a $240 handmade piece for one enthusiast, while for another it&#8217;s a dollar-store knife that he customized with his collection of sharpening gear.</p>
<p>Our researcher for this review has been collecting and using knives of all sizes since he got his first Wenger Swiss Army &#8220;MacGyver knife&#8221; at age five or six. Though he long ago gave up his dream of becoming a bladesmith himself, he&#8217;s made a few cooking knives. He grew up around a lovely set of Henckels, and he&#8217;s been peripherally aware of the movings and shakings in the kitchen cutlery world.</p>
<p>Studying reviews from Cook&#8217;s Illustrated, Serious Eats and Wirecutter gave us a list of must-test blades, but also quickly shaped a bell curve for our assessment of the best kitchen knives for the money.</p>
<p>We also made a deep dive into online discussion among the chefs at Cheftalk and the never-ending knife discussions on reddit and the Kitchen Knife Forums.</p>
<p>Then, to take a step back from the hype, we talked to some more wizened experts for their takes on what a cook really needs in a knife.</p>
<p><strong>After consulting with <a href="https://martellknives.com/pages/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dave Martell</a> (long-time kitchen knife sharpener, knife maker and owner of the Kitchen Knife Forums) and Chef David Hendricksen, <a href="https://www.artinstitutes.edu/academics/culinary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national culinary director for the Art Institutes Culinary School</a>, we put together a list of criteria and began comparing retail offerings.</strong></p>
<p>We analyzed the stats and reviews of 39 models and narrowed that group down to 12 finalists. We settled on three groups, each with slightly different goals and priorities:</p>
<p><b>Budget knives:</b> These finalists are a set of rough-and-ready blades with molded handles that were as cheap as $13. Utility knives like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001FEJ0WO/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this one from Kiwi brand</a> are often the real workhorses in professional kitchens, but we wanted to show options more refined than that. We included plastic-handle knives from Victorinox and Wüsthof because they&#8217;re so well-regarded by other reviewers, but we also included a much cheaper knife from Mercer to get a fair comparison of what&#8217;s possible on a shoestring budget.</p>
<p><b>Mid-tier knives:</b> These are knives you can give to a friend as a wedding gift without blowing a $50 budget, but also without being embarrassed by cheap-looking molded handles. The ideal knife in this category is also a great starter blade for someone who wants to up their fine-cooking game but has no intention of learning about steel types or mirror-polished edges.</p>
<p><b>Upgrade knives:</b> We opened up the purse strings a little bit to see what you get for slightly more than a mid-tier knife. A $40 knife should already cut well if you keep it sharp, so we looked specifically for better, harder steel that will hold a razor-sharp edge longer than ordinary knives do.</p>
<p>Knife nerds of all stripes will probably protest that we aren&#8217;t even testing $100 or $200 knives (not to mention the hallowed Kramer designs or other $300+ options you&#8217;ll find at fine retailers). But if you&#8217;re going to shell out more than $100 for a knife, you should really feel it in-hand for yourself.</p>
<p>We can steer you through the important specs and pitfalls of mass-manufactured knives, but it&#8217;s very difficult to tell you what your favorite balance, edge profile and handle shape are going to be. At price brackets above $100, those are the refinements you should be looking for, more a matter of taste than qualities we can list on a chart.</p>

<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>We talked to two kitchen knife experts to narrow down a list of the most important characteristics in a knife. Dave Martell runs the kitchen knife forums, and they get a lot of requests for knife recommendations from new members. We came up with these core questions that you need to ask yourself to make a good knife choice:</p>
<p><strong>Intended use: </strong>What&#8217;s the most important job for your knife? Will you be slicing meat? Chopping root vegetables? Will you ever split an acorn squash? A knife you use for eight hours every day might have different features than something you only use for half an hour every week.</p>
<p><strong>Profile: </strong>Do you want the edge of the knife to be in full contact with the cutting board to get more control, or do you want to &#8220;rock&#8221; it through the food to get more power?</p>
<p><b>Edge geometry: </b>Every knife collector has a preference for the final edge shape. To sum it up, there are basically two paths: First, there are thick, obtuse edges that are robust and easy to re-sharpen. Those more interested in maximum slicing precision prefer thin, acute edges that will slice like a laser but chip more easily if you abuse them. Thin edges also take longer to re-sharpen, and often require practiced skill with a bench stone.</p>
<p><strong>Handle size, shape and materials:</strong>  A handle you hate with a great blade in it will still be a knife you hate. Do you have big hands? Do you prefer a certain way of gripping a knife? Sadly, it&#8217;s hard to tell which handles you&#8217;ll like best from a picture, but you can see the relative sizes in our lineup photos.</p>
<p>Only after you&#8217;ve answered questions about those preferences does Martell suggest looking into other factors. Here are some commonly-mentioned attributes:</p>
<p><b>Balance: </b>If you like to move quickly and make rapid cuts, a light knife with neutral balance can feel more nimble. If you want more power and you&#8217;re cutting for long sessions, you might prefer a blade-heavy knife that keeps weight on the cutting board. An eight-inch blade typically has a neutral or handle-heavy balance, while longer knives will be more and more blade-heavy.</p>
<p><b>Full tang or hidden tang:</b> The steel your knife&#8217;s handle is attached to is called the tang. If you can see the line of steel extending the full length and width of the handle, it&#8217;s called a full tang. It&#8217;s cheaper for manufacturers to cut the tang short and mold a handle around it, though plenty of lovely and expensive knives are made with partial or hidden tangs. The biggest influence of this choice is on balance and weight: a full tang means more weight in the handle and moves the balance point closer to you.</p>
<p><b>Stamped vs. forged:</b> Thirty years ago, if a blade was stamped or cut out of a sheet cookie-cutter style it was usually a sign of a very cheap knife, while all the &#8220;good&#8221; knives were forged to shape from a bar or rod. These days, that distinction is entirely gone. Both forged and stamped-and-welded knives are now made with bolsters, and stamped or laser-cut steel is used in some of the very best collector&#8217;s knives.</p>
<p><b>Steel hardness and toughness:</b> If a manufacturer chooses to make their knives harder, the edges will last longer, but that also makes them more prone to chipping and makes sharpening take longer. Most popular knives are kept on the softer side so a bent-over edge can be burnished back to shape with a honing steel. <a href="#stability-test">See our tests below</a> for a look at how big that difference can be when an edge is thinned out.</p>
<p><b>Steel alloy and wear resistance: </b>Steel is mostly just iron with a pinch of carbon, but other alloying elements can make it even better for certain tasks. More carbon means the steel can get harder, and more chromium adds stain resistance, but in high-carbon stainless the chromium and other elements like vanadium also form extra-hard carbides. Carbides help the steel resist wear, but they make thin edges more prone to breaking. Finding a balance of all these elements and managing heat treatment carefully is how the master bladesmiths stay ahead of the curve.</p>
<p><b>Surface texture:</b> Hammered finishes can show off the connection that your knife has with the smith who forged it. That said, there are plenty of lovely hand-hammered blades that are then carefully polished flat, so a hammered finish is almost always a decorative choice. The texture doesn&#8217;t add anything to the function of the knife unless the pattern is dramatically deep, in which case it might help keep food from sticking to the blade.</p>
<p><b>Patterned blades: </b>Pattern-welded steel is made up from layers of steel that have been stacked, folded and welded together. This specialized material is often called &#8220;Damascus&#8221; steel because of the resemblance to Wootz steel from India and the Middle East, though it&#8217;s made more like <a href="https://youtu.be/gxwWf-MfZVk?t=1156" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Japanese tamahagane</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTMkTEpYPA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nordic pattern-welding</a>. The advantages of these methods are entirely obsolete now that we have precise control over steelmaking, but many collectors still love the look and the tradition behind the pattern.</p>
<p><b>Layers vs. monosteel:</b> Many smiths in Japan prefer to make blades that have layers of softer metal on the sides. Smiths we talked to agree that there&#8217;s no specific benefit to the end user unless you especially want a high-carbon steel core with stainless sides to make maintenance easier.</p>
<p><b>Hollows and stick-resistant finishes:</b> There are a few different ways to approach food sticking to the blade. A true Granton edge (invented by Granton Cutlery) for slicing meat is actually wavy all the way to the edge, something you basically never find on a chef&#8217;s knife. Other manufacturers will grind out hollows in the side of their blades and sometimes call them &#8220;granton edges.&#8221; In Japanese cutlery, you&#8217;re more likely to see hand-forged divots or a dished-out grind profile called &#8220;urasuki&#8221; that keeps food from sticking. We didn&#8217;t buy any chef&#8217;s knives with textured blades, but <a href="#food-release">see our testing results below</a> for what we found out about food release when slicing with chef&#8217;s knives.</p>
<h2 id="budget">How much should you spend?</h2>
<p>So far as performance and value goes, there&#8217;s often a big gap between a mass-produced $100 knife and a handmade $300 specialty piece. When choosing a really high-end knife, you can often pick and choose important factors: A steel with specific characteristics, attractive handle materials and a profile or sharpening style that matches your intended use.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have specific preferences and you want to get the most for your money, though, the difference between a mass-produced $40 knife and most $100 knives is surprisingly small. In some ways this is a testament to the quality of modern $40 knives: Steel quality, factory sharpening and heat treatment are pretty well standardized at this level, with few exceptions. It&#8217;s not the best performance possible, but that mostly means you&#8217;ll just have to sharpen more frequently. Check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-knife-sharpener/">kitchen knife sharpener review</a> to see what the options are.</p>
<p>A $100 knife isn&#8217;t doing very much extra to pull out ahead; most are made from the same steels on the same production lines as their budget brethren. You&#8217;ll often get a more prestigious name, and a nicer-looking handle, but the cutting edge itself will usually be identical between a plastic-handle knife and a $150 model.</p>
<p>In German knives, you&#8217;ll typically see a bigger performance improvement by having an expert cutler re-sharpen a $40 knife to a thinner edge than you would by paying for an up-market model from the same manufacturer. <strong>The days when a forged knife from a German manufacturer was clearly superior to their budget line are long gone; the differences are now mostly in handles.</strong></p>
<p>Above $140 you can find the best-selling brands used by chefs who make a long-term investment in their tools: the ubiquitous <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074SVJKDZ/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Henckels</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000N5H2XU/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003B66YKA/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shun</a>, as well as premium-steel offerings from newer brands like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017AED3F2/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Yaxell</a>. The steel in German-made knives typically won&#8217;t be any different than most $40 knives even at this price, but if you look carefully you should be able to find steels that get harder than the ubiquitous German X50CrMoV15 (also called 1.4116) Stainless.</p>
<p>If you want hand-forged, you can sometimes find good, basic knives at less than $200. You won&#8217;t get anything really artisanal, like the alluring &#8220;hamon&#8221; line from careful edge-hardening, until you go above $200-300.</p>
<p>Dave Martell sharpens and sells some very expensive, very beautiful knives, but he warns people not to get caught up in the hype and miss the bigger picture: &#8220;Too many people get hung up on what steels are used and what fancy crap has been added to lure you in. <strong>What matters so much more than that is if the knife is made to perform for its intended task.</strong> If that isn&#8217;t addressed first then what steel the knife is made from will have little meaning.&#8221;</p>
<h2 id="knife-types">What is a chef&#8217;s knife?</h2>
<p>The tradition of the chef&#8217;s knife goes back for centuries, but we learned when talking with our experts that the prototype for nearly every modern chef&#8217;s knife can be traced through the designs used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabatier">two different Sabatier families</a> in Thiers, France, in the 19th Century. The curve of the edge has morphed and evolved slightly as we&#8217;ve developed specific chopping and slicing techniques, but chef&#8217;s knives all feature a &#8220;dropped&#8221; edge that gives your fingers room when you&#8217;re chopping on a cutting board.</p>
<p>The recent influx of Japanese cuisine, Japanese chefs and cross-pollination between Japanese and German manufacturing technique has heavily influenced popular trends in chef&#8217;s knives.</p>
<p>To summarize trends: German manufacturers pioneered the use of stainless steel that is easy to take care of, but not very hard. You can use a honing steel on most Western chef&#8217;s knives and bring back a fairly sharp edge by burnishing and re-aligning the steel that rounds off or rolls over, but it won&#8217;t stay that sharp for more than a day or so of chopping veggies. You can keep using the steel to bring back the edge, but eventually it gets too thick to cut effectively and needs thinning.</p>
<p>In contrast, Japanese chefs expect extra-hard steel finished to a mirror-polished edge, often with a chisel-shaped asymmetrical bevel rather than the same sharpening angle on each side of the blade. <strong>The edges can be thinner, since the expectation is that chefs will be making careful, precise cuts with gyuto knives, while heavy-handed vegetable chopping is reserved for a cleaver-style knife.</strong> These edges last longer, but the hard steel doesn&#8217;t respond well to burnishing with a honing rod, so you&#8217;ll need to learn how to sharpen them yourself or send them away.</p>
<p>Both the German kochmesser and the Japanese gyuto shape are still inspired by the French Sabatier knives. The biggest difference is in handles. German knives tend to have a full-width steel &#8220;tang&#8221; sandwiched between riveted handle &#8220;scales,&#8221; while the traditional &#8220;wa&#8221; handle in Japan is a single, round piece of outer material with a skinny tang inside that you can&#8217;t see. Another characteristic feature of European designs is the bolster, a thickened section of steel that covers the transition from blade to handle.</p>
<p>These days, most Japanese manufacturers also make the Western-style &#8220;yo-handle gyuto&#8221; with the familiar full-tang-and-rivets construction. (The Misono and Tojiro we tested are perfect examples.) Ironically, Wa-handle designs are now very popular among American and British custom knife makers.</p>
<h3>Chopping, slicing and edge thickness</h3>

<p>Another big difference between popular chef&#8217;s knives today is in their belly and edge thickness. <strong>When you look at a blade in profile, a larger radius in the arc of a knife edge is basically the definitive trait of a German chef&#8217;s knife.</strong> More of that &#8220;belly&#8221; curve makes the knife better suited to rocking motions against the cutting board. If the arc is flatter, the knife will have more board contact and can slice long sections with a push or slicing motion.</p>
<p>The thickness of steel behind the final sharpened bevel is probably the biggest influence on the way a knife handles. If you want a stiff blade that can help you crunch through hard root vegetables with its weight, or something that will chop through chicken leg bones, a thicker blade is what you&#8217;re looking for. On the other hand, if you&#8217;re trying to slice ripe tomatoes without squashing them, thinner &#8220;laser&#8221; knives will present less drag and resistance as they slide through.</p>
<h3>How long is too long?</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re slicing something like a large roast, a longer blade will help you work efficiently, cutting as deeply as possible with each stroke. If you&#8217;re mostly chopping carrots, though, you usually don&#8217;t need to make any slicing movement and you can easily cut all the way through with one motion, whether rocking or push-cutting. A dedicated vegetable knife is usually shorter, from five to seven inches, while a dedicated slicer is often as long as 12 inches.</p>
<p>Most home cooks want a chef&#8217;s knife that&#8217;s good for both types of cutting, so the real question is your cutting board. If you&#8217;re limited to an eight-inch cutting board, you might want to look for seven-inch versions of these chef&#8217;s knives just so you&#8217;ll have an easier time maneuvering. If you&#8217;ve got a beautiful 24-inch butcher-block, a 10-inch knife will have plenty of room to maneuver and will be able to mince a large pile of veggies more quickly.</p>
<p>Chef Hendricksen puts it a slightly different way: &#8220;Big knives scare people and an 8-inch is a good size to get work done and not be so intimidating. It’s the starter knife I recommend. If someone is proficient with an 8-inch, they should be able to use other sizes.&#8221;</p>
<h2 id="grip-tips">How should I hold a chef&#8217;s knife?</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re just starting out with a chef&#8217;s knife, you might be unsure about the best way to hold it. So long as you keep your fingers clear of the edge, there&#8217;s nothing specific that you need to learn other than how comfortable the knife feels in your hand while making the cuts or slices you need.</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pushcut.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Slicing by pushing or drawing the edge of the knife through the food you&#8217;re cutting is one of the most efficient ways to use a sharp knife, especially when you&#8217;re cutting something soft or tricky to hold.</p>
<p><strong>Most chefs favor the &#8220;pinch&#8221; grip with the blade itself between thumb and knuckle: This angle is just right so that the back-and-forth slicing movement comes from the strength of your arm, not your wrist or fingers.</strong></p>
<p>Knives with smaller bolsters and simple handle shapes are generally easier to use in this grip, and the Japanese &#8220;wa-handle&#8221; is becoming very popular partly for this reason.<br />
As you can see from the video above, a blade with a deep belly curve almost gets in its own way when push-cutting into the board or making short, quick slices. A flatter edge profile is usually preferred, since the whole edge will finish the cut against the cutting board at the same time.</p>
<p>That said, if you&#8217;re making really long draw-slices, like julienne or matchstick cuts, extra curvature can make things easier (think of a pizza cutter).</p>

<p>When chopping, even just small, precise chops where the blade rocks against the cutting board, many prefer to keep their fingers wrapped securely around the handle. You don&#8217;t need anything fancy to chop well, but if you&#8217;re putting a lot of force into your chop for stringy or hard materials, a contoured or cushioned grip can be nice.<br />
The bigger difference here comes from blade shape: A full, rounded &#8220;belly&#8221; makes rocking the knife that much easier.</p>
<h2 id="stainless-vs-carbon">Can stainless steel be good enough?</h2>
<p>About 100 years ago, cutlery manufacturers started using chromium-rich &#8220;stainless&#8221; steels in knives. The appeal is obvious: Stainless steel prevents tough-to-clean rust spots, and the chromium layer that forms naturally on the surface of stainless steel also keeps the steel from leaving a metallic taste in food.</p>
<p>Without careful heat treatment, though, stainless steel is less ideal for knife edges than simple carbon steels or specialized &#8220;tool steels.&#8221; Early stainless steel had a terrible reputation for being soft, and even with modern heat treatment methods the old recipes for 420 and &#8220;surgical&#8221; stainless are often derided as &#8220;junk.&#8221;</p>
<p>New alloys with more and more carbon appeared on the scene and allow the steel to get harder than that early stainless steel, and as more carbon is added the chromium and other elements also combine with it to create hard, wear-resistant carbide grains within the steel.</p>
<p><strong>With more extreme carbide-rich alloys, steel is more wear-resistant, but also more prone to chipping when edges are thin.</strong></p>
<p>The industry standard is x50CrMoV15 stainless steel (also listed as 1.4116 or frequently as &#8220;German stainless&#8221;), with a middling amount of carbon and usually a hardness of only 55 or 56 on the Rockwell scale compared to 59 or low 60s for other knives and tools. This low hardness prevents chipping, and ensures you can still easily sharpen the edge by running it across a steel honing rod to bend or scrape it back to shape.</p>
<p>Those who seek to push the envelope look to other alloys that allow thinner edges and better wear resistance. AUS-8 and its evolved cousin, VG-10, are the gold standards for Japanese stainless knives.</p>
<p>Often considered an ideal balance of toughness and wear resistance, VG-10 has just enough carbon to allow more hardness and wear-resistant carbides that will give a busy chef a few days more between sharpening touch-ups.</p>
<p>The big name to look out for if you&#8217;re seeking a specific alloy is AEB-L (the trademark from Austrian steel mill Böhler-Uddeholm) and 13c26 (from Swedish mill Sandvik.) This steel was formulated for use in razors; it&#8217;s basically the finest-grained stainless steel out there, which means edges resist chipping even when the steel is extra hard.</p>
<p>Sadly, we didn&#8217;t find any affordable knives to test that use AEBL, though rumor has it that&#8217;s what Zwilling uses it in their little-known <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074T3R6VS/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Diplome chef&#8217;s knife</a> and Misono uses it in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Misono-UX10-Gyutou-8-2-21cm/dp/B000XSX8IA/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">frequently-sold-out UX10</a>.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t mind the staining and want something as easy as possible to sharpen, Carbon steel knives are still available, both from European and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G5HBRW2/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Japanese</a> factories. If anything, they&#8217;re easier to find now than they were 10 years ago due to growing interest among chefs and enthusiasts.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re buying a high-end piece, makers like Bob Kramer, Murray Carter and Dave Martell will often use carbon steel with a refined and customized heat treatment to get top performance from a knife. You&#8217;re going to want to clean a knife like that very diligently anyhow, so the lack of stain-resistance is often less of a concern. Some chefs even cherish the dark patina that develops on their prized carbon steel blades.</p>
<p>For the most part, the real advantage that carbon steel used to have over stainless — namely, a heat treatment that makes knives hard enough for extra-thin edges that aren&#8217;t brittle — is missing in mass-produced carbon steel blades. Factory-made blades in the West are almost always tempered on the softer side to maximize toughness and to make sharpening easier. Bringing modern stainless steels to an equivalent level of performance is now common practice, and you don&#8217;t gain much by stepping back in time.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We spent three months using these knives in a home kitchen. We made Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners, stew and soups, and diced over fifteen pounds of onions.</p>
<p>We bought a five-pound bag of carrots and chopped them with wet hands to see how the grip of each knife changed in stressful situations. We also sliced yams to see how the knives fared in hard vegetables with enough cross-section that thicker blades will wedge stuck.</p>
<h3>Slicing Performance</h3>
[table id=229 /]
<p>In the kitchen, easy slicing is the quality that&#8217;s most important. Even if you have a knife that&#8217;s perfect in every other way, a blade that won&#8217;t slice through food is just going to stay in a drawer.</p>
<p>One feature of kitchen knives that&#8217;s often talked about, but rarely quantified, is the thickness of a blade. <b>We measured each blade with a micrometer to check the thickness at the spine as well as the thickness immediately behind the edge, where it can start to wedge in food if it&#8217;s too thick. </b>Thinner blades slice better but are also more flexible, which is a slight liability if you&#8217;re using a lot of force when cutting hard root vegetables.</p>
<p>Weight is another consideration: A light blade is easier to lift and move quickly, but a heavier blade can help you chop and slice efficiently. We also checked how far toward the tip or handle the balance point is, measuring from the heel of the blade. There&#8217;s no perfect weight or balance for a knife, as that&#8217;s definitely a matter of preference, so we hope our chart will help demonstrate the differences if you can&#8217;t hold the knives for yourself.</p>
<p>The standout performers in slicing tests are thin blades with extra-thin edges. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000UAPQGS/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tojiro &#8211; DP</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079S3G9KZ/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nexus &#8211; BD1N</a> are great slicers, as we expected, but the thin edge of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002R1CGV6/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mercer &#8211; Renaissance</a> was a nice surprise. It used to be that budget knives were just flat pieces of sheet steel sharpened on one edge, but all the blades we tested are ground across the whole blade to make an elegant, thin wedge. Even the most disappointing knife in this group can cut tomatoes without squashing them, so long as it&#8217;s kept sharp.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XT4GJO/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Misono &#8211; Molybdenum Steel Gyuto</a> is a rare exception to the thinner-is-better rule: The asymmetrical edge that it comes with is ideal for some push-cutting tasks once you get used to it, but for peeling, carving and other tasks where you need to control the width of the section you&#8217;re slicing off, it steers your hand quite a lot.</p>

The way some vegetables stick to a knife blade when you&#8217;re cutting thin slices can be annoying. We compared all of these chef&#8217;s knives with an old santoku-style chopping knife that has hollows ground into the side of its blade, and we&#8217;re reassured that these features are nearly always a placebo at best. The one spec that seems to matter here is the cross-section of a blade&#8217;s cutting edge: the thickest edges we tested did seem to stick less than the thinner blades.</p>
<p>There are specialized slicing knives that have specific features to &#8220;hack&#8221; this problem, but they&#8217;re generally not as versatile as a regular chef&#8217;s knife. If you&#8217;re slicing roast all day a true Granton edge is probably worth looking into, and if you&#8217;re making paper-thin veggie slices for delicate displays you should check out the specialized Japanese &#8220;usuba&#8221; knife style.</p>
<h3>Factory sharpening and ease of maintenance</h3>
[table id=230 /]
<p>After measuring the initial sharpening angle with a goniometer and checking factory sharpness on our BESS tester for the sake of posterity, we killed the edges on a sharpening stone and then re-sharpened them, first by hand to get a feel for how easy each steel sharpens, and then with the winner of our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-knife-sharpener/">knife sharpener review</a>, the Chef&#8217;sChoice &#8211; 1520, on its 15 degree setting.</p>
<p>We also used fine-grained ceramic stones on the Spyderco &#8211; Sharpmaker to deburr and polish the edges after sharpening. We stropped the edges occasionally with a chromium oxide-loaded leather paddle to see how easy it was to keep an ultra-sharp edge on each steel.</p>
<p>We checked sharpness again after our cutting sessions to see which steels have the best edge retention. The VG-10 on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000UAPQGS/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tojiro &#8211; DP Gyuto</a> definitely lived up to its reputation as full-strength Japanese steel, both because of how long the edge lasts and because of how much longer it took to sharpen.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079S3G9KZ/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BD1N steel in the Nexus</a> is a strong performer in a different way: easier to sharpen, slightly less wear resistant. We&#8217;re not able to provide a controlled edge retention test, but we think it&#8217;s well worth a little bit less wear resistance to get easier sharpening.</p>
<p>After our edge stability and repair tests, the Nexus earned our pick for the best real-world performance, but if you&#8217;re cutting into something more abrasive that wears the edge instead of rolling it, you may prefer the VG-10 steel in the Tojiro or Greater Goods knives.</p>
[table id=231 /]
<h3 id="stability-test">Edge stability</h3>
<p>A test of wear resistance is common among knife enthusiasts looking to sort out which steels and heat treatments are superior for cutting abrasive material like cardboard or rope. For a veggie slicer, though, abrasive wear isn&#8217;t the primary reason your edge goes away: Instead, pressing the edge into the cutting board (not to mention bone or glass serving dishes) rolls over or chips away the micron-thick edge.</p>
<p>Steel is hardened by heat treatment that changes the structure on a molecular level. When steel is hard, it will still flex just as much as soft steel of the same thickness. (Springs are very hard, but also very thin.) The opposite of hardness is not flexibility, but toughness, more precisely called ductility.</p>
<p>A ductile or tough blade will spring back and forth up to a point, but when you flex it past what its strength can handle a tough blade will permanently bend instead of snapping. Tough steel can even be bent back to shape, though it is weakened. <strong>Put another way, hard steel can stand up to slightly more pressure on the edge than soft steel before it&#8217;s damaged, but when you push it past the limit harder steel will be more likely to chip.</strong></p>
<p>A fine grain in the molecular structure of the steel allows a thin edge to be hard (so it resists that bending or &#8220;rolling&#8221; sideways when pushed to the limit) without being brittle. Metallurgist Roman Landes <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=sko_PQAACAAJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popularized the term &#8220;edge stability&#8221; in his research</a> to determine which steels are best at holding a thin edge.</p>
<p>Whatever knife you settle on, choosing an edge angle when sharpening that&#8217;s appropriate for what you&#8217;re cutting is crucial to keeping your knife sharp. Hard material like bone requires a higher edge angle than raw fish does. If you can get a hard-yet-stable steel that doesn&#8217;t chip on the materials you&#8217;re cutting, though, you can make the edge thinner.</p>
<p>You can measure hardness with the Rockwell test, where a calibrated instrument presses a diamond tip into the steel. It&#8217;s tricky, though, to get a consistent reading on thin, wedge-shaped blades (and impossible on laminated blades with soft outer layers). We looked for another test that would directly measure the ability of a knife edge to withstand abuse.</p>
<p>We consulted with metallurgist <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Larrin Thomas</a> to design a test, inspired by Landes&#8217;s methods, that would show differences in the ways our knives resist both rolling and chipping. Larrin is working on his own set of tests for comparing steels, but he suggested adapting the &#8220;brass rod test&#8221; popularized by bladesmiths like the late Wayne Goddard.</p>

<p>Our test uses a steel rod held by one end at a fixed distance above the edge of a table; the knives were clamped to the table so that the rod rested on the edge at a 30-degree angle. We experimented with weights to find the limits of representative steels. <strong>At 15 pounds of weight hanging from the 30-degree rod, soft steels bent into a divot, while brittle steels (like a sample of the ultra-wear-resistant CPM-S90V alloy from one of our tester&#8217;s utility knives) broke away in a pretty serious chip.</strong></p>
<p>We took a representative set of our kitchen knives in the different steels (and from different price levels) and thinned out the edge to a uniform 12 degrees per side. This is a more acute edge than any commercial sharpening device will make, but it&#8217;s a good benchmark for what you can get when hand-sharpening to maximize slicing ability.</p>
<p>The results are translated to an out-of-five scale in our chart, but we measured each deformation with calipers and again by measuring the width in a macro photograph.</p>
<p>The harder blades made from high-carbon alloys like AUS-8, BD1N and VG-10 were the most resilient in this test, with the smallest deflections from the rod pressing against the edge. This should translate well into resistance to the kind of damage your knife gets from bones, plates and scraping against the cutting board.</p>
<p>We were surprised not to see any damage in the form of chips in this test, since in hard-but-tough tool steels like CPM-M4 (a popular pick for &#8220;blade sport&#8221; cutting competitions against rope and wood) we had already seen minor chipping when we set up the controls for the test. These kitchen knives, even the ones on the harder end of the scale, are probably tempered specifically to resist chipping.</p>
<p>The softer German-style knives all bent over pretty severely in this test, with bent sections averaging at more than 1 mm. This means that a 12-degree edge (which is close to the factory setting for many of these knives) is probably too acute for general-purpose use with these knives. Our test is quite extreme compared to slicing onions, but it&#8217;s a real test of relative strength.</p>
<p>The best score was from the Nexus at only 0.45 mm of damage, and the Tojiro close behind at 0.50 mm. These edges have enough strength that you could sharpen to an even more acute edge if you want razor-blade levels of slicing performance. (<a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-straight-razor/">The straight razors we&#8217;ve reviewed</a> go as low as 7 degrees, which is definitely too thin an edge for these knives.)</p>
<h3>Sharpening and repair</h3>
<p>After testing and photographing the deformations in the knife edges, we ran them across a carbide pull-through sharpening device (the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NB5EGEW/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brod &amp; Taylor &#8211; Classic</a>) to see which steels are easy to repair. This process straightens out the deformation from our test, but only if the thin steel edge is ductile (or &#8220;tough&#8221;) enough.</p>
<p>The softer German steel in most knives is tempered enough that it reshapes easily with the Brod &amp; Taylor or a steel &#8220;honing&#8221; rod. Of the harder blades (which aren&#8217;t typically sharpened in this fashion), the finer grain in the AUS-8 steel from Misono and the BD1N steel from Nexus also survived realigning to a straight edge. With the more wear-resistant VG-10 blades from Tojiro and Greater Goods, when we sliced some phone book paper after the repair procedure, small chips were easy to feel.</p>

<p>If you want to use waterstones for sharpening, an edge that resists wearing away against your cutting board and an edge that&#8217;s easy to sharpen have basically opposite qualities. VG-10 takes more work to sharpen than these other steels, and it&#8217;s more fragile, but it&#8217;ll hold that edge for longer. VG-10 isn&#8217;t as difficult to work with as some crazy-carbide-content alloys used in high-end pocket knives, but still, forget about maintaining it with just a steel.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re ready to invest in a set of fast-cutting water stones for freehand sharpening, or <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-knife-sharpener/">a powered sharpening device like our pick for best sharpener</a>, VG-10 is a great steel. The hardness we saw in these tests hasn&#8217;t lead to fragility you should worry about. But, if you want something that you can maintain for months with just a honing rod or a strop, a tougher steel will definitely be a better pick.</p>
<p>The Nexus uses new BD1N steel, which is a great compromise. This knife should resist chipping and other severe edge damage much better than VG-10. It can be maintained with a honing steel, but we still think a sharpener like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G8R4XSW/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spyderco Sharpmaker</a> is a good idea for keeping the edge in tip-top shape.</p>
<h3>Stain resistance</h3>
<p>We smeared each of the knives with lemon juice and mustard, and after we cleaned the knives a day later, there was no staining or etching left behind. These steels are all have enough chromium in the mix to meet the classic &#8220;stainless&#8221; definiton, so it&#8217;s not a surprising result.</p>

<p>If you want a knife that can hold a sharp edge for longer but is still easy to sharpen, look no further than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079S3G9KZ/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nexus &#8211; BD1N 8&#8243; Chef&#8217;s Knife</a>. This is a knife designed and manufactured exclusively for CutleryandMore.com. While there are a few other blades on the market made with similar specs, this one comes in at about half the price.</p>
<p>The accepted wisdom in cutlery design has always been that you can only have hard or tough knives, not both. The Nexus doesn&#8217;t do anything magical — there are limits to how much abuse this knife can take, and it won&#8217;t hold its edge forever — but this knife will require less work to maintain in the long run, and for a home cook that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>
<p>The important distinction this knife achieves with its BD1N steel is that you get great edge stability (it won&#8217;t blunt as quickly from slamming into a cutting board or hitting a bone) while also being fairly easy to sharpen. The VG-10 steel used in Tojiro&#8217;s fan-favorite DP series is also impressively resilient, but it takes more work to sharpen when it eventually wears down.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re accustomed to using a &#8220;honing&#8221; steel with your knives, the Nexus will actually let you carry on to a certain extent without damaging the edge the way you would most wear-resistant Japanese knives. You&#8217;re still better off using a waterstone or even an <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-knife-sharpener/">electric sharpener</a> for maintenance, but if you see rolled-over divots in the edge, the Nexus will tolerate repair strokes to reset the edge.</p>

It wins on all counts. There are some finishing flaws that reveal the price point, but the hard-yet-tough BD1N steel is exactly what we were hoping for. It's a good compromise between thin and beefy, and it's easy to take care of.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079S3G9KZ/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The handle of the Nexus is made from G-10, the same fiberglass-reinforced resin that circuit boards are cut from. This stuff is basically indestructible unless you hit it hard enough to crack it. We don’t recommend washing any knife in the dishwasher, but this material will stand up to that abuse as well as any other handle.</p>
<h3>What about flaws?</h3>
<p>There are a few reasons you might not like the Nexus, and they&#8217;re considerations you should take seriously.</p>

<p>First, the knife we bought had an obvious blemish along the spine that probably came from a slip when someone was &#8220;crowning&#8221; that edge with a nice, smooth rounded finish. <strong>This is a forgivable blemish on a $60 knife, but if you get one with a mark like this you could probably get it exchanged.</strong> We should note that other reviews are quite favorable regarding finish quality.</p>
<p>Second, the handle isn&#8217;t our favorite. It&#8217;s rounded and polished, which isn&#8217;t a bad thing, but the tapered shape doesn&#8217;t always lend itself to a secure grip. Even if you&#8217;re a pinch-grip acolyte who cares more about the bolster than the handle, the lack of meat at the front half of the handle feels less comfortable for extended use than many of the others we tested.</p>
<p>Finally, this blade feels even thinner than it actually is. We were surprised when we checked and found that the spine thickness is greater than that on the Greater Goods &#8211; 0556; it feels more whippy when you&#8217;re trying to <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/video/jacques-p%C3%A9pin-peeling-crushing-and-chopping-garlic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smash garlic into a paste the way you remember Jacques Pépin doing it</a>. This feeling mostly comes from the narrow transition area right in front of the handle, typical for a &#8220;yo-gyuto&#8221; East-meets-West handle style.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079S3G9KZ/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nexus &#8211; BD1N</a> is an innovative and affordable knife that stands out from the pack.</li>
<li>A few scuffs mar an otherwise excellent finish.</li>
<li>This is a new blade steel that keeps an extra-fine edge without being fragile.</li>
<li>G-10 handle material will withstand anything, though the polished finish is a bit slippery.</li>
<li>The weight and grind are a good compromise; neither a clunky beater nor a fragile laser.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L2I4SM4/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greater Goods &#8211; Nourish 0556 Japanese Damascus Steel 8&#8243; Chef&#8217;s Knife</a> is a budget-friendly knife made to match all the specs and features that used to be exclusive to high-end Japanese cutlery.</p>
<p>Pattern-welded steel wrapped around the VG-10 core doesn&#8217;t cut any differently or make it a better tool, but it&#8217;s a distinctive look some people love. <strong>The consistent finish overall is also notable at this price, with no grinder marks or scuffs showing anywhere.</strong> The wood-grain pattern of the steel layers will also hide scratches better than a plain, polished blade, but the &#8220;road&#8221; of core steel next to the edge has been polished to a mirror finish. It&#8217;s only an imitation of traditional Japanese craftsmanship, but it looks very impressive.</p>
<p>What makes this cut better than an average chef&#8217;s knife is that hard, wear-resistant core. This is the same Hitachi VG-10 steel that&#8217;s used by Miyabi, Shun and other better-known Japanese factories in their top-shelf knives. VG-10 has enough carbon that it can get very hard, and alloying elements like vanadium help it resist wearing down for longer than simpler steels.</p>
<p>If you like knives that are light and nimble, this isn&#8217;t a top pick. At 8.6 ounces, it&#8217;s the second-heaviest knife we tested, and the balance point is more than a half-inch behind the bolster. It&#8217;s not unwieldy, and one tester found the weight reassuring, but if you&#8217;re spending long days in the kitchen a blade-heavy design will usually make work easier.</p>
<p>The handle design is deliberately modern, rather than mimicking a classic shape, but it works very well. Unlike some knives, the handle isn&#8217;t contoured in an awkward way; there&#8217;s a gentle taper to the rounded-square cross section. The handle material is polyoxymethylene (POM) plastic  — not exactly high-end, but it&#8217;s a reliable, durable choice that serves very well on quite a few more expensive knives.</p>
<p>Greater Goods chose a balanced blade grind and a rounded edge profile for this knife, and that means it&#8217;s a versatile kitchen tool. It won&#8217;t slide through tomatoes quite as easily, but it also feels less flimsy than the Misono, Tojiro and Nexus knives. It&#8217;s one-thousandth of an inch thinner behind the edge than the Victorinox, with the same thickness at the spine.</p>

<p><strong>As good as all of those specs are on paper, using steel from Japan isn&#8217;t the same thing as having Japanese mastery in heat-treating.</strong> This blade had 0.7 mm divots after our edge stability tests, compared to the 0.5 mm dents that Tojiro allowed with the same steel.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s still well above the soft German steels at over 1.0 mm, but we&#8217;ll speculate that the Chinese factory is deliberately making it softer than the Japanese like it. Sadly, running a conventional hardness test is impossible: The standard Rockwell hardness tester pushes a diamond point into the side of a flat piece of steel, and the other steel layers on the sides of these knives would make that measurement meaningless.</p>
<p>We wish that Greater Goods had tried to get a harder heat treatment instead of spending on the pattern-welded steel and polishing. All things considered, though, it&#8217;ll hold an edge for longer than any other knife we&#8217;ve seen at this low price.</p>
<p>A downside to VG-10 is that you can&#8217;t really bring back a damaged edge with a honing steel the way you can with a softer edge. VG-10 will just make a ragged razor-ribbon at the edge when you try to burnish it.</p>
<p>Instead, you&#8217;re much better off sticking with abrasive sharpening: Waterstones are the traditional choice, but a motorized pull-through sharpener that uses abrasive wheels (like our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-knife-sharpener/">top knife sharpener picks</a>) also works quite well. Make sure to use a sharpener with a 15-degree edge angle, and put masking or packing tape on the sides of the blade to prevent scratching the decorative finish.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re extra-diligent about knife care, the Spyderco Sharpmaker is a great choice for weekly touch-ups and requires less of a learning curve than benchtop stones. That said, you&#8217;d definitely want to buy the optional coarser-grade diamond or CBN abrasive rods for repair sharpening if you manage to chip a VG-10 knife; you&#8217;d be sharpening for a very long time with the included medium-grit stones.</p>
<p>The fact that this knife includes a well-designed magnetic mounting puck also means this kit has everything you need to outfit a minimalist kitchen. The versatility of the blade style, comfortable handle and low price make this knife an easy recommendation.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000UAPQGS/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tojiro &#8211; DP Gyuto</a> is a perennial favorite among the kitchen knife enthusiasts on the web. A few years ago this knife was even less expensive, but mainstream popularity has brought the price up and made it less of a standout value. The popularity isn&#8217;t all negative, though, since this knife is easy to find.</p>
<p>Tojiro tied for the thinnest knife we tested, just 0.012&#8243; behind the edge. The factory edge was one of the sharpest we tested, and it slices both soft and hard vegetables very well.</p>
<p>The Tojiro isn&#8217;t going to impress anyone next to a Shigefusa or other hand-finished custom knife, but it has no major flaws. Tojiro only does the bare minimum to smooth rough edges and make the handle comfortable, but it&#8217;s a solid version of the classic East-meets-West design. The heel of the blade is left as a sharp 90-degree corner, which some people prefer, but it&#8217;s also easy to round off on a sharpening stone if you&#8217;re worried about accidentally snagging it on something.</p>
<p>Tojiro doesn&#8217;t say what the handle is made from. It seems to be some kind of layered composite like Micarta, and the very slightly raised edges on the rivets mean it&#8217;s probably a tiny bit less stable during humidity changes than the G-10 material used on the Nexus.</p>

Hard VG-10 steel gives you a long-lasting edge if you take care of it, and it's extra-thin for easy slicing. The soft layers on the side are easy to scuff, though.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000UAPQGS/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If there&#8217;s a downside to the Tojiro, it&#8217;s maintenance. <b>The VG-10 steel has alloy elements that resist wear, which means you won&#8217;t have to sharpen it as frequently, but you&#8217;re going to have to work harder to sharpen it when that time comes.</b> There are plenty of solutions on the market to getting this blade back to a keen edge, like <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-knife-sharpener/">our favorite electric knife sharpener</a>, but if you want to take a shot at hand-sharpening with a waterstone it&#8217;s just that much more work than the other knives we tested.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using the Tojiro in the kind of kitchen where people are sometimes cutting against ceramics and metal, you&#8217;re going to be spending even more time sharpening a blade like this. The Nexus resists damage a tiny bit better and is easier to repair.</p>

<p>The other downside to Tojiro&#8217;s steel choice is that they layer a softer steel on either side of the extra-hard core. This looks kind of neat, but that softer steel is vulnerable to scratches. If you&#8217;re using a magnetic knife bar or an electric sharpener, be prepared to see scratches and &#8220;snail-trail&#8221; marks.</p>
<p>Like the Nexus, this is a blade that&#8217;s too thin for some jobs; it&#8217;s a symmetrical edge grind, but it&#8217;s a refined slicer more than than a work-horse chopper. If you&#8217;re accustomed to full-bellied chef&#8217;s knives for rocking up and down on the cutting board, this shape will take some getting used to.</p>
<p>The price is also less of a bargain than we&#8217;d like. If you&#8217;re chasing Japanese-style slicing performance, this is probably still the best place to get it, but the Greater Goods will be a more comfortable knife for many home cooks at a much better price.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000UAPQGS/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tojiro &#8211; DP</a> is a great pick for a first Japanese-style blade.</li>
<li>This is an excellent blade for careful work, but less forgiving than our top pick if you&#8217;re enthusiastic about chopping.</li>
<li>The hard VG-10 edge steel is sandwiched between soft side layers, and they scuff easily.</li>
<li>Other Japanese knives can be had at a better value, but this model is easy to find.</li>

<p>Mercer is one of the most popular knife brands in culinary schools, mostly because they sell prepackaged kits that make one-stop shopping easy and affordable for students. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002R1CGV6/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Renaissance Chef&#8217;s knife</a> is Mercer&#8217;s full-tang, half-bolster styling, with a look and construction quality that matches the Classic series from Wüsthof but at a significantly lower price.</p>

<p>Mercer gets a bad rap among enthusiasts who prefer the hard steel of Japanese knives, but if you&#8217;re looking for a softer, easy-to-maintain knife anyhow, the Renaissance keeps up with the best sub-$100 knives from the European manufacturers.</p>
<p>Chef Hendricksen gave the low-cost Mercer knives his vote for a great way to save money and build a set that focuses on your needs: &#8220;I’ve used all sorts of knives. I have been very happy with the Mercer tools. Chefs often have an advantage over others where they can talk to the reps from the knife companies about the intended use and preferences. The reps know that marketing will only last so long and the tools need to do the job. Remember that knives are tools and it’s the cook that makes the food.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Also best knife set for the money: Mercer</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MRU46DS/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mercer&#8217;s basic block set</a> is attractive and a good value if you actually want every knife it includes. Most of the knives we included in this roundup are available in sets, but Mercer has the widest range of options and the best price for a starter set.</p>

If you want to mix-and-match your knives, the Nexus pair might be a perfect place to start, but if you want to build a full block with the same styles, Mercer offers a better value.</p>

The worst thing about block sets is that they give you an excuse to just pull out a different knife, even a knife that&#8217;s badly suited to the task at hand, because you&#8217;ve already been using your favorite knife and it&#8217;s dirty. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with having multiple tools that can do the same job, but most of us don&#8217;t need a three-inch, five-inch and six-inch knife in the same set. Fortunately, Mercer makes it easy for you to buy their knives one at a time, still for a great price.</p>
<p>One of our knife experts, Dave Martell, sums up knife blocks like this: &#8220;I say put your money into a few really nice knives vs. a whole bunch of mediocre ones.&#8221; Most people will be served best by a simple set with the 8&#8243; chef&#8217;s knife (or the 10&#8243; if you&#8217;ve got room on your cutting board), along with a paring knife and a 10&#8243; or longer serrated bread knife. Martell&#8217;s personal standards for &#8220;really nice&#8221; are probably different than most of ours, but the principle applies if your budget is $50 or $1,000.</p>
<p>Martell also recommended getting a good non-serrated slicing knife for carving, while culinary instructors like Chef Hendricksen like to see a boning knife as a part of a first set. Being able to get knives that fit the way you cook is key.</p>
<p><strong>The option to buy knives that are longer than eight inches is the best reason not to buy a knife set: Manufacturers only started making chef&#8217;s knives, slicers and bread knives in eight-inch lengths because it&#8217;s so much cheaper to make (and ship) a knife block if it only needs to hold eight-inch knives.</strong> The bread knife is the big let-down in the Renaissance block set: it&#8217;s only 8 inches. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016BRBYBE/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Mercer &#8211; Millennia bread knife</a> doesn&#8217;t have a matching handle, but for sawing through a thick loaf the longer 10-inch edge really does help.</p>
<p>One perk of buying one at a time is that you can pick and choose from other manufacturers, too. You could combine Mercer&#8217;s bread knife with the Nexus for chopping veggies and a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003VME12M/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tojiro Yanagiba</a> for slicing, for example. But if you want a matched set you can still add all the essentials and a few specialty tools from the Mercer &#8211; Renaissance line without spending $300+ like you would with more recognizable brands.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t get your knife set with a block, where will you store them? Wall-mounted magnetic knife storage is an option that doesn&#8217;t take up counter space, and can hold basically any combination of knives you prefer. We&#8217;ve bought <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016ISHAC8/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this bar from Modern Innovations</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DCBTEZK/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this set with hooks from Unique Effects</a>. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JLCHFTQ/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">This walnut strip from Kurouto</a> is also a good buy &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t have an ugly logo on the front the way some wooden strips do.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002R1CGV6/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mercer &#8211; Renaissance</a> knives perform just as well as the big German brands at one third the price.</li>
<li>The fit and finish on the chef and paring knives is perfect.</li>
<li>Mercer&#8217;s softer steel and thicker edges are easy to maintain, though not as impressive as thinner knives.</li>
<li>If you want a matched set, the Renaissance series is easy to get with just the pieces you need.</li>
</ul>

Misono is one of the mainstays of knifemaking in Seki, Japan. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XT4GJO/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Misono Molybdenum series</a> (named for the notable alloying element in the steel) is their least-expensive line, but it&#8217;s finished with the same attention to detail as their more expensive models.</p>
<p>This knife performed very well in our slicing and edge stability tests. <strong>If you&#8217;re looking for an extra-thin blade, this one won&#8217;t disappoint.</strong> The AUS-8 steel is a popular choice for Japanese cutlery; it’s not as wear-resistant as the VG-10 in the Tojiro, but that also means it&#8217;s easier to sharpen.</p>

If you're looking for something elegant, Misono executes this laser-thin slicer very well.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XT4GJO/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>This is another Japanese blade with a sharp corner at the heel; if you&#8217;re not expecting a knife to have a sharp edge there, be careful not to catch it on towels when drying. It&#8217;s quite easy to round the corner on a cheap sharpening stone if you&#8217;re of the opinion that it shouldn&#8217;t be so pointy.</p>
<p>The one caveat with this knife (and many other Japanese knives) is that it&#8217;s sharpened to an asymmetrical edge: We measured 17 degrees on the left side, 25 degrees on the right. <strong>This means it will &#8220;steer&#8221; slightly to the right if you try to make a long, smooth push-cut, kind of like the way an airplane wing creates lift when slicing through the air.</strong> For careful chopping and slicing most food, it works well, but it made some cuts, like peeling potatoes, far more difficult.</p>

Mercer makes <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000PS2XI4/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">an entire line of Millennia knives</a> for students, commercial kitchens and anyone else who just needs a cheap knife that&#8217;s easy to maintain. We&#8217;re not going to soften our critique of this knife — the price is low for a reason. These knives use bottom-of-the-barrel X30Cr13 steel that&#8217;s even cheaper than the X50CrMoV15 steel used by the big names in mass-produced knives. About the best thing that can be said about this steel is that it&#8217;s very easy to sharpen.</p>
<p><strong>That said, the difference between this $15 knife and the OXO or IKEA knife is that it&#8217;s actually comfortable to use.</strong> The edge is just as thin as the Wüsthof and Victorinox, so this a great slicer when it&#8217;s fresh off the sharpener. For slicing through raw yams, this budget-friendly knife actually has top slicing performance.</p>

They're not glamorous, but if you keep them sharp they do their job well.

<p>The handle on the Millennia is both cushioned and grippy. Pinching the textured sides of the bolster area isn&#8217;t quite the same as pinching the sides of the blade in a chef&#8217;s pinch-grip, but it&#8217;s right at the balance point and gives good control while remaining comfortable. It&#8217;s a much easier handle to get used to than the Wüsthof, and this one won&#8217;t get in the way when sharpening.</p>

<h3>Victorinox &#8211; Fibrox</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008M5U1C2/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fibrox chef&#8217;s knife</a> has topped budget-knife lists for as long as we can remember, and it&#8217;s a nice knife that knows how to find its place in a busy kitchen.</p>
<p>If the Fibrox were as cheap as it used to be, it would have ranked higher, but Victorinox has started enforcing a &#8220;minimum advertised price&#8221; policy with online retailers. <strong>When you can easily buy the Mercer &#8211; Renaissance in the same steel with a nicer full-tang handle and bolster for $10 less, it&#8217;s hard to say that the Victorinox is a good value, let alone a bargain.</strong></p>
<p>Made from the same plain old X50CrMoV15 steel that&#8217;s used by the rest of the European cutlery industry, about the only thing that&#8217;s remarkable about this knife is the grip. The Fibrox material feels grippy and soft without feeling sticky like rubber or silicone grips. The molded bolster is still too far forward for easy use with an electric sharpener, but it&#8217;s not as bad as the Wüsthof.</p>
<h3>Wüsthof &#8211; Pro Cook&#8217;s Knife</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008GRUNOC/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wüsthof &#8211; Pro Cook&#8217;s Knife</a> is one of the more unique designs in the budget bracket. The belly radius of the edge is fuller than most, which makes it good for rock-chopping. The blade is sharpened well and ground to a nice, thin edge, and there&#8217;s a buffed wavy-mirror polish on the sides of the blade that give it a bit of distinction.</p>
<p>The handle is a grippy, rubbery material that&#8217;s molded to stay in your hand no matter what. That said, the molded bolster gets in the way if you prefer a pinch-grip, and it prevents sharpening all the way to the heel if you&#8217;re using an electric sharpener.</p>
<p>Like the Victorinox, this could be a good budget pick if it were actually budget-priced. When we bought our test lineup it was twice as expensive as the Mercer &#8211; Millennia, and only $7 less than the traditional looks and construction of the Mercer &#8211; Renaissance. If you find one on sale for $20, it&#8217;s a good utilitarian knife, but don&#8217;t expect more than that.</p>
<h3>Tramontina &#8211; Pro Chef&#8217;s Knife</h3>
<p>Tramontina makes their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073BYNFKV/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pro Chef&#8217;s knife</a> with a drop-forge process just like all the big-name manufacturers used to do fifty years ago. These methods and styling have largely disappeared from Germany as automation has made stamping and welding cheaper (and cleaner) than forging, but the giant old-world presses are still pounding away in Brazil.</p>
<p>This is the thickest, heaviest knife we tested. The blade is actually ground thinner behind the edge than the other Euro-style knives from Wüsthof, Victorinox or Mercer, but the spine is thick and the full bolster brings the balance point almost an inch toward the handle side. The out-of the box sharpening was below-average, though this steel is as easy to sharpen as any you&#8217;ll find.</p>
<p>If you like having a full bolster (for… opening cans?) and a heavy knife for smashing through vegetables, this isn&#8217;t a bad choice. The steel is finished just a touch harder than the other Euro-style knives, which was a nice surprise, but the fit and finish is not good enough to earn it a recommended pick. At this end of the price range, we still think most people will prefer the Mercer &#8211; Renaissance.</p>
<h3>OXO &#8211; Good Grips Pro</h3>
<p>We like many OXO products, but their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019ZP6VPS/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Good Grips &#8211; Pro Chef&#8217;s knife</a> is a great example of form before function. All of the specs are there: full tang, half-bolster, quality German steel and a profile that&#8217;s good for rock-chopping. Despite the smooth molded handle and flawless finish, though, the crisp spine and bolster edges just aren&#8217;t comfortable in extended use.</p>
<p>Worse still, the OXO has the thickest blade of any we tested. Slicing yams, even after re-sharpening the edge, was just too much work. The one positive quality of this blade is that the thick edge angle helps keep veggies from sticking to the face of the blade when making thin slices of cucumber and potato.</p>
<h3>IKEA &#8211; 365+</h3>
<p>The new <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10283522/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA 365+ chef&#8217;s knife</a> is like many IKEA products: a good attempt that isn&#8217;t executed as well as it could have been. We&#8217;d heard <a href="https://en.ikea-club.org/item/90131068.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good things about a past IKEA knife</a>, but the new 365+ just tries to look like a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005OL44/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Global G2</a> without actually feeling good in the hand.</p>
<p>Sadly, the IKEA handle is just too narrow to be comfortable over extended cutting sessions. Worse, there was a telltale brown scorch mark near the tip, evidence that someone overheated the edge when sharpening. The edge is thick, too, so slicing performance was subpar.</p>
<p>The premise of a $20 one-piece knife in &#8220;molybdenum-vanadium&#8221; stainless made us hopeful, but whoever IKEA chose to make this knife for them did not follow through. If you like stainless handles and want to try thinning out this blade on a waterstone, at least it wouldn&#8217;t be an expensive experiment.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>A kitchen knife is a tool that can become an extension of your hand, turning raw ingredients on a cutting board into food that you can enjoy cooking. Knife buying doesn&#8217;t have to be complicated, but finding a good balance of cost, easy maintenance and materials that will hold a sharper edge for longer can really turn your kitchen chef&#8217;s knife from a tool you loathe into a tool you love.</p>
<p>We set a fairly low budget for our lineup in this review, since most people will be much better served spending more on a sharpening tool than on a high-end knife that&#8217;s still going to become dull after a month of use.  Check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-knife-sharpener/">knife sharpener review</a> for solutions that will keep your blades at peak performance.</p>
<p>We really love the performance of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079S3G9KZ/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nexus 8&#8243; Chef&#8217;s knife</a>, and we think it&#8217;s an excellent buy. In a unique feat, the innovative use of a brand-new steel means this edge is both durable and easy to sharpen. <strong>The handle materials are bomb-proof, and the blade is ground to a high-performance slicing edge.</strong></p>
<p>For those of us who don&#8217;t need more than a solid, versatile knife to use in a small kitchen, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L2I4SM4/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greater Goods &#8211; Nourish 0556</a> is an even better value. It&#8217;s made from top-tier Japanese steel, but the weight and handle design help it feel comfortable and secure even in novice hands. It&#8217;s a great-looking blade at a great price, and the included magnetic mounting stud makes this a one-stop purchase for a first step into better knife skills.</p>
<p>Finally, if you want a conventional-looking knife with a German-style blade, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002R1CGV6/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mercer &#8211; Renaissance</a> is a chef&#8217;s knife that will serve you just as well as it has served thousands of culinary students across the country. Better still, you can easily build a set of matching kitchen knives from Mercer&#8217;s catalog, and expand your collection as you need it without being shackled to a clunky, dirty knife block like most overpriced knife sets.</p>

The new nitrogen-alloyed steel is basically perfect for kitchen use, with a balance of toughness and hardness. The handle and finishing aren't perfect, but the sharpening, materials and price are all spot-on. You'll have to spend $130 or more to find a knife that can really compete with the Nexus.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079S3G9KZ/?tag=ybdknife-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>

				<description><![CDATA[After using five of the best stand mixers on the market to make pizza crust, cookie dough and cakes, we've found that the KitchenAid - KSM150PSWH is the clear winner. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e subjected five highly rated stand mixers to rigorous testing — from making light-as-air sponge cake batter to perfectly kneaded pizza dough — and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005UP2K/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KSM150P</a> performed the best. It’s a bit expensive, but if you’re a frequent baker, you may consider it a worthy investment. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000308BUI/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; Eclectrics</a> has a sturdy and functional design that’s similar to the KitchenAid, but at $100 less, it’s a more affordable stand mixer.</p>

<h2 id="selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>If you Google “stand mixer,” you’ll find many websites and videos promoting the best one you should buy. However, when you take a closer look, you’ll see that an overwhelming majority don’t actually take the time to test the product, or if they do, test methods are vague.</p>
<p>We found two exceptions in our initial phase of research: The Wirecutter and America’s Test Kitchen’s video review. America’s Test Kitchen’s test methods are solid, but the review is five years old so the recommendations may no longer be valid. We then turned to Amazon, where KitchenAid stand mixers reign supreme, and read through many of the thousands of reviews (KitchenAid alone has over 9,000).</p>
<p>KitchenAid has many versions of stand mixers that are rated extremely high overall by consumers. Depending on the model (and color), they range between $200–$500. But who are KitchenAid’s competitors? There aren’t many.</p>
<p>We chose to focus on finding stand mixers with an affordable price, the convenient tilt-head design, a mixing bowl with a substantial 4.5 to 5-quart capacity and high customer esteem.  Once we had our list, we cross-referenced the stand mixers with the manufacturers’ websites to ensure we tested the most recent model.</p>

<h2 id="who">Who needs a stand mixer?</h2>
<p>If cupcakes, sugar cookies and cake mixes are the extent of your baking repertoire, then you probably just need a hand mixer and a sturdy mixing bowl. But if you’re a more frequent baker of yeast breads, sponge cakes, chunky cookies, fluffy meringues and pizzas, then a heavy-duty stand mixer has the power and size to substantially decrease your time and effort.</p>
<p>While a hand mixer is a light and portable appliance, most stand mixers require kitchen counter space. Some have evolved to become slightly more compact, but they’re still pretty tall (12 to 14 inches) and hefty (up to 26 pounds), which makes storing them in a kitchen cabinet difficult if not impossible.</p>
<p>Another consideration is price. You can buy a very good hand mixer for about $30, but a well-built stand mixer is much more expensive. There are certainly cheaper models to choose from (and we tested one — the Cheftronic &#8211; SM986), but many Amazon reviewers claim that the motors and attachments of the cheaper mixers don’t hold up. If you can afford $300 and are committed to baking on a frequent basis, then a quality stand mixer is well worth it.</p>
<h2 id="important">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Professional vs. commercial: </b>Almost all stand mixers intended for home kitchens are marketed as &#8220;professional&#8221; grade. A commercial stand mixer is too large for a home kitchen and is used exclusively in restaurants and bakeries. It can also cost three or four times more than a professional mixer.</p>
<p><b>Planetary motion: </b>There are two types of stand mixers: planetary motion and spiral. Planetary motion refers to how the mixer’s attachment revolves — like a planet’s orbit — inside the fixed mixing bowl. Planetary motion mixers are designed for both home and commercial use. A spiral mixer, used exclusively in commercial kitchens for preparing large batches of dough, revolves the mixing bowl and hook attachment together.</p>
<p><b>Tilt-head vs. bowl-lift:</b> Many newer models of stand mixers have a tilt head — a button or lever loosens the mixer’s head so it can be lifted backward to accommodate easy removal of attachments and the mixing bowl. Older models have a “bowl lift” head in which a lever raises and lowers the mixing bowl. While bowl-lift stand mixers are heavier and sturdier, tilt-head mixers are lighter and more compact. It’s easier to add ingredients into a bowl-lift mixer, but it’s easier to clean and store a tilt-head mixer.</p>
<p><b>Mixing bowl shape and depth:</b> During our testing, we found the shape and depth of the mixing bowl to be crucial to the mixer’s efficacy. All of the mixing bowls we tested had a 4.5- to 5-quart capacity. Half of them had rounded bottoms, and with these, the mixer struggled to reach ingredients (such as egg whites and whipping cream). The better mixing bowls had a slight taper, which kept the wet ingredients contained in a compact pool that the attachments could reach and lift up.</p>
<p><b>Attachment length: </b>All stand mixers come with three attachments: a wire whisk, a mixing paddle and a dough hook. The length of attachments is of primary importance, since they need to reach the sides and bottom of the mixing bowl. Half the mixers — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005UP2K/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BEM800XL-Scraper-5-Quart-Die-Cast/dp/B003QI9HPW/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000308BUI/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach</a> — had attachments that easily incorporated ingredients with minimal or no scraping needed. The other mixers had attachments that were too short and not broad enough to incorporate ingredients without our stopping, scraping and re-starting.</p>
<p><b>Splatter shield: </b>We prefer a c-shaped splatter shield over an enclosed-ring splatter shield. A c-shape splatter shield, which slides into place on top of the mixing bowl, can be easily attached and removed without lifting the tilt head. An enclosed-ring splatter shield, however, must be attached to the mixer head before affixing or releasing the attachment and then lowered together onto the bowl.</p>
<p><b>Power: </b>A stand mixer should have at least 325 watts of power. However, a mixer with more wattage does not necessarily mean that it’s more efficient. The mixer’s motor must be precisely engineered to harness wattage to create adequate torque (the force needed to rotate an object), which is essential for kneading dough.</p>
<p>For example, the KitchenAid mixer has only 325 watts, but its excellent torque can knead pizza dough into a compact ball. The Cheftronic mixer has double the wattage, but it shook violently and struggled to incorporate the ingredients and knead the dough during our testing.</p>
<p><b>Speed levels: </b>The mixers we tested had six to twelve speed levels. There was minute differentiation between the mixers that had 12 speeds. In actuality, you probably just need five speed levels: a true low for incorporating flour or wet ingredients without splatter; a medium-low, medium and medium-high for combining ingredients; and a true high for aerating egg whites and whipping cream.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>

<p>We devised tests that worked the most commonly used functions of a stand mixer: creaming butter and sugar, blending cake batter, whipping egg whites and cream, blending cookie dough with mix-ins and mixing pizza dough.<br />
[table id=212 /]
<h3>Small-batch whipping</h3>
<p><b>Egg whites: </b>We began with small-batch whipping to test whether the mixer’s attachments could reach the bottom of the mixing bowl. For each mixer, we put two room-temperature egg whites into the bowl and started the mixer at its slowest speed. Once the egg whites began to foam, we gradually increased the speed to the highest setting and timed how long it took for the whites to stiffen to a meringue consistency — in other words, a consistency that would not plop out when we held the mixing bowl upside down.</p>
<p>The KitchenAid, Breville and Hamilton Beach whipped the egg whites to a meringue consistency in one minute.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart and Cheftronic just foamed the two egg whites because their whisks could not reach the bottom of the mixing bowls. However, once a third egg white was added, the whisks could at least reach enough of the egg white to pull it upwards and whisk it to froth.</p>
<p><b>Cream: </b>We poured one cup of chilled heavy cream into the bowl and began at the slowest speed, waiting until the cream frothed and then gradually increased to the highest speed. Results were similar to those of the egg white test. The KitchenAid, Breville and Hamilton Beach whipped thick whipped cream in one minute.</p>
<p>Because of their short whisks, Cuisinart and Cheftronic failed to whip one cup of cream. We added a second cup and both achieved fully whipped cream in about two minutes.</p>
<h3>Cake batter</h3>
<p>We used “The Great British Baking Show” judge <a href="https://www.bbc.com/food/recipes/mary_berrys_perfect_34317" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Berry’s recipe for genoise</a>, or sponge cake, which serves as the base for many types of iced cakes.</p>
<p>The recipe differs from other sponge cakes in that the eggs are not cooked over a double-boiler before adding them to the other ingredients. Instead, everything is blended together all at once, and to achieve a light and airy cake, the stand mixer must be able to evenly mix the ingredients while also whipping the eggs and creaming the butter into a smooth batter. If the mixer fails to do so, or if excess scraping of the bowl is required, then the cake won’t rise when baked.</p>
<p>The Breville and the Cheftronic have a silicon scraper on their paddle attachments. This nice addition worked well in scraping the sides of the bowl during blending so we didn’t need to stop, scrape and restart.</p>
<h3>Cookie dough</h3>
<p>We wanted a thick cookie dough with lots of mix-ins to test each mixer’s power and torque. <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/super-chunky-cookies-3362198" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This delicious recipe for super chunky cookies</a> allows you to add whatever you like to the dough. Our mix-ins included peanuts, chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, raisins and M&amp;Ms, which proved to be a challenge for the Cuisinart and Cheftronic. Their squat paddles simply couldn’t reach down to the bottom of their too-deep mixing bowls, so the ingredients had to be mixed by hand.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, we also had a bit of trouble with the KitchenAid and Breville. Although their motors breezed easily through the thick dough — even at the highest speed — there were small amounts of mix-ins left untouched at the bottom of the bowl. Only the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000308BUI/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach</a> was able to thoroughly blend the cookie dough and mix-ins together.</p>
<h3>Pizza dough</h3>
<p>The most challenging test for the stand mixers was the pizza dough. The mixer’s hook attachment must first blend the ingredients together and then knead them into a compact yet elastic ball. We used <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/pizza-dough-recipe-1914764" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a standard recipe for the pizza dough</a>, but we cut the proportions in half, which better suited the 4.5- to 5-quart capacity bowls. Even with the half batch, the usual culprits — Cuisinart and Cheftronic — failed to combine the ingredients and shook violently when the mixer kneaded the dough.</p>
<p>As an additional test — and something you really shouldn’t do at home — we increased the speed to the highest level during the kneading to see whether the motor gave out. The KitchenAid and Breville vibrated slightly, but they clearly were able to handle the dough at high speed. The Hamilton Beach shook rather ominously, but it kept right on kneading and seemed to hold out.</p>

<p>KitchenAid has been the leader in stand mixers for years. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005UP2K/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KSM150PSWH</a> is one of the popular Artisan Series tilt-head mixers and comes in a variety of sizes, styles and colors.</p>
<p>It’s slightly smaller and a bit more compact than KitchenAid’s other stand mixers, but it still isn’t ideal for storing in a cabinet because it weighs in at 25 pounds. That heft, however, keeps the all-metal mixer secure on the countertop even at the highest speed. Its 325-watt motor has enough power to plow through cookie and pizza dough without showing signs of strain, and it performs every task in minutes. As stand mixers go, it’s also quiet.</p>
<p>The KitchenAid is very easy to use. Its tilt head is locked and released with a lever on one side, and it tilts far back enough for easy insertion of attachments. The five-quart stainless steel mixing bowl locks firmly into place by turning it slightly clockwise. Lower the tilt head and you’re ready to go.</p>

It’s less expensive than previous KitchenAid models, and with the separately bought attachments, it can also roll out pasta, grind meat and spiralize vegetables.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005UP2K/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The KitchenAid has 10 speed levels, marked as Stir, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. They’re controlled with a side lever that clicks into place. For the odd-numbered speeds, you need to hold the control lever and gently guide it to the speed you want. There isn’t much differentiation between the odd- and even-numbered speeds. The even-numbered speeds are so well differentiated, however, you don’t really need the other five.</p>
<p>The mixing bowl is slightly tapered, so when you lower the attachments (nylon-coated paddle and dough hook, stainless steel wire whisk) you’ll notice immediately that each touches the bottom and sides of the bowl. For each of our recipes, we needed to do very little — and sometimes no — scraping to incorporate the ingredients.</p>
<p>The KitchenAid was the top performer in all of our tests. It smoothly creamed the butter and aerated the eggs to create an evenly blended cake batter, which baked light and airy. It had no problems blending the large amount of mix-ins into the thick cookie dough and it kneaded a perfect ball of pizza dough in five minutes. Since the mixer’s attachments touch the bottom of the mixing bowl, the wire whisk whipped the egg whites and cream to fluffy heights in one minute.</p>
<p>The KitchenAid stand mixer can really do anything, except perhaps wash your clothes. Its extraordinary design includes a hub on the mixer head into which a variety of (separately purchased) attachments can be plugged, such as a pasta maker, meat grinder, cheese shredder and even a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-spiralizer/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spiralizer</span></a>.</p>
<p>So although all KitchenAid stand mixers are on the pricey side, you’re getting much more for your money, since your mixer can be swiftly transformed into another kitchen appliance. (For the record, we’ve tested the pasta maker and the meat grinder, and they are excellent.)</p>
<p>Although KitchenAid’s warranty is only for one year, the Artisan stand mixer is so well-constructed that, if properly cared for, it will last for many years. We believe there isn’t a stand mixer on the market that can beat the KitchenAid &#8211; Artisan Series in quality or performance.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The KitchenAid &#8211; KSM150PSWH is sturdily constructed and has plenty of power to plow through thick cookie dough and pizza dough in minutes.</li>
<li>Its mixing bowl and attachments have been designed to work together for optimal mixing and blending with minimal scraping.</li>
<li>The KitchenAid &#8211; Artisan Series is very user-friendly, and it will have you baking like a pro straight out of the box.</li>

<p>Hamilton Beach really scores with this beautifully made stand mixer from its line of Eclectrics kitchen appliances. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000308BUI/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 63232</a> has many similar features that our top pick has, including its all-metal construction and (at this writing) it’s $120 cheaper. We’ve reviewed many Hamilton Beach products, and most have, sadly, been disappointing. However, their Eclectrics series stand mixer is top notch and nearly equally as good as the KitchenAid &#8211; Artisan.</p>
<p>Like the Artisan, the Hamilton Beach has the tapered mixing bowl that we find is most effective for blending small-batch ingredients. Indeed, it whipped two egg whites in a minute and a half to meringue consistency and one cup of cream into fluffy perfection in one minute.</p>
<p>Again, the Hamilton Beach’s efficacy is due to the length and width of the attachments (nylon-coated paddle and dough hook and stainless wire whisk), which reach the bottom and sides of the mixing bowl.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach has 400 watts, slightly more than the KitchenAid &#8211; Artisan, and its torque is just as good. It incorporated all the ingredients for the cookie dough and pizza dough well enough, but not without some vibration, especially at higher speeds.</p>

It has a couple of design quirks, like an inconvenient tilt-head release, but overall it’s well-made and durable and will last for years with frequent use.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000308BUI/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Hamilton Beach blended the cake batter in two minutes, and when baked, it was moist and firm with a good crumb. It was absolutely the best of all the cakes we made with the mixers. Despite the vibration at the middle speed, the mix-ins were fully incorporated into the cookie dough, and when baked, the cookies came out of the oven exactly the same as those we made with the KitchenAid.</p>
<p>The Eclectrics had a bit of trouble with the pizza dough. The machine shook when it was kneading and the dough took various forms during the kneading process, running up and down the hook as a cylinder, then an oval before forming a compact ball. However, when the kneading was completed, the dough was beautifully shiny, smooth and elastic; again, the best of the pizza doughs we made.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach has a few negatives that are not deal-breakers. First, the button for releasing the tilt head is located inconveniently beneath the base of the head and we had trouble finding it when the head was tilted back. Second, like the KitchenAid, speed levels are even-numbered — 2 through 12 — and there is almost no differentiation between them and the odd-numbered levels (not marked on the blender). Finally, its splatter guard is an enclosed-ring type that we find inconvenient to attach and remove.</p>
<p>Hamilton Beach has really stepped up to the plate to compete with KitchenAid. At $120 less, the Eclectrics stand mixer is an impressive and, we believe, long-lasting alternative for budget-conscious consumers.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Hamilton Beach &#8211; 63232 stand mixer has a similar mixing bowl and attachments to the KitchenAid &#8211; Artisan, but it’s $120 less expensive and an excellent alternative.</li>
<li>It performed just as well as our top pick and even bested the KitchenAid in our cake and pizza dough tests.</li>
<li>Despite a few minor flaws, the Hamilton Beach stand mixer is solidly constructed, well-designed and will last for years with frequent use.</li>

<p>Like most Breville products, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BEM800XL-Scraper-5-Quart-Die-Cast/dp/B003QI9HPW/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BEM800XL</a> stand mixer is beautifully designed. It’s a sleek machine with curved lines and a futuristic speed-control LED panel that lights up as levels are increased.</p>
<p>The Breville has lift-assist handles to raise and lower the tilt head, and its slightly tapered bowl easily locks into place. It has twelve speeds, labeled with a particular baking task, like fold/knead, light mix and aerate/whip. We tested all speeds, and it was one of the few mixers we tested that had a gradual increase between each speed level.</p>
<p>For such an attractive machine, we were surprised that it didn’t perform better. We found its pour shield most vexing. It’s c-shaped, but quite narrow and tricky to balance on top of the bowl. The pour spout clicks into the shield, which can only be done when the tilt head is lowered. Each time we tried to scrape the bowl and lifted the tilt head back, the shield popped off and the pour spout plopped into the batter or dough.</p>
<p>The Breville’s silicon-edged scraper paddle manages to scrape the sides of the bowl, but it’s too short and can’t reach the bottom of the bowl. The same flaw afflicts the wire whisk, which left a small pool of cream not whipped. The Breville failed the two-egg test — it just foamed the whites — but when we added a third egg white, it aerated them to a sturdy meringue texture in one minute.</p>
<p>The lower speeds don’t seem to be as effective as the higher speeds. The Breville struggled to incorporate the mix-ins into the cookie dough. Although it blended the pizza dough well enough, it couldn’t quite knead it until we increased the speed to medium-high. In fact, even at the highest speed, the Breville only slightly vibrated and gave no indication that the motor would fail.</p>
<p>It’s a very good stand mixer, but it’s slightly more expensive than the KitchenAid, which we believe to be superior to the Breville.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8EJ81Q/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cheftronic &#8211; SM986</a> is one of several relatively inexpensive stand mixers, ranging in price from $90 to $150. While it may seem like a bargain compared to the KitchenAid, you definitely get what you pay for in this case. It’s cheaply constructed; its entire casing is plastic. The attachments are short and stout and can’t reach the sides or bottom of the rounded stainless steel mixing bowl.</p>
<p>The tilt head is released by pushing down a lever, which could use a shot of WD40 in our opinion: it was so creaky, and if you don’t keep your hand on top of the head, it snaps back. Its annoying enclosed-ring splatter shield can only be removed by taking off the attachment first. Since we had to frequently scrape the mixing bowl, we needed to do this several times.</p>
<p>At 650 watts, the Cheftronic has double the wattage of the Cuisinart, but it’s a perfect example of a poorly made and exceedingly noisy motor that can’t efficiently harness the high wattage. There is almost no differentiation between its first three lower speeds, then it suddenly zooms into high speed at levels four through six.</p>
<p>The Cheftronic struggled mightily to combine the pizza ingredients, and during kneading, the entire mixer rocked back and forth rhythmically as the dough ball formed. It couldn’t handle the small-batch tests, and after we increased the egg whites and cream, it whipped both in four minutes and two minutes, respectively — much longer than the other stand mixers we tested.</p>
<p>The Cheftronic’s silver plastic model is priced at $150, but for $30 more, you could buy the far better Hamilton Beach &#8211; Eclectrics stand mixer instead.</p>

<p>We’re usually impressed with Cuisinart’s product line, but we weren’t with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-SM-50BC-Stand-Brushed-Chrome/dp/B01K2FQ4DE/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; SM50BC</a> stand mixer. It copies a few of the KitchenAid’s features, like a durable metal casing, easy-release tilt head, secure locking bowl and c-shaped splatter guard with generous pour spout.</p>
<p>But that’s where the similarities end. The Cuisinart has twelve speeds, controlled by a flimsy plastic dial, the first six of which have almost no differentiation. The medium and higher speeds are better defined. We had almost the exact same issues with the Cuisinart as we had with Cheftronic because of poor design: a rounded mixing bowl that’s much too deep and stubby, narrow attachments.</p>
<p>The mixing paddle failed to blend the butter into the cake batter, leaving stray bits behind. Plus, it couldn’t reach the mix-ins for the cookie dough, which remained untouched in the bottom of the bowl. The dough hook simply swirled the dough ingredients and the whisk just foamed and splattered the egg whites and cream — until we increased the amount of each.</p>
<p>This stand mixer simply doesn’t live up to Cuisinart’s reputation. The motor is powerful enough, but it can’t compensate for the mixing bowl and attachments that are virtually useless.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you love to bake or bake large amounts on a frequent basis, then there’s no better kitchen appliance than a stand mixer. A great stand mixer needs to be multi-functional and have a durable, well-designed motor with sufficient power to last many years.</p>
<p>KitchenAid has long been a leader in manufacturing outstanding stand mixers, and its  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005UP2K/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KSM150PSWH</a> — one of the Artisan Series stand mixers — is no exception. It handily out-performed all of the stand mixers we tested. The KitchenAid plowed through thick cookie dough and kneaded sticky pizza dough with ease; smoothly mixed the batter for an airy sponge cake; and whipped egg whites and cream to frothy peaks in a minute.</p>
<p>This KitchenAid stand mixer is so easy to use and with all the amazing attachments you can purchase, it’s like having a Transformer in your kitchen.</p>
<p>A less expensive option is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000308BUI/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; Eclectrics</a> stand mixer. It’s also well-made, and though it takes slightly longer to perform the same tasks as the KitchenAid Artisan, the Hamilton Beach stood up to our tests and even bested the Artisan in a couple of them. At $120 less than the KitchenAid, the Hamilton Beach &#8211; Eclectrics is a very good and affordable alternative.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We blended over 30 pounds of produce in the most popular blenders on the market. Ultimately, we thought the Cuisinart - CBT-2000 blended the best for a mid-range price. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hether you’re making a fruit or green smoothie, you need a powerful blender that can pulverize gnarly seeds, tough leaves and stems into a silky-smooth drink. But with so many blenders on the market at different price points, it’s hard to figure out which one is right for you. Our professional chef spent 30-plus hours blending 30 pounds of produce to determine that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X3N9O58/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; CBT-2000</a> is the best blender.</p>
<p>We tested three price ranges of blenders and think the Cuisinart &#8211; CBT-2000 is the best all-around mid-range blender for making smoothies, soups and nut butter on a frequent basis.</p>
<p>If making smoothies or juices is part of your daily lifestyle — and you don’t mind spending substantially more money — then we recommend the high-performance <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-A3500-Programmable-Connectivity-Professional-Grade/dp/B075713NNL/?tag-ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vitamix &#8211; A3500</a>. Our low-priced pick, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0094B94BM/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cleanblend &#8211; 2001</a>, doesn’t have programmed functions and it isn’t great for processing nut butters, but it matched the Cuisinart and Vitamix in overall blending.</p>

<h2 id="selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>The initial phase of our research comprised of reading through posts on Reddit and Amazon to determine the primary reasons consumers are purchasing a blender and how much they’re willing to spend. We found that an overwhelming majority of people are looking for an inexpensive blender that can make fruit and vegetable smoothies.</p>
<p>However, the cheaper blenders for $50 or under don’t have the powerful motors that are needed to break down ice, fruit seeds and skins and sturdy vegetables into a palatable consistency. Another frequent complaint from consumers is that cheaper models simply don’t last long, especially if they’re used on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Vitamix’s marketing and “road show&#8221; promotions at warehouse stores have certainly worked in convincing people that a Vitamix will change their lives by significantly improving their diet. However, not everyone wants to spend $600 or more on a blender. So we looked at the wide swath of blenders on the market and divided them into high-end, mid-range and low-end price categories and see how consumers compared them.</p>
<p>We then cross referenced the blenders rated the best by consumers with the most recent reviews for blenders at Wirecutter, America’s Test Kitchen and Consumer Reports before deciding on the eight blenders we would test. Finally, since manufacturers are frequently upgrading — or sometimes just changing the appearance of — their blenders, we went to their websites to ensure we would be testing the latest model.</p>

<h2 id="who">Who should buy a blender</h2>
<p>Since 1933 when the Oster company introduced the blender to the world, it’s considered to be an essential kitchen countertop appliance. Initially, the blender was created for mixing alcoholic drinks and frozen desserts, but in the last several years it’s taken on a new role as the means for improving diet with fruit or vegetable smoothies and juices.</p>
<p>The build quality of a blender corresponds with its price. The more expensive, high-end blenders, are designed and built to last for years. On the opposite end of the scale, budget blenders ($50 and under) aren’t made well enough for long-term use, and their motors tend to burn out after a year or two.</p>
<p>There are many varieties, sizes and shapes of blenders, and deciding which one is right for you can be confusing. The type of blender you choose will depend on what you want to make and how often you plan to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Low end</strong> ($100-$199): Occasional use for blending frozen drinks and desserts. The blenders we tested in this category are the Cleanblend, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Countertop-1100-Watt-Smoothies-BL660/dp/B00939FV8K/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ninja</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BBL620SIL1AUS1-Furious-Blender-Silver/dp/B07GJ24VXV/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CXKTNDU/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Mid-range</strong> ($200-$399): Frequent use for blending smoothies, juices, nut butter, soups and sauces. These blenders are more advanced than the occasional-use blender and can handle a wider range of food and drink processing tasks. In this category are the Cuisinart and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004UJKKI4/?tag=ybdblender-20">Waring</a>.</p>
<p><strong>High-end</strong> ($400-$599): Everyday, heavy-duty blending for diet, weight loss and overall health improvement.  This type of blender would be excellent for raw-food, vegetarian and vegan diets. There are really only two high-end blenders, the fiercely competitive Vitamix and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blendtec-D725C3216A1A-AMAZON-Designer-Blender-Stainless/dp/B01FASW6OY/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blendtec</a>, and they both have several expensive models.</p>

<p><b>Power of motor:</b> Most manufacturers market their blenders’ ability to reach between 2 to 3.5 “peak horsepower.&#8221; This is a meaningless claim, as a blender will only reach its peak or maximum speed for a couple of seconds at the pulse function. You will also see a blender’s high RPM advertised (30,000 and upwards), which is also misleading since all blenders work at a high RPM. What’s important is whether the motor can sustain a high RPM without burning out.</p>
<p>A more accurate gauge is the blender’s wattage since you want the blender’s motor to have enough power to handle tough blending and grinding jobs. Think whole, hearty fruits and vegetables or nuts. The blenders we tested fell between 1100 and 1800 watts.</p>
<p>As stated by April Jones in <a href="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/article/287/Understanding-Blender-Specifications/print" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cooking For Engineers</a>, “Compare watts, not horsepower ratings. Higher watts mean smoother smoothies and a longer motor life.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Blender jar size and shape:</b> The majority of the blender jars we tested were 64 ounces, which is ample room for the blades to create a vortex that pulls food down into the blades and then pushes it backup for even distribution and blending. We found that jars were those with a slight tapering down to the blades. The tapering created a tighter and more efficient vortex for drawing up ingredients that settled to the bottom.</p>
<p><b>Blade position:</b> Seven of the eight blenders we tested had wing-shaped blades positioned in the bottom of the jar. The Ninja has a blade spindle with three sets of (wickedly) sharp blades evenly distributed. During our testing, the Ninja’s blade created a centrifuge that whirled ingredients but didn’t entirely pulverize them, and the spindle couldn’t reach ingredients in the lower part of the jar.</p>
<p>The other blenders had two to eight wing-shaped blades. The blades that were the most efficient in our tests had upward and downward prongs and the smallest gap between the tip of the blades and the jar. This position allowed the blades to grab ingredients from the bottom and sides without our needing to constantly scrape the insides of the jar.</p>
<p><b>Pre-programmed functions:</b>   The blenders that we found to be most convenient and easy to use had pre-programmed functions. These functions are at a set speed that the manufacturer considers ideal for blending smoothies, juices, soups, ice-crushing and self- or auto-clean. They can each be adjusted with a variable speed-control dial or button to increase or decrease speed as needed. Two of the low-end blenders, the Ninja and the KitchenAid, do not have adjustable speed control, and it was definitely a function we missed.</p>
<p>Both Vitamix and Blendtec have a single, all-purpose speed/time function for smoothies, but the Breville and Cuisinart have two different speeds and times for fruit and green smoothies.  All four blenders made great smoothies, but the blenders that had separate functions dedicated to either fruit or green were slightly better.</p>

<p><b>Hot-soup function: </b>It’s not a “must have&#8221; function, but it’s certainly nice to have. Half of the blenders we tested had a pre-programmed function for blending and then heating the soup to piping hot. (The three low-end blenders and the mid-range Waring do not have the soup function.) The Vitamix and Cuisinart performed exceptionally well, evenly blending and heating the soup in about six minutes. Blendtec’s soup function is programmed at three minutes, and the soup only heated to warm.</p>
<p><b>Noise:</b> Many consumers apparently have the hearing of bats, because complaints about the noise level of high-performance blenders are voluminous. To be fair, <i>all </i>of the blenders we tested were loud, ranging in sound from a high-pitched whine to the roar of a lawnmower. The quietest blender was the KitchenAid, which also has the lowest wattage (550), so there does seem to be a correlation between the blender’s power and its noise output.</p>
<p><b>Warranty:</b> If you’re spending a lot of money on a blender, then you’ll want assurance that it’s going to last, and if something fails, the manufacturer’s warranty will repair or replace the blender. The next most frequent consumer complaint is motor burn-out of the low-end blenders, usually after about a year, and the manufacturer’s limited one-year warranty no longer covers replacement or repair.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0094B94BM/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cleanblend</a> — our top pick in the low-end category — is the exception and has a remarkable <a href="https://cleanblend.com/pages/warrenty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five-year full warranty</a>. Vitamix and Blendtec are confident that their blenders are solidly built and have the most impressive warranties, <a href="https://www.vitamix.com/us/en_us/shop/10-year-warranty" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">10-year</a> and <a href="https://www.blendtec.com/pages/warranty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight-year</a>, respectively.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We carefully chose several tests that would equitably rate all three categories of blenders. All the blenders advertise that they are the best blender for smoothies, so clearl,y we needed to test that claim.</p>
<h3>Ice crushing</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17644" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice.jpg" alt="Crushed ice in a blender." width="2000" height="1335" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-1000x668@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-768x513.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-885x591.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-1000x668.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-320x214.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-885x591@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-320x214@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Our first test was a simple one: we added two cups of ice cubes to each blender and timed how long it took to pulverize the ice into a snowy consistency, which is necessary for for a properly blended smoothie. Half of the blenders had a separate “crush ice&#8221; function. For the blenders that didn’t, we simply turned the blender up to its highest speed.  All of the blenders pulverized ice to a powdery snow from three seconds (the Ninja) to one minute (Cleanblend).</p>
<h3>Fruit smoothies</h3>
<p>Most fruit smoothies contain several ingredients: a liquid (such as milk, almond milk, coconut milk), yogurt (usually Greek yogurt, but any style of unsweetened yogurt will do), fresh or frozen fruit and ice. The ingredients should be layered exactly from bottom to top as we’ve listed, since it allows the blender blades to grind the fruit first, then draw the ice down into the vortex to be pulverized and blended with the fruit mixture.</p>
<p>One of the most commonly used fruits is berries — strawberries, raspberries and blueberries. Strawberries and raspberries present a challenge for any blender because of their tiny seeds, which need to be completely ground up and integrated into the smoothie. We decided on <a href="https://www.blenderbabes.com/lifestyle-diet/diabetic/light-pre-workout-raspberry-smoothie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this recipe for a raspberry smoothie</a>; it’s simple but would also determine which blender is best for a seeded-fruit smoothie.</p>

<h3>Green smoothies</h3>
<p>The next most frequently blended smoothie is a green vegetable smoothie. These concoctions also have a milk of some sort in their ingredients and a combination of a green vegetable, such as kale or spinach, another vegetable or two and for sweetness, a bit of fruit. Kale is the heartiest of green vegetables, and it also can be a struggle for a blender to completely grind and pulverize the kale into a smooth green smoothie without any sediment.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.cookincanuck.com/kale-apple-green-smoothie-recipe-vegan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recipe for a kale-apple smoothie </a>tested how well each blender made green smoothies. We thought the apple added enough sweetness and so we omitted the agave. We also left out the flax seeds, since we wanted to focus on how well a blender did in grinding up notoriously tough kale.</p>
<p>As a general note for smoothies, make sure that you use only well-washed organic fruits and vegetables. The blenders blend the whole fruit and vegetable, including seeds and skins. You’ll be drinking them, and you don’t want to ingest pesticides or preservatives.</p>
<p>An egg-based sauce, such as mayonnaise, takes about 30 seconds to make in a blender, and if you haven’t tried it, you’ll be amazed at how easy it is and how much better it tastes than the bottled stuff.</p>
<p>One of our favorite sauces is Hollandaise, and made in the traditional way — whisking eggs over a pot of simmering water — but it’s a bit of a pain. <a href="https://toriavey.com/toris-kitchen/julia-childs-easy-blender-hollandaise-sauce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a blender, however, it’s simple</a>. Basically, it’s mayonnaise with egg yolks, lemon juice and hot butter instead of oil. There’s no cooking involved — other than melting butter in the microwave — and you pour the hot butter into the egg yolks spinning in the blender. Within seconds, the mixture emulsifies, and you have a thick sauce for vegetables or Eggs Benedict.</p>
<p>The Hollandaise test was quite eye-opening, because it highlighted the importance of the jar shape and blade position in each blender. The blender jars that were uniform in shape with no tapering failed the test miserably, because their blades couldn’t reach the egg yolks in the bottom of the jar. When the speed of the blender was increased, the vortex lifted the eggs up, but they weren’t contained tightly enough to bond chemically with the hot butter. The result was a thin buttery liquid that didn’t hold together as a sauce.</p>
<p>The one test that all of the blenders did well in was a simple tomato-basil soup. We used the <a href="https://www.vitamix.com/us/en_us/recipes/tomato-soup" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vitamix recipe</a>, because there weren’t many ingredients, and we wanted a soup that required no pre-cooking and took minutes to make. (If you want to make this recipe, only add one-half cup of water and not the two cups as instructed.) Although half of the blenders did not have the “hot soup&#8221; function, they all made a relatively smooth and fresh-tasting soup that could be heated up in a microwave.</p>
<p>The most daunting challenge for the blenders was peanut butter, since this really put their motors to the test. But also, again, the shape of the blender jar and blade position significantly contributed to the blender’s passing or failing this test.</p>

<p>Only two of the eight blenders we tested — the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X3N9O58/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BBL620SIL1AUS1-Furious-Blender-Silver/dp/B07GJ24VXV/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville</a> — succeeded at our first attempt. The Vitamix model that we tested had a wide, non-tapered blender jar, so the peanuts were too far spread out in the bottom of the jar for the blades to reach. The peanuts were finely chopped and got lodged beneath the blades. We consulted the instruction manual, and for this particular model, we needed to double the peanuts from two cups to four cups. We tried again, and the second time, the blades could reach the additional peanuts and process them into peanut butter.</p>
<p>Half of the blenders we tested had a self-clean function. This is a pre-programmed button that spins water and dish soap for up to one minute. The function begins at a low speed for a few seconds, then shifts into high speed for about 30 seconds, before finishing at a low speed for the final few seconds.</p>
<p>We did find the self-clean function effectively removed food residue from the top and sides of the jar to beneath the blades.</p>

<p>In the ongoing marketing battle between the most expensive blenders, Vitamix and Blendtec, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-A3500-Programmable-Connectivity-Professional-Grade/dp/B075713NNL/?tag-ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vitamix &#8211; A3500</a> wins hands down. The Vitamix’s powerful 1500-watt motor crushes ice cubes into powdery snow in seconds, purees and heats vegetables to hot soup in minutes and pulverizes entire fruits — seeds, core and fruit skins — and sturdy kale and other hearty greens into silky smoothies with no sediment.</p>
<p>Initially, we were a bit suspicious of Vitamix. There’s so much hype around it, and the product demonstrations at stores can be overbearing. Subsequently, we were a bit more stringent in testing Vitamix, but, except for one test, this powerhouse blender completely won us over.</p>
<p>So why is Vitamix so good? Let’s start with the smoothies, since they will most likely be a major consideration if you’re thinking about buying one.</p>
<p>Vitamix has a pre-set function for smoothies timed at a mere 50 seconds. The cycle begins at the mid-speed, level 5, for ten seconds, during which it draws down the ice to the blades and pulverizes it to powder. The cycle then speeds up to its highest level and processes the ingredients in 40 seconds. We were hypnotized by the cyclonic blur of the Vitamix’s vortex as the smoothies were blended.</p>
<p>No other blender we tested could beat Vitamix’s ability to grind the raspberry seeds in the fruit smoothie. The ground seeds had texture but not graininess. We strained the smoothie, and no seed bits were left behind.</p>
<p>Vitamix doesn’t have a separate cycle for green smoothies, but no matter, it worked exactly the same, and our green smoothie was silky with no sediment. Because of Vitamix’s marketing videos depict whole fruits and vegetables being processed, we threw in whole kale leaves, an entire apple — without coring or seeding — and un-cut stalks of celery. Vitamix processed it all without a struggle, and gave us a smoothie that was like a super-refined juice.</p>

<p>As we noted above, the soup function is a wonder, if you enjoy hot soup on a cold day, you can have it freshly made and piping hot in under six minutes. The tomato-basil soup we made in the Vitamix exploded with fresh tomato and herbal flavor, and although it was composed entirely of vegetables, the Vitamix blended it into a frothy emulsion that tasted creamy.</p>
<p>Making peanut butter was a little less stress-free. As we noted earlier, the width of the blender jar for this particular model necessitated our using a minimum of four cups of nuts; otherwise, the finely ground peanuts got lodged beneath the blades. When we added more peanuts on our second attempt, the Vitamix achieved peanut butter in about two minutes.</p>
<p>The only test that the Vitamix failed was the Hollandaise. For the sauce to emulsify, the eggs needed to be beaten for 30 seconds. But the eggs could not be tightly contained in the Vitamix’s wide blender jar, so they just whizzed around underneath the blades. We tried increasing the speed, and the vortex lifted the eggs up but again failed to beat them. When we added the hot butter, it simply splattered and never came together as a thick sauce.</p>
<p>The Vitamix has a great auto-clean function that’s preset at 35 seconds. It goes through three cycles that effectively washes away everything along the sides and bottom of the pitcher all the way up to the lid.</p>
<p>If we had one negative about the Vitamix’s design, it’s that the lid attaches to the blender jar by two plastic tabs. They’re made of the <a href="https://www.rawblend.com.au/assets/files/Vitamix-Container-Info.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">same tough Tritan copolyester</a> as the blender jar, but when we pressed down on the tabs, there wasn’t a click to indicate that we had actually fastened the lid securely on.</p>
<p>Of course, at $600, the Vitamix is certainly an investment. But if improving your diet is important, and blending smoothies or making fresh juices is part of your daily regimen, we believe it will be money well spent. Vitamix’s amazing and unique ten-year warranty is proof they’re confident this blender will last with everyday use.</p>

<p>If you don’t want to spend a good chunk of your paycheck on a Vitamix, but you do want a blender for a daily smoothie, there are several mid-range blenders to consider. During our testing, we found that a couple of the mid-range blenders performed nearly as well as Vitamix, and the differences in texture and consistency of their smoothies and soups were minimal.</p>
<p>At 1,677 watts, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X3N9O58/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; CBT-2000</a> has plenty of power. It has five pre-programmed functions, an LCD screen with a countdown timer and a variable speed dial that can be minutely adjusted from lowest to highest any time during blending. The dial also has a push-button “turbo&#8221; function that instantly increases the speed to high in short bursts.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart’s function for fruit smoothies is preset at 45 seconds and runs through various speeds at ten-second intervals, finishing with a final burst at high. Its fruit smoothie was nearly as perfect as the Vitamix’s with just a touch of miniscule seed bits.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart has a separate function for green smoothies with a longer time (one minute, 30 seconds) and the different cycle of speeds. Again, the Cuisinart’s performance matched Vitamix, blending the tough kale and apple seeds and core to velvety smoothness.</p>
<p>The soup function blends and heats the soup in six minutes, and it may not have had the creamy emulsification of Vitamix’s soup, but it was still perfectly smooth and nearly boiling hot.</p>

<p>As noted earlier, it was a chore to make peanut butter in <i>all of the blenders</i> we tested. The Cuisinart’s lowest speed finely chopped the peanuts in seconds, but as we increased the speed to form butter, the peanut bits splattered up the sides of the blender jar and lodged underneath the blades. We had to continuously scrape together the ground peanuts for about five minutes before they coalesced into a relatively smooth peanut butter.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart did not perform as well in making Hollandaise. Its blender jar is similar to the Vitamix and has almost no tapering at the bottom. Consequently, the blades couldn’t contain the eggs in a tight vortex, so when the butter was added, everything sprayed up without ever emulsifying.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart’s preset clean function is 30 seconds at medium speed, which worked fine for washing off smoothie and soup residue. But we needed to run the program twice to clean off the sticky peanut butter that was lodged underneath the blades.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart &#8211; CBT-2000 comes with an attractive recipe book that includes recipes for smoothies, frozen cocktails, soups, salad dressings and desserts. We were extremely impressed by the Cuisinart’s versatility, durability and its ease of use, and at under $300, it’s a great alternative to Vitamix.</p>
<p>We should note that the Breville &#8211; BBL910XL (“The Boss&#8221;) was one of our best contenders in the mid-range category. However, near the end of our test period, Breville abruptly discontinued this excellent blender, which is now <a href="https://www.breville.com/us/en/products/blenders/bbl910.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only available on the Breville website</a>.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Cuisinart &#8211; CBT-2000 can do virtually everything the Vitamix can, but it’s half the price.</li>
<li>Its powerful and durable 1677-watt motor blended velvety smooth fruit and green smoothies with barely perceptible residue from seeds.</li>
<li>The Cuisinart’s accurate, preset functions include hot soup, ice crush, auto-clean and two different programs for fruit and green smoothies.</li>
<li>It’s easy and convenient to use, and its versatility makes the Cuisinart “Hurricane Pro&#8221; one of the best all-around blenders you could buy.</li>

<p>Fans of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0094B94BM/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cleanblend &#8211; 2001</a> claim that it performs exactly the same as a Vitamix for a third of the price. Their claim didn’t entirely hold up, but the Cleanblend was far superior to the two other low-end blenders we tested. It has an extraordinarily powerful motor — 1800 watts — more powerful than the Vitamix, and excellent speed control.</p>
<p>Outwardly, compared to Vitamix, the Cleanblend looks simple. It’s very easy to operate and physically recalls a slightly squatter version of a 1970’s Waring blender. It has no pre-programmed functions and operates simply with an on/off switch. A center knob controls the speed levels and a second switch allows short controlled bursts.</p>
<p>The motor is quite heavy, but Cleanblend has further ensured the blender holds firmly in place, even at its highest speed, by adding four super-strong rubber anti-slip feet. A tamper is included, but we found it to be too short to reach more than half-way into the 64-ounce blender jar.</p>
<p>Since there is no program for crushing ice, we used the pulse switch. The Cleanblend’s pulse is a bit explosive, shooting crushed bits of ice upward like hail. It pulverized the ice in a minute, much slower than blenders with less wattage, and its consistency was granular rather than snowy.</p>
<p>Despite the propulsive nature of the ice, the Cleanblend did a beautiful job blending the fruit and green smoothies. After a couple of pulses to get the ice crushed, the speed control dial could be adjusted in small increments, gently increasing the speed from a true low to a pulverizing high. We enjoyed having an interactive role with the blender rather than just standing back and watching it do its automated thing.</p>

<p>We did need to add more liquid during the processing of both smoothies to keep the ingredients flowing. The raspberry smoothie that the Cleanblend produced had small bits of seeds. However, the kale in the green smoothie was completely liquified in 30 seconds and left behind no sediment when strained.</p>
<p>It took the Cleanblend only 30 seconds to process the tomato-basil soup (the Cleanblend does not have a function for heating the soup) and to whip the Hollandaise into a thick and creamy emulsion.</p>
<p>The blender’s only fail was the peanut butter. We began by pulsing the peanuts in short bursts, and half splattered upwards. We scraped it down and tried grinding the peanuts on low, but they constantly lodged underneath the blades. After several tedious minutes, all we got was a finely ground paste.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, Cleanblend’s <i>five-year full warranty</i> is unusual for a low-end blender. The company offers a full refund within 30 days, and for five years after that, they will repair or replace the blender. No other low-end blender has this kind of warranty.</p>
<p>Priced at $179, the Cleanblend &#8211; 2001 is slightly more expensive than the KitchenAid and Ninja. But neither performed nearly as well, and it’s still a fraction of the cost of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blendtec-D725C3216A1A-AMAZON-Designer-Blender-Stainless/dp/B01FASW6OY/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blendtec</a>, which it also out-performed. Cleanblend may not be a household name yet, but the quality of its blender and its thoughtful additions, like a flexible silicone spatula and nut-milk bag, and the company’s ace customer service are giving its competitors a run for the money.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Cleanblend &#8211; 2001’s powerful 1800-watt motor makes short work of consistently blending fruits and hearty veggies into creamy smoothies.</li>
<li>Its interactive manual speed control can be easily adjusted to gradually increase from a true low speed to a pulverizing high speed.</li>
<li>The Cleanblend’s sturdy construction and unique five year-full warranty ensure the blender’s longevity far longer than the other low-end blenders we tested.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004UJKKI4/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Waring &#8211; MX1200XTX</a> physically resembles the Cleanblend. It has two switches, on/off and pulse/variable, and a dial for adjusting speed. The blender jar has a slight tapering, so the blades’ wingspan reaches a couple of millimeters shy of the jar’s interior.</p>
<p>The variable switch is the default position (held down it engages the pulse function), and we found it took a bit of practice to adjust the dial to the right speed level. The lowest speed was a true low, a nice steady blending motion. The higher speeds (7 to 10) were actually too high, and the vortex spewed ingredients to the top of the jar.</p>
<p>The Waring gave us decent results, however. There was a bit of unground seed in the fruit smoothie, but the green smoothie had the same silky consistency of the Vitamix. The Waring doesn’t have a soup function, and we needed to blend the soup a little longer to get it from a gazpacho to a pureed consistency.</p>
<p>The close positioning of the blades, however, produced a luscious and thick Hollandaise, one of the best of our testing. We had the usual problem with the peanut butter — the peanuts were ground to a paste and lodged beneath the blades. The Waring doesn’t have a separate clean function, but it did the job at the highest speed.</p>
<p>The Waring is certainly a good blender, but the similar and cheaper Cleanblend is better.</p>

<p>As noted earlier, Breville abruptly discontinued its mid-range blender BBL620XL during our testing period, and based on Breville’s recommendation, we tested its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BBL620SIL1AUS1-Furious-Blender-Silver/dp/B07GJ24VXV/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BBL620SIL1AUS1</a> “Fresh &amp; Furious blender.&#8221; We were assured by Breville’s customer service that the Fresh &amp; Furious was a suitable substitute for the BBL620XL and had all the same features.</p>
<p>It short, it didn’t, and the Fresh &amp; Furious did not perform nearly as well. The Fresh &amp; Furious has 1300 watts, which wasn’t quite enough power to pulverize the raspberry seeds and kale. It does have two separate settings for fruit and green smoothies, and although both smoothies were well blended, they were filled with seed bits and sludgy green sediment. A second blending did not improve their consistency.</p>
<p>The Fresh &amp; Furious blender jar isn’t tapered at the bottom, and so we had the usual problems with a non-tapered jar. There is a one-half inch gap between the jar and the blades, so ingredients got stuck underneath the blades and along the sides and bottom of the jar. The Fresh &amp; Furious has an auto-clean function, but it couldn’t reach the food particles trapped along the two ridges that run the length of the blender jar.</p>
<p>The Fresh &amp; Furious has five speeds with minimal differentiation between the lowest and highest. The low speed didn’t create much of a vortex when blending the eggs for the Hollandaise, so we increased the speed to medium, and we got a decent sauce.</p>
<p>The Fresh &amp; Furious achieved a smooth, creamy peanut butter after eight minutes on the highest speed. As a precaution to prevent motor burn-out, the high speed automatically shuts off after two minutes, a feature we found annoying.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BBL620SIL1AUS1-Furious-Blender-Silver/dp/B07GJ24VXV/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BBL620AIL1AUS1</a> is certainly well made, and it’s a good all-around moderately priced blender. But if you’re looking for a low-end blender for making smoothies on a daily basis, we recommend the slightly less expensive Cleanblend instead.</p>

<p>For such an expensive high-performance blender, we were surprised at how poorly Vitamix’s main competitor fared. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blendtec-D725C3216A1A-AMAZON-Designer-Blender-Stainless/dp/B01FASW6OY/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blendtec  &#8211; D725C321A1A</a>’s control panel is entirely LCD touch screen, including speed control, which needs to be swiped left or right. Each function has a cute little icon, and every time you blend something, a message — such as “Ta-Da!&#8221; or “You should tweet this blend&#8221; — flashes. Without doubt, we were charmed by these amusing techno touches, but it proved to be a case of style over substance.</p>
<p>Two design flaws impacted the Blendtec’s performance: its blade and its pre-programmed functions. The blade is flat with two prongs each with two “arms&#8221; abouta one-half inch tall. The jar has almost no tapering, so there is a half-inch gap between the blade arms and the inside of the jar. There is a one-inch gap between the arms and the corners of the jar.</p>
<p>Consequently, the blade could not reach and process the raspberry seeds, nor could it pulverize the apple skin and core. In both tests, the smoothies were grainy and not pleasant to drink. We had the same problem with the peanut butter and Hollandaise. The blade chopped and spun the nuts into a paste that got stuck beneath the blade, and the egg and butter splattered and never emulsified.</p>
<p>In all cases, the timing of the pre-programmed functions was too short, the briefest being the soup function at three minutes, which gave us a decently blended but lukewarm soup. Of course, it could be argued that you can achieve the same results as Vitamix if you used the manual function. We tried, and it didn’t. But since the Blendtec is as expensive as Vitamix, its pre-programmed functions should work the same.</p>
<p>This particular model of Blendtec comes with a mini jar for single servings, which worked better since the jar is about a third of the width and kept the ingredients closely contained.</p>
<p>Like Vitamix, there are a number of Blendtec models, and they might perform as well as Vitamix. But the model we tested, the Designer 725, did not live up to the Blendtec reputation.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Countertop-1100-Watt-Smoothies-BL660/dp/B00939FV8K/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ninja &#8211; BL660</a> has three blades affixed to a spindle that fits into the bottom of the jar. After many complaints of injuries from the previous model, Ninja redesigned the spindle so it could be removed for easier and safer cleaning. (We will note that despite our efforts to stay clear of these razor blades, we got nicked twice.)</p>
<p>The largest blade is set in the center of the spindle with the two smaller blades positioned below. Presumably, this design allows the blender to crush ice at the top and distribute it to the lower blades for finer processing. The Ninja did crush the ice to a powdery texture and the smoothies had a slushy consistency.</p>
<p>With both smoothies, the fruit and vegetables were crushed at the blender’s initial burst, but they were not pulverized enough. Each had sediment and a crunchy feel on the tongue. The soup ingredients were well-blended, but again, there was substantial substance to the soup, like a finely chopped salsa. It was pleasantly palatable but not smooth. Blitzing the smoothies and soup additional time did not further process them.</p>
<p>The tiny blade at the bottom of the spindle could barely whip the egg for the Hollandaise, and it couldn’t distribute the ground peanuts upward to the wider blade, neither of which emulsified.</p>
<p>Two single serving blending cups are included, one with a traditional, removable four-pronged blade. A single-serving function is separate from the three speed levels. It’s basically a pulse function that needs to be pressed until the ingredients are processed. The resulting smoothie had a better consistency and was easier to use than the main blender.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CXKTNDU/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KSB1575CU</a> Diamond Blender had the lowest wattage of any blender we tested. At only 550 watts, the Diamond Blender’s motor clearly struggled in all of our tests. Not only did it take longer to blend ingredients, but it also didn’t have enough power to pulverize them to the smooth consistency we achieved with the Cleanblend. Raspberry seeds were left whole, and the green smoothie had a sludgy sediment.</p>
<p>The KitchenAid has five speeds, but we found that the lowest wasn’t a true low and splattered the egg and butter to the top of the blender jar and out the pour spout. The highest speed finely chopped the peanuts, but it didn’t have enough speed to convert them to butter.</p>
<p>The power switch is a big problem, because there’s no indication that it’s on or off. Several times during our testing, we thought the power was off, but when we picked up the blender jar, the blades spun and we barely avoided injury.</p>
<p>The KitchenAid we tested is the company’s recent upgrade of its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/KitchenAid-KSB1570SL-5-Speed-56-Ounce-BPA-Free/dp/B00DBQ1AIG/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KSB1570</a> blender, but it did not perform better than Cleanblend or the Ninja.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The type of blender you might consider purchasing is linked to your lifestyle and diet. The eight blenders that we tested ran the gamut from occasional blending (a couple of times a month) to frequent blending (twice or more a week) to daily use.</p>
<p>Many people think spending $50 for a blender is too much, and if they’re just using it for whipping up frozen margaritas on Cinco de Mayo, they’re probably right.  In most cases the old adage “you get what you pay for&#8221; applies to blenders. A powerful motor — 1500 watts — doesn’t come cheap, but our testing showed that it takes more than a strong motor to make a good blender. The shape of the blender jar and the blade position in the jar are equally important.</p>
<p>We chose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X3N9O58/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; CBT-2000</a> as the best overall, mid-range blender for making smoothies on a frequent basis. Its five programmed functions and precise manual control make this blender exceptionally easy to use.</p>
<p>At a whopping $600, our high-end pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-A3500-Programmable-Connectivity-Professional-Grade/dp/B075713NNL/?tag-ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vitamix &#8211; A3500</a>, pulverizes virtually anything edible into silky smoothies and creamy soups in minutes. Even if you used it several times a day, the Vitamix &#8211; A3500 is built to last for years, and its 10-year warranty is the best you’ll find anywhere.</p>
<p>Our low-end choice, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0094B94BM/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cleanblend &#8211; 2001</a>, doesn’t have programmed functions and is manually controlled, but its powerful 1800-watt motor liquifies fruits, vegetables and seeds nearly as well as Vitamix. It’s a great, affordable blender for frequent or everyday use.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter 40 hours of baking cakes, kneading bread and mashing 20 pounds of potatoes, we determined that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BHM800SIL-Handy-Scraper-Silver/dp/B00XBOXUWC/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BHM800SIL</a> is the best hand mixer.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected hand mixers to test</h2>
<p>We began our research by reading hundreds of reviews of hand mixers posted on Amazon, focusing on those that had the highest ratings. From there we went to the manufacturers’ websites for the hand mixers we were interested in testing to compare features and accessories.</p>
<p>The majority of hand mixers run about $20 or less, and they’re very similar in appearance, wattage and accessories. But we also wanted to test higher-end models to determine if their additional features were worth the increased price.</p>
<p>Included in our research was reading reliable and authentic reviews of hand mixers posted by other review sites to learn what criteria each used to test and rate hand mixers.</p>
<p>We also read through several Reddit threads to learn how people use hand mixers and what’s important for them when they’re considering buying a new one. We compared user recommendations with those other online product reviews, then culled through the hand mixers that are the newest models, or currently available, to settle on the seven hand mixers we would test.</p>
<h2 id="the-seven-best">Compare the best hand mixers</h2>
[table id=167 /]
<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs a hand mixer?</h2>
<p>A hand mixer is primarily used for small baking tasks, such as mixing cake batter, creaming butter and sugar or whipping egg whites and heavy cream. Many online comments cite the hand mixer as the perfect appliance for whipping mashed potatoes into an ultra-smooth and fluffy consistency.</p>
<p>Larger baking or cooking tasks are better accomplished with a stand mixer, which allows you to perform several functions completely hands-free. A stand mixer, however, is very heavy and difficult to store anywhere except a countertop, and it lacks portability. Conversely, a hand mixer offers flexibility and can be used in almost any size mixing bowl.</p>
<h3>Hand mixer versus immersion blender</h3>
<p>An <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-immersion-blender/" rel="noopener">immersion blender</a> or stick blender is ideal for pureeing hot or cold soups, fresh-fruit drinks or smoothies and mayonnaise or other sauces. High-end models, such as the Breville &#8211; BSB510XL Control Grip and the KitchenAid &#8211; KHB2351, include a whisk attachment. We tested their whisk attachments to determine whether an immersion blender could perform the same whipping tasks as a hand mixer.</p>
<p>In both cases, it took substantially longer to whip cream, since any speed higher than low splattered the cream everywhere. We had more success with egg whites, which didn’t splatter at high speed.</p>
<p>We had two problems with the mashed potatoes: first, it took quite a bit of effort to push down on the potatoes, and second, the immersion blender’s blade pureed the potatoes into a thick and gummy consistency. Good for vichyssoise, perhaps, but terrible for mashed potatoes.</p>
<p>Consequently, we decided that a hand mixer is really a better appliance for these tasks.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Attachments</h3>
<p><b>Beaters: </b>All hand mixers come with two beaters used for most baking tasks. The beaters for newer and up-scale models are thin wires, not dissimilar from a wire whisk, and range from five-to-six inches in length with a diameter of about two inches. Wire beaters are open, as opposed to the thick beaters, which have four metal tines attached to a center post. Wire beaters are much easier to clean, and by driving ingredients downward rather than outward, they also reduce splatter.</p>
<p><b>Whisk: </b>Almost all hand mixers include a single wire whisk (the Vremi did not), which is used only for whipping cream and egg whites. The wire whisk should have a diameter of at least three inches to efficiently aerate the ingredient you’re whipping. We found the majority of the whisk attachments to be flimsy and not wide enough to effectively aerate.</p>
<p><b>The only hand mixer we tested to include two wire whisks is the</b> <b>Breville &#8211; BHM800SIL</b><b>,</b> which easily outperformed all single-whisk hand mixers. The Breville’s attachments are made of stainless steel rather than chrome or chrome-plated like other mixers.</p>

<p><b>Dough hooks</b>: Elongated, curly-cue-shaped dough hooks are used exclusively for blending and kneading yeast-based doughs. During our testing, the dough hooks were able to blend ingredients, but we found it a real challenge to knead the dough, which kept twirling around one hook or riding up the side of the bowl. Overall, we decided dough hooks are pretty useless for kneading, and you get better results by kneading dough by hand.</p>
<h3>Power</h3>
<p>The hand mixers we tested ranged between 150 watts (Vremi) and 290 watts (KitchenAid). The Vremi stalled a bit with the bread dough, but it had enough power for other tests. The Breville and Oster are both 240 watts, which is sufficient for any baking task.</p>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<p>We determined that speed levels were more important than the actual wattage, and more speed levels do not necessarily mean better mixing.</p>
<p>For example, the KitchenAid &#8211; KHM926WH has nine speeds, but there is little difference between each level, so it’s like having only three speeds, low, medium and high. Conversely, the Breville and the Cuisinart &#8211; HM-90S also have nine speeds, but there is a very clear differentiation between each one. Adding to this, the Breville suggests levels of speed for a particular task, such as creaming (4-6) and whipping (7-9), which we found helpful in our trial test runs.</p>
<p>You also want a hand mixer with a “true” slow speed, especially for adding flour or sugar to a batter or mix. The less expensive hand mixers we tested did not have a sufficiently slow speed, which resulted in spray and splatter. The higher-end models — the Breville, Cuisinart and KitchenAid — had very slow lower-speed levels and were the best for incorporating dry ingredients.</p>

<p>Overall, we decided that a true low, medium-low, medium, medium-high and high are really the only speeds you need for a hand mixer.</p>
<h3>Ergonomics</h3>
<p>Most of the hand mixers we tested weighed about two pounds (the Vremi was the lightest at only one pound), so they’re designed to be easy to maneuver in a mixing bowl. The Vremi was the easiest to zoom around the bowl, whereas the Oster felt a bit bulky.</p>

<p>Naturally, it’s a personal choice how the mixer fits into your hand, but we discovered that the location of the power/pause and speed level switches are important. When you’re adding ingredients, you want to be able to change speeds or pause the mixer at intervals to ensure thorough mixing. So the switches should be within your thumb’s reach and easy to press.</p>

<p>Hands-down, the Breville is the easiest to control with its unique scroll wheel that allows you to change speeds with a flick of your thumb. The Cuisinart and KitchenAid also have easy-to-reach speed controls, but we found the location of their power buttons to be a bit awkward. The other models have levers for speed control, and these proved to be stiff and inexact.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Our tests comprised the most common baking tasks for a hand blender:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whipping egg whites into a fluffy meringue.</li>
<li>Whipping heavy cream into stiff peaks.</li>
<li>Combining dry ingredients with wet ingredients without splatter.</li>
<li>Creaming butter and sugar evenly.</li>
<li>Blending cake batter to a smooth consistency.</li>
<li>Churning heavy doughs like cookie, bread or pizza.</li>
<li>Kneading bread or pizza dough.</li>
</ul>
<p>We chose <a href="http://www.kitchme.com/recipes/lemon-sponge-cake" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this recipe for a sponge cake</a> for testing whipping, combining and blending and this <a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/basic-homemade-bread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basic recipe for bread</a> for churning and kneading. We performed separate tests for whipping cream and creaming butter with sugar.</p>
<p>Our tests for whipping egg whites and cream also included timing how long it took the hand mixer’s whisk attachment to whip them into stiff peaks.</p>
<h3>Features Comparison</h3>
[table id=168 /]
<p>Many people comment online that they use their hand mixer for whipping mashed potatoes. For each hand mixer we tested, we boiled two pounds of russet potatoes until tender, mashed them and added two tablespoons of butter and half a cup of warmed milk. Using the beater attachment we timed how long it took to blend the potatoes to a smooth and fluffy consistency.</p>
<p>An equally important element in testing the hand mixers was their ergonomic design. We wanted a hand mixer that fits easily and comfortably in the hand and was light enough to maneuver effortlessly in a mixing bowl.</p>
<p>We also tested how easily or difficult it was to change speeds, power on and off, pause and eject attachments with a flick of the thumb. Finally, we hand-washed the attachments to determine how easy they were to clean.</p>

<p>Thoughtful design and superb engineering handily elevated the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BHM800SIL-Handy-Scraper-Silver/dp/B00XBOXUWC/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BHM800SIL</a> nine-speed hand mixer to the top. The Breville is the most expensive of the hand mixers we tested, but if you’re serious about baking, the Breville is a worthwhile investment.</p>
<p>The Breville has a number of unique features that set it apart. Physically it’s been designed to fit ergonomically in your hand. Its handle rests comfortably in your palm, and although it’s a bit heavier than other models, it glides around a mixing bowl almost by itself. You simply guide the mixer where you want it to go. An unusual feature is a trigger ring fitted for your forefinger. It’s actually the eject mechanism, but it also contributes to the mixer’s maneuverability in your hand.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the scroll wheel for adjusting speed levels is remarkably easy for increasing or decreasing speed. Above the wheel is an LED panel with a speed indicator and a timer that begins timing when the mixer is turned on and pauses timing whenever the pause button is pressed.</p>
<p>The Breville’s electrical cord has a plug with a finger-hole for rapid removal from a socket, and most impressively, the base of the cord in the mixer’s chassis swivels, so it can be used by both right- and left-handed people. As if these design elements weren’t enough, the Breville has a light located between the beaters that shines into your mixing bowl each time you power on.</p>

This mixer comes at a higher pricer point, but it delivers outstanding performance and ergonomics, including a swivel cord and trigger ring that improves your maneuverability in the bowl.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XBOXUWC/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Breville’s stainless-steel attachments include two silicone-coated beaters, which didn’t clatter against our mixing bowls and also virtually eliminated scraping down ingredients, two dough hooks and two wire whisks. No other hand mixer has two whisks, and the Breville’s easily doubled the volume of egg whites to fluffy heights in a minute.</p>
<p>An especially remarkable engineering feat is the mixer automatically adjusts the range of speed depending on which attachments you insert. For example, the dough hooks need less speed than the whisks or beaters. So when you insert the dough hooks, the mixer’s low speeds decrease so they’re low enough that flour doesn’t splatter when added.</p>
<p>The Breville’s performance matched its design in excellence. Our only complaint — and it’s the same for all of the blenders we tested — is the dough hooks do a good job of combining the ingredients into a blended dough, but kneading gave us trouble. Even at a low speed, we had to fight the dough from climbing up the sides of the bowl.</p>
<p>The Breville’s hefty price tag might discourage casual bakers or cooks, but we do believe this is an exceptional hand mixer for someone who really enjoys baking. The Breville whips through any baking task with little effort and could inspire you to bake more than the once-a-year birthday cake or Christmas cookies.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-HM-90S-Advantage-9-Speed-Handheld/dp/B0034A8C4O/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; HM-90S</a> is about one-third less expensive than the Breville, and although it doesn’t quite match Breville’s outstanding performance, it’s nonetheless a very good hand mixer for the price.</p>
<p>It has nine speeds, each one noticeably increasing at small increments, which gave us a real sense of control. The three slow speeds are indeed very slow and were great for incorporating flour and sugar without any splatter. We didn’t find much difference between the middle speeds and settled at speed 5 as the most effective, particularly for whipping potatoes.</p>
<p>Cuisinart’s instruction manual helpfully suggests speeds and attachments for certain foods, which we tested out. The suggestions proved to be mostly accurate, although we did find that increasing the suggested speed by one level gave us quicker results.</p>

You can count on thorough coverage in the bowl due to the Cuisinart's longer and wider beaters.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0034A8C4O/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The mixer fits comfortably into the grip of your hand, and although the power button might be slightly too high up to reach for some people’s thumbs, the speed control buttons are at thumb level. The mixer’s speed automatically reset at level 1 each time it’s turned off, and there’s a bit of a surge before it adjusts to the actual speed level. Once we got used to that, it didn’t present a problem; we simply waited for a second or two before lowering the beaters into the bowl.</p>
<p>Maneuverability is excellent, thanks to the mixer’s lightweight and a swivel base for the electric cord, so you can move around the mixing bowl without the cord getting in your way.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart has the usual attachments (including a nifty little bowl scraper), but the beaters are longer and wider than those of other mixers we tested, which gave us great coverage in the mixing bowl when blending the cake batter. As with most of the mixers, a snap-on storage case for the attachments is a welcome addition.</p>

<p>The Cuisinart performed well in all of the tests, and as was the case with the Breville, the dough hooks efficiently combined the dough ingredients but had trouble keeping the dough in the bowl during the kneading process, even at the slowest speed.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart is still a bit expensive for a hand mixer, but it’s very well made and is sure to last. It comes with a three-year warranty, which is remarkable for a kitchen appliance (most are one-year), and any replacement parts are readily available and not expensive. If you don’t want to shell out big bucks for the Breville, then we recommend the Cuisinart HM-90S as our second-place winner.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Cuisinart &#8211; HM-90S is compact yet powerful with plenty of speed to plow through thick doughs and whip egg whites and cream in under two minutes.</li>
<li>Its stainless steel attachments are sturdy and easy to clean.</li>
<li>The Cuisinart’s three-year warranty is unique for a hand mixer.</li>
<li>It’s a bit pricey, but it’s durable and designed to last for years.</li>

<p>The majority of hand mixers we tested run in the $15 to $20 range, and the best of them was definitely the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XCCULW/?tag-ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oster &#8211; 2500</a>. At 240-watts, the Oster is actually a bit more powerful than our runner-up, the Cuisinart HM-90S. It has five speeds, each of which is clearly differentiated, unlike most nine-speed models.</p>

<p>The Oster is a bit larger and heavier than the other hand mixers we tested, and in some ways, reminds of us of the hand mixer our mother (or even grandmother) might use. The beaters are made of chrome and are thicker, like the old-fashioned models, intended for creaming butter and mixing thick cookie or bread doughs. The beaters were a little more difficult to clean, but they gave us good volume with egg whites in one minute and smooth blending of pizza dough.</p>
<p>Of the competition, its slowest speed didn’t splatter dry ingredients, and at the fastest speed, it tore through the potatoes like a little motor boat.</p>
<p>The Oster is a little heavy in the hand, so it may not be ideal for people who have hand or wrist weakness. We also found the chrome lever for adjusting speeds and the eject button to be stiff.</p>
<p>These quibbles don’t stand in the way, however, of our recommending this hand mixer as a good product at a great price.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>

<li>The Oster &#8211; 2500 is more powerful than the other comparably priced mixers we tested.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C9OQ47S/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KHM926WH </a>is another 9-speed hand mixer and shares several features with the Breville. It fits nicely in the hand and has also been designed for easy operation and maneuverability.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to like about the KitchenAid. Its large wire whisk is efficient and added good volume to the egg whites and whipping cream. We also found it helpful that the chassis is marked with symbols for how the attachments should be inserted. Oddly, the KitchenAid’s eject button isn’t marked.</p>
<p>However, as we found with the other mixers, its nine speed levels aren’t differentiated much to matter, since each increment between speeds is minimal. Its lowest levels were lower than the other mixers, and its highest levels were too high, splattering anything we attempted to mix.</p>
<p>The KitchenAid &#8211; KHM926WH is comparable in price to the Cuisinart, which in our testing, we found to be superior.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N3L2AN8/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 62650A </a>has many of the same features as the other hand mixers we tested: beaters and whisk attachments, snap-on storage case and good wattage (250 watts). It’s got six speeds with not much difference between speeds three and four, but the lowest speed and the highest speed are much too high for incorporating dry ingredients or mixing anything without splatter.</p>
<p>Its lever for changing speeds is awkwardly placed, so you really need to stretch your thumb high up on the mixer to reach the upper speed levels. It doesn’t have a separate eject button, but instead eject is done by pushing on the speed lever, which can stick. The Hamilton Beach &#8211; 62650A is certainly reasonably priced, and we did like its unique bowl rest feature on the base of the mixer, but for a bargain-priced option, we’d recommend the Oster &#8211; 2500 instead.</p>

<p>We really wanted to love the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vremi-Electric-Mixer-Built-Storage/dp/B01I1RQ2GY/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vremi &#8211; VRM010008N</a>. First of all, it’s adorable. The Vremi is a tiny candy-apple red hand mixer with 150 watts. It’s compact, could fit in a drawer and designed so its beaters (the Vremi’s only accessories) fit right into the chassis of the mixer. The Vremi is very lightweight and can whizz around a mixing bowl with no effort.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, its low wattage does this little mixer in. The Vremi has the flaws of some of the other mixers we tested. Its speed button is difficult to move while you’re mixing something, and the low speed splatters dry ingredients everywhere. Even at its highest speed, the Vremi struggled to plump up the egg whites and whipping cream.</p>
<p>The Vremi is an inexpensive option for a tiny kitchen.  But its low wattage increases the time and effort in doing basic baking tasks.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-6-Speed-Attachments-MX3200B/dp/B00BIBBIH4/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; MX3200B</a> has little differentiation between the speeds. Although it has six speed settings, in actuality, it’s a three-speed mixer — the two lows, mediums and highs are virtually the same.</p>
<p>The Black+Decker did a nice job in whipping the egg whites, and it creamed the potatoes to a smooth consistency. We found there was a lot of splatter, however, even at its lowest speed. Oddly, the mixer doesn’t stand up easily on its end, so we had to balance it against the mixing bowl. The Black+Decker was, by far, the loudest of the mixers we tested.</p>
<p>It has a plastic storage case for the entire mixer, which no other mixer we tested had, and it’s reasonably priced. But since the Black+Decker’s lowest speed isn’t low enough to prevent splatter of dry ingredients, we believe you should buy our budget pick, the Oster &#8211; 2500, instead.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Whether you’re a frequent or occasional baker, you’ll want a hand mixer that is reliable, durable and performs all the necessary tasks for baking fluffy cakes and breads and whipping lighter-than-air cream with minimal effort.</p>
<p>We gave our test subjects a rigorous work-out and feel confident that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BHM800SIL-Handy-Scraper-Silver/dp/B00XBOXUWC/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BHM800SIL</a> is unquestionably the best hand mixer you could buy. Its smart design features — like a scrolling-wheel speed changer, mixer light, silicone-coated beaters, extra wire whisk — are worth the Breville’s higher price.</p>
<p>If you want a high-quality mixer that’s not as expensive, we recommend our runner-up, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-HM-90S-Advantage-9-Speed-Handheld/dp/B0034A8C4O/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; HM-90S</a>. It’s also a great performer, and you really can’t beat Cuisinart’s three-year warranty.</p>
<p>For under $20, our budget pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XCCULW/?tag-ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oster &#8211; 2500</a> is a sturdy mixer with five clearly differentiated speeds, giving you a true low for splatter-less mixing and blending.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>A sharper knife is safer knife. That’s because a dull knife can twist askew under pressure and cause injury. And whether amateur cook or home gourmet, you’re much more likely to maintain sharp knives if you can readily perform the task right on your kitchen counter. We set out determine which knife sharpener best solves people’s cutlery maintenance needs with respect to learning curve, effectiveness, cost and especially convenience.</p>
<p>Our initial research took us to expert sites like KnifePlanet.com and KitchenKnifeGuru.com, knife enthusiast sites such as BladeForums.com, plus videos from renowned bladesmith <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MyIsYqyBzY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Murray Carter</a> and YouTube phenom <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTFVJ4xkSrsN0rvocgivjIQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryky Tran</a>. We honed up on traditional versus modern practices, the different grades and types of abrasives, and more. It quickly became clear there are many ways to sharpen a knife — and many different opinions about which method is best.</p>
<p>Informed by the pros’ perspectives, we hopped on Amazon to learn which products appeal to consumers. Our analysis revealed a divide based on user group and knife type. Home cooks prefer to sharpen their chef’s knives with simple devices that do not require training, setup or cleanup. On the flipside, people who own utility, hunting or tactical knives are more apt to commit time toward mastering traditional whetstones or pricey jig systems. Since home chefs value convenience over a mirror-polished edge, we determined not to review whetstones or advanced systems — those methods are best left to expert shops or to enthusiasts who set up on a garage workbench.</p>
<p>With our focus narrowed on easy-to-use devices, we dove deeper into electric knife sharpeners and manual pull-throughs. Consumer review sites like Wirecutter, Cook’s Illustrated, and America’s Test Kitchen helped confirm our top candidates. We also reached out to professional sharpeners Frank from <a href="http://knifesharpeningbyhand.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Art of Sharp</a> and Josh from <a href="http://www.razoredgeknives.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Razor Edge Knives</a> who both graciously shared their insights on abrasives and manual devices. To close out our research, we contacted the major knife manufacturers to learn which sharpening methods they recommend for their cutlery lines.</p>
<p>All this study guided product selections. Our finalists include five electric knife sharpeners (three high-end, plus two budget) and four manual sharpeners (two with triangulated rods, plus two slotted style). To allow for fair comparison, we tried to keep each group at a similar price point. We believe this well-rounded ensemble provided ample opportunity to assess the pros and cons, and offers consumers a wide range of costs to pick from.</p>

<p>At a most basic level, knife sharpening is all about reshaping a deformed steel edge back to a sharp apex. A thinner, more acute angle will slice or even push-cut more easily, while a thicker edge will stand up to more abuse. Either way, making sure the very apex of the edge is as refined as possible ensures its best performance.</p>
<p>With traditional techniques, you pass the blade over an abrasive surface; on each pass you alternate grinding from one side of the blade to the other. Knife sharpening has up to four stages depending on how sharp the blade is to start with.</p>
<h3>Understand traditional sharpening stages</h3>
<p><b>Grinding</b> is the most aggressive stage and uses a coarse mineral abrasive (or even a hard scraping blade) to restore, or “reprofile,” a dull or damaged blade back to a sharp edge. When grinding, you gradually remove metal toward an acute apex as you flip the blade with each pass. This usually forms a “burr,” a ridge of foil-thin metal that hangs onto the edge when it&#8217;s as thin as it can get.</p>
<p><b>Polishing</b> follows grinding as you move from coarse to medium to a fine-grit abrasive. For a quick glimpse of different grit levels that are out there, check out this <a href="https://www.sharpeningsupplies.com/Sharpening-Stone-Grit-Chart-W21.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stone grit chart</a>. At this stage you refine the edge and remove imperfections. Polishing can also be a maintenance step to bring back that extra bit of sharpness after normal use wears your edge down.</p>
<p><b>Stropping</b> removes any remaining burr after grinding and polishing. If you skip this step, the burr will fold back into a dull edge and possibly break off into your food. Stropping is traditionally done with a flexible strip of leather. Unlike the grinding stage where you push the knife edge forward, stropping is performed by dragging away from the edge.</p>
<p><b>Steeling </b>does not remove metal but rather straightens the edge and burnishes it..</p>
<p>As a blade is subjected to impact through daily use, the edge can roll to one side. Steeling realigns the edge and is usually performed with a fine-tooth or smooth sharpening steel (thus the name “steeling”) and works best on knives with soft, tough steel. (Hard steel might just chip instead.) A ceramic or diamond abrasive &#8220;hone&#8221; is starting to replace this tool for many chefs, and will actually do some light polishing rather than just straightening the edge.</p>
<p>In most cases, you either grind, polish and strop to restore a dull or chipped blade, or you can use a steel to maintain an already fairly sharp knife throughout a day of heavy use. If you use knives with extra-hard steel, you will probably just want to polish-and-strop and make sure steels are kept far away from your knives.</p>
<p>Heavy grinding is typically only required if an edge is damaged. You really don’t want to overdo this coarsest stage because it reduces the lifespan of your knife. Edge maintenance, on the other hand, should be done frequently, as often as every couple of uses.</p>
<h3>Choose a sharpening method</h3>

Knife sharpening options can be grouped into four categories.</p>
<p><b>Easy-to-use devices</b> fall into two categories: countertop electrics and handheld manual pull-throughs. These devices are fast, convenient and require very little instruction. The main drawback is that most only sharpen to a specific edge angle, making them less versatile than other methods.</p>
<p><b>Whetstones</b> are the traditional way to sharpen a knife. You alternately grind each side of the blade on a flat, abrasive stone that’s lubricated with water or oil, a sometimes messy procedure. This method relies heavily on technique and can take years to master.</p>
<p><b>Advanced systems</b> range from complicated jigs to machines like water wheels and belt sanders. These tools let you sharpen to very precise edge angles, but they are expensive, require practice, and are best used at a garage workbench.</p>
<p><b>Professional services</b> is the non-DIY option. Other people do the sharpening for you, but for a fee. We found that one-man shops favor traditional whetstones while larger companies use industrial machines. Though bringing or sending your knives to a service takes time, it’s still the best option for high-quality knives.</p>
<p>So which method is best for you? As mentioned earlier, we eliminated whetstones and advanced systems from consideration, as those methods require too much practice or cost too much money for the average home chef. For this review, we are focusing only on convenient methods — and that means either easy-to-use devices or professional services.</p>
<h2 id="professional-sharpening">Professional knife sharpening services</h2>
<p>This is the method you want to use for all your expensive cutlery. With this option, you rely on a skilled professional to handle your high-quality knives with care. Skilled cutlers greatly reduce the risk of damage. This is also a good option for any knives with handles that won’t fit in a home device.</p>
<p>The downside to professional sharpening is twofold: It costs money, and you have to get your knives to the shop. Most services charge around $4-$10 per knife; some charge by inches of blade length, others offer a discount if you sharpen as a bulk order. For transport, if you can’t find a local business, many services let you send by mail or courier and provide detailed instructions on how to safely package your knives.</p>
<p>Many people aren’t aware that knife manufacturers also offer sharpening service. Messermeister and Shun actually provide free lifetime service as part of their warranty (shipping costs excluded). Wüsthof, Henckels and MAC all offer sharpening for fees that are surprisingly reasonable. To share our research, we put together the following chart (bevel angles are for post-2015 product lines; see “Important features” if unfamiliar with bevels).</p>

<p>If you prefer to use a local service, perhaps for quicker turnaround, be sure to do your homework first. The danger is that if your high-end knives end up in unskilled hands, they could be damaged. We turned to Nate Ouderkirk at KitchenKnifeGuru for advice.</p>
<p>Nate is a big proponent of professional cutlers versus large commercial grinding services. Cutlers tend to be sole proprietors, which means you’re much more likely to receive personalized care. Most are highly skilled from many years of experience sharpening hundreds of blades. Best of all, they truly care about their craft so you can trust them with that $300 Bob Kramer Damascus knife.</p>
<p>We’d be doing a disservice if we didn’t also point out Nate’s recommendation for these <a href="http://kitchenknifeguru.com/sharpeners/reviews-of-professional-knife-sharpening-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five top services</a>. We spoke with three of the five (Bob, Frank and Josh) during our research phase. All were highly professional, super friendly and incredibly knowledgeable.</p>
<h2 id="easy-kitchen-devices">Easy-to-use home kitchen sharpeners</h2>
<p>Each of these product categories has a shallow learning curve, performs quickly and readily stores in a kitchen cabinet or drawer. In general, electric sharpeners are much better at edge restoration (i.e., returning a severely dulled blade to sharpness) but come at a higher price point. Manual pull-throughs are geared more toward edge maintenance and typically cost less than electrics.</p>
<h3>Electric sharpeners</h3>
<p>Of all these easy-to-use devices, countertop electrics perform the fastest. Unlike dated, single-slot models that sent sparks flying, today’s electrics are designed with improved abrasives and dedicated slots for coarse, medium and fine grinding. Most include guides that help position the blade for precise edge angles — but you&#8217;re limited to the bevels set by the included guides.</p>
<p>Electric sharpeners use motorized abrasive disks that remove metal faster than with whetstones or jig devices. That’s their key advantage: speed. So long as you don’t overuse the coarse stage, you can quickly restore a worn edge to a sharp apex. With the electrics that we tested, all warned not to use too much downward pressure, as that can wear away the abrasive disks and potentially remove too much knife metal.</p>
<h3>Manual pull-throughs</h3>
<p>Handheld sharpeners can be categorized as two types.</p>
<p><b>Triangulated rod pull-throughs</b> position two abrasive-coated rods to form a V-shaped edge profile. You simply pull the blade through the “V” where the rods meet, using minimal downward pressure. Triangulated-rod devices come in many different designs; but in every case, you hold the knife vertical to maintain a consistent angle. Some models adjust for different edge angles.</p>
<p><b>Slotted pull-throughs</b> are inexpensive and small enough to store in a drawer. Most models come with with two or three stages, with abrasives ranging from diamond to ceramic. Slotted pull-throughs lack the speed and power of electrics, which hinders their ability to restore a severely dulled blade. We encountered more than a few expert opinions complaining that fixed, V-shaped slots can chip and damage blades, so we stuck with products that use rotating disks (not motorized, just free-spinning).</p>

<h3>Bevel angle</h3>
<p>Kitchen knives are typically described as having edges factory-sharpened to a 15- or 20-degree bevel. The bevel angle is usually measured for each side of the knife, though it’s sometimes listed as “inclusionary” in which case the number is doubled (30 or 40 degrees for 15- and 20-degree knives, respectively).</p>
<p>The bevel angle is an important factor. You&#8217;ll want a sharpener that&#8217;s shapes an edge profile appropriate for the majority of your knives. Not all manufacturers list bevel info, so you may have to dig a bit — or even call the company, like we had to do.</p>
<p>Historically, Western-style blades were ground to a 20-degree edge. These blades tended to be made from softer metal, which rendered them less able to hold an acute edge; however, the wider angle will stand up to more force at the cutting board. By comparison, Asian-style blades (mainly from Japan) are typically ground to 15 degrees; these blades tend to be harder, allowing them to sustain a more acute apex, but they’re more susceptible to damage from abuse.</p>
<p>Around 2010, most American and European knife manufacturers switched their lines entirely to 15-degree edges. We found it tough to get a clear answer on why companies changed the angle, but Wüsthof advised it was simply for “higher cutting performance.”</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to stick to the factory bevel, either. For more delicate foods, such as fish and soft vegetables, a 15-degree bevel will allow thinner, finer cuts. If you prep a lot of bone-in meats or love to slam the edge into your cutting board when chopping, then a 20-degree edge will last longer, whatever type of knife you&#8217;re chopping with.</p>
<h3>Number of stages</h3>

<p>The better sharpeners include three stages: a stage-one coarse grind for reprofiling, a stage-two medium grind for refining, and a stage-three polish for edge cleanup. Terms vary among manufacturers, often designated as “sharpening, honing and polishing,” but the way each manufacturer accomplishes those three steps varies dramatically. You ideally want a sharpener that can perform all three stages so you can periodically use the medium grind and polish for maintenance, then use the coarse stage only when you see a chip or heavy wear.</p>
<h3>Type of abrasives</h3>
<p>For most kitchen sharpeners, the abrasive material is impregnated onto belts or metal disks. Abrasive grits range from coarse to medium to superfine. Whether electric or manual, the most common abrasives — in order of hardness — are diamond, alumina ceramic and tungsten carbide..</p>
<p>Abrasives wear out over time. Most will last for a reasonable amount of time (we see five years commonly quoted), again depending on individual use. Still, if you invest in a more expensive product, check to see if the abrasives can be replaced once they wear out. It’s also a perk if the device lets you swap out abrasives for different uses, like the Work Sharp&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B074JHV64C/?tag=ybdsharp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">accessory polishing belts</a>.</p>
<h3>Versatility</h3>
<p>Each device offers different capabilities. Of products researched, the majority can sharpen serrated knives, but not all. Most can also sharpen pocket knives, but very few can accommodate scissors. And none can sharpen ceramic knives, which require a specialized device. So if you have specific needs, be sure to check for that function.</p>
<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>As with other products, the adage “you get what you pay for” applies to knife sharpeners as well. The difference here is that if you go too cheap, you risk damaging your knives, typically by chipping or scratching. It’s important to balance your sharpener investment against the quality of your cutlery.</p>
<h3>Warranty</h3>
<p>Manufacturer warranties are really only of concern with electric sharpeners, mainly due to their higher price and more complicated parts. Most electrics come with a one-year warranty. The exception is Chef’sChoice who offer up to three years on their high-end models.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>First we’ll describe our equipment, then the procedures.</p>
<h3>A device to quantify sharpness</h3>
<p>We included the popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vORqh4BAn5Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper slicing test</a> you might have seen on YouTube. Though a good indicator of when a knife reaches decent sharpness, this test doesn’t clearly define how sharp one knife is relative to others. We wanted to go a step further and also obtain quantitative results.</p>
<p>Our research led us to the <b>PT50B Professional Edge Tester</b>. With this device, you stretch a wire filament across a small gap, then press a knife blade down on the filament until it severs. The PT50B measures the grams of downward pressure required to make the cut. This number indicates relative sharpness: the less downward force required, the sharper the edge.</p>

<p>The PT50B device works hand-in-hand with the Brubacher Edge Sharpness Scale (BESS), developed by Mike Brubacher at Edge On Up, makers of the PT50B. To interpret the numbers (in grams of pressure), we referred to the BESS “C” scale published at Bessu.org. Medical labs, factories and knife pros alike rely on this scale to evaluate sharpness.</p>

<p>Calibrated to yield precise numeric results, the PT50B took the guesswork out of our testing. By taking a reading every certain number of passes, we could tell how quickly each knife became sharper as well as when the blade was ready for the next stage. It also helped us verify that each knife started at roughly the same level of dullness.</p>
<p>The BESS test doesn’t assess all the qualities of a knife edge, but it did help minimize bias in our results. For sake of comparison, we found that once a blade measured around 300-400 it had no problem at all effortlessly slicing through tomatoes.</p>
<h3>Our sacrificial test knives</h3>
<p>For knives, we purchased four Chicago Cutlery 3-piece knife sets. Each set included a 7.5” chef’s knife, a 5.5” utility knife, and a 3.5” paring knife. We used one knife set to test each of our four categories (two types of electrics, plus two types of manuals); this helped establish a level playing field. We also included an 8” thrift store knife, then rounded things out with a couple forged steel chef’s knives from our own collection.</p>

<p>Our new knives were manufactured at a 15-degree edge bevel. But we assumed our older knives, all from the early 2000s, were closer to 20 degrees. We respected these angles to select the appropriate slot in each device.</p>
<p>Lastly, during our initial prep we learned that different points along an edge yield varying sharpness results. So we marked the midpoint of each blade with a Sharpie Marker to ensure that we tested each knife in roughly the same spot.</p>
<h3>Edge dulling and restoration test</h3>

<p>For our first test, we wanted to see which devices could restore a severely dulled edge. We began by blunting our brand-new, out-of-the-box knives on a concrete paver. Granted, this dulled our blades beyond what you&#8217;d see in a typical home kitchen, but it’s the same amount of work you&#8217;d have to do when repairing a chip or other severe damage back to a sharp edge. After about 25 strokes on the paver, all tested at around a 2000 on the PT50B, indicating they weren&#8217;t cutting into the wire at all.</p>
<p>Next, we put our sharpeners to work and followed specific manufacturer instructions. Every product has a different recommended technique, including number of passes per stage, types of strokes and amount of pressure on blade. To show the work required from the user, we counted each stroke — whether affecting one or both sides of blade — as a single pass.</p>
<p>After each recommended number of passes, which varied per device, we used a loupe to visually inspect for a burr. We diligently checked edges at roughly every 5-10 passes and recorded PT50B results to monitor progress. Once the knife was ready to proceed to next stage, we took three BESS readings for each data set and then averaged these numbers to account for margin of error. While the PT50B is accurate, we expected some deviation in the numbers simply because it’s nearly impossible to test the same microscopic point on the edge each time.</p>

<p>We found that all our devices required significantly more passes than described in product instructions. Some may, in fact, appear like ridiculously too many strokes. But we very methodically took a BESS reading at roughly every 10-20 passes — some more, some less, based on visual burr and subsequent readings — and this is truly how many strokes were required.</p>
<p>Again, to frame this fairly, we dulled our knives well beyond even what you&#8217;d see even on an edge that hasn’t been sharpened in a few years. Extreme as it was, this test demonstrates the advantage offered by powered sharpening systems: If they can give you a sharp edge in these conditions, they can handle just about anything.</p>
<p>Let’s also recognize that these brand new devices were tested with fresh abrasives, neither worn down nor metal laden — we can assume each performed as well as it could.</p>
<p>All five electrics were able to restore our dulled knives to a sharp edge. We confirmed this not only with PT50B measurements, but also by making sure each knife could effortlessly slice paper. The Chef’sChoice &#8211; AngleSelect 1520 and the Presto &#8211; EverSharp 08810 delivered best results and restored each type of knife. The Chef’sChoice &#8211; Trizor XV struggled with our old thrift store knife, but on our paring knife it measured the highest sharpness of all finalists. The Work Sharp and LINKYO products restored a sharp edge; however, we experienced awkward control issues with both (see below).</p>
<p>It’s worth sharing that the motors in all our electrics proved surprisingly quiet. Pulling knives through the abrasives was of course noisier, but not to a level that required earplugs.</p>

<p>As expected, our manual sharpeners didn’t fare quite as well as the electrics. A couple did okay with chef’s knives over 7”, but all dropped in performance as we progressed to shorter blades. The Brød &amp; Taylor &#8211; Classic Sharpener was the standout — it restored our 7.5” chef’s knife to a sharpness level on par with the electrics; however, it didn’t do so well with our other test knives.</p>
<p>We were also surprised that the Chef’sChoice &#8211; ProntoPro 4643 reached a sharpness level that could cut paper, even though it took 420 strokes to get there. The same can’t be said for the GLOBAL &#8211; MinoSharp 3; after 700 strokes, it still couldn’t slice paper. As for the Spyderco &#8211; Tri-Angle Sharpmaker, the base package came with medium abrasives, but no coarse abrasives. The Sharpmaker’s medium-grit rods couldn&#8217;t put an apex on our blunted knife even after a frustrating amount of effort.</p>
<h3>Edge maintenance test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14550" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/edge-maintenance-test.png" alt="chart showing edge maintenance test results" width="2000" height="1207" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/edge-maintenance-test.png 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/edge-maintenance-test-610x368.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/edge-maintenance-test-768x463.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/edge-maintenance-test-885x534.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/edge-maintenance-test-1500x905.png 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/edge-maintenance-test-295x178.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/edge-maintenance-test-1000x604.png 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/edge-maintenance-test-360x217.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/edge-maintenance-test-375x226.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/edge-maintenance-test-414x250.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/edge-maintenance-test-320x193.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/edge-maintenance-test-885x534@2x.png 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Our edge restoration test confirmed what we’d read: Manual pull-throughs struggle to reprofile a damaged edge. The abrasives are simply not coarse enough to grind down to a fresh apex. The exception is the tungsten carbide edge on the Brød &amp; Taylor &#8211; Classic Sharpener, which turned out to be a star performer even for damaged blades. The other three manual devices require more passes than anyone should have patience for.</p>
<p>We wanted to give our manual pull-throughs a fair chance at doing what they’re best at, so we set up another test. This time we only dulled the blade to a “moderately rolled edge” as defined on the BESS “C” scale. We anticipated that at this level the devices wouldn’t need to work nearly as hard to succeed.</p>
<p>For this test, we again relied heavily on the PT50B to guide our process. We used it to confirm starting dullness and then took frequent readings. The Brød &amp; Taylor again shined through, requiring remarkably fewer passes than the competition. It’s interesting that it needed 10 more passes than the more demanding edge restoration test, but the results remain impressive.</p>
<p>We were happy to see both the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007IVBET0/?tag=ybdsharp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chef’sChoice &#8211; ProntoPro 4643</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0015S0VN2/?tag=ybdsharp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GLOBAL &#8211; MinoSharp 3</a> cut their required number of passes in half. The ProntoPro hit exactly the sharpness we were looking for, proving this is the task it’s more suited for. The MinoSharp 3 also performed much better, but not as well as the ProntoPro. And though it’s coarse stage did its job, we couldn’t get the medium or fine stages to show any improvement (in fact, our knife actually became less sharp).</p>
<p>We were hoping to see improvement from the revered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000Q9C4AE/?tag=ybdsharp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spyderco &#8211; Tri-Angle Sharpmaker</a>. Based on a call to Spyderco’s tech support, we scrubbed the rods with Comet cleanser to remove any metal particle build-up and ensure best results. But that didn’t improve the medium-grit rods’ performance. After 400 passes on each side — alternating between corners and flat face of rods per the user manual — our PT50B readings indicated our knife was becoming duller than when we started, which led us to abort the mission.</p>
<h3>Product ranking</h3>
<p>As we put our finalists through their paces, we ranked each product by factoring in both our test data and firsthand experience. To assign scores, we considered these qualities and questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Effectiveness</b>: How efficiently can can it sharpen? How many passes required to achieve acceptable sharpness?</li>
<li><b>Control</b>: How easy is it to work the blade through each slot while maintaining consistent contact against the abrasive? Does it feel safe and under user control?</li>
<li><b>Versatility</b>: How many different angles can it sharpen? How many different types of blades?</li>
<li><b>Build quality</b>: Is it made with lots of plastic parts? Does it have a substantial feel?</li>
</ul>

<p>Of all our electrics, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001CA5LZ6/?tag=ybdsharp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chef’sChoice &#8211; AngleSelect 1520</a> is the only model to sharpen both 15- and 20-degree angles, making it the most versatile in our group of five. This setup lets you sharpen older Western-style knives as well as newer blades. And though most knife manufacturers have changed to 15-degree bevels, you might still want the freedom to use a 20-degree edge; for example, if you’re chopping lots of hard foods like boned meats, a 20-degree edge will hold up longer.</p>
<p>As a tradeoff for that flexibility, the 1520 has three slots but actually only two abrasive stages. The first pair sharpens to 15-degrees, the second pair sharpens to 20 degrees and the third pair polishes both angle types. So for any given knife, you never run the blade through all three slots. Still, we think the extra versatility is worth it.</p>
<p>Losing one abrasive stage certainly didn’t hold back the 1520 in our tests. It outperformed other finalists by consistently producing very sharp edges on all our knives; each set of BESS measurements was nicely clustered and averaged out to 280, and in a few cases they came out sharper than new. The 1520 had no problem restoring a dulled edge on old and new knives alike, whereas some contenders just couldn’t get there. With each test, the 1520’s robust motor powered through and never faltered or bogged down.</p>
<p>Chef’sChoice products are made by the EdgeCraft Corporation located in Pennsylvania. One might argue they dominate the world of sharpener products with their robust line of both electric and manual devices (you’ve probably noticed that three of our nine finalists are Chef’sChoice products). They even manufacture electric sharpeners for Wüsthof and Mercer.</p>

Sturdily built, it grinds and polishes both Western-style and Asian-style blades, plus it cleverly incorporates a magnet to collect metal flakes deposited in the housing.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001CA5LZ6/?tag=ybdsharp-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Both our Chef’sChoice finalists are worthy examples of EdgeCraft’s signature high quality. &#8211; For each abrasive stage there are two angled slots that separately sharpen each side of the blade, which is the ideal way to form a burr. Although housed in white plastic, the 1520 feels substantial and has a nice weight, presumably due to the large 125-watt motor that fills the housing. Pedestal rubber feet help it rest stable and secure on a countertop. A single power button keeps controls simple.</p>
<p>For added convenience, the 1520 has a removable magnet molded into its underside that collects metal shavings. You still need to wipe some metal dust from where it falls around the slots, but the magnet handles most of the cleaning. It’s a great idea and appears to be included in most Chef’sChoice electrics.</p>
<p>Also common to their electrics, Chef’sChoice touts “flexible spring guides that provide accurate control of the sharpening angle, for the thickest or thinnest knife blades.” Although marketed as an “advanced” feature, we found the spring-loaded guides to be more annoying than helpful. It’s awkward to start each pass because you have to work your blade between the two plastic guides. That makes it challenging to keep up a smooth rhythm. Also, some knife handles don’t fit, so you can’t sharpen to the very back of heel. In testing the 1520, this was our biggest frustration, but that’s fortunately our only gripe.</p>
<p>In case you’re concerned about long-term durability, the 1520 comes with a three-year warranty; plus, EdgeCraft is well-established company. Moreover, their FAQ web page includes this reassuring info: “If the abrasives need replacement, you may send the sharpener back to EdgeCraft and, for a nominal fee, EdgeCraft will replace the abrasives, clean and lubricate the sharpener and ship it back in almost new condition.” The replacement fee for both the 1520 and the Trizor is $45, plus shipping costs.</p>

<h2 id="budget-electric">Best budget electric: Presto &#8211; EverSharp 08810</h2>
<p><video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" muted="" width="100%" height="auto"><source src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/presto-vid-sm3.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video></p>
<p>Despite its much lower price point, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000TYBWJ0/?tag=ybdsharp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Presto &#8211; EverSharp 08810</a> performed remarkably well in testing. In fact, it restored some of our test knives significantly faster than any other contenders, including the high-end electrics. This earned it not only our budget winner, but nearly compelled us to name it our top pick. However, the Presto only sharpens 20-degree blades, which most major knife manufacturers have phased out of production in favor of 15-degree edges. Although that limitation held it back in overall ranking, it’s a great option if you only own 20-degree blades.</p>
<p>The Presto is one of our only electrics (other than the Trizor XV) that truly performs three-stage sharpening. That increases its versatility, making it handy for both reprofiling and periodic maintenance. It uses Sapphirite abrasives (essentially aluminum oxide) for coarse and medium grinding, plus a ceramic disk for fine polishing. All stages feature angled slots to separately sharpen each side of knife.</p>
<p>In addition to the Presto’s fast and effective sharpening, we really appreciated its excellent control. Our other electrics impregnate abrasives onto metal disks of surprisingly thin-gauge material that are made further flexible by spring axles; they allow for a lot of give. By contrast, the 120-watt Presto uses 5/8&#8243; thick, solid abrasive disks that are firmly fixed in place. We found this design helped us establish and maintain much better contact against the full length of the knife as we passed it through. That’s important for shaping a consistent edge.</p>

Solid half-inch thick abrasive wheels allow your blade to make firm contact. If you only need to sharpen 20-degree knives, it delivers great performance at a bargain price.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000TYBWJ0/?tag=ybdsharp-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Though made with all plastic, the Presto has a substantial feel. It weighs in at 4.8 pounds, slightly heavier than our sturdy Chef’sChoice 4.4-pound models. At just over 13.5” in length, it’s also the longest of our finalists, yet still sized for convenient storage. Five suction-cup feet add to its already hefty countertop stability. And while not part of our ranking system, the Presto scores on style for its modern silver-and-black housing with bright orange guides that offer a fun punch of color.</p>
<p>Perhaps its most unique feature, the Presto is designed with an adjustable blade guide, labeled as thick, medium and thin. We contacted a rep and learned these adjust to roughly 23, 21 and 19 degrees. However, the guides don’t lock into position, but rather allow quite a bit of give, which the rep confirmed is by design. It’s actually meant to accommodate different thickness blades, not to set a bevel angle. Too bad these guides aren’t more rigid because that would solve the problem of electrics not being able to adjust for different edge bevels.</p>
<p>Of course, while the Presto comes at an appealing price, it falls short in a couple areas. First, the warranty is only good for one year, compared to three years offered by our high-end electrics. And unlike the Chef’sChoice electrics, there’s no option to replace disks with fresh abrasives. Still, those are minor drawbacks relative to such strong performance at very reasonable cost.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NB5EGEW/?tag=ybdsharp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brød &amp; Taylor &#8211; Classic Sharpener</a> is one of the more unique products on the market. It features two spring-action bars, each inset with a bar of tungsten carbide, that form a “V” and open to different angles depending on pressure applied. Hand position determines which part of the bar you&#8217;re running the edge across: knife tip down for coarse shaping on a scraping edge, knife tip up for smoothing on a beveled edge, and knife held level for burnishing between the flat plates. You can also sharpen serrated knives by using only one side of the &#8220;V.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company website states that the spring-action bars automatically adjust for different blade angles. Be aware this isn’t as accurate as devices with fixed angles set at 15- or 20-degrees; if you apply too much pressure, the “V” opens to a more obtuse angle. With a bit of practice, you can learn to find the right amount of pressure, typically at a point when the rods first start to separate.</p>
<p>Once you get a feel for when the carbide plates are doing their work, it’s very simple to control. The Brød &amp; Taylor certainly feels a lot gentler on knives than slotted pull-throughs with angled wheels. For longer knives, you may find that your knife tip hits the countertop when performing the tip-down coarse grinding for stage one. We learned it helps to use the device at edge of counter where the blade can extend further down.</p>

Unlike some pull-throughs that struggle with dulled blades, its tungsten carbide edge had no problem shaving metal to form a burr.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NB5EGEW/?tag=ybdsharp-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Brød &amp; Taylor performed well in both our edge restoration and maintenance tests. It restored our new 7.5” chef’s knife to a sharpness level on par with our electrics — and did so in a similar number of passes. That said, it struggled to restore our other kitchen knives, which suggests it’s not as universal as the electrics. We also noticed that the initial coarse stage did a lot more work than the smoothing and burnishing stages. Still, the B&amp;T scored well in our edge maintenance test, where it dominated the other manual pull-throughs by sharpening in dramatically fewer passes.</p>
<p>One negative we can point to is the B&amp;T’s slot width. The tops of the V-configured rods are only separated by a half inch. So if you have a knife with a fatter handle, say 5/8&#8243; or 3/4&#8243; wide, you can still push it through (in order to sharpen heel of blade) but that opens the rods to a wider V-slot which in turn creates a more obtuse edge bevel. It’s something to be aware of if you plan to sharpen wide-handled knives.</p>
<p>With regard to style, the Brød &amp; Taylor truly owns its cutting-edge look. We tested the less expensive polymer model to keep costs down, but the B&amp;T is also available in a brushed stainless steel upgrade if that better matches your kitchen décor. And if you prefer not to keep on countertop, it’s small enough to easily slip into a drawer.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018RSEMU/?tag=ybdsharp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chef’sChoice &#8211; Trizor XV</a> incorporates many of the same winning features (solid build, strong performance, etc.) and minor annoyance (fussy guides) as our top-pick 152o. We’re not going to repeat these common properties here (see above for that) but rather focus on what sets these models apart.</p>
<p>Two interrelated features differentiate the Trizor XV from the EdgeSelect 1520: number of stages and type of edge angles. Unlike the 1520, the Trizor XV is a true three-stage electric sharpener. It uses diamond abrasives for coarse and medium grinding, plus a patented synthetic for the polishing stage.</p>

The Trizor features a coarse grind, medium grind and fine polish so you can reprofile or refine edges as needed.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018RSEMU/?tag=ybdsharp-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Chef’sChoice heavily promotes that the stage-one abrasive can even reprofile a knife from a 20- to a 15-degree edge bevel. The company also describes that the Trizor XV creates a “triple-bevel arch-shaped” edge that cuts cleaner and lasts longer. We can’t vouch for those since claims since we didn’t test for long-term edge durability. What we can report is that the Trizor — for whatever reason — struggled to sharpen both our old thrift store blade and new 5.5” utility knife. Even with our new 7.5” chef’s knife, it took significantly more passes to achieve only marginally better results than the 1520.</p>
<p>We can’t offer an explanation as to why the highly reviewed Trizor XV fell short in our edge dulling and restoration tests. We can only report the numbers as measured. On that front, in our two test knives that the Trizor XV proved most successful with, it attained higher sharpness levels — to a degree equivalent with a utility razor blade — than any other finalist. Unfortunately, it didn’t perform as well for our other test knives.</p>
<p>Here’s something to be aware of: The Chef’sChoice website specifies that the Trizor is available in “brushed metal.” That’s not true — it’s plastic. While it’s made to simulate metal appearance, it’s still plastic. So if you’re looking to pair the Trizor next to that brushed stainless steel toaster, don’t expect to get the same lustrous finish.</p>
<p>Despite inconsistent results, the extreme sharpness we achieved in some tests gives us hope that it simply takes more time to master the Trizor’s subtleties (such as when to shift stages). It remains a solid product that we don’t hesitate to recommend. Still, we prefer the 1520’s dual-angle versatility, which is the main reason we picked it over the Trizor XV.</p>

<p>Top in their line of manual pull-throughs, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007IVBET0/?tag=ybdsharp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chef’sChoice &#8211; ProntoPro 4643</a> is a three-slot, two-stage sharpener. Similar to their 1520 electric, slot one sharpens to 15 degrees, slot two sharpens to 20 degrees and slot three polishes both angles. All three slots use skewed metal wheels coated with diamond abrasives. As described on the Chef’sChoice website, the ProntoPro “CrissCross” technology sharpens both “into” and “out of” the knife edge. They claim this design creates a “highly effective, extremely sharp, burr-free edge with microscopic teeth.”</p>
<p>Despite the claim, the ProntoPro struggled to restore our dulled knives during testing, pretty much as expected. After 400 passes with our 8” thrift store knife, the PT50B device measured barely any improvement at all, forcing us to abort the effort. Our new 5.5” and 3.5” knives showed some improvement, but remained quite dull. However, we were impressed the ProntoPro could actually restore a blunted edge on our 7.5” chef’s knife, taking it to a sharpness level that cleanly sliced paper.</p>
<p>The ProntoPro did a much better job in our edge maintenance test, confirming what other reviewers reported. It readily outperformed our other slotted pull-through, the MinoSharp 3, achieving superior sharpness in roughly a third fewer passes. From a control perspective, it felt unpleasantly awkward to perform the ProntoPro’s recommended back-and-forth strokes; the knife edge tends to lock up in the wheels every few strokes. It helps to ease back on pressure, but the instructions say to push down with 4-5 pounds of pressure, so it’s a balancing act.</p>
<p>Ergonomics-wise, the device offers a firm grip for the required back-and-forth strokes. The top of the handle is rubberized and the proportions feel just right. All in all, the ProntoPro is a sturdy little device that’s well-designed for countertop use. It’s also small enough to fit in a kitchen drawer.</p>
<p>While the ProntoPro is not the best choice for restoring a dulled knife, it does a decent job refining a blade that is already fairly sharp. This type of light maintenance, where you don’t need to push down too hard, helps mitigate our issue with the wheels locking up. Of all finalists, the ProntoPro requires the least setup or manipulation, making it an efficient go-to solution.</p>

<p>Of all nine finalists, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B074HKGQ2G/?tag=ybdsharp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Work Sharp &#8211; Culinary E3</a> is our only belt sharpener. Taking its cue from Work Sharp’s highly respected but more utilitarian <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003IT5F14/?tag=ybdsharp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WSKTS</a> model, the E3 (and E5 upgrade) is their first foray into sharpening knives. Introduced in late 2017, this stylish little unit takes up minimal counter space and easily tucks away in a cupboard.</p>
<p>The E3&#8217;s single abrasive belt is located toward the front face and reminds us of the fan belt on a car engine. You sharpen the knife by alternating pulls through left/right slots at the unit’s tapered top. Angled guides help set the knife bevel. Work Sharp opted for 17 degrees, a middle ground between standard 15- and 20-degree angles.</p>
<p>Instead of different abrasives, the E3 includes a fairly coarse 120-grit belt and has two speed settings: one for sharpening and one for “refining.” It also comes with a separate ceramic rod for polishing or maintenance touch-ups. Compared to our other devices that offer all-in-one solutions, this seems kind of like cheating. However, Work Sharp thoughtfully included two angled guides that make this rod simple to use.</p>
<p>We found it odd that the belt drive only cycles in a counterclockwise rotation. As you pull the knife through the left side, the belt abrades metal toward the blade’s apex. But as you draw the knife through the right side, the belt abrades away from the apex. Not only does this deviate from traditional methods for forming a burr, but it creates such strong friction on the left side that it essentially sucks down the blade. The E3 achieves a decent level of sharpness, but its unwieldiness makes it very difficult to sharpen a consistent edge.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-14545 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/spyderco-tri-angle.jpg" alt="Spyderco Sharpmaker knife sharpener kit on table" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/spyderco-tri-angle.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/spyderco-tri-angle-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/spyderco-tri-angle-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/spyderco-tri-angle-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/spyderco-tri-angle-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/spyderco-tri-angle-1500x1001.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/spyderco-tri-angle-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/spyderco-tri-angle-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/spyderco-tri-angle-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/spyderco-tri-angle-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/spyderco-tri-angle-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/spyderco-tri-angle-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Of all finalists, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000Q9C4AE/?tag=ybdsharp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spyderco &#8211; Tri-Angle Sharpmaker</a> comes closest to traditional whetstone sharpening. The device includes two abrasive rods that you insert in a plastic base to form a “V” shape; each side of the “V” is angled for either 15- or 20-degree bevels. You then hold the blade in a pure vertical orientation and draw it down and toward you against the rods. Compared to our other contenders, the Sharpmaker feels by far the most natural way to sharpen a knife as well as the least risky for chipping or oversharpening.</p>
<p>The Sharpmaker also offers the most versatility. Because the rods are open and the blade isn’t constrained by a fixed slot, you are free to adjust the knife for slightly different angles. You can even use the rods laying flat in the bottom of the base like a traditional bench stone, or pull them out to use like files. That freedom also means you can sharpen a wide variety of tools. In addition to most any knife type, the Sharpmaker works on scissors, fishing hooks, wire cutters, screwdrivers, chisels and even pinking shears.</p>
<p>Further expanding its versatility, Spyderco offers different abrasive rods to insert in the Sharpmaker base. In addition to the basic kit’s medium- and fine-grit stones, you can also purchase ultra-fine, diamond and “cubic boron nitride” stones as accessories (the latter CBN stones are similar to diamond abrasion but should last longer). Rods are sold in pairs and range in price from about $15 to $50.</p>
<p>So with all those positives, why have we not named the Sharpmaker one of our winners? The problem comes down to the abrasives included in the base package. Per the description on Spyderco’s website: “The Sharpmaker system includes two sets of high-alumina ceramic stones — a pair of medium-grit (brown) stones for aggressive sharpening and a set of fine (white) stones for professional-grade finishing.” During our research phase, we contacted their support team to confirm that the Sharpmaker could restore an edge to a damaged knife, and we were advised the medium stones could indeed reprofile an edge to an apex.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we could not get the medium-grit rods to restore either a severely worn or moderately rolled edge in our tests. Without buying more aggressive rods, we could not test it on an even playing field with our other finalists. We dug a little deeper and learned that Spyderco&#8217;s high-alumina ceramics use micron-sized particles roughly half the size of most &#8220;fine&#8221; diamond abrasive in other systems. It appears this makes them more appropriate for making sharp blades even sharper (i.e., starting to do their job from where other sharpeners leave off).</p>
<p>We’re confident the Sharpmaker is a fine product because two of the professional cutlers we spoke with (Frank and Josh) each shared that they regularly use it to supplement whetstone sharpening. We really appreciate the Sharpmaker’s natural feel, and its technique is very simple to learn. Though it didn’t deliver great results for our specific tests, that might be one of its strengths: Because it gradually abrades metal, it’s the least likely of our devices to cause damage — in fact, we wouldn’t hesitate to use the Sharpmaker on even our high-end cutlery.</p>
<p>If you want to restore even moderately dulled blades, be prepared to invest in Spyderco’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000WUKFBM/?tag=ybdsharp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">diamond rods</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KNRP3SO/?tag=ybdsharp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CBN rod sets</a> that each cost around $50. That might seem a steep price for an add-on item, but such flexibility opens a wide range of sharpening options and allows you to replace abrasives as they wear out over time.</p>
<h3>LINKYO &#8211; 2-Stage Sharpener</h3>

Second of two budget electrics we tested, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VSDULFW/?tag=ybdsharp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LINKYO &#8211; 2-Stage Sharpener</a> is about two-thirds the size and cost of the Presto. It also features only two sharpening stages rather than three. Both stages use diamond abrasives, one for coarse sharpening and the other for fine polishing (though to our ears it sounded more a grind than a polish). Like the Presto, the LINKYO includes suction-cup feet to hold it in place and removable plugs to empty out metal shavings.</p>
<p>For a budget product, the LINKYO seems a fine compact unit; it’s just not all that remarkable, especially compared to the Presto. The LINKYO shaped knives to a similar sharpness as our other electrics (as tested with our BESS device). But we found control to be an issue. That’s because its abrasives are impregnated on metal disks not only very thin in gauge but also small in diameter. It felt less firm as we drew our knives, and it also produced a tinny noise.</p>
<p>Not to pile on, but it’s worth noting the LINKYO comes with barely any instructions and no direction at all on how many passes to make through each slot.</p>
<h3>GLOBAL &#8211; MinoSharp 3</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-14541 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/global-minosharp-3.jpg" alt="Global MinoSharp 3 manual knife sharpener" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/global-minosharp-3.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/global-minosharp-3-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/global-minosharp-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/global-minosharp-3-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/global-minosharp-3-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/global-minosharp-3-1500x1001.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/global-minosharp-3-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/global-minosharp-3-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/global-minosharp-3-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/global-minosharp-3-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/global-minosharp-3-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/global-minosharp-3-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Second of our two slotted pull-throughs, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0015S0VN2/?tag=ybdsharp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GLOBAL &#8211; MinoSharp 3</a> is our only finalist that uses ceramic abrasives in all three slots. It’s also our only device that incorporates a water trough. Each ceramic wheel rests halfway in a trough and is skewed at an angle to its knife slot. And that’s where our complaint lies: Like the ProntoPro, the knife tends to get stuck in the groove cut into each wheel’s center. It’s very awkward unless you apply barely any pressure, but then the abrasives don’t do their job.</p>
<p>We didn’t notice that the water added any improvement; it’s not like the wheels move fast enough for the blade to require cooling, as with a traditional water wheel. The trough actually adds extra steps (to fill and empty), but the flip-top does make it easy to clean, unlike other handheld pull-throughs that can clog with metal.</p>
<p>Novelty aside, the all-plastic MinoSharp 3 just didn’t deliver on performance. In testing, we could not get it to restore a dulled blade (we abandoned the cause after 600 strokes). It did okay, but not great, in our edge maintenance test. The problem with the MinoSharp 3 is that the ceramic wheels aren’t as effective as more aggressive abrasives in other devices. Another shortcoming is that it only sharpens 15-degree knives, but that’s a minor issue compared to its subpar performance.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Today’s consumer electric sharpeners and manual pull-throughs can’t replace a highly skilled cutler armed with a whetstone and lots of time to get the job done. But these easy-to-use kitchen devices certainly deliver on convenience, speed and economy.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001CA5LZ6/?tag=ybdsharp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chef’sChoice &#8211; AngleSelect 1520</a> ranked at the top for all four of our scoring categories: effectiveness, control, versatility and build quality. Some of our top performers struggled on certain knives, but the 1520 delivered consistently sharp results on old and new knives alike. It also outperformed its Chef’sChoice counterpart, the newer Trizor XV. Even if most of your knives aren’t manufactured to a 20-degree angle, it’s nice to have that option in case you want to set a wider bevel to last longer for cutting bone-in meats or tough vegetables.</p>
<p>Scoring in second place, we were surprisingly impressed by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000TYBWJ0/?tag=ybdsharp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Presto &#8211; EverSharp 08810</a>. For a budget-priced model, it sharpened our test knives in significantly fewer passes than all other electrics.</p>
<p>Looking to our manual devices, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NB5EGEW/?tag=ybdsharp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brød &amp; Taylor &#8211; Classic Sharpener</a> is a versatile, capable improvement of the steel chefs and butchers have always relied on. It doesn&#8217;t polish an edge the way fancy abrasives will, but it&#8217;s very capable at scraping and burnishing to a sharp apex.</p>
