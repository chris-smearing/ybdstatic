<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>For insight into the process other parents have gone through when selecting formula, we talked with three sets of parents from various walks of life to see what formula their babies liked best. We found that most parents can&#8217;t decipher the differences between formulations, much less understand why some work better for their babies.</p>
<p>We boned up on the background of infant nutrition with detailed guidance from <a href="https://babyformulaexpert.com/about-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Bridget Young</a> and <a href="https://www.askdrsears.com/topics/feeding-eating/bottle-feeding/choosing-formula" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. William Sears</a>, two experts whose guides are linked all over parenting blogs and discussion groups. We had hoped to get a more concrete set of criteria from the experts, but we found out that even the researchers can&#8217;t point to one specific set of ingredients that will make the perfect formula for everyone.</p>
<p>We researched the manufacturers of formula to see if there was anything notable about specific standards or practices. The US Food and Drug Administration imposes stringent regulations on ingredients, but we did find a few common variations that are discussed below.</p>
<p>Our final selections were based on price, availability, and a comparison of ingredients lists to find a full range of options that can satisfy even the compulsive label-readers among our friends and family.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s in your baby&#8217;s formula is the subject of a government-regulated standard, the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/infant-formula-guidance-documents-regulatory-information/regulations-and-information-manufacture-and-distribution-infant-formula" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s Infant Formula Act</a> (&#8220;IFA&#8221;). Just as with most nutritional guidelines, dieticians and researchers have worked to define the minimum and maximum amounts of basic nutrients, vitamins and minerals that go into a product.</p>
<p>The IFA requires manufacturers to register and test any infant formula that&#8217;s brought to market and also regulates quality standards, including a procedure for issuing recalls. All infant formula legally sold in the U.S. meets the IFA standards.</p>
<h3>Water</h3>
<p>OK, this isn&#8217;t a nutrient or ingredient in dry formula, but babies get all of the water they need from the milk or formula you give them.</p>
<p>Tap water from a city supply system is — generally speaking — just as safe as bottled water, but neither is sterile. Parents are advised to boil water before mixing up a bottle of formula to eliminate any risk of bacterial or viral exposure, even when using bottled water. If you have any doubts about lead in your pipes or other low-level sources of contaminants in your water, check out our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-faucet-water-filter/">faucet water filter</a> and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">water filter pitcher reviews</a> for alternatives to bottled water.</p>
<h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
<p>Sugar, in one form or another, is the main ingredient in milk. The average 100 milliliters of breast milk has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3586783/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">between 5 and 8 grams of sugar</a>. Lactose is sugar, <a href="https://babyformulaexpert.com/sugar-in-baby-formula/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">though it&#8217;s digested differently</a> than the glucose and fructose we harvest from plants.</p>
<p>Most of the popular formula brands use only lactose to add enough calories (about double what you get from cow milk) for growing babies. In a few cases corn syrup is added instead of extra lactose. If your baby can&#8217;t digest lactose, you will need a formula that specifically lists lactose-free ingredients like soy protein instead of &#8220;milk&#8221;.</p>
<h3>Fat</h3>
<p>The next ingredient on the list is fat, at 3.8 grams per average 100 mL of breast milk. Most fat in baby formula is from plant oils: Typically, that includes saturated fats from palm oil and a lighter type like sunflower oil blended in ratios that resemble the fat in breast milk.</p>
<p>Some research suggests that the way palm-oil fats is structured can cause complications in digestion, specifically because palm-oil fats can bind to calcium and make it indigestible. <a href="https://babyformulaexpert.com/baby-formula-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Young says in her formula guide</a> that manufacturers usually make up for that with extra calcium, so fat types are lowest on her priorities. <a href="https://kabritausa.com/blogs/nourish-blog/palm-oil-calcium-soaps-palmitic-acid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kabrita has a neat explainer on palm oil</a> if you want more details, but remember that it&#8217;s an advertisement.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got a pre-term baby who hasn&#8217;t developed full bone density, you&#8217;ll probably want to use a formula like Similac or Kirkland Signature that doesn&#8217;t rely on palm oil.</p>
<h3>Protein</h3>
<p>Protein is the least-significant nutrient in milk by weight, at only 1.3 grams for 100 mL. Protein usually comes from cow-milk whey.</p>
<p>Protein is usually the trickiest nutrient for tiny tummies to digest. If your baby has trouble with constipation, it might be because of the cow-milk proteins in the formula — not the lactose, just the protein. <a href="https://www.drgreene.com/qa-articles/milk-constipation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One study found that 65 percent of babies with constipation problems saw an improvement after switching to formula made with soy protein.</a></p>
<h3>Substitutions and easy-to-digest options</h3>
<p>Most experts suggest trying formula with a hydrolyzed protein to make digestion easier. These types of formula are usually labelled with names like &#8220;gentle&#8221; or &#8220;sensitive.&#8221; If pre-digested whey protein doesn&#8217;t make a difference, a soy-protein-based formula is probably in your future.</p>
<p>If different protein doesn&#8217;t help, lactose-free formula is often the next step. Typically this involves using plant sugars that can be digested without the lactase enzyme.</p>
<h3>Supplemental ingredients</h3>
<p>These days, formula packaging calls out non-essential, supplemental ingredients that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3922793/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren&#8217;t covered by FDA regulations</a>. These additives range from specially-derived oils to &#8220;prebiotic&#8221; sugars that encourage the right kinds of bacteria to grow in your baby&#8217;s tummy.</p>
<p>All of these additional ingredients are designed to mimic breast milk, but remember that breast milk varies, and the effectiveness and necessity of each additive is still going through long-term research. Just because a formula manufacturer claims a certain ingredient helps brain growth doesn&#8217;t mean your baby will be deficient without it.</p>
<p>If your baby can easily digest a formula and get the essential calories, fat and protein they need, you&#8217;ve done your job well. Finding a nifty set of extra supplements is icing on that cake.</p>
<p>Many watch-dog agencies like the Cornucopia Institute and blogs like FoodBabe also raise awareness about ingredients like lecithin, the trace amounts of hexane you can find in formula from extracted oils. The FDA says formula is safe if it&#8217;s made according to industry standards, but there&#8217;s plenty of room for the concerned parent to ask if some formula could be even more safe.</p>

<h3>Organic and GMO-free certifications</h3>
<p>Food certification is important to many consumers, but it&#8217;s also big business. Remember that even if you pay double or triple for a tub of premium formula, it&#8217;s still meeting the same nutritional standards as all the other formula on the shelf and usually comes from the same factory.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (&#8220;USDA&#8221;) guidelines for organic certification are strict and definitive, so certified organic formulas with the USDA seal are sourced from organic farms in a traceable supply chain.</p>
<p>Our researcher for this post has worked with a family farm to get organic certification in California and can testify to the level of detail required by inspectors and auditors. That said, there&#8217;s usually no discernable difference in the resulting food, and the heavily processed ingredients in formula aren&#8217;t covered in pesticides or fertilizers the way something like lettuce can be.</p>
<p>If trace amounts of stuff that&#8217;s not allowed in the USDA organic certification program — that list ranges from antibiotics that may be fed to cows, herbicide sprayed on seeds or solvents used to extract oil from soybeans — bother you, most brands have a second label and a higher price tag for nearly-identical formula made from milk and oils that should have had less exposure to those things.</p>
<p>The potential exposure to non-certified ingredients isn&#8217;t entirely avoided by buying certified organic baby formula, though: The <a href="https://www.cornucopia.org/2013/12/find-safest-organic-infant-formula/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cornucopia Institute filed an official complaint in 2008 </a>because formula manufacturers were allowed to add specialized ingredients (DHA and ARA oils which contribute to eye development) to certified organic formula, even though these ingredients had been extracted with hexane solvents.</p>
<p>The USDA and FDA haven&#8217;t enforced a ruling by the National Organics Standards Board that the extracted ingredients should disqualify formula from organic certification. So, as consumers, we&#8217;re left to shrug our shoulders about the implications or do our own research and find a product that&#8217;s made differently.</p>
<p>Thus far <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007GH8R4Q/?tag=ybdform-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baby&#8217;s Only</a> is the only manufacturer using an alternative oil extracted from eggs with water, but their formula is not tested for feeding infants and is sold as a toddler formula. Some formulas are available without DHA and ARA, but most pediatricians recommend that it be included.</p>
<p>Genetically modified organisms (&#8220;GMOs&#8221;) are an even trickier subject. Right now <a href="http://gmoanswers.com/current-gmo-crops" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are only ten GMO crops</a>, so most plant ingredients in baby formula couldn&#8217;t come from GMO varieties anyhow. The impact of GMO-free sourcing is biggest in soy-based formula, since most soybeans grown in the U.S. come from the biotech seed labs. But between sugar from corn and sugar beets and oils from canola and soybeans, there are opportunities for ingredients from modified-genome plants to pop up.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that formula ingredients are at their most basic molecular structure and don&#8217;t contain DNA. <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/01/21/378882909/why-some-gmo-foods-don-t-have-genetically-modified-dna" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When NPR investigated GMO-free labelling standards</a>, they found that most common GMO-derived ingredients wouldn&#8217;t even be detectable if we screened carefully for them.</p>
<p>When the <a href="https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2018/12/20/Final-GMO-labeling-rule-does-not-require-labeling-of-highly-refined-ingredients-from-GM-crops-if-no-modified-genetic-material-is-detectable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">final U.S. regulations for mandatory GMO labelling</a> come into play in 2020, processed products like baby formula will not have to disclose if they use sugar, oil or protein from GMO plants. Voluntary &#8220;GMO-free&#8221; labels are still going to be common, but they don&#8217;t mean any more for baby formula than they do for water in most cases.</p>

<p>The FDA doesn&#8217;t publish a list of approved formula, though they do have specific rules about registration and what has to be in formula. <a href="https://www.nj.gov/health/fhs/wic/documents/List_of_Infant_Formula_Manufacturers_Wholesalers_and_Distributors.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to this list maintained by the state of New Jersey,</a> there are only four major FDA-registered manufacturers of formula in the U.S.: Abbot (Similac), Mead Johnson (Enfamil), Nestle (Gerber) and Perrigo (nearly every other brand).</p>
<p><b>Abbot Nutrition Brands</b> makes Similac formula, which has been around since 1923. We strongly suspect that Abbot also makes the Kirkland Signature formula for Costco, since it&#8217;s so similar in every possible way. Note the identical packaging in the above photo, but also the absence of palm oil in the ingredient lists. Naturally, neither company will verify where Costco buys their product, and it is possible they could switch suppliers without warning.</p>
<p><b>Mead Johnson Nutrition</b> has been around since 1903, and their Enfamil formula was launched in 1964. This is another key player in the brand-name formula race.</p>
<p><b>Nestle </b>is one of the oldest and best-known formula manufacturers, though you won&#8217;t see the name on a bottle of formula in the U.S. Nestle acquired the <b>Gerber</b> baby food company in 2007, and they merged the two lines for sales in the U.S., while using the Nestle name in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>Pharmacist Henri Nestle designed a breast milk replacement in 1867, and his work on condensing milk built a multinational food company that has changed the way we buy chocolate, milk and even water.</p>
<p>Nestle was so aggressive in their worldwide marketing of formula in the 1970s that <a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/nestle-baby-formula-boycott/melissa-sartore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some called them baby killers</a>, after mothers without the means to safely prepare formula were effectively tricked into decreasing their own breast milk supplies when they used free formula samples handed out by saleswomen dressed as nurses.</p>
<p>The distinctive feature of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N8RTWZR/?tag=ybdform-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gerber &#8211; Good Start</a> formula is that it&#8217;s only available with added probiotics and broken-down, easier-to-digest protein, comparable to a &#8220;sensitive&#8221; or &#8220;gentle&#8221; formula from other brands.</p>
<p><b>Perrigo</b> makes basically every other formula sold in the United States. They have an in-house brand, but you&#8217;ll have an easier time buying their products from other major retailers. Perrigo even runs a website called &#8220;<a href="https://www.storebrandformula.com/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storebrandformula.com</a>&#8221; to ease concerns about buying &#8220;cheap&#8221; alternatives to brand-name &#8220;premium&#8221; formula.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to spot Perrigo formula by the packaging once you know what to look for, and they&#8217;re now making formula for everyone from Amazon to Whole Foods to Target. Even the premium-priced Organic formula from Happy Baby, Earth&#8217;s Best Organic and Honest Company almost certainly came out of a Perrigo facility.</p>
<p>One other manufacturer, <a href="https://www.prolacta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Prolacta</b></a>, makes formula out of donated breast milk to help pre-term infants. It&#8217;s not commonly available and is classified separately by the FDA.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Parent-s-Choice-HMO-Non-GMO-Advantage-Infant-Formula-with-Iron-4-Pack-35-oz-ea/780084641" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parent&#8217;s Choice &#8211; Infant Formula</a> is the store-brand formula available at Walmart, and it&#8217;s the formula you should probably try first.</p>
<p>Since infant formula is so strictly regulated in terms of nutrition, and since different babies will respond in different ways to formula, we stuck with price and availability as our key selection criteria for a top pick. You can get this formula shipped or pick it up in-store, and it&#8217;s almost always the least expensive.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to remember when comparison shopping that Perrigo makes almost every store-brand formula on the market and quite a few custom-label organic formula brands.</p>
<p>Now, we can&#8217;t say for certain that there will never be a difference between what Perrigo puts in a particular brand&#8217;s tub. For example, Honest Company specifically gets Perrigo to leave out the algae-derived DHA/RDA supplement that&#8217;s been the subject of minor controversy.</p>
<p>But the most significant differences are always going to be in protein types and sugar types offered for special dietary needs. Brands don&#8217;t matter much in picking one of these, since they all follow the same rules and offer the same lines of alternative blends to help you find something your baby can digest well.</p>
<p>Walmart sells the same six basic formula types that all the other full-line retailers do: a Similac clone, an Enfamil clone, a clone of the easy-digestion recipes from those brands, an organic formula and a dairy-free formula. They&#8217;re all certified and tested to be good formula.</p>

This is top-notch formula at a very competitive price.</p><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Parent-s-Choice-HMO-Non-GMO-Advantage-Infant-Formula-with-Iron-4-Pack-35-oz-ea/780084641" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Walmart.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The one distinction between Parent&#8217;s Choice formula and the competition that gave us pause is that the <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Parent-s-Choice-Organic-Infant-Formula-With-Iron-23-2-oz/35849584" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">organic version of the formula</a> uses corn syrup solids and maltodextrin, rather than lactose, for its sugar calories. Many parents are leery of corn syrup, but that one ingredient is probably behind the price difference between this and other organic brands.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re willing to pay a little bit more to avoid retailers like Walmart and Target, our runner-up pick from Kirkland Signature is also a very good formula. But they only sell one type of formula, while Parent&#8217;s Choice has an entire lineup of options.</p>
<p><b>Recall update:</b> <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/perrigo-issues-voluntary-recall-parents-choice-advantage-infant-formula-milk-based-powder-iron" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I</a>n the summer of 2019, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/perrigo-issues-voluntary-recall-parents-choice-advantage-infant-formula-milk-based-powder-iron" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perrigo recalled 23,388 tubs</a> of Parent&#8217;s Choice &#8211; Advantage after metal was found in one specific batch. That&#8217;s worth noting, but it&#8217;s far less serious than, for example, the e. coli contamination outbreaks in lettuce that were announced in late 2018. Other manufacturers have issued formula recalls before, because mistakes happen in manufacturing and the recall system catches them. Premium brands are no less likely to be recalled, there have actually been <a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/infant-formula-recalls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more recalls for top-dollar formula</a> than store brands. We want buyers to be informed about recalls, but we haven&#8217;t changed our opinions about the quality of Parent&#8217;s Choice.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Parent&#8217;s Choice &#8211; Infant Formula is easy to find and the most affordable.</li>
<li>If your baby has a special dietary need, you can probably find a suitable formula from Parent&#8217;s Choice.</li>
<li>This formula is made in a certified facility that follows the same regulations as everyone else.</li>
<li>Most other store-brand formula is likely to be identical to the Parent&#8217;s Choice equivalent.</li>
<li>Walmart will typically ship formula to your door just as quickly as anyone else.</li>

<p>If you&#8217;ve tried another formula and your baby isn&#8217;t responding well, or if you&#8217;ve got a baby who needs extra calcium, <a href="https://www.costco.com/Kirkland-Signature-Non-GMO*-Infant-Formula-34-oz%2C-3-count.product.100292648.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirkland Signature &#8211; Infant Formula</a> is a palm-oil-free blend that might be a better choice than the other store brands, for only slightly more per ounce.</p>
<p>Costco Wholesale&#8217;s Kirkland Signature line is probably the most prestigious store brand you can find, generally supplying top-shelf products at a substantial discount. When we found the Kirkland baby formula on the shelf one bay over from the Similac formula, we could hardly believe how similar they were. From the ingredients to the packaging, it&#8217;s certain that Costco&#8217;s store brand formula is made by Abbot, the company that makes Similac.</p>
<p>Kirkland formula has a very slightly different formulation from the full-price Similac &#8211; Pro Advance that it&#8217;s based on, but note that they&#8217;ve changed the serving size listed in the nutritional information to make it difficult to compare the two containers.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.costco.com/Kirkland-Signature-Non-GMO*-Infant-Formula-34-oz%2C-3-count.product.100292648.html" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kirkland-thumb-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kirkland-thumb-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kirkland-thumb-180x180@2x.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kirkland-thumb-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kirkland-thumb-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kirkland-thumb-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kirkland-thumb-180x180.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kirkland-thumb-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kirkland-thumb.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Alternate Ingredients: Kirkland Signature</h3><p>Kirkland Signature items are often a great way to buy top quality without breaking the bank, and this baby formula is no exception. If you're looking to avoid calcium-absorbing palm oil, this is the most affordable brand that doesn't use it.</p><a href="https://www.costco.com/Kirkland-Signature-Non-GMO*-Infant-Formula-34-oz%2C-3-count.product.100292648.html" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Costco.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>As with most formula, Kirkland Signature advertises specialized fat and sugar ingredients claimed to mimic breast milk more closely than the basic lactose and protein from processed cow milk.</p>
<p>The big difference on this ingredient list is one that&#8217;s starting to draw attention: Like Similac, Kirkland Signature formula doesn&#8217;t use palm oil to match the high ratio of palmitic-type fats found in breast milk, but uses coconut oil instead.</p>
<p>Palm oil is linked to reduced calcium absorption, so using it means other manufacturers have to add some extra calcium just to make up the difference. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5475287/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palm oil is also associated with harder poop</a>, so if you&#8217;re dealing with a constipated baby, Kirkland Signature is worth investigating.</p>
<p>What Costco doesn&#8217;t give is a full line of formula types. If you&#8217;re looking for formula with processed proteins for easier digestion, or if your baby is allergic to cow-milk proteins and you need dairy-free formula, you&#8217;ll need to buy another brand.</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s also the cost of a Costco membership to consider—but over just one year, you&#8217;d save nearly $800 buying Kirkland signature formula instead of Similac. That difference covers a membership easily.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Kirkland Signature &#8211; Infant Formula is a premium product at a great price.</li>
<li>This formula doesn&#8217;t use palm oil, which is an ingredient many parents are choosing to avoid.</li>
<li>Another brand with similar ingredients is Similac, which sells for nearly double the price.</li>
<li>Kirkland only sells standard baby formula, no options for sensitive babies.</li>

<p>Among the organic formulas we tried, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WLH9LQF/?tag=ybdform-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Happy Baby &#8211; Organic Infant Formula</a> is corn-syrup free and slightly higher in gut-bacteria-nurturing prebiotics. The price isn&#8217;t the best, but it&#8217;s fairly easy to find in stores like Whole Foods.</p>
<p>Every single indication points to Perrigo as a manufacturer for Happy Baby formula, just like the store brands. From the taste of the formula to the special storage clip for the plastic scoop, Happy Baby formula is at least a sibling of other Perrigo-made organic brands.</p>

Happy Baby also adds more prebiotics than most other formula blends, which might help digestion.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WLH9LQF/?tag=ybdform-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Compared to Parent&#8217;s Choice &#8211; Organic Infant Formula, which costs 17 cents more per ounce than the regular stuff, Happy Baby will set you back about a dollar more per ounce. They&#8217;re subject to the same restrictions on where they can get ingredients and what can go into formula either way, but Happy Baby chose not to use corn syrup as a source for sugar, just organic lactose.</p>
<p>Organic formula is still a heavily processed product, so only trace amounts of synthetic pesticide or fertilizer could possibly show up in the final product. We don&#8217;t think organic formula is a good value, but if you&#8217;re committed to buying organic this is a good option.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Happy Baby &#8211; Organic Infant Formula is like other Perrigo formula, but with certified organic ingredients.</li>
<li>Slightly more prebiotic ingredients than other organic brands might help digestion.</li>
<li>No corn syrup, just lactose for the calories your baby needs.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s also a low-lactose and older-baby version of this formula available.</li>

<p>Basically, everything we&#8217;ve said about Parent&#8217;s Choice formula above is also true of <a href="https://www.target.com/p/advantage-hmo-infant-formula-35oz-compare-to-similac-pro-advance-up-up-153/-/A-70000043" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Up &amp; Up &#8211; Infant Formula from Target</a>. The descriptions of the prebiotic ingredients are slightly different, but equivalent.</p>
<p>The biggest difference we saw between Walmart and Target is that Walmart offers formula in packages of four tubs. Buying in bulk will save you 13 cents per ounce, which adds up to about $200 per year. Target runs promotions once in a while that bring the price in line with Walmart, but you&#8217;d have to wait and stock up when the time is right.</p>
<h3>Similac</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24354" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac.jpg" alt="Similac" width="2000" height="1335" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-1000x668@2x.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-885x591.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-180x120@2x.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-1000x668.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-320x214.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-885x591@2x.jpg 1770w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-320x214@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to turn your nose up at store-brand formula and only consider the big-name baby formula brands despite all the regulated similarities, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Similac-Pro-Advance-Non-GMO-Formula-Support/dp/B01KQ9DNV2/?tag=ybdform-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Similac &#8211; Pro-Advance</a> is the brand that makes the most sense to us. They don&#8217;t use palm oil, which means better calcium absorption and possibly softer poop for your baby.</p>
<p>Similac &#8211; Advantage is so similar to the blend of ingredients used in Kirkland Signature that we find it hard to think of a reason to pay extra for the name brand. We tried the Similac &#8211; Pro-Advance, and it is very slightly different in texture and flavor because of an added prebiotic sugar called &#8220;Human Milk Oligosaccharide&#8221; or &#8220;HMO.&#8221; This is a sugar that isn&#8217;t digested; instead, it stays in your baby&#8217;s gut and feeds the beneficial bacteria that help digest food.</p>
<p>In our testing, we found that this formula was the first to smell slightly fishy and possibly rancid after we stored a few samples separately from the bigger containers for a few weeks. Definitely keep this stuff in a cool, dry place.</p>
<p>The price of Similac is just about double that of Parent&#8217;s Choice or Kirkland Signature, at $1.18 per ounce. Similac does sell a certified organic version of their formula, while Enfamil does not.</p>
<h3>Enfamil</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24348" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Enfamil.jpg" alt="Enfamil" width="2000" height="1335" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Enfamil-1000x668@2x.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Enfamil-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Enfamil-885x591.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Enfamil-180x120@2x.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Enfamil-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Enfamil-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Enfamil-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Enfamil-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Enfamil-1000x668.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Enfamil-320x214.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Enfamil-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Enfamil-885x591@2x.jpg 1770w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Enfamil-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Enfamil-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Enfamil-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Enfamil-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Enfamil-320x214@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The other big-name player in the baby-formula world is Enfamil with their line of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077M4Q27K/?tag=ybdform-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neuro-Pro formula</a>. Our test family has received Enfamil formula samples every time they had a new baby, so they must be working closely with obstetricians or hospitals to get access to new parents.</p>
<p>Enfamil&#8217;s primary distinction is a new type of fat they call &#8220;milk fat globule membrane&#8221; (&#8220;MGFM&#8221;). This fatty compound is supposed to make formula based on cow milk a little bit closer to human milk, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27234413" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they&#8217;ve shown in some research</a> that it might promote brain development better than regular formula. They got in trouble with advertising watchdogs for suggesting so boldly that Enfamil is better at growing brains, but it is a unique additive.</p>
<p>Enfamil&#8217;s NeuroPro blend is the most expensive formula we tested, at about $1.29 per ounce or $2,000 for a year&#8217;s supply.</p>
<p>Enfamil has a full line of options for babies with sensitive stomachs or allergies, but they don&#8217;t offer a certified organic product.</p>
<h3>Earth&#8217;s Best</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AHZ5JOY/?tag=ybdform-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Earth&#8217;s Best &#8211; Organic Infant Formula</a> is one of the oldest and best-known certified organic formula brands, and it&#8217;s only gotten better with time.</p>
<p>This certified organic baby formula used to be the least-expensive on the market. Since Parent&#8217;s Choice started offering a lower-lactose organic formula for a much lower price, and Happy Baby is offering a blend with more prebiotics for only 4 cents more per ounce, it&#8217;s hard to pick this as an overall winner.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/b01ltho2kq/?tag=ybdform-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Earth&#8217;s Best does sell a DHA-free version of this formula</a>, but the price bump is insane: You pay an extra ten dollars per tin just to have a tiny amount of oil (and a few parts per billion of potential solvent exposure) left out. Most pediatricians strongly recommend you buy a formula with DHA, and supplement drops are a pain to deal with.</p>
<h3>Kabrita &#8211; Toddler Formula</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MJ4ZC62/?tag=ybdform-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kabrita &#8211; Toddler Formula</a> is the only formula on our list that hasn&#8217;t been tested and approved for feeding infants by the FDA, so it can&#8217;t legally be sold as an infant formula. Hence the name &#8220;Toddler Formula.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kabrita has become a trendy option for infant formula all the same, and it&#8217;s the most-recommended goat-milk option. Here are a few points of interest for goat milk formula:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goat milk might not cause as much discomfort as cow milk if your baby is sensitive to casein proteins that are present in cow milk only. If you&#8217;re allergic to cow milk, though, you could also be allergic to goat milk.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.askdrsears.com/topics/feeding-eating/feeding-infants-toddlers/goat-milk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Sears recommends goat milk for some patients</a> because it has smaller, easier-to-digest fat globules than cow milk.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://babyformulaexpert.com/best-goat-milk-formula/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr Young says in her post on goat milk that Kabrita adds more whey protein</a> to make this formula closer to breast milk than most other European-import goat-milk formula blends on the market. The palm oil they use is also a special type that doesn&#8217;t reduce calcium availability.</p>
<p>Kabrita does include hexane-extracted DHA oils, which some parents would rather skip. Note that it&#8217;s not a certified organic product, either, so the soy oil in this formula was also probably extracted with the same solvents that make DHA controversial.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in buying a goat-milk-based formula, this is the one available to U.S. consumers. Other brands are sold for U.K. and European parents, but the legality and cost of importing formula make it hard to recommend when there are so many other options.</p>

<p>Formula is a product designed to provide all the nutrition that a baby needs to grow in the first year of life, so it&#8217;s important that you&#8217;re buying good formula.</p>
<p>The FDA tests and monitors the quality of infant formula closely, and if a product isn&#8217;t shown to help babies thrive it&#8217;s not allowed to be sold as baby formula. There&#8217;s no reason to doubt the safety or quality of baby formula sold in the United States.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve picked the most affordable formula as the best infant formula overall: At just 50 cents per ounce, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Parent-s-Choice-HMO-Non-GMO-Advantage-Infant-Formula-with-Iron-4-Pack-35-oz-ea/780084641" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parent&#8217;s Choice infant formula</a> is a bargain. When you pick a product that you&#8217;re going to feed six times a day for a year, it&#8217;s nice to know that you&#8217;re not paying more than you need to.</p>
<p>If your baby is experiencing discomfort from indigestion or hard stools, there&#8217;s a full range of specialty alternative formula available from Parent&#8217;s Choice.</p>
<p>If you are having trouble finding a formula that works for your baby, talk to your pediatrician about what to try next. But we hope we&#8217;ve helped you understand at least some of the factors that separate one brand of formula from the rest.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We talked to experts and gave 11 digital thermometers to a test family. The iProven won top marks overall, with Motorola's instant-read model best for checking babies.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter our test family used 11 of the best digital thermometers for tracking body temperature, they chose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ML4B1BC/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iProven &#8211; DMT-511</a> as the best thermometer overall. With easy-to-read temporal (forehead) and tympanic (ear drum) modes, you can confidently tell the difference between low-grade fever symptoms and a high fever. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0751FXJS1/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Motorola &#8211; MBP70SN Smart Touchless Thermometer</a> is even better for quickly checking baby and toddler temperatures when your little one just won&#8217;t sit still. It&#8217;s a good idea to have a traditional probe thermometer on hand, too, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079V7C135/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ADC &#8211; Adtemp 418N</a> is both easy to use and reliable.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>During nine hours of careful research, we read recommendations from health agencies, reviewers like Consumer Reports, Wirecutter and Baby Gear Lab, parenting magazines and blogs.</p>
<p>Our researcher spoke with nurses at his children&#8217;s pediatrician&#8217;s office (part of the St Joseph Medical Group in Orange) as a part of the research for this review. He also interviewed Naomi Jackson, a mother of four and a registered nurse working at Killam General Hospital, about her own experiences and preferences. We checked all of these front-line perspectives against the guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).</p>
<p>After we collected a list of favorite types and model numbers, we checked our list against retailer listings. We checked Amazon to see which models are best-selling and have the highest average review score, but we also looked for updated versions of the best sellers.</p>
<p>In addition to popular consumer retail websites, we looked at medical-supply catalogs to see where professionals are getting their gear. We didn&#8217;t buy any clinic-grade thermometers that cost over $300, but we noted the prominent manufacturers and found some good examples of home-use thermometers based on technology developed for the clinic.</p>

<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Fever indicator guides:</b> Most new thermometers use symbols or colors to tell you if a body temperature is within normal range. If the temperature is a low grade or high fever, colored lights or other indicators will notify you. If you don&#8217;t have time to look up temperatures on a chart, then these color-coded fever warnings might be helpful. It&#8217;s still a great idea to check and write down the body temperature of your family members (and yourself) on a day when you&#8217;re not sick, so you&#8217;ll have a better idea of how severe a fever is. Find out what range the thermometer considers normal and severe, and remember that the temperature ranges are different for a baby.</p>
<p><b>Predictive vs. live monitor readings:</b> All the thermometers we bought are &#8220;guessing&#8221; at a body temperature reading. For example, probe thermometers don&#8217;t actually wait for the metal tip to reach a stable temperature, they guess based on known temperature curves in typical scenarios.</p>
<p>It sounds tricky, but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11340736" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it&#8217;s been proven accurate and is much quicker</a> than waiting for a thermometer to come up to your actual temperature. If you want to monitor changes in real time, you&#8217;ll need to make sure you buy a monitoring thermometer and learn how to use it.</p>
<p><b>Actual vs. compensated reading:</b> Like predicted temperatures for probes, most forehead thermometers are adjusting their temperature reading by a few degrees to tell you what a person’s oral reading should be. Again, this is fairly accurate, but you should understand what the number actually means.</p>

<p>The most difficult part of buying a thermometer is deciding which type will serve you best. There are pros and cons for each type, and they will all let you down if you don&#8217;t learn how to use them consistently.</p>
<p>After testing a wide range of types we feel comfortable with both scanning and instant forehead thermometers as the easiest to use.</p>
<p>If you want something that&#8217;s more bulletproof, probe thermometers basically never give a false reading, though you still need to know where to put them to get a consistent temperature.</p>
<h3>Probe thermometer</h3>
<p>A digital version of the mercury-in-glass thermometers used a century ago, these thermometers are still incredibly popular. For adults, a probe thermometer under the tongue is an easy way to get a reliable temperature.</p>
<p>For infants and children younger than 3, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) <a href="https://www.aappublications.org/content/30/11/29.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommends taking a rectal temperature if you want the most accurate reading</a>, though one nurse we spoke with said she would never ask a parent to take a rectal temperature.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Probe thermometers can give very reliable readings.</li>
<li>This type is the least expensive.</li>
<li>They&#8217;re also easy to carry in a diaper bag.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two words say it all: rectal probe.</li>
<li>Oral readings are tricky with squirming kids or babies.</li>
<li>Oral temperatures are not considered reliable in babies before six months of age.</li>
<li>Axillary (armpit) temperatures aren&#8217;t as consistent as other methods.</li>
<li>Having multiple thermometers, or at least disposable covers, is essential if you&#8217;re sharing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pacifier thermometer</h3>
<p>This is just a probe thermometer built into a pacifier, so you&#8217;ll at least have a fighting chance of getting an infant to keep it in his or her mouth.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pacifier can be much easier to get your baby to accept than a regular thermometer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accurate readings through a pacifier nipple require up to five minutes of sucking to verify temperature.</li>
<li>Professionals don&#8217;t recommended oral temperature for checking newborns.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>We looked at the pacifier thermometers available and were disappointed by long read times and tiny displays.</b> Pacifier models are also missing extra features we&#8217;ve come to expect from other thermometers. Reviews were quite negative, so we didn&#8217;t test any.</p>
<h3>Ear (tympanic) thermometer</h3>
<p>Reading the eardrum with an infrared sensor is quick, but you have to get a clear shot at it. Studies have shown that newborns often have ear canals that are too small to allow this type of thermometer to work effectively, so it&#8217;s only recommended after six months. Even then, the nurses we talked to still find this type frustrating on occasion.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Readings for kids and adults can be very accurate.</li>
<li>They&#8217;re quicker than oral measurements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Earwax can lead to inaccurate readings.</li>
<li>Readings for infants younger than six months are not considered reliable.</li>
<li>Some people hate having things in their ears.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scan-type forehead (temporal) thermometer</h3>
<p>This type of thermometer uses either an infrared sensor or a metal contact patch with a thermal probe behind it to measure the temperature of your forehead, specifically the blood flowing through the temporal artery on your temples. This involves scanning over a fairly wide area to get an average temperature, usually for just a few seconds with infrared scanners.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is fast and non-invasive.</li>
<li>Studies show this is usually a reliable way to judge body temperature.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s hard to know when you&#8217;re using a forehead thermometer wrong.</li>
<li>Scanning the forehead still takes 2-3 seconds.</li>
<li>Babies may not hold still enough for this to work well.</li>
<li>These models require skin contact.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Non-contact forehead thermometer</h3>
<p>Like the above forehead thermometers, this type measures skin temperature to estimate the temperature of blood inside your temporal artery. The distinction is that this new style measures over a wider area instantaneously, so it doesn&#8217;t have to touch your skin.</p>
<p>This type of thermometer is so quick, you might doubt its accuracy. That said, it&#8217;s fast enough to be very easy to use. It&#8217;s also the thermometer least likely to wake someone. It&#8217;s also important to make sure the forehead is clean and dry before using this type.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hands down, this is the fastest way to take a temperature.</li>
<li>No skin contact is required to take a reading.</li>
<li>You can take readings without waking someone up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>This type is the most expensive.</li>
<li>You still need to practice measuring the same spot each time.</li>
<li>These thermometers have the most buyer complaints about inconsistent readings.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-fever">Understanding fever temperatures</h2>
[table id=285 /]
<p>Generally speaking, physicians consider temperatures above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit to indicate a fever. That means the body&#8217;s metabolic system has raised its temperature to respond to illness. 100.4 is 2.2 degrees higher than the average temperature of 98.2.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a guideline for clinical practice, but the range of normal temperatures in different people is wide. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/what-is-normal-body-temperature#temperature-range" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The range in adults goes from about 97 to 99</a>, so if your normal body temperature is on the low end, an equivalent to the standard fever reading would be just 99.4.</p>
<p>Babies tend to be slightly warmer, and after age 65, our bodies stay cooler on average. In those age ranges, doctors advise paying extra attention to a fever and any other symptoms.</p>
<p>if you&#8217;re going to buy and use a thermometer, you owe it to yourself to find out what your (or your child&#8217;s) normal temperature range is. Most of the manuals we read recommended to check at the same time of day over a few days.</p>
<p>Once you learn how your thermometer works and what your normal temperature is, you&#8217;ll be better prepared to take accurate readings when you&#8217;re sick.</p>
<h3>What to do about a low-grade fever</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re not seeing any problematic symptoms, most doctors will prescribe rest and possibly pain-relieving drugs. <a href="https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/AAP-Issues-Advice-on-Managing-Fevers-in-Children.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The American Academy of Pediatrics issued a report in 2011</a> that makes a very clear statement about fever and fever-reducing drugs:</p>
<p>&#8220;Fever is a physiological mechanism that has beneficial effects in fighting infection. Although many parents administer antipyretics (medications to reduce a fever) such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen to a child to reduce a fever, the report emphasizes that the primary goal should be to help the child feel more comfortable, rather than to maintain a “normal” temperature.</p>
<ul>
<li>Parents should focus on the general well-being of the child, his/her activity, observing the child for signs of serious illness and maintaining appropriate fluid intake.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Parents should not wake up a sleeping child to administer a fever-reducer. Antipyretics must be stored safely to avoid accidental ingestion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Parents should be aware that the correct dosage is based on the child’s weight, and that an accurate measuring device should always be used.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="nurse-interview">A nurse&#8217;s perspective</h2>
<p>We talked to Naomi, a mother of four who works as a Registered Nurse in the emergency room at a small hospital in rural Alberta, Canada. We asked her to compare what she uses at work and at home.</p>
<p>Naomi&#8217;s hospital uses a clinic-certified model from Exergen, fairly similar to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004T6G550/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TAT200c</a> we tested. The nurses rely on a probe thermometer if they have doubts: &#8220;If we&#8217;re not sure of accuracy and the child is symptomatic we just go to the axilla (armpit) after [a forehead scan].&#8221;</p>
<p>For home use with her four kids, Naomi bought an ear-reading infrared thermometer, but she says it&#8217;s not as reliable as some would have you think: &#8220;Even the hospital grade in-ear thermometers are way off sometimes. User variations—getting it in exactly the right place in the ear, pulling the lobe just right to position the canal, etc&#8230; that make it less accurate. If I was to get a second thermometer for home I would get a temporal [forehead-type].&#8221;</p>
<p>We asked Naomi how they check temperatures in the ER for infants, given all the studies that suggest a rectal thermometer is the only one that’s really accurate. &#8220;Rectal is considered the most accurate of any measurement,&#8221; she says, &#8220;but also has the most risk of harm. Nurses are not allowed to take rectal readings without a doctor&#8217;s order, and it is hardly ever necessary to have a reading that accurate. I would never recommend rectal to a parent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, we asked her what kind of device would give the most helpful information to a parent when talking with a nurse, and she laughed. &#8220;If I call in to Health Link [a telephone medical advice service in her area] the nurses always make me retake the temperature with a probe thermometer under the arm before they will give advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, whatever thermometer you pick, read the instruction manual carefully, and learn how to take consistent readings. Also, don&#8217;t be surprised if a nurse tells you to use a cheap probe thermometer under your baby&#8217;s arm.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Our test family consists of two adults, a three-year-old, and an eight-month-old. They&#8217;ve used a variety of thermometers over the last three years, including a non-contact forehead thermometer and a few cheap probe thermometers.</p>
<p>Our testers used most of the thermometers a few times for checking cold symptoms, but mostly they took normal readings and relied on controlled tests to see how the thermometers responded to elevated temperatures.</p>
<p>Normal temperatures among our testers ranged from 97 degrees Fahrenheit to 98.5.</p>
<p>Note that our tests show, as expected, all of these thermometers are calibrated from the factory to give valid readings. You&#8217;ll need to learn how to interpret those readings for a thermometer to be useful.</p>
<p>For example, the red fever indicator light on some thermometers shows up at 99.5, while on others that temperature would trigger an &#8220;elevated&#8221; indicator with a &#8220;high&#8221; fever light reserved for 102.6.</p>
<p>Different test sites (forehead, ear and mouth) also show different temperatures, and some thermometers even convert a &#8220;raw&#8221; reading into an equivalent for what you would likely see with a different thermometer.</p>
<p>So if you want to know if a fever is serious, it&#8217;s important to know how much higher your temperature is, compared to a thermometer reading when you&#8217;re definitely healthy.</p>
[table id=284 /]
<h3>Ease of use and read time</h3>
<p>Each thermometer type works a little bit differently, so we measured the time between turning the thermometer on and a final temperature reading.</p>
<p>The real winner is, again, the instant-scan <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0751FXJS1/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Motorola</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075QQ8VZW/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iHealth</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TVS12U4/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Braun</a>. The read time really is instant, and that can make all the difference if you&#8217;ve got a fussy baby. For taking temperatures on yourself or an older kid, it&#8217;s not as much of an issue, but the speed is still nice.</p>
<p>An uncooperative baby or toddler presents two problems when you&#8217;re taking a temperature. First, they don&#8217;t sit still. Second, they often don&#8217;t want you to touch them with the thermometer.</p>
<p>Non-contact thermometers are the real winners in this test as well, since they give readings instantly and don&#8217;t need to touch your kid&#8217;s skin. If you have a two-year-old throwing a tantrum that might not be enough, but at least you&#8217;ve got a fighting chance.</p>
<p>The other thing to note about testing with babies is that you need to be more aware of exactly what counts as a fever. See our section on <a href="/#understanding-fever">understanding fever temperatures.</a></p>
<h3>Accuracy: water bath</h3>
<p>Many purchasers who leave low-score reviews complain about the difficulty of getting consistent readings with forehead thermometers, and the same is sometimes true of ear thermometers. Basically, the more reviews a thermometer has, the more likely someone has complained about it.</p>
<p>The fact that many thermometers aren&#8217;t giving you a &#8220;true&#8221; reading doesn&#8217;t help: Braun <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/technology/2015/01/10/more-thoughts-on-the-braun-no-touch-forehead-thermometer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quickly points out when asked</a> that their readings are factoring the temperature from your whole forehead and predicting your body temperature, rather than just giving you a simple reading.</p>
<p>For our first accuracy test, we used a warm water bath and a large cast iron pan to get a stable temperature. Our reference was a calibrated alcohol-filled thermometer with traceable certification to half a degree Celsius. Agitating the water constantly to keep the temperature stable, we checked the temperature of the water for probe thermometers or the iron surface for infrared-reading models.</p>
<p>In our chart, we recorded averages of high and low readings. All of the probe thermometers were very accurate, but three readings from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GT7Y8GY/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vicks &#8211; Rapid Read</a> varied the least averaged to just over a tenth of a degree from the calibrated reference across three tests.</p>
<p>If tallying up the error margin (or &#8220;delta&#8221;) on each reading, then averaging the amount of error per reading, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0795ZW85G/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kinsa &#8211; QuickCare</a> squeaks ahead by a few decimal points.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, probe thermometers are carefully calibrated from the factory and are probably more accurate than our bath setup is capable of testing.</p>
<p>Many of the infrared thermometers would not accept the metal surface or the surface of the water to give a reading. Two models would test in &#8220;object&#8221; mode (advertised as a way to check bath and bottle temperatures) but were more than four degrees off.</p>
<h3>Accuracy: body temperature</h3>
<p>We checked accuracy with all of the forehead and ear thermometers against a rectal temperature reading. The most accurate body temperature readings came from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004T6G550/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Exergen &#8211; TAT200c SmartGlow</a>, but that&#8217;s partly because the directions for that thermometer suggest averaging forehead measurement with a reading behind the ear.</p>
<p>The only device that was more than one degree off was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TVS12U4/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Braun &#8211; NTF300US</a>, but it gives a reading that&#8217;s one degree cooler than every other thermometer. That&#8217;s closer to an armpit measurement, rather than an oral measurement equivalent we expected.</p>
<p>Again, numerical accuracy isn&#8217;t a problem if you&#8217;ve taken the time to find out what your normal body temperature reads as with the thermometer you buy, since all the models we tested are all very consistent. But it could be confusing if you were worried about a fever, bought the thermometer, saw a &#8220;low grade fever&#8221; 100.4 reading and then checked it again with a different method and saw 103.4.</p>
<h3>Consistency</h3>
<p>As expected, all the thermometers were very consistent. We tested multiple readings with the same subjects, being careful to check as consistently as we could with each model. We used one infant and two adult subjects for repeat tests to nail down consistency.</p>
<p>Most thermometers came in at 0.2 or 0.3 degrees change over three readings. The highest variability came from contact-reading thermometers, but two thermometers achieved a totally steady reading over three closely-spaced readings with multiple subjects: The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0751FXJS1/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Motorola Baby</a> instant-read and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GT7Y8GY/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vicks</a> probe thermometers.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ML4B1BC/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iProven &#8211; DMT-511</a> is a new update to a best-selling thermometer design. As the only combination forehead-and-ear thermometer on our list, it&#8217;s also more versatile. If you want the ability to back up a forehead scan with a different type of measurement in case you get a strange result, iProven has you covered.</p>
<p>A perennial best-seller, iProven has clinched recommendations from the likes of Wirecutter, Babylist and The Bump with their old DMT-489 model. The 511 is slightly sleeker and easier to use: older models had separate buttons for forehead and ear readings and relied on combination presses for other functions.</p>
<p>The new design uses the cap to detect which mode you&#8217;re using, and just one &#8220;take temperature&#8221; button. There&#8217;s a designated function button for mute and memory options. You still need button combinations to change scales and switch to object measurement mode, but it&#8217;s a better interface than the old models.</p>
<p>In use, the iProven is accurate and easy to use. In forehead mode (with the cap on) you need to hold down the read button and swipe the reader across your forehead.</p>
<p>The swipe-scanning motion does take longer than an instant-scan touchless thermometer like our runner-up. If you&#8217;re dealing with a baby that&#8217;s thrashing, even the two-second swipe might be frustrating. The iProven is still a good thermometer for babies, but this is mostly the best digital thermometer for adults or kids.</p>
<p>Measuring the temperature of the eardrum is also easy: Pop off the cap, insert the tip carefully into the ear canal while pulling back on the earlobe, and press the button for an instant reading.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re averse to objects going into your ears you might skip that mode, but it works as well as the forehead scan. In our tests, the eardrum temperature was on average 0.2 degrees cooler than the forehead, which indicates the thermometer is compensating to give similar readings with both methods.</p>
<p>Some people will already be looking up a chart to interpret between different types of thermometers, but you can rely on this thermometer to give you a number consistent with what you&#8217;d get from skin temperature under the armpit.</p>

It's not the fastest thermometer, but the bonus of a back-up ear scan method is good for peace of mind if you get a strange reading. A bargain price and all the options you could ask for rounds out its feature list.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ML4B1BC/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Memory for the last 35 readings is available at the push of a button. That&#8217;s a handy feature if you&#8217;re tracking a fever as it runs its course, though it doesn&#8217;t give you an at-a-glance overview as an app or even a paper notebook would. It&#8217;s a less-useful feature if you use the thermometer for more than one person, since you&#8217;d quickly lose track of which readings belonged to each person.</p>
<p>This model also includes a mode to scan baby bottles and bath water—hold down the function button when the thermometer is powered off to activate this mode—though somehow it was off by eight degrees. Don&#8217;t buy this thermometer for kitchen or laboratory use; instead, check out our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-digital-meat-thermometer/">meat thermometer</a> and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/thermoworks-thermapen/">Thermapen reviews</a> for devices with that kind of accuracy.</p>
<p>Happily, iProven includes a mode to adjust the built-in temperature compensation by up to two degrees, which means you can fine-tune the reading to better match a reference reading using a different kind of thermometer.</p>
<p>Changing between Fahrenheit and Celsius is handled with a toggle switch inside the battery compartment, which is definitely our favorite method. To mute the confirmation beep that sounds with every reading, hold down the mode button with the &#8220;memory/mute&#8221; symbol.</p>
<p>After comparing the field, we were won over by the simple controls, reliable reading and low price of this model. The eardrum mode is a nice perk; most of us shouldn&#8217;t need it, but if your patient&#8217;s forehead is covered in sweat or dirt it&#8217;s nice to have a back-up method.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The forehead scan mode of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ML4B1BC/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iProven &#8211; DMT-511</a> gives quick, accurate measurements, so long as you use it consistently.</li>
<li>If you ever doubt a forehead reading, the eardrum mode is a handy backup method.</li>
<li>Silent mode is also easy to activate.</li>
<li>No Bluetooth or profiles means less frustration.</li>
<li>35 past-temperature memory, but no profiles for individual family members.</li>
<li>Not as quick or simple as an instant-read model.</li>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a thermometer to add to your baby registry, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0751FXJS1/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Motorola &#8211; MBP70SN Smart Touchless Forehead Thermometer</a> has a few advantages over the iProven.</p>
<p>First, the Motorola scans from up to two inches away from the center of the forehead, no touching necessary. Second, the Motorola gives a measurement instantly, and there&#8217;s no need to practice side-to-side scanning. It’s much easier to get readings from a fussy baby or a toddler this way.</p>
<p>Beyond those clear benefits, the Motorola is a mixed bag. You give up the ear scan feature that makes the iProven more flexible, though remember that ear scans aren&#8217;t considered accurate until six months anyhow.</p>
<p>Motorola doesn&#8217;t include a silent mode for this thermometer either. If you&#8217;re checking someone who&#8217;s sleeping, the &#8220;didi&#8221; beep is not excessively loud, but it&#8217;s there. There&#8217;s no guarantee it won&#8217;t wake a light sleeper.</p>
<p>For taking the temperature of a wriggly baby, an instant scan is as good as it gets, but sometimes even that isn&#8217;t fast enough to make your job easy. </p>

<h3>Not just for babies</h3>
<p>A non-contact thermometer is easier for everyone to use, not just for parents of newborns. If you&#8217;ve got a mirror, the point-and-click method is even easy to use on yourself. If you&#8217;re used to taking a temperature with an oral thermometer, you might consider the touchless design a waste of money, but it&#8217;s definitely convenient.</p>
<h3>Are apps and profiles worth it?</h3>
<p>Motorola gives you profiles to track temperatures for four users, which means more button-press combinations to remember if you want to get the most out of this model.</p>
<p>A Bluetooth connection links your thermometer readings with the &#8220;Hubble Connect for Smart Nursery&#8221; app. It&#8217;s a decent way to see a trend line, manage profiles and set medication reminders but not much else.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re also using another Motorola Baby nursery device, like a baby monitor or humidifier, you can use the same app rather than install something new for each device. It&#8217;s still an app that we don&#8217;t think is necessary. Our test for a data-collection app is whether it lets you do something more easily than a paper notebook would, and in this case a notebook in the medicine cabinet (or just making entries on your phone&#8217;s calendar app) works better.</p>
<p>Sharing temperatures by email didn&#8217;t actually work when we tested that feature with Gmail on an Android phone.</p>
<p>Switching profiles on the thermometer takes a few seconds, so we wouldn&#8217;t blame you for just taking readings without switching every time. If you&#8217;ve got four babies and you really want an accurate historical record, the app is required to move temperature readings between profiles. You can&#8217;t see profile names on the thermometer, either, just numbers.</p>
<p>Most parents aren&#8217;t going to need this kind of record, but it does make the memory feature useful with more than one person.</p>

After hundreds of measurements and checking against our reference thermometer, we didn't see any errors, and we've grown to appreciate how easy it is to check babies with this type. The app isn't as useful as we'd hoped, but you don't need to install it for the thermometer to work.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0751FXJS1/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<h3>Fast and accurate</h3>
<p>The Motorola was slightly more accurate and more consistent for us than the iProven &#8211; DMT-51. It&#8217;s fast and very easy to use, as long as you&#8217;re not stuck trying to remember which person in your household is assigned each profile slot.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, if you&#8217;re OK with ignoring the extra features, or if you actually want to track temperature readings on a graph, this is a great thermometer. The basic measurement function works right away without your pressing any menu buttons.</p>
<p>If you’re not  worried about waking a sleeping baby, the non-contact design isn&#8217;t worth the doubled price. In addition, Motorola uses a method that’s less well-proven to determine body temperature from your forehead, and in certain cases, there could be factors that lead to problems with accuracy.</p>
<p>If you want measurements you can feel 100-percent confident about, we&#8217;d still advise that you have a backup conventional probe thermometer like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079V7C135/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the ADC</a>. If you&#8217;re talking to a doctor&#8217;s office on the phone, they&#8217;ll likely ask for that type of reading, even if you have detailed charts that track your temperature hour by hour.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When it comes to quick readings, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0751FXJS1/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Motorola &#8211; MBP70SN Smart Touchless Thermometer</a> is nearly impossible to beat.</li>
<li>This thermometer was very accurate and consistent in our tests with all ages.</li>
<li>The extra features and app only give you better access to stored measurements, they don&#8217;t make this a better thermometer.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re skeptical of instantaneous no-contact readings, you&#8217;ll want to have a backup thermometer on hand as well.</li>

<p>If you want an easy-to-read and fairly speedy thermometer that just does what you&#8217;d expect, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079V7C135/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ADC &#8211; Adtemp 418N</a> is an easy recommendation.</p>
<p>A probe thermometer is only as accurate as your technique, though. If you don&#8217;t learn how to put it in the right place under your tongue or armpit, you might get an inconsistent reading. Rectal readings are generally very consistent, but there&#8217;s some risk of injury if you&#8217;re not careful.</p>
<p>Probe thermometers are carefully calibrated, as our tests in a water bath against a certified lab thermometer confirmed. The most variation we saw between readings from any of this style of thermometer was 0.38 degrees, and our top pick averaged to 0.31. Our ability to maintain the conditions of the test was almost certainly worse than the thermometer itself.</p>
<p>What sets the ADC probe thermometer apart from the competition is simplicity. The only option you have to worry about with this thermometer is switching between Celsius and Fahrenheit scales. (While the thermometer is off, press and hold the power button until the scale symbols start flashing; press the power button to switch, then wait for it to power off.)</p>
<p>ADC upgrades this model over older models with a fever warning via a colored backlight. That&#8217;s a nice perk, but the bigger selling point for us is the quick read time and easy-to-see numerals.</p>
<p>After you press the power button, you&#8217;ve got about 10 seconds before a reading is confirmed. That&#8217;s not as fast as the lightning-quick Vicks &#8211; Rapid Read system, but with the ADC you don’t need to confirm which site you&#8217;re using every time you turn it on. For an oral temperature check, the overall time between power-on and a verified temperature is surprisingly close between these models, even if the Vicks thermometer spends less time in your mouth.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know what your regular and elevated body temperatures are, then the color-coded fever warning might be helpful. It&#8217;s still a great idea to check and write down the body temperature of your family members (and yourself) on a day when you&#8217;re not sick, so you&#8217;ll have a better idea of how severe a fever is when it hits.</p>
<p>Five latex-free probe covers also come with this thermometer, and those are a must-have if you think you might ever want to do a rectal probe and then use the thermometer for anything else ever again.</p>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re just sharing a thermometer among your kids for oral readings, the covers are still good to have on hand. Probe thermometers are washable, but you can&#8217;t immerse any of the models we tested in boiling water for sterilization. Fortunately, probe covers are universal-fit and available in drugstores.</p>

Big numerals and fast results make this very easy to use. This isn't the cheapest thermometer we found, but it's a great price for such a well-designed tool.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079V7C135/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The ADC briefly shows the saved records of the last reading taken when it powers up. This is just about perfect for tracking the course of a fever over a night. It&#8217;s not a replacement for writing down a normal temperature or a long-term record of changes, but it doesn&#8217;t require extra button-presses or troubleshooting a Bluetooth connection.</p>
<p>The thermometers we tested aren&#8217;t likely to be significantly more accurate than what you can find at your corner drugstore, and you could probably get a bare-bones thermometer for free if you ask around. Still, it’s nice having a model that&#8217;s easy to read and gives you quick results.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The ADC &#8211; Adtemp 418N probe thermometer is quick and simple to use.</li>
<li>Big, bold numerals are easy to read.</li>
<li>A temperature check takes about ten seconds, much quicker than most cheap thermometers.</li>
<li>The colored fever indication backlight is helpful, but it&#8217;s no replacement for knowing your own normal range.</li>
<li>A last-temperature display can help you track the progress of a fever, but it only shows for a second.</li>

<p>Of the probe thermometers we tested, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GT7Y8GY/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vicks &#8211; Rapid Read</a> was the closest to earning a recommendation. Technically, it&#8217;s faster than the ADC if you&#8217;re doing an oral temperature check under the tongue: Once it&#8217;s ready, it only takes two seconds to give an accurate, consistent reading. That&#8217;s very impressive. But the whole power-on process takes about the same amount of time as other quick-reading thermometers.</p>
<p>In order to give that accurate reading, this model needs to know what part of your body you&#8217;re checking. There&#8217;s a three-second wait as the thermometer asks you to press the blue mode button if you want to choose a different location, or leave it on the default. The instruction manual also tells you how to change the default site from oral to armpit or rectal modes.</p>

    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Vicks-starting-up.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>In all, the startup sequence takes eight seconds. When you add that time to a two-second oral temperature check, any speed advantage it has over other thermometers disappears. It spends less time in your mouth, but it wouldn’t be as intuitive if you handed it to someone who had never used it before.</p>

Those options make it more complicated to use, though, and we were left wishing for a simpler thermometer most of the time we used the Vicks.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GT7Y8GY/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Readings also change based on location. Armpit checks, for example, get about 10 seconds reading time instead of two. The thermometer even converts the temperatures to an oral equivalent—in our water bath test, it read one degree higher than expected in armpit mode and 0.6 degrees lower in rectal mode, which lines up with expected differences between those locations and a reading under the tongue.</p>
<p>On the whole, this is an accurate, reliable and versatile thermometer. The extra features make it very reliable, but only if you know how to use it. If you don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s converting temperatures, the changes could lead you to believe a fever is worse than it actually is.<br />
<strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Vicks &#8211; Rapid Read is very accurate, and has the quickest read time we&#8217;ve ever seen.</li>
<li>Vicks automatically adjusts rectal and armpit readings to oral temperature equivalents.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re not expecting a conversion, the readings you get will be confusing.</li>
<li>The startup time is quite long.</li>

<p>If you want the sleekest and simplest thermometer, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075QQ8VZW/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iHealth &#8211; PT3</a> non-contact forehead thermometer will be sure to impress. The iHealth only has one button and one reading mode, and it even uses a vibration motor rather than a beeper to tell you when it finishes checking. It&#8217;s not as versatile as the iProven, though, since it only gives you one method of scanning. It was also slightly less consistent than the Motorola in our tests.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TVS12U4/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Braun &#8211; NTF300US</a> was the first popular non-contact forehead thermometer, and it&#8217;s probably the model that gave us the most mixed results. Braun seems to have developed an updated model, but it&#8217;s not easy to find for sale. In our tests, the 300 model displayed a temperature a full degree below most others, though it was quite consistent. For the price, its poor reputation is too much of a risk when the other non-contact models we tested gave us the readings we expected to see.</p>
<p>If you want something that&#8217;s closer to a design tested in clinics and hospitals, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004T6G550/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Exergen &#8211; TAT200c SmartGlow</a> is based on a best-selling professional model. The display is very small, though. About the only major benefit this model has over the others we tested is a comprehensive instruction booklet, including suggestions for ways to verify forehead readings by checking behind the ear.</p>
<p>For those who need a smartphone app and don&#8217;t trust forehead readings, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Y02OIK2/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kinsa &#8211; Smart Ear Thermometer</a> gives you Bluetooth-connected record-logging along with the accuracy of an eardrum measurement. In our tests, though, we didn&#8217;t see much reason to prefer ear readings, and the app doesn&#8217;t do anything more than a notepad would.</p>
<p>The only forehead scanner we found that uses touch, rather than infrared sensing, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003AGV8RU/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ADC &#8211; Temple Touch</a> is an inexpensive alternative. The metal contact patch has to be on your forehead for about 20 seconds, but it tells you when it&#8217;s working and seems reliable. It ranked low on our list, because it&#8217;s so much slower than any of the other thermometers we tested, and it&#8217;s difficult to tell if the metal pad is making contact when you&#8217;re checking yourself.</p>

<p>Another Bluetooth thermometer we tried was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0795ZW85G/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kinsa &#8211; QuickCare</a>. This simple probe thermometer has a lot going for it: accurate and consistent readings that are almost as quick as the ADC and Vicks probe models, plus Bluetooth if you want to track temperatures in an app.</p>
<p>The Kinsa&#8217;s downside is the short display time; after just 10 seconds, the temperature display resets. If you&#8217;re using the app that&#8217;s not a problem, but it could be annoying if you don&#8217;t check right away. The button is also harder to press than on the other probe thermometers.</p>
<p>Our final probe thermometer is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BDMGMLY/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iProven DT-R1221AWG</a>. It&#8217;s not much different than the ADC overall: It takes about as long to read a temperature, and it was a tiny bit more accurate in our tests. The display is smaller, though, and it wasn&#8217;t as consistent between tests. This isn&#8217;t a bad thermometer, but the ADC is a few dollars cheaper.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Getting an easy-to-use thermometer to measure fever symptoms is an essential part of stocking your medicine cabinet. You want a model that is accurate and consistent but isn’t difficult to use.</p>
<p>Different bodies work at different temperatures, over a range of about two-and-a-half degrees Fahrenheit. Whatever thermometer you get, it&#8217;s important to test it and learn how it works when you aren&#8217;t running a temperature, so you&#8217;ll know exactly how much hotter you&#8217;re running if you get sick.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ML4B1BC/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iProven &#8211; DMT-511</a> was the best forehead and ear thermometer for kids and adults, since it gives you two different reading modes that will help you verify if you&#8217;re getting the right numbers with your technique. It&#8217;s also easy to mute if you don&#8217;t want to disturb your sleeping sicky.</p>
<p>If you need to check a baby’s or small toddler’s temperature, it can be frustrating to get them to sit still even for a few seconds. That&#8217;s when an instant-scan touchless forehead thermometer like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0751FXJS1/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Motorola &#8211; MBP70SN</a> makes life better. The Bluetooth functions can help you track temperatures and remember medications, but they don&#8217;t get in the way of basic temperature checks.</p>
<p>Finally, if you&#8217;re looking for a basic, affordable thermometer to pop under your tongue without worrying about aiming a forehead thermometer or ear wax interfering with an ear scan, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079V7C135/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ADC &#8211; Adtemp 418N</a> is quick, reliable and easy to read.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Our researcher for this project has used a variety of diaper bags over the years, so we already had some expectations about what to look for. We checked the latest reviews from testing sites like BabyGearLabs and Wirecutter.</p>
<p>We also looked at the latest trends on The Bump, Babylist and Instagram. One trend that we had to make a call on was leather and leather-like bags: After researching user reviews for popular artificial-leather bags we decided that they don&#8217;t stand up to wear-and-tear well enough to be a best pick overall.</p>
<p>Genuine leather is a material that usually wears well in a bag, but water and staining are problems. We also recognize that many people simply don&#8217;t want to use leather or other animal products, so we skipped leather bags, at least for this test.</p>
<p>After collecting recommendations for 24 popular diaper bags, we narrowed the field to a set of finalists. We eliminated bags that had more than a handful of complaints about material quality or flaws in manufacturing. We also picked bags that at least claimed to offer insulated bottle pockets.</p>
<p>We eliminated bags that were expensive without justification in the materials used. Most of the bags we tested came in at less than $70. We did make an exception for the JuJuBe&#8217;s perennial award winner; compared to other bags we looked at in the $150–180 price range,  JuJuBe’s zippers and fabric are actually an upgrade (with a warranty to back them up).</p>
<p>We wanted to find bags with style options, rather than focusing on different diaper bags &#8220;for girls&#8221; and &#8220;for dads.&#8221; For example, the fashion-forward JuJuBe &#8211; B.F.F. comes in a range of &#8220;black-out&#8221; styles to cater to all sensibilities.</p>
<p>We did test a few designs that were aiming to be more trendy, too. We avoided overtly &#8220;tacti-cool&#8221; dad-bags, but we tested some diaper changing pads that you could add to any good backpack or messenger bag that you already trust.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs-diaper-bag">Do you really need a diaper bag?</h2>
<p>Should you buy a diaper bag, or is a regular messenger bag or backpack just as good? The case for buying a new diaper bag might seem to rest on style, but there are some compelling reasons to have a dedicated bag.</p>
<p>Most importantly, there is an essential feature missing from a shoulder bag or backpack: a changing pad.</p>
<p>A changing pad isn&#8217;t always necessary to change a diaper. Sometimes, though, you see a puddle on that already-sketchy changing table in the mall. Many public restrooms can make you wonder why you don&#8217;t carry a bottle of bleach solution everywhere.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t even have a changing table to work with, a diaper bag changing pad can&#8217;t make every location suitable, but it really helps in situations where you&#8217;re not prepared to sacrifice your baby&#8217;s favorite blanket.</p>

<p><strong>If you already have a bag you like and just want to make it into a diaper bag with a changing pad, check out our reviews of <a href="#changing-pads">add-on changing pads below</a>.</strong></p>
<p>But there&#8217;s another reason you should think about buying a new bag: A dedicated diaper bag means you don&#8217;t have to shuffle diapers and other essentials in and out of your favorite backpack or shopping bag.</p>
<p>Additionally, a diaper bag eliminates confusion about which bag has the diapers in it when a spouse or sitter has the baby for a few hours. Nothing&#8217;s worse than realizing you brought the wrong bag on a day trip just as certain smells begin to fill the car.</p>
<p>A dedicated diaper bag doesn&#8217;t automatically re-stock itself with diapers, so picking the best bag doesn&#8217;t solve all your problems. But knowing exactly where to stash your emergency supplies is at least a start to winning back some sanity. This is the bag you&#8217;ll take everywhere you go with your baby, so make sure it&#8217;s a good one.</p>

<p>We started our testing with a survey of seven experienced parents, many of whom had three or more kids already out of diapers. We asked them to rank the importance of factors like storage capacity, specialized organization options and backpack straps versus shoulder slings.</p>
<p>After in-depth testing of all the bags, we ranked them against these concerns. We then asked our group of testers to rank the bags from most-desirable to least-desirable.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[table id=235 /]</span></p>
<h3>Storage versatility</h3>
<p>This is the category where our testers were fairly ambivalent about specific bags. Organizer pockets are a great idea, and they can turn out to be perfect for what you need to keep on hand. Most times, however, a bag is just a bag.</p>
<p><strong>After testing, we decided that the best organization features were options to separate the contents of your bag.</strong> Especially if you have stuff for more than one kid in there, this helps you find a specific item without pulling everything out.</p>
<p>The stand-out bag here is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I0P7WIU/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">JuJuBe &#8211; B.F.F.</a> It combines a spacious main compartment, extra side pockets and organizer pouches to make it practically perfect, even for those parents who keep extra stuff in the diaper bag all the time.</p>
<p>On the flip side, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K2RXRWY/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Obersee &#8211; Bern</a> is a great backpack that really doesn&#8217;t distinguish itself as a diaper bag. The tall compartments and organization features are better for carrying laptops and pens than wipes and spare socks.</p>
<h3>Comfortable straps</h3>
<p>How well a particular bag carries definitely depends on your body, but good straps never hurt. We ranked these bags based on how we felt about them after an all-day outing.</p>
<p>In the case of the two backpacks, we took them on a trip that involved shambling around the SFX airport for hours late at night with a three-year-old and an infant.</p>

<p>The Obersee &#8211; Bern isn&#8217;t going to win awards from backpackers on a through-hike, but it&#8217;s definitely the best diaper backpack for comfort. The closest competitor was the Eddie Bauer, though we have to give JuJuBe credit for designing convertible backpack straps that actually work and keep up with the purpose-built backpacks.</p>
<p>The cross-body straps on the rest of the bags are fine if you only need to wear them for a half-hour, but you&#8217;ll be looking for ways to ditch them after that. This is one area where the convertible JuJuBe and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074Q56ZJQ/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ergobaby &#8211; Coffee Run</a> really stand out.</p>
<h3>Changing pad size</h3>
<p>We used the changing pads for diaper changing and they&#8217;re all good enough — that is, they provide you with the reassurance that your baby won&#8217;t be lying on top of something icky during a change. They&#8217;re all fairly small.</p>
<p>The pads are also waterproof enough, but none of them are large enough to change a diaper in a puddle. Check out our <a href="#changing-pads">add-on changing pad review</a> if you want something bigger.</p>
<p>The Eddie Bauer and Maman bags lose points here because the fabric soaks up a trace of liquid and they also use sponge padding instead of closed-cell foam, so they could trap liquid inside. Water beads up and rolls off quite well, but you do not want to leave these pads sitting in something wet and nasty.</p>
<h3>Insulated bottle pockets</h3>
<p>An ice pack is essential for keeping bottles chilled if you&#8217;re on a day-long outing in the heat, even if you&#8217;re using a fully-enclosed cooler. We found the same results in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-coolers/">cooler review</a> and when <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-lunch-box/">testing the best lunch boxes</a>: Insulation helps, but you need ice to keep perishable food safe for longer than a few hours.</p>
<p>This is another case where our testers had mixed feelings. If you use a lot of bottles every day, having a way to carry them for a little bit longer at safe temperatures is a big deal. But only one of our testers was really sold on having a bottle cooler integrated into a diaper bag.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re carrying a bottle around for more than a few hours on a hot day, an insulated pocket will do very little to keep it cold. You will need to use an ice pack to keep cooler temperatures on an all-day trip.</p>

<p>The Obersee &#8211; Bern is the only diaper bag we tested with insulation worth noting. It can hold three small bottles along with a slim ice pack, which might make all the difference when you&#8217;re traveling.</p>

<p>Many dads resent diaper bags. The look of most trendy diaper bags mimics designer purses or tote bags, so a handful of enterprising men have started companies to offer alternatives. There&#8217;s now an entire market segment for diaper bags designed around military aesthetics: Stuff like MOLLE-style ladder straps and velcro for clever diaper-joke morale patches.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goruck.com/stories/gr1-aka-the-most-badass-diaper-bag-ever-built/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason McCarthy of GORUCK bags insists that a specific bag design for diaper-bag duty is a ridiculous idea</a>, and he&#8217;s not entirely wrong. McCarthy tells you to buy his $400 GR1, of course. It and a lot of other great &#8220;tactical&#8221; bags are very capable of holding diapers, wipes, a change of clothes and other necessities.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re well aware of the diversity of preferences among parents. Not every dad wants to use an ammo pouch to carry bottles, and not all diaper bags for girls will have pastel floral prints. Happily, there are now diaper bags on the market that suit nearly every possible taste.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[table id=236 /]</span></p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve already said above, though, we don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s as easy as saying your favorite bag for other purposes is also your best choice for a diaper bag.<b> If you&#8217;re splitting play-date duties with your spouse, finding a diaper bag you can both be happy with will save you some confusion when you&#8217;re rushing to get somewhere on time.</b></p>
<p>Fortunately, most of the bags we tested come in at least neutral colors and design options. Our dad testers and our mom testers didn&#8217;t think any specific bag style was objectively &#8220;most neutral.&#8221; Taste is still going to play a big role in what you like. That said, we did have some popular picks.</p>
<p>JuJuBe won big with moms for the huge range of styles available. There are offerings that cover the entire spectrum of fashion sensibilities: many are colorful prints, but they do offer more subdued versions, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K3PLBGD/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the &#8220;Gray Matter&#8221; style</a>. It&#8217;s not going to pass for &#8220;tactical,&#8221; though.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077N4G6DW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eddie Bauer- Traverse</a> won some points in this category with the subdued-but-not-boring textured gray fabric. It&#8217;s only available in that color, but nearly everyone loved it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing stopping you from buying two diaper bags if you can’t agree on one design or shape. Just make sure you and your partner are on the same page about which bag actually has diapers and spare clothes in it.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I0P7WIU/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">JuJuBe &#8211; B.F.F.</a> is a lesson in excellence through compromise. This isn&#8217;t a gigantic bag, but it&#8217;s not too small to carry more than the essentials. It&#8217;s not a bag for all-day trekking, but the comfortable straps can be un-clipped. This is both a great shoulder bag and the best backpack diaper bag.</p>
<p>The fabric is durable, with a Teflon coating that makes it washable and stain-resistant. It feels smooth and supple, a real upgrade from the cheap polyester or even the Cordura-style nylon you find on suitcases and messenger bags.</p>
<p>Organization features are the real key to the B.F.F.&#8217;s success. <strong>The main compartment is spacious and allows for carrying bulky items along with your diaper-change essentials.</strong> The front zippered compartment keeps smaller items from getting lost, and there&#8217;s a no-scratch front pocket that&#8217;s great for sunglasses or smartphones.</p>
<p>The side pockets are great, easily holding baby bottles as well as <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-water-bottle/">our favorite water bottles</a> and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-sippy-cup/">sippy cups</a>. They&#8217;re insulated with Thinsulate, which is very good as far as insulation materials go. On a summer day when you&#8217;re out for more than a few hours, you&#8217;ll still want to use an ice pack inside the bag to maintain safe temperatures for milk or formula.</p>
<p>The founders of JuJuBe came from the world of sneakers, backpacks and sunglasses, and they&#8217;ve put together one of the largest selections of styles and prints available. This is a designer diaper bag, but it doesn&#8217;t sacrifice functionality for style.</p>

It easily converts from a great shoulder bag to a very good backpack, and it's just the right size. The great materials are also backed by a lifetime warranty.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I0P7WIU/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>When it comes to the changing pad, there&#8217;s a lot to love about the quality, but it&#8217;s the smallest pad we tested. The memory foam in the middle provides great cushioning, but it would probably be too thick to fit easily in the side pocket if it were any wider. The pad has one satin and one waterproof side to help with a variety of diaper emergencies and environments.</p>
<p>JuJuBe has been making this bag since 2005 and it&#8217;s a design they haven&#8217;t topped. Some of our friends have used JuJuBe bags for more than five years, and they just don&#8217;t die.</p>
<p><b>Key Takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The JuJuBe &#8211; B.F.F. is a near-perfect balance of style and functionality.</li>
<li>You can make the B.F.F a backpack or a shoulder bag and it&#8217;s great either way.</li>
<li>This bag is not too big for one baby, not too small for two toddlers.</li>
<li>Good materials, zippers and buckles are guaranteed for a lifetime against defects.</li>
<li>JuJuBe promises these bags will stand up to machine washing.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077N4G6DW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eddie Bauer &#8211; Traverse</a> backpack diaper bag has a look that all of our testers liked. It&#8217;s not the height of fashion, but the gray textured nylon has a sleek look that helps it blend in anywhere. This diaper backpack also has some features that make it great for carrying your baby-care essentials.</p>
<p>This is definitely the best diaper bag backpack on a budget. The zippers and other hardware are all fine. Not amazing, but perfectly acceptable for a $50 backpack. The one place where the price shows most clearly is in the changing pad: It will work well enough for a year or so, but the stitching on the edge of the pad started to unravel after washing it once.</p>
<p>Among our testers, the only thing more important than good organization features is good backpack straps. This bag has both. If you weigh it down with books it won’t beat a high-end backpack, but the shoulder straps are still comfortable when the bag is full of clothes and diaper-change supplies.</p>
<p>The main internal compartment is narrower than the JuJuBe, but it&#8217;s still a great diaper bag. There are obvious places for diapers, wipes, and other essentials. Our lead tester took this backpack on a Christmas vacation trip with two kids, and the sheer number of pockets with external zippered access was impressive.</p>
<p><strong>Having a few carefully planned pockets is usually better than having random pockets all over a bag.</strong> That principle becomes apparent when you&#8217;re getting used to a backpack like this. There are many pockets that could hold your keys, wallet or baby&#8217;s favorite pacifier, but the chance you&#8217;ll forget which one you used is high for the first week or so.</p>

The changing pad is the only place where the low price really shows. It's not the best backpack we've seen, but it's just right for diaper-change essentials.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077N4G6DW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The wipe pocket on the side of the bag is a handy feature to have that we quickly learned to appreciate in a late-night airport layover. Tossing a 100-count pack of <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-baby-wipes/">our favorite wipes</a> into the bag is less annoying than figuring out how many wipes to load. The side-pocket dispenser makes going back for that last sneaky blob of poop less of a hassle.</p>
<p>Stroller clips are built in to the top of this backpack, so you still have a way to hang it if you&#8217;re just out for a stroll. We know that some people don&#8217;t like stroller-mounting bags since a heavy bag can tip some strollers, but it&#8217;s nice to have the option.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Eddie Bauer &#8211; Traverse looks like a regular backpack, but inside it&#8217;s all diaper bag.</li>
<li>Real backpack straps make this easy to carry for all-day outings.</li>
<li>Our testers all liked the style of this bag.</li>
<li>For the price, quality and materials pretty good.</li>
<li>Wipes are kept handy in a convenient dispenser pocket.</li>

<p>This is a special edition of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B7XUVLW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Skip Hop &#8211; Duo</a> that brings some extra touches to a reliable budget-friendly tote. The handles and buckles all look better than the nylon luggage look of the original model, but the upgraded wipe-clean fabric is also stiff enough to help this bag stay upright better.</p>
<p>Compared to the JuJuBe, this is a smaller bag, about 13 liters instead of 16. But the fact that it&#8217;s tall and slim means it feels even smaller than it actually is while carrying loads of baby gear.</p>
<p>The real downside to the slim-and-tall shape of this bag is when you need to carry heavy, bulky stuff. Pumps, lunch boxes and shopping items have to be narrower than three inches to fit down to the bottom of the main compartment. That&#8217;s not a big problem since it&#8217;s a bag that will mostly carry folded clothes, diapers and wipes. However, if you like carrying a jumbo-size package of wipes you might be surprised at how much it fills the space.</p>
<p>This is a cross-body shoulder bag only, which means if you&#8217;re on an all-day outing you may start to resent it flopping around at your side. The shoulder strap is decent, but nothing special. Skip Hop has also sewn in a set of stroller attachment loops.</p>
<p>There are some simple but very effective organization features in this bag. The side pockets are a good size for bottles, and they&#8217;re zippered so the bottles sit inside the bag. This way you get even better insulation than you would with a bit of padding on the outside of a pouch pocket.</p>

The SE style options are more limited than for the regular Duo, but in either case you get a tote that holds plenty and still feels small.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B7XUVLW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p><strong>A zippered accessory pocket on the top holds as much as a mid-size purse — it won&#8217;t keep your glasses safe from your keys, but it&#8217;s a great catch-all for stuff you don&#8217;t want to lose in the bottom of the bag.</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a key-clip ring conveniently positioned on the zipper pull (we&#8217;ve never met anyone who used a key-keeper that&#8217;s hidden inside a pocket), but it doesn&#8217;t actually have a clip. Points for making it potentially useful, but none of our testers actually used it.</p>
<p>Front pockets on the Duo have magnetic buttons that don&#8217;t really do much to keep stuff in if you turn the bag upside-down, but they&#8217;re big enough for <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-water-bottle/">a 32-ounce insulated water bottle like our favorite Klean Kanteen</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a pen loop cleverly hidden in one of the front pouch pockets. We&#8217;d rather keep a pen in the zippered pocket, but at least it won&#8217;t fall out in either case.</p>
<p>The quality of the Skip Hop is not at the same level as the JuJuBe: The fabric stained in one spot after a few weeks and the zippers definitely feel less reliable (though we didn&#8217;t have any problems). Skip Hop won&#8217;t cover damage from a washing machine under warranty either. There&#8217;s a two-year warranty against defects.</p>
<p>The price is definitely a crowd-pleaser, though: Some of our testers assumed it was a $200 bag like the JuJuBe, but the list price is $70 and we&#8217;ve seen it going for as little as $42.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B7XUVLW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Skip Hop &#8211; Duo Special Edition</a> is an even better version of a mainstay budget diaper bag.</li>
<li>You can still hold a lot of diaper-changing gear in this tall, deceptively-slim design.</li>
<li>Special Edition style choices are limited, but they&#8217;re top-tier looks.</li>
<li>While this version only comes in fashion-forward patterns, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J4J243Y/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">regular Duo comes in more neutral styles</a>.</li>
<li>A shoulder bag only, so if you&#8217;ve got a long day you&#8217;ll be relying on the stroller clips.</li>

<p>In many ways, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074Q56ZJQ/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ergobaby &#8211; Coffee Run</a> feels like an attempt to make a better version of the Skip Hop Duo. The shape and pocket configuration are similar, though this is about 40% bigger than the Duo. The big difference is the addition of shoulder straps to make it a convertible design.</p>
<p>On the plus side, Ergobaby has included a big, totally-waterproof changing pad with this bag, six inches wider than most of the others. The organization of the interior pockets is good, and the front zippered pouch is insulated.</p>
<p>Ergobaby is famous for their baby carriers, which are usually made from materials that feel great and have excellent padding. We mostly bought this bag on faith that it would live up to that legacy. It&#8217;s a bit of a let-down that their foray into diaper bags feels like a cheap nylon school backpack.</p>
<p>Even with the water-resistant tub bottom and mesh panels on the shoulder straps, and after looking at the other color options, the look and feel did not impress any of our testers. <strong>Many assumed the Ergobaby was the least-expensive bag we tested, when it was actually more expensive than most at $70.</strong></p>
<p>That said, all but one of our testers said backpack straps are in their top two priorities for diaper bag features. Even if the Ergobaby straps aren&#8217;t exactly class-leading, they&#8217;re better than nothing. Compared to other large totes, like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RYU9FZA/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Skip Hop &#8211; Grand Central</a> or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NBT92X6/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">JuJuBe &#8211; Be Prepared</a>, these backpack straps can really save you from an aching neck when you load up the bag.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KL5LPHK/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Maman &#8211; Designer Tote</a> is putting all their style-eggs in the quilted-jacket basket, and it works pretty well. If you love this look, there&#8217;s a lot to love about the design of this bag, too.</p>
<p>As far as we can tell, this style launched around the same time as the Skip Hop &#8211; Duo Special Edition, so we&#8217;re not going to call out an original or a copycat. The styles are distinct because of the fabric, but most of the actual features are surprisingly similar. That&#8217;s not a bad thing, though, since the Skip Hop tote design has been a great choice since they launched it in 2003.</p>
<p>The same things we loved about the Skip Hop are present here: it&#8217;s a slim, tall tote shape that stands fairly well on its own. Maman gives you places to keep stuff from sinking to the bottom of the bag, but it&#8217;s not an overwhelming number of pockets to lose your keys in.</p>
<p>After using the bag for a few weeks, we started to wonder how well it would resist stains. The waterproof coating on the fabric does its job and it&#8217;s more durable than we expected. The quilt-stitching is almost certainly going to be the weak point in the long-term if you let this bag get buried under other stuff in your trunk or closet: wear on the corners of a bag is one thing, but there&#8217;s nothing appealing about a running stitch on a quilted design.</p>

<p>Obersee has made the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K2RXRWY/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bern backpack diaper bag</a> out of a unique combination of pieces you&#8217;d expect to see other places. This is basically an anti-diaper bag, but in the best way.</p>
<p><strong>If you cover up the labels, you could easily mistake this bag for a SwissGear laptop backpack.</strong> Obersee is a real family-owned American company that mostly sells gymnastics gear, not a giant luggage-brand-conglomerate that just swaps labels, so there&#8217;s nothing disingenuous about saying this was designed as a diaper bag. But the changing pad pocket is definitely a repurposed laptop pocket, complete with a fleece-lined tablet pouch on the side.</p>
<p>This is still a good bag for carrying baby gear. There&#8217;s a full-length zip-up mesh compartment for a change of clothes and plenty of room for whatever you might need to throw inside. There aren&#8217;t any features designed around carrying baby-specific items, but maybe you want a music player headphone pass-through more than a wipe dispenser. We won&#8217;t judge.</p>
<p>There are a few pieces that really do seem like the result of carefully thought-out design and clever innovation. The changing pad is slightly bigger than average, 23 by 14 instead of 22 by 12 inches. It also has a nice easy-cleaning waterproof side, like the Ergobaby changing pad.</p>
<p>The clip-on bottle pocket is a nifty design that does a much better job of keeping two or three bottles cold on a long summer day, but only if you slip an ice pack into the mesh pocket. Without ice it&#8217;s still not really any safer than throwing a bottle in the bottom of a regular diaper bag.</p>
<p>Having a bottle cooler is a great idea. When we took this bag on a trip it was very rewarding being able to store bottles, liquids and gels in it to detach when going through TSA checks before a flight.</p>
<p>Most of the time, though, this clip-on system wasn&#8217;t any better than having a separate bottle cooler bag. If anything, it kind of gets in the way when you need to open the backpack. We found ourselves leaving it detached most of the time we were testing.</p>
<p>If all of that sounds good, maybe this bag is for you. The price was what pushed it to the bottom of our ranking, though: For $80, you can probably find a backpack you like even better and slip an accessory changing pad into it, with money left over for <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-lunch-box/#the-best-small-coolers">a great small cooler</a>.</p>
<h2 id="changing-pads">Changing pad replacements we tested</h2>
<p>If you have a backpack or tote you like already, there&#8217;s nothing stopping you from adding a changing pad to make it a great diaper bag.</p>
<p>We tried the DaffaDoot and Baby Loovi changing pads, both much bigger than the average diaper bag pad and fairly affordable. They&#8217;re also great replacements if you happen to lose the pad that&#8217;s included in your diaper bag.</p>
<h3>An absorbent pad: DaffaDoot</h3>
<p>The first changing pad we tested is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GSJLTS8/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the DaffaDoot</a>. It&#8217;s gigantic — double the size of the average pad. It&#8217;s soft fleece on one side, water absorbent in the middle, and waterproof on the bottom. All that plush material makes this more difficult to fold up and stow in a bag, but it&#8217;s an excellent changing pad.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GSJLTS8/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>A Backup for the Car: DaffaDoot Absorbent Pad</h3><p>This is an extra-large changing pad, but it's also soft and absorbent on one side. We wouldn't want to rely on this as a changing pad on every outing, since you'll have to carry around everything it might soak up in your bag, but for protecting your car's upholstery it's perfect.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GSJLTS8/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a replacement to carry around in a bag, though, all our testers agree that a waterproof pad is definitely better than something that absorbs the kinds of fluids you might encounter during a diaper change. If you have a containment leak in a mall washroom, you want to be able to wipe everything off then and there.</p>
<p><strong>For an emergency in the car (where keeping the upholstery clean is mission-critical) DaffaDoot&#8217;s pad is perfect.</strong> You&#8217;ll probably be happiest if you store it in a plastic bag you can seal well until you have a chance to wash out whatever it soaks up.</p>
<h3>A wipe-down changing pad: Baby Loovi</h3>
<p>We also tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0EU3A5/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baby Loovi change pad</a>, an even bigger pad than the DaffaDoot at 25 by 31 inches. It&#8217;s easy to wipe down after any sort of messy encounter with a leaky diaper.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re the kind of person who appreciates a well-folded roadmap (do they still make those?), or someone who can get a bed-in-a-bag sheet set back in the storage pouch, you&#8217;ll love that the Loovi comes with a storage pouch that&#8217;s just big enough to keep your bag tidy.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0EU3A5/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Waterproof Pick: Baby Loovi</h3><p>This is a gigantic changing pad. At three times the size of a regular changing pad, you can probably use it doubled-up most of the time for extra padding. It's still easy to fit in a bag, and you can probably use it as a mattress protector when you're done with diapers.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0EU3A5/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If you can&#8217;t fold things to save your life, The Baby Loovi still a pretty manageable changing pad without the pouch. It isn&#8217;t as cushioning on hard surfaces as the DaffaDoot, but it&#8217;s much better than your average changing pad and easier to carry around.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Buying a diaper bag is a lot like buying most parenting gear: After spending years researching our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-baby-carrier/">baby carrier review</a>, <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-infant-car-seat/">car seat review</a> and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-baby-monitor/">baby monitor review</a> we think it’s clear that parents are faced with overwhelming choices. After carefully selecting and thoroughly testing six diaper bags, we’re confident that this is these picks all have something you&#8217;ll appreciate.</p>
<p><strong>We asked our testers what stood out after using a bag for five years or more, and they told us that backpack straps really do make a difference, but sometimes it&#8217;s also nice to have a shoulder bag.</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I0P7WIU/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">JuJuBe &#8211; B.F.F.</a> is the best example of a do-it-all bag: The straps totally convert from one mode to the other. Either way, the bag is great at keeping stuff organized for one or two babies.</p>
<p>If you prefer a purpose-built backpack or tote, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077N4G6DW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eddie Bauer &#8211; Traverse</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B7XUVLW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Skip Hop &#8211; Duo SE</a> are great bags too. They don&#8217;t quite live up to the great materials that make the JuJuBe such an unstoppable force in the world of diaper bags, but these two bags are still dependable and well-made for the price.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent a month researching and scoping out the best double strollers, personally inspecting more than 15 different models before picking our top three.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>Double strollers are a tricky category since the different types of strollers available have very different strengths and weaknesses. We spent a week searching forum posts, watching YouTube videos, and listening to podcasts to figure out what other parents love and hate about double strollers. We paid close attention to top picks from review sites like Baby Gear Lab, Wirecutter and Lucie’s List, and we hunted for negative reviews and accounts of long-term pain points.</p>
<p>By the end of our research, we had seventeen potential picks and we worked for another two weeks narrowing down the list. After looking at the core criteria, we settled on some <span style="font-weight: 400;">main features</span>.</p>
<h3>Compact folded size</h3>
<p>Many people who use doubles every day love jogging strollers because they&#8217;re easier to push and offer rugged durability. Popular joggers like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BSPDOQM/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">B.O.B. &#8211; Revolution</a> aren&#8217;t easy to fold and store, though, and right off the bat we eliminated any stroller that wouldn’t fit in the back of our tester&#8217;s compact car — a Toyota Corolla. If you&#8217;re driving something bigger maybe that isn&#8217;t as much of a concern, but if you&#8217;re driving around with two or more kids, you probably need all the cargo space you can get.</p>
<h3>Options for infants</h3>
<p>Umbrella strollers are compact when folded, but even the well-reviewed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0786PC3M5/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zoe XL2 double umbrella</a> (which we nearly tested) doesn&#8217;t recline far enough for infants. We did test one stroller that doesn&#8217;t have attachment options for carrying an infant car seat, but that model folds down to a very low angle to protect infant necks from flopping around. Umbrella strollers are also hard to push around and fold.</p>
<h3>Comfortable seating positions</h3>
<p>We settled on two tandem strollers and one side-by-side design for our testing group. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F5VQIE0/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">phil&amp;teds &#8211; Sport</a> (with an added second seat) is a well-reviewed stroller at a moderate price, but nobody we talked to actually liked using a stroller with the second seat so low to the ground.</p>
<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>This is where picking a &#8220;best&#8221; product gets tricky. Some will insist that the premium materials used on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KMYK367/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">UPPAbaby</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WLQG96K/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mountain Buggy</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073RZZ814/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bugaboo</a> strollers are well worth the price, but when we looked at the features we really needed and compared the strollers in person, we settled on a budget more of us can afford.</p>
<h3>Sensible design features</h3>
<p><b>We also paid close attention to tell-tale factors like weight ratings.</b> Many strollers give a weight rating for each seat, but on a side-by-side model, that&#8217;s really just half of the limit of the whole stroller&#8217;s weight capacity. The exceptions are strollers like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KMYK367/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">UPPAbaby &#8211; Vista</a>, which has a low limit in the front seat because all the weight is directly over the small front wheels (which have trouble swivelling with a bigger child in that seat). We also looked for comfort perks like adjustable handlebars and flip-flop-friendly brake releases.</p>
<p>After all that research, we sent our expecting double-dad with his three-year old and pregnant wife to local retailers to try every prospective stroller he could get his hands on (and to interrogate the staff about returns and warranties). After exhaustively comparing all the relevant stats, we settled on three top-ranked strollers that get you the features you need without breaking the bank.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20705" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/lineup.jpg" alt="Lineup of products" width="2000" height="1333" /><br />
[table id=221 /]
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Stroller width: </b>This measurement is a catch-22. Wider strollers are easier to turn, but they also may not fit through some passages or doors.</p>
<p><b>Folded size:</b> It&#8217;s important that you can actually take your stroller where you need it. If you haven&#8217;t bought a minivan yet, trunk space can get tight.</p>
<p><b>Wheel size:</b> A larger wheel rolls and swivels more easily, plus handles bumps better. They also make the stroller bulkier when folded.</p>
<p><b>Recline angle:</b> A stroller seat that reclines far enough can safely carry a newborn. Sources we checked list 30 to 45 degrees from horizontal as the maximum angle you should have your newborn sitting up.</p>
<p><b>Car carrier compatibility:</b> Not all car seats are compatible with all strollers. Generally speaking, if you&#8217;re buying from one of the bigger car seat manufacturers that also makes popular strollers, you don&#8217;t get any options for carrying other brands. Two of our picks have universal compatibility options.</p>
<p><b>Disney park stroller and wagon restrictions:</b> Since the spring of 2019, <a href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com/faq/parks/strollers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Disneyland and Disney World have specifically banned strollers bigger than 31 inches (79 cm) by 52 inches (132 cm)</a>. What&#8217;s more, no wagons or stroller wagons are permitted, even if they&#8217;re well within that size. </p>
<p>All the double strollers we&#8217;ve tested are technically approved, though the Britax B-Agile just barely squeaks through a 31-inch doorway; lots of reports say that it&#8217;s accepted by Disneyland staff, but it&#8217;s the tightest fit of the models we tested.</p>

<p><b>Stand-up fold position:</b> Some strollers will stand on their own when folded, which makes them less likely to fall over in front of your car when you&#8217;re parking in a small garage. Toddlers love climbing on parked strollers even when they&#8217;re folded, so storage hooks for hanging are still a good idea.</p>
<p><b>Flip-flop-friendly brakes:</b> This design allows you to both engage and disengage the parking brake lever with the downward motion of your foot, so you don&#8217;t have to use your toenails to take the brake off.</p>
<p><b>Strollers for toddler and infant</b><b>:</b> There are a few ways to optimize a stroller for tinies and bigs at the same time. All of our strollers feature dual full-sized seats, so two kids get the full stroller experience. Two of our picks also carry infant car seats. Other options when one of your kids gets bigger include a sit-and-stand or rear-facing bench configuration, where a bigger kid can ride in the back without needing to be lifted in and out of the seat for every single ride.</p>
<h2 id="stroller-types">Types of double strollers</h2>
<p><b>Tandem strollers: </b>Arrange the seats one behind the other. The biggest benefit to a tandem stroller is that it can be just as narrow as a single stroller: you can still fit through nearly all doorways and between parked cars. The downside, of course, is that they&#8217;re long. This makes the stroller more difficult to steer, and can even make turning some corners quite difficult. You won&#8217;t have as much trouble fitting down the aisle at the pharmacy, but you may not be able to make the turn at the end.</p>
<p><b>Side-by-side strollers: </b>This style has seats arranged next to each other, so they&#8217;re as short in wheelbase as a single stroller but much wider. The big benefit to this arrangement is that they&#8217;re easy to turn: our side-by-side pick can be spun in a circle with one hand. The wide wheelbase means that you may have trouble fitting through some doors or walkways, though.</p>
<p><b>Double jogging strollers: </b>This is a specialized variety of the side-by-side type. Jogging doubles have big bicycle-style wheels, locking front steering wheels for coasting without wobbles, and safety brakes that activate automatically if you let go of the stroller. The big wheels are a benefit any time you&#8217;re pushing, especially on rough terrain, but these strollers are harder to fold and transport in a car (they don&#8217;t even fit in some SUV hatchbacks). We didn&#8217;t test any jogging strollers, though many of our friends are &#8220;B.O.B. snobs&#8221; who wouldn&#8217;t go back to a regular stroller unless you forced them.</p>
<h2>Strollers vs. wagons</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re in the market for a double stroller because you have too much stuff to carry, you should also check out our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-folding-wagon/">review of the best folding wagons</a>. We&#8217;ve compared the popular models that come in at less than $400 (sorry, Keenz and Veer fans) and found that they&#8217;re good at different things than a stroller is.</p>
<p>The big question when comparing a wagon and a stroller is how long your kids will be riding at a time. If you just need to get your kids (and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-diaper-bags/">a diaper bag</a>, and a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-beach-umbrella-chair-tent/">beach chair and pop-up shelter</a> and a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-lunch-box/">small cooler</a> on top of all that) down to the beach, wagons are amazing. Wagons are less helpful if you want to quickly click in an <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-infant-car-seat/">infant car seat</a> and walk around the mall for an hour or more.</p>

This wagon isn't as maneuverable as a stroller, but it's perfect for hauling extra stuff around.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CTUGC5K/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Comfort is also a trade-off: Strollers are unquestionably more comfortable for kids to sit in for a long period of time when they&#8217;re strapped in and you&#8217;re walking, but kids have less room to wiggle or lie down. A wagon like the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CTUGC5K/?tag=ybdwagn-20">Radio Flyer &#8211; 3-in-1</a> is like a combination between a bassinet and a rolling bench, and it folds to a more compact size than even a single stroller.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Our lead tester cycled through these strollers for four months of day-to-day use with his three-year-old and newborn. Each stroller went to parks, festivals, on walks to the library, and car trips out of town. We tried to find the worst situations for each stroller, and we also consulted with other testers who owned the same strollers or similar strollers to find long-term pain points.</p>
<h3>Mobility and accessibility</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Britax-turningloop.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We wheeled these strollers over all kinds of urban terrain, from muddy parks to busy malls. Broken sidewalks, cobbles and curbs all revealed the difference in ride quality you get with larger wheels and spring suspension.</p>
<p>It quickly became clear, once we had walked the strollers on the same paths, that wider wheels make for better maneuverability. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06VWS5C94/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Britax &#8211; B-Agile Double Stroller</a> is so easy to turn, it&#8217;s almost a game. The weight is evenly balanced over the wheels, and the adjustable handlebar means short or tall parents don&#8217;t have to hunch or curl their arms awkwardly.</p>
<p>In comparison, the tandem-configuration strollers we tried became more difficult to steer the narrower they got. The biggest difference with a narrow stroller is a feeling of instability, like you&#8217;re going to push the stroller over instead of making a tight turn.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a trade-off to make, of course. <b>A wider stroller won&#8217;t always fit where you need to go.</b> If you arrive at a hotel room with two screaming kids and your stroller doesn&#8217;t fit through the door until you unload everything and fold it, you might start crying, too.</p>
<h3>Kid comfort</h3>
<p>The biggest impact on kid comfort in a stroller is definitely personal space. If you&#8217;re looking for a narrow tandem-style design so you can fit through tight doorways, you&#8217;re turning your stroller into a tiny two-seat version of an airplane cabin. If the front seat reclines, the kid in the back will feel it. That said, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J889IBQ/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contours &#8211; Options Elite</a> gives a good amount of legroom for a tandem, and its seats give more headroom for taller kids than the Britax does.</p>
<h3>Folding and storage</h3>

<p>Not everyone who needs a double stroller will need to fit it in the back of a small car, but many of us do. Even if you&#8217;re driving a minivan while sightseeing on a road trip, a compact fold can be the difference between enjoying your stroller and wishing you&#8217;d left it at home.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N15BCSV/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Joovy &#8211; Caboose Too Ultralight</a> is a long, skinny, flat package when folded, and technically takes up the least volume. The Britax scores points here, though, because while it takes up more height and depth there&#8217;s room to slide a carry-on suitcase beside the folded stroller.</p>
<p>Folding the Contours (pictured above in the trunk of a Toyota Corolla) you have a similar footprint to the Joovy, but in some configurations you&#8217;ll have to take one seat off before you load it in a small trunk so you don&#8217;t run out of height.<br />
[table id=222 /]
<h3>Versatility</h3>
<p>All of these strollers offer various options. If one of your babies is already three years old and you have a newborn on the way, you may not need a seat for your oldest very often. A stroller like the Joovy &#8211; Caboose Too is perfect for this scenario, with any combination of a car seat cradle, two forward-facing seats, a bench seat, and standing platform.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got two infants of the same size and want to keep them both in car seat carriers while you go for a stroll, Contours easily wins this category. Joovy only handles one car seat with the Caboose platform, and Britax has discontinued car seat adapters altogether. Contours also allows you to re-orient the seats to face any way you want.<br />

<p>The flexibility of its seating positions makes the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J889IBQ/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contours &#8211; Options Elite</a> the best double stroller for twins. It handles beautifully compared to other tandem strollers in this price range, with bigger wheels and a wide wheelbase to make rolling and turning easier.</p>
<p>Unlike other strollers that prioritize one seat over the other, the Options Elite uses identical seats in both positions. You can also add car seat adapters in either position, with click-in adapters available for all of the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-infant-car-seat/">best infant car seats we tested</a>. Note that because of seat size, some pairs of car seats may only fit in certain orientations.</p>
<p>The fact that these seats can be installed to face each other was a huge highlight of our testing time. There&#8217;s opportunity for fighting siblings to torment each other this way, of course, but changing to facing-away mode is just as quick and simple.</p>

The seats can dock in any position, and the quality is great for the price. Bigger wheels make the ride quality good, too, though this stroller is slightly trickier to fit in a small trunk.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J889IBQ/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Everything about the Contours stroller is a little bit nicer than the other models we tested, but list price is $399, only a third the cost of a premium stroller like the UPPAbaby &#8211; Vista.</p>
<p>The wheels on the Contours are already quite large for its class, which is part of what makes this stroller roll smoothly. Unfortunately, those 10-inch baller rims also make this stroller tricky to fit in your trunk. The seats also won&#8217;t let you fully fold this stroller if you have them in certain positions or recline angles.</p>
<p>You can easily pop the wheels and seats off if needed, and we could usually figure out a way to adjust the seats or wheels to make this stroller still fit in our tester&#8217;s Corolla with everything attached. Forget about fitting anything else bulky in the trunk at the same time, though.</p>
<p>The one other caveat with wheels is that the rear wheels stick out wider than the rest of the stroller. If you&#8217;ve ever owned a stroller with this design feature, you&#8217;ve probably got the rear wheel stuck on a tight doorway. It&#8217;s a minor complaint, since the wider wheelbase goes a long way to making turning more stable, but it&#8217;s something you should be aware of when comparing strollers.</p>

<p>The other minor sticking point on this stroller is the fold-release lock. While the folding action is smooth and works well, the multitude of possible seat positions means the lock that keeps the stroller folded isn&#8217;t a tight fit the way the locks on the other two strollers are. The amount of wiggle room makes it slightly more difficult to disengage the lock while you&#8217;re unfolding, and if you try to pull the stroller apart after the lock accidentally re-engages enough times, you could break it.</p>

<p>Unlike the Joovy, the Contours doesn&#8217;t come with a snack tray. If you want to buy accessories, though, you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GP8ZZF2/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">add a tray to both seats</a>, unlike the Joovy which doesn&#8217;t have an option for the rear seat.</p>
<p>The seats themselves are also loaded with features. The recline mechanism allows each seat to go all the way down to 25 degrees above flat — not as far as the Britax, but lower than the recline of most car seats. The leg rests are also adjustable and the built-in canopies are bigger than average. The zip-open mesh &#8220;peekaboo&#8221; panel on the canopy is a nice touch, too.</p>
<p>Another great feature of the Contours is the storage basket. It&#8217;s big and easy to get into in most configurations. Even if you&#8217;ve got a kid&#8217;s legs obstructing your access from the back, there&#8217;s a side access option.</p>
<p><b>When you&#8217;ve got the stroller unfolded and ready to go, this is a dream ride compared to the Joovy.</b> It rolls and turns more easily because of the wide wheelbase and the more balanced weight distribution — not as easy to turn as the Britax side-by-side, but it&#8217;s good for a tandem stroller.</p>
<p>The most obvious reason to pick this stroller is if you want to use two car seats at once. Even if you just want to use one car seat, click-in adapters for all the different car seat brands make this stroller nicer to use than the Joovy.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Contours &#8211; Options Elite gives you more seating options: each seat can be mounted forward or rear-facing.</li>
<li>Adapters available to click-in most car seats in either position.</li>
<li>This tandem design makes a good compromise between easy pushing and narrow width.</li>
<li>This is the biggest stroller we tested when folded, but it still fits in a compact car trunk.</li>
<li>Full-featured reclining seats with room to grow.</li>
<li>More expensive than our other picks, though still very competitive with other brands offering the same features.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Joovy &#8211; Caboose Too Ultralight is based on the popular Joovy Caboose sit-and-stand stroller, with the addition of a snap-in extra rear seat. It&#8217;s a very popular stroller in either configuration. <b>The flexibility and value are the real stand-out selling points: if your babies are spaced more than a year apart, this stroller will grow with them.</b></p>
<p>For mounting a carrier like the ones we tested in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-infant-car-seat/">car seat review</a>, Joovy&#8217;s built-in system uses the side-rails and a front-mounted neoprene cradle for the front of the car seat. There are two straps stored permanently in side pockets so you can cinch the car seat down tight. The way the strap is attached to the buckle makes finding the right length more difficult than it could have been, but it won&#8217;t loosen accidentally.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve got twins, the Joovy is a great stroller as soon as they can sit up. Even with older twins, the bench configuration offers enough leg room to get a year or two more of use when the rear forward-facing seat is too cramped.</p>
<p>With an older toddler and a baby sibling, the space offered in the forward-facing back seat is just big enough for a three-year-old like E.J., the blondie in our pictures. <b>Joovy designed this stroller so you&#8217;ll probably hit the 80-pound weight limit before they outgrow the legroom.</b> The canopy is taller than most, too, at more than 24 inches above the base of the front seat.</p>
<p>Unlike taller convertible tandems like the Contours, the Joovy lets you move a heavier child to the rear seat (so you can still steer the front wheels) without having to lift them so high off the ground.</p>

<p>This stroller is identical to the regular <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BMAW0M2/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Joovy &#8211; Caboose Ultralight</a> except for the addition of the snap-in rear seat. Once your oldest is too big for the constraints of the rear seat, converting to Joovy&#8217;s signature rear-facing bench seat is simple. <b>In a few more years, it&#8217;s just as easy to slide the bench forward so an older kid (or two, if they&#8217;re light enough) can hitch a ride by standing on the platform.</b></p>
<p>The flexibility of the Caboose Too is its strongest suit. Long after other doubles are uselessly small, you&#8217;ll still be able to throw your library books or groceries in the basket and give a seven-year-old an occasional break from walking while a four-year-old naps in the front.</p>

<p>Folding and unfolding the Joovy is very similar to other tandem strollers. The trickiest part is figuring out how to stand so you can pull the outside pieces of the frame together; if your arms are long enough, you can stand at the back and grab the front tray or seat and just pull it toward you.</p>
<p>Fitting this stroller into storage or the back of a compact car is a cinch. <b>We looked long and hard to find another tandem that&#8217;s as compact, and we have yet to find one.</b> The Joovy lies flat in your trunk so you can fit groceries and backpacks on top, but it will take up most of the width.</p>
<p>That said, if you&#8217;d rather have a stroller take up nearly the full height of two-thirds of your trunk but still have room for a carry-on suitcase beside it, the Britax side-by-side is what you want.</p>
<p>When it&#8217;s folded, the Joovy doesn&#8217;t stand on its own. With the brake on it&#8217;s stable leaning against a wall, and you can also wheel it around in the folded configuration if you leave the brake off. It&#8217;s also the lightest full-function stroller we found and you may prefer to carry it around.</p>

It's a real upgrade over other budget tandems, but it's still affordable. The light frame and narrow wheelbase make this easy to handle and store when folded, but it's also more robust and versatile than an umbrella-fold double. If your kids are three years apart, the modes on offer here are practically perfect.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N15BCSV/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>For twins, there&#8217;s no way to attach two infant car seats to this stroller or fully recline both seats. You could still use the front position with a carrier in the universal-fit cradle while you carry a twin in a baby carrier, but if you&#8217;re expecting twins that&#8217;s probably not what you had in mind from a double stroller. Contours and Britax are both much better choices if you&#8217;ve got two babies who can&#8217;t sit up yet.</p>
<p>Our long-term tester, A.A., says maneuverability is her biggest complaint. You can&#8217;t steer this stroller with one hand, and it&#8217;s tricky with tight corners. &#8220;I knew this going in,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and as much as it bothers me from time to time, I put up with it to have a relatively small double stroller.&#8221;</p>
<p>The four-wheel suspension doesn&#8217;t work nearly as well as Joovy would like you to think. When you roll over cobblestones or uneven sidewalks, you&#8217;ll definitely feel it. It&#8217;s better than some umbrella strollers, but doesn&#8217;t compare well to the suspension systems used by bigger strollers we tested.</p>
<p>A.A. also notes that the open-cell foam used for padding the handle does pick up perfumed scents from the hands of anyone who uses the stroller.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Joovy &#8211; Caboose Too Ultralight is a flexible and affordable double stroller.</li>
<li>When folded, this is a very light and compact package.</li>
<li>A stroller that grows with your family, from the birth of your second child until you don&#8217;t need a stroller anymore.</li>
<li>The front seat reclines down low, though it gets into the space of the back seat.</li>
<li>This isn&#8217;t an option for infant twins, since the back seat has limited recline.</li>
<li>With a long, skinny wheelbase, this is not a maneuverable stroller.</li>
<li>If your kids are spaced further apart than three years, skip the second seat and just get the regular Caboose Ultralight.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-side-by-side">Best side-by-side: Britax &#8211; B-Agile</h2>
<p>The Britax &#8211; B-Agile Double is a classic take on a side-by-side design. It&#8217;s light, easy to fold and pack, and easy to maneuver. If you can manage your infant (or twins) without a travel-system attachment for your car seat, this our pick for best side-by-side double stroller.</p>
<p>The Britax is the easiest to maneuver out of our three picks. The handlebar height quickly adjusts to make things easier for parents who are shorter or taller than the average, and you can turn this stroller on a dime. It also has a 100-pound weight limit, 20 than most strollers in this price bracket.</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Britax-Folding.mov" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The only downside to the short wheelbase is that this stroller is wide. It&#8217;s one of the narrower side-by-side designs we looked at, at only 31 inches, so it&#8217;ll fit through any doorway that complies with the 32-inch Americans with Disabilities Act standard for accessible design. That&#8217;s not every door everywhere, but it&#8217;s most of them. We ran into trouble at a hotel in San Diego when we found out that our room had a 29-inch doorway.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a full 10 inches wider than the Joovy, so on a narrow sidewalk or in a crowded store aisle you could find yourself obstructing other people, but at least you&#8217;ll be able to turn around easily if you get stuck.</p>
<p>Reclining the Britax means loosening the support strap that holds up the backrest, like on many strollers. The Britax uses two straps, which probably makes the seat stronger than the seats which use plastic gears at the attachment point, but you have to hook your finger through two loops when you&#8217;re pulling. It&#8217;s not a bad seat design, but the other seats are quicker to adjust with one hand.</p>

<p>The elephant in the room with this stroller is the car seat adapter. Britax used to make one that works as a click-in docking system with their own car seats, and also a universal strap-down cradle. Then there was a recall.</p>
<p>The recall reports are pretty shocking: The car seat attachment adapters were totally exposed and sticking out when the stroller is folded, and became unreliable after they were damaged by dropping or sliding around in car trunks. Car seats fell off of strollers.</p>
<p><b>Britax issued a replacement part with a safety strap that should prevent them from detaching, but you can&#8217;t buy any of these parts in North America.</b> The attachment point is still part of the frame, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00QCCG2UW/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EU version of the B-Agile adapter</a> is still sold over there. Britax HQ says that the <a href="https://www.britax-roemer.com/safetynotice-clickgo-adapters/SafetyNotice-ClickGo-Adapters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">car seats used in the EU are &#8220;totally different,&#8221;</a> and they aren&#8217;t concerned.</p>
<p>If you really want to attach a car seat to a side-by-side stroller like this, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019W8W8KA/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baby Jogger &#8211; City Mini Double</a> works the same way the old Britax system did. Baby Jogger has also <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2013/Baby-Jogger-Recalls-Car-Seat-Adaptors-for-Strollers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recalled some of their strollers and car seat adapters</a> over unrelated issues, though you can buy the replacement versions.</p>
<p>If you can find the safe updated version of the Britax adapter, or you decide to shell out the extra cash to buy the Baby Jogger and get more car seat compatibility (for Graco, Cybex, and Maxi Cozi car seats), think twice before resting a Costco box on top of them in your trunk. These bits of plastic are going to bear the entire weight of your child and car seat.</p>
<h3>Other features</h3>
<p>The adjustable handlebar on the Britax is a pretty great perk that even the Baby Jogger &#8211; City Mini Double doesn&#8217;t have. In addition to more comfort for short or tall parents when strolling, it also allows you to position the handlebar so that the stroller can stand up when it&#8217;s folded. That makes this the only free-stander from our top picks.</p>
<p>The brake release on the Britax doesn&#8217;t really qualify as flip-flop-friendly, but it&#8217;s close. The pedal is large and easy to release. There aren&#8217;t sharp edges, either, so our testers didn&#8217;t feel like it was a problem when wearing sandals.</p>
<p>The mesh panel windows with cover flaps are a great way to keep an eye on what&#8217;s happening down below the canopy, and make it easy to take a peek when your baby is taking a nap inside the snug little cave created by the fully reclined seat.</p>
<p>These seats are very nice and roomy, right up until your child is too tall. The back measures 18 inches from seat to the start of the canopy: an older kid (like O.M. in the image above) can still ride on the stroller, but leaning against the edge of the canopy is barely more comfortable than the bench seat on the Joovy.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06VWS5C94/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Britax &#8211; B-Agile Double Stroller</a> lives up to its name, and is the easiest stroller to push without spending more than $400.</li>
<li>This side-by-side design won&#8217;t fit through 30-inch doorways, but otherwise it&#8217;s good to go.</li>
<li>A square-ish folded shape makes this even easier to fit in a trunk than a long-but-narrow tandem.</li>
<li>The Britax is 20% lighter than the closest competing side-by-side, and half the price.</li>
<li>The seats are shorter, but this stroller easily carries more weight than the others we tested.</li>
<li>An adjustable handlebar makes this great for parents who fight over how tall things should be.</li>
<li>Recline angle goes very low for newborns, but Britax has discontinued all car seat attachments for this model.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>We researched dozens of strollers and spent four months testing our top picks, and it&#8217;s tricky to say that any one stroller is going to be the very best for everybody. But we&#8217;ve got three great strollers that are a good value and have specific perks that could make them the best stroller for you.</p>
<p>The Contours &#8211; Options Elite gives you, like the name says, options. You can get this much seating flexibility in other convertible strollers that cost more, but we like that Contours has balanced the seat placement specifically to make it a good double stroller. The wheels are big enough to give a smooth ride, but they don&#8217;t stop you from fitting the folded stroller in your trunk.</p>
<p>If you have an older child and a baby, the Joovy &#8211; Caboose Too Ultralight will synchronize better with your needs than nearly any other stroller. Even after your older child is too big for the removable rear seat, Joovy has you covered with a bench seat and a running board. Joovy&#8217;s strap-down car seat cradle system doesn&#8217;t give you snap-in compatibility, but you won&#8217;t have to worry about finding adapters.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t care about car seats at all, Britax has you covered with the truly easy-to-push B-Agile Double. Extra perks like low-recline seats and adjustable handlebar height make this a very tough competitor to beat. It&#8217;s also the most compact double stroller in the trunk, and very light if you need to carry it.<br />

These full-featured seats give you lots of position options right up until your kids are too heavy to lift into the top seat.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J889IBQ/?tag=ybd2stroll-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e took four top-rated car seats and asked six experienced parents to size them up. After two months of testing and a thorough debrief, our team picked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BRQWV8H/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Britax &#8211; B-Safe Ultra</a> as the best infant car seat. Easy-to-use installation and harness adjustment features make this a great seat to work with and you get extra installation flexibility with European-style shoulder belt routing. If you&#8217;re looking for advanced crash protection features, the Britax is no slouch, but we also like the compact <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VHVID1O/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cybex &#8211; Aton2</a> for its extra features.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Shopping for car seats can be a nightmare. The number of brands is staggering and they all seem to be offering different approaches to keep your baby safe.</p>
<p>We spent three weeks checking reviews from the top baby product test websites, like Wirecutter, Consumer Reports and BabyGearLab. Some of the models mentioned in those reviews have been replaced with new designs, so we talked to retail associates at two local BuyBuyBaby stores and looked at video coverage from baby product trade shows.</p>
<p><strong>We honed in on the $200 price bracket as the best value.</strong> If you spend $180–230 you can get some premium features that trickle down from more expensive seats. Spending more than that doesn&#8217;t seem to get you more features than the Britax has, while the sacrifices you make at a lower price point are pretty big losses in convenience.</p>
<p>The features we prioritized when shopping were all related to daily use: adjusting the fit of the harness, moving the seat from one car to another, and using the seat &#8220;bucket&#8221; without its base (like you would in a taxi or Uber).</p>
<p>We compiled a list of 15 car seats and inspected them in-store before purchasing our test lineup. We also checked Amazon buyer reviews and looked for recall notices.</p>
<h2 id="lineup">Compare the best infant car seats</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20460" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Lineup.jpg" alt="lineup of seats" width="2000" height="1333" /><br />
[table id=217 /]
<h2 id="who-needs-this">Who needs an infant car seat?</h2>
<p>Put simply, if you want to move a baby in a car, you need a purpose-built car seat. <strong>If you&#8217;ve done your planning for delivery day, you&#8217;ve probably already found out that hospitals and birth centers won&#8217;t let you take a baby home unless you have an approved infant car seat.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to plan ahead and make sure you buy and know how to install your car seat a few months before your due date. You don&#8217;t want to be caught off guard if baby arrives early!</p>
<p>There are two main qualifications for a seat that will protect a newborn. First, the car seat has to be rear-facing (and in the back seat). In a crash, the force of baby&#8217;s weight has to be spread out along the padded back of the seat, not just into the straps. Most states require rear-facing seats for the first two years, and many safety experts advise keeping your kids rear-facing for as long as possible.</p>
<p>Second, the seat has to recline quite low, but not too low. Official specs range from 35 to 40 degrees incline. Recline is necessary so a newborn’s head won&#8217;t just flop down onto their chest, but if it’s too low the momentum in a crash would just go into the shoulder straps instead of the back of the seat.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible to move your baby to a less-reclined seat once they have enough neck strength, but typically a baby won&#8217;t be able to sleep comfortably sitting up — most people keep the reclined position until their baby is too big for an infant car seat.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>

<strong>Extra crash-protection features:</strong> Most car seats will make claims about design considerations that specifically go above and beyond the baseline crash test performance allowed under federal regulations. Sorting through these claims, and linking up claims with tested results, is tricky at best.</p>
<p><strong>Installation aids:</strong> The more readily apparent benefits come from systems that make securing your car seat to the anchors in your car quick and simple. Clips and belt-paths are color coded, and safety labels point out exactly what to do for an installation. Most seats in the same price bracket have comparable features, but not all are created equal.</p>
<p><strong>Options for no-base installs:</strong> If you find yourself taking a car seat in a taxi, Uber or your mom&#8217;s car, will you be able to secure the carrier without the base? European standards include the option to wrap the shoulder belt around the front of the carrier for easier and more secure installs — you never know when you may need it.</p>
<p><strong>Seat size and adjustment:</strong> Most parents don&#8217;t know exactly how big their baby is when they buy a car seat, so it&#8217;s important to have a seat that can fit a range of heights. It should also be easy to adjust the seat straps to grow with your baby.</p>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> If you leave the car seat installed in a car all the time, this may not be a critical feature. But if you&#8217;re lugging one of these carriers around for extended periods of time, you may appreciate saving a few pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Materials:</strong> All the big car seat manufacturers target parents with exclusive materials and patterns. We didn&#8217;t find anything ultra-luxe like flame-retardant-free wool in the $200 price bracket we tested.</p>
<h2 id="crash-testing">A word about crash tests</h2>
<p>Crash test results are an interesting wrinkle in car seat safety. The National Highway Transportation Safety Agency (NHTSA) has rules about minimum car seat protection and they test car seats extensively to help make every seat on the road safe, but many car seat manufacturers claim safety features that aren&#8217;t related to the core set of crash test measurements.</p>
<p>After running a four-year pilot study, the NHTSA determined that &#8220;<a href="https://one.nhtsa.gov/Laws-&amp;-Regulations/Child-Passenger-Safety/Regulations-Safety-Standards-and-Safety-Rating-Program-for-Child-Restraint-Systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a rating program based on simulated crashes would not provide practicable, readily understandable, or meaningful information to consumers.</a>&#8221; Thus, if you see a safety &#8220;rating&#8221; on a car seat at a retailer or in a review, it&#8217;s not based on a standardized test that&#8217;s recognized by the NHTSA.</p>
<p>Review publications like Consumer Reports have chosen to run crash tests themselves. These tests are looking at factors outside the scope of federal regulations to see if they can find differences between car seats. An example is side-impact testing: some review tests are designed to show an absolute worst-case scenario of a vehicle sliding sideways at 30 miles per hour and colliding with a stationary object exactly on the door next to a car seat installed in a side seat.</p>
<p>Nobody&#8217;s saying that side-impact performance isn&#8217;t something worth paying attention to, but you should spend more time reading an instruction manual and finding a way to install your car seat in a center seat than you do combing through crash test results.</p>
<p><strong>Learn about how the anchors in your car and attachment systems on your car seat work together to make a tight, secure installation.</strong> That, and driving safely, are the best things you can do to protect your children.</p>
<p>The NHTSA does <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/car-seats-and-booster-seats/clasificaciones-de-facilidad-de-uso" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provide a rating on how easy a car seat is to use</a>. They look at instruction manuals, installation features, labels and harness restraints. We tested four car seats for ourselves, and the official scores line up closely with our assessment.</p>
<h2 id="convertible-car-seats">What about a convertible car seat?</h2>
<p>A convertible car seat makes sense in a lot of ways. You buy just one seat and can use it in different positions for years — maybe even until your child is tall enough to use a seat belt without a booster.</p>
<p>A convertible can replace three different car seats and that&#8217;s a big money saver. You also get all the safety benefits of a larger seat, and if you want to spend money on premium features you only have to spend it once.</p>

<p><strong>The downside, though, is literally huge.</strong> The back of a convertible is so tall that when it&#8217;s reclined in rear-facing mode for an infant, it takes up a lot of extra room. In anything but a minivan, it&#8217;s a tricky fit.</p>
<p>In our experience, this even makes it difficult to get convertibles to recline far enough for use with newborns. Unless your vehicle has legroom to spare, a dedicated infant car seat makes far more sense for the first year.</p>
<p>Once your baby is big enough to sit in a more upright rear-facing position that won&#8217;t take up all your legroom, these tall-back designs make a lot more sense. You&#8217;re usually ready for this shift when your baby is one year old, but follow manufacturer instructions about height and weight limits.</p>
<p>If your family is continuing to grow, separate infant, toddler and booster seats can be a good way to get the most value out of your purchases. <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-booster-car-seat/">Check out our review of forward-facing booster seats for big kids here</a>.</p>

<p>We asked a team of five moms and one dad to try out these car seats. They compared ease of installation and fit with their babies, plus we tested each of these car seats with our universally-compatible double strollers.</p>
<p>We installed the carriers in cars with and without bases, and our lead tester&#8217;s family used them all to carry B.J. — a chunky-monkey little newborn — during shopping trips and outings for two months.</p>
<h3>Installation of the car seats</h3>
<h3>[table id=216 /]</h3>
<p>For testing, we installed car seats in four different vehicles: a compact sedan, minivan and two SUVs. Obviously, the more space between the seats, the easier installation was. The &#8220;Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children&#8221; (LATCH) system is a nearly universal standard that makes attaching seats pretty similar across vehicles.</p>
<p>There are some perks and quirks that differentiate each system, but our biggest takeaway is that you should get a car seat with some easy-to-use tension aid for secure installation. The Cybex is a good example, with a giant tensioning lever that makes sure the belt or latch strap is extra tight without all the knee-on-seat gymnastics you&#8217;d need to get the same results with some other systems.</p>
<p><strong>In comparison, the basic strap-mounted tensioner that Graco uses on all their seats requires too much work to get tight, and even more work to remove.</strong> Our lead tester has used that system on four different infant seats and convertibles, and he&#8217;s ready for this bare-bones style of LATCH strap to just disappear.</p>
<p>All the car seats we checked provide a mechanism for leveling out the base when on an angled car seat, and they all provided a nearly identical degree of adjustment. Sadly, many cars have seat padding that&#8217;s even more dramatic than these systems account for and you may still find yourself adding rolled up receiving blankets, towels or pieces of pool noodle under the car seat base to help level it out.</p>
<h3>Length and leg room</h3>

Installing a car seat in the back also often means losing some leg room in the front; about the only way to get around that is to drive a minivan. We checked the length of the seats in a few different positions, and found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VHVID1O/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cybex &#8211; Aton2</a> gives you the most space.<br />
When resting on level ground as in the photo above, the Britax has a slight edge over the Chicco, but if you adjust the recline angle for a newborn the difference basically disappears.</p>
<h3>Installation without a base</h3>
<p>This is where the better seats start to distinguish themselves. Britax and Cybex both provide a &#8220;euro-style&#8221; belt path. This means that if you&#8217;re installing the car seat with a three-point retractable shoulder belt, you can actually wrap the shoulder belt around the front of the seat and use the retracting mechanism to make it more secure.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in a situation where you have the car seat and not the base, this extra level of security is a big deal. H-clip accessories (provided with the Chicco and Graco) can help make a conventional belt path more secure, but most of us will struggle holding everything in place to get the belt tight. The wrap-around installation is even more secure and much easier to do by yourself.</p>
<h3>Fit and tension of harness</h3>
<h3>[table id=215 /]</h3>
<p>All of the models we tested except for the older Graco have a front-adjusting harnesses. On basic models like the Graco &#8211; Snugride 30, you have to adjust the fit of the harness from the underside of the seat, which is awkward at best. Graco has addressed this with a front adjustment on the Snuglock 30.</p>
<p>Once you move up to a quick-release tension system with an adjustment strap in the front, it&#8217;s easy to tighten and loosen the harness every time you take baby in the car. Just pull the &#8220;tail&#8221; of the harness with one hand while you check for fit with your other hand. Releasing tension to make unbuckling easier was simple for all of these systems.</p>
<p>The other adjustment that you&#8217;ll need to make periodically, though, is harness height. Straps should always start at a level just below your baby&#8217;s shoulders to pull them down into the bottom of the seat.</p>

    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/harnessadjuster.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p><strong>Britax is the only manufacturer we found that sells a seat with a no-rethread harness in this price bracket.</strong> When your baby hits a growth spurt, that lets you quickly and easily adjust shoulder harness height without having to take apart the seat.</p>
<p>Rethreading isn&#8217;t very difficult if you read the directions carefully and pay attention to which slot you&#8217;re coming from and which slot you&#8217;re moving to — but it takes time and you have to take your baby out of the carseat. Any feature that helps you keep up and stay sane is well worth considering.</p>
<h3>Weight and age range</h3>
<p>How do you know when your baby is too big for a car seat? This is one of the tricky parts of purchasing your car seat: you may not even know your baby&#8217;s sex when you purchase a car seat, let alone how tall they&#8217;ll be at six months of age.</p>
<p>Weight and height ranges are prominent in the specs for these car seats, but in almost every case you&#8217;ll find that the reason you have to stop using a carseat is that your child&#8217;s torso is too tall, regardless of how short their legs may be.</p>
<p>We checked the car seats for &#8220;seat back length&#8221; in the chart above by measuring along the back-board where your baby&#8217;s spine rests, from the bottom of the seat to the rim of the seat. Note that manufacturers typically consider a seat too small when your baby&#8217;s head comes up to an inch before the head comes up to the top of the back-board part of the seat.</p>
<p>Legs can stick out of a carseat without any issues, but if the head is within an inch of the top level of the carseat, your baby is growing up fast and ready for a bigger car seat.</p>
<p>The other factor to consider is the width of the cushions included. The Cybex &#8211; Aton2 has the biggest, fluffiest cushions and the second-narrowest &#8220;bucket,&#8221; which makes it the best fit for tiny babies. One of our testers, A.M., seemed entirely too small in the Graco and Chicco.</p>
<h3>Stroller compatibility</h3>
<p>Sadly, this is an area where combinations of strollers and car seats are either fine or not good at all.</p>
<p>We looked at compatibility across all the major stroller and car seat brands, and there&#8217;s a pattern: the strollers from big-name manufacturers like Britax, Graco and Chicco just don&#8217;t work with other car seat brands.</p>
<p><strong>If you want compatibility with a stroller that doesn&#8217;t come from your car seat manufacturer, there are still options.</strong> A few third-party stroller manufacturers like Joovy and Contours have done a good job of providing universal fit adapters: this means you can put nearly any car seat into a cradle and strap it down securely.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers also provide click-in compatibility with adapters for a wide range of brand compatibility. It&#8217;s not free, but it gives you all the convenience of a made-to-fit travel system. One of the top picks in our review of the best double strollers, the Contours &#8211; Options Elite, makes adapters to fit all major car seats.</p>

<p>Picking a winner from this group of award-winning car seats was actually easier than we thought it would be. After comparing all of the features and using the car seats, our testers nearly all said the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BRQWV8H/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Britax &#8211; B-Safe Ultra</a> is the car seat they&#8217;d choose to take home.</p>
<p>The Britax is a bit bigger than the others we tested. At 11.5 pounds, it&#8217;s the heaviest, and at 26.5 inches it&#8217;s the longest carrier front to back. We didn&#8217;t have trouble fitting it in our tester&#8217;s Corolla, though, even in a side seat behind the driver. Yes, there was more leg room with the Cybex, but when it&#8217;s in the base the Britax is slightly shorter than the Chicco despite giving more room to grow.</p>
<p>The Britax seat is also the deepest when measured from the bottom to top where your baby&#8217;s back will rest, so there&#8217;s more room to grow before you need to move up to a bigger seat.</p>
<p>Installing the B-Safe base is a breeze. Coming from three years of using various Graco seats with fiddly strap-mounted tensioners, one tester admired the way Britax lets you pull on two independant LATCH straps directly. This gives a little bit more control and feedback than tying them together in a single pull-strap, like Chicco does, or forcing you to rely on a lever, as Cybex does.</p>
<p><strong>The NHTSA rates this a 24 out of 25 for ease of use — and an easy-to-use car seat is a safe car seat.</strong> Labels are clear, instructions are well-written, and the important installation and adjustment components are color coded and easy to use.</p>

The B-Safe Ultra has easier strap adjustment, better options for temporary installation in Grandma's car or an Uber, and a great look and feel. This isn't a compact or lightweight car seat, but it's top-rated for easy installation and adjustment.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BRQWV8H/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Britax provides two key features on this model that are still rare at this competitive price point.</p>
<p>The first is an adjustable-height harness system. Instead of taking your car seat apart after every growth spurt, you can just slide the adjuster up and down to one of six positions. No complicated buckles, no forgetting to thread the straps through the head rest pad, no excuses. The Britax is the only car seat we found in this price bracket with a no-rethread harness.</p>
<p>The second distinct feature is the European-style belt path for installing without the base. If you only ever use your car seat in one car, maybe you&#8217;ll never use this feature. But that one time your spouse leaves you at home to spend the afternoon with Grandma and the base is still in the minivan, you&#8217;ll be thankful for the option.</p>
<p>There are other safe ways to install a car seat without a base (always check the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions to see your options). But wrapping the shoulder belt around the front of a car carrier is so much quicker, easier and more secure it&#8217;s hard to believe this isn&#8217;t a standard feature for every car seat.</p>
<p>Both of these features are missing from the base-model B-Safe 35, and the better seat belt path option is still missing on the Elite, so we&#8217;d definitely recommend spending the $30 or so to upgrade to the Ultra.</p>
<p>The padding inside this top model of the B-Safe line is plush and smooth. In our tests, we didn&#8217;t have any difficulty wiping off spit-up and snacks, but it&#8217;s also easy to remove the cover for washing. We liked the shoulder strap pads better than most, since they don&#8217;t have exposed snaps, seams or velcro to leave an impression on baby&#8217;s neck.<br />

<p>The flip-up sun shade feels just a little bit more luxurious, and it offers better coverage than any other shade except Chicco&#8217;s zip-on accessory extension.</p>
<p>If you want a little bit more in the way of safety-conscious design, the Britax &#8211; Endeavours is the same as the B-Safe, but the base has an anti-rebound bar bolted on for about $60. (Yes, it&#8217;s literally the same base with an added part. No, you can&#8217;t buy the bar separately.)</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Britax &#8211; B Safe Ultra packs in nearly every convenience feature for a reasonable price.</li>
<li>With no-rethread adjustment, you have no excuse not to keep shoulder straps at the correct level as your baby grows.</li>
<li>This base is easy to install: the carrier connects and disconnects easily.</li>
<li>A European-style shoulder belt path makes this carrier easier to install securely, even without the base.</li>
<li>The sun visor provides ample shade.</li>
<li>This is a bigger, heavier car seat, which is a good thing for safety.</li>
<li>Gets a near-perfect score for ease of use from the NHTSA and from our testers.</li>

<p>For something a little different, we looked to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VHVID1O/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cybex &#8211; Aton2</a>. This dark horse contender comes from Germany, and it comes with distinctive features that set it apart. It wasn&#8217;t the most convenient to use every day, so it narrowly missed top spot, but it&#8217;s still a car seat we like.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about how compact this car seat is: at just less than nine pounds, it&#8217;s not the lightest seat we tested, but it&#8217;s close. It&#8217;s definitely the easiest to fit in a compact car, though, with a design that maximizes the amount of space you have between seats.</p>
<p>The Aton line also has a base that&#8217;s easy to install, with a large flip-up lever that presses down on your LATCH straps to suck the base tight into your seat. You can get the same effect by pushing down on a base and pulling hard, but some people will prefer this mechanical advantage. The NHTSA gave this car seat full marks for installation.</p>
<h3>Extra safety features</h3>
<p>Cybex includes two features that are rarely seen in the U.S. market at any price. The first is a &#8220;load leg&#8221; feature that sticks out from the base. This leg is designed to absorb forward inertia in case of a head-on crash. The LATCH tethers will do a great job of preventing a car seat from flying forward, but as the seat cushion underneath compresses there&#8217;s still room for momentum to rock the seat forward, then rebound.</p>

<p>The other unique feature is a &#8220;linear side-impact protection&#8221; (LSP) system. These are two plastic wings that snap out, only for use when you install the Cybex in a side position next to a door or panel — never when seated beside a person or another car seat. The LSP is designed to absorb side impact energy which would otherwise cause the seat to bounce off the car door or other side panel.</p>

<p>Videos of European <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLUU4CcuyAY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crash tests like this one</a> are pretty convincing. That said, you can still have a safe car seat without these features and U.S. safety agencies aren&#8217;t currently testing them: The Cybex is tested and approved with these two features folded in, and U.S. standards don&#8217;t currently test side impacts.</p>
<h3>Also best for smaller babies</h3>
<p>The Cybex &#8211; Aton2 is also slightly better for the tiny infants like A.M. who get lost in bigger car seats. The seat bottom was the second-narrowest we tested and has a nice fluffy insert to help keep baby in place.</p>
<p>Cybex also gives you a &#8220;newborn insert&#8221; that fills in some space in the bottom of the seat. This helps the harness fit small infants better and makes the angle of your baby&#8217;s body a little bit flatter to help out baby&#8217;s developing neck.</p>
<p>You should never deliberately recline a seat past the level indicator on the base since that changes the way the harness and seat can absorb weight in case of a crash. This car seat was designed with the newborn insert in mind, so you can rest easy.</p>
<h3>The drawbacks</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cybexdock.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
There were a few things that kept this car seat from taking top spot.</p>
<p>The mechanism that keeps this car seat locked in the base is a bit tricky to work with. There&#8217;s a two-step removal procedure, where you have to lift the foot end of the carrier out of the base before the head latch will unlock. It isn&#8217;t that hard to repeat once you learn the feel of it, but four of our testers said it was a deal-breaker after seeing a demonstration.</p>
<p>The harness on the Aton2 requires you to re-thread the shoulder straps as your baby grows. That&#8217;s not unusual, especially at this price point, but the fact that the Britax manages to provide a non-rethread harness at a similar price is a real bonus.</p>
<p>Also, the sun visor on the Cybex is fairly small and doesn&#8217;t extend far enough to prevent low-angle sunset glare when used in a stroller. This isn&#8217;t a dealbreaker, and many parents will use a blanket or stroller canopy when the carrier isn&#8217;t in the car, but it&#8217;s annoying that you can&#8217;t get just a few more degrees of rotation out of the shade.<br />

You don't need all these extra features to have a safe car seat, but it sure can't hurt. The infant insert is also great for smaller babies and this takes up less of your front row legroom than any other seat available in the U.S.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VHVID1O/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
All things considered, this is a quirky little car seat that has a lot to offer at a competitive price. If you can afford to spend a little more, the Aton Q adds a bigger sun canopy and non-rethread harness adjustment, but the tricky carrier release latch is still the same. The Aton2 is a great car seat for those with small cars, small babies, or who want the peace of mind that comes with buying the latest safety features.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re looking for cutting-edge safety features, the Cybex &#8211; Aton2 has extra protection at a reasonable price.</li>
<li>This is also the best fit for cars without legroom to spare.</li>
<li>The base is easy to install with a nifty strap-tensioning lever system.</li>
<li>Sadly, you&#8217;ll still have to re-thread the shoulder harness as baby grows.</li>
<li>An infant insert may help smaller babies ride more comfortably.</li>
<li>This is also one of the lighter car seats we found, less than nine pounds.</li>

Chicco&#8217;s car seats are great and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B078T4LL67/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KeyFit 30 Zip</a> is no exception. We don&#8217;t want the ranking in this review to be overstated: if it weren&#8217;t for a few features that made other car seats easier to use in specific cases, this car seat would have been very close to the top pick.</p>
<p><strong>The biggest point holding back the Chicco from ranking higher is the lack of a better option for seat belt routing when you don&#8217;t have the base with you.</strong> The fact that you get the European-standard belt-path feature along with a no-rethread harness adjustment on the Britax makes it just that much better.</p>
<p>The Chicco is the shallowest seat we measured measured along the back-board part of the seat, with 17.5 inches of room for your baby&#8217;s torso to grow compared to Britax&#8217;s 19.6.</p>
<p>Many reviewers give this car seat top marks, but all of our testers preferred the installation and safety features of other seats. The NHTSA rates this car seat a 19 out of 25, docking points for label clarity and the harness system.</p>

We tested the upgraded Zip model so we could see what the premium features are like to use, and the additional foot cover and visor extension are nice to have on chilly days. If you&#8217;re just going to buy some other privacy or cold-weather cover, there&#8217;s not much reason to spend extra on this upgrade, but child passenger safety technicians will give you bonus points for sticking with factory-designed accessories that have been fully tested.</p>

The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D7DGNSC/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Graco &#8211; Snuglock 30</a> is a budget-friendly, lightweight car seat that will keep your baby safe. This is a minor update of the seat our lead tester had been using for his two children and there&#8217;s really nothing about this car seat that was missed. The extra couple of pounds you&#8217;ll have to carry with a Cybex are well worth it when it comes to plush materials, easy installation and other quality-of-life improvements.</p>

Buying a car seat is intimidating. It&#8217;s hard to know which features are most important and which features are going to come in handy unexpectedly. When you&#8217;re buying, you probably don&#8217;t even know how big your baby will be yet.</p>
<p><strong>Five out of our six testers picked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BRQWV8H/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Britax &#8211; B-Safe Ultra</a> as their favorite car seat.</strong> Britax brings features you&#8217;d usually only see on $300 or $400 car seats down to an affordable price, and it&#8217;s one of the easiest seats to work with.</p>
<p>For a runner-up, we also like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VHVID1O/?tag=ybdinfseat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cybex &#8211; Aton2</a>. This seat doesn&#8217;t have all the convenience features of the Britax, but it makes up for it with two innovative crash-protection features that are rarely seen in the U.S. car seat market. Cybex also made their car seat light and compact, which could be a real plus for those with small cars to squeeze in and out of. The Aton2 base takes some practice to get used to, but if you want these features it might be worth the learning curve.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>Our test team for this review consisted of our resident babywearing dad and six volunteer moms. We also reached out to some friends who are experienced baby-wearers for research and to participate in our photo shoot.</p>
<p>Our lead tester has been using a soft structured carrier for three years with both of his kids. He&#8217;s got extensive experience with the original Tula and a few wrap-style carriers. Our test parents have used everything from the old-school crotch-dangling BabyBjorn and the Infantino to an older version of the Ergobaby.</p>
<p>As parents, we&#8217;ve followed the developments in babywearing with great interest. Most of us have been fairly satisfied with carriers for specific uses, but frustrated by limitations and complexities.</p>
<p>We read reviews of baby carriers extensively, noting selections from Wirecutter, BabyGearLab and reviewed.com. After compiling a list of 14 noteworthy carriers based on their popularity and features, we checked in-depth comparison videos on YouTube and watched all of the manufacturer instruction videos we could find to get an idea of what the different models were like to use. We also scoured Amazon reviews for signs of long-term reliability problems or drawbacks to specific designs. In the end we narrowed our list using a few key design qualifications.</p>
<p>Our first concern with selection of products was ensuring that the products we selected were safe for babies. The International Hip Dysplasia Institute has been studying the effects of carry positions for decades. They now advocate for baby carriers to create a <a href="https://hipdysplasia.org/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip/baby-wearing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;m-shaped&#8221; seat posture</a> when you&#8217;re looking at the legs of your inward-facing baby in the mirror. The IHDI provides educational information and now certifies popular designs — all of our picks are &#8220;hip healthy.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>A note on hip dysplasia:</b> Some babywearing advocates have started to downplay the importance of this point, as there&#8217;s now some evidence against the effect of swaddling and posture on the development of hip problems in babies who aren&#8217;t born with existing dysplasia, but the wider seat offered by hip-healthy carriers is comfortable and certainly can&#8217;t hurt.</p>
<p>Second, we only picked designs that provide infant neck and leg support without an insert. After using baby carriers in the past that require bulky extra pieces to accommodate infants safely, we were happy to find competitive designs that work out of the box for newborns.</p>
<p>Finally, we looked for convertible designs to allow forward-facing carry (when a baby is old enough).</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t test any of the new designs that try to do something beyond baby carrying: the MiaMilly with its hip-ledge, for example, or the Onya Cruiser that converts from a carrier into a chair harness. There&#8217;s even the Mountain Marsupial babywearing jacket. These products require an infant insert for newborns and the extra functions didn&#8217;t seem like a clear benefit for all the extra bulk and complexity.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs-a-carrier">Who needs a baby carrier?</h2>
<p>Using a baby carrier is now popularly referred to as &#8220;babywearing&#8221; in the U.S., but it&#8217;s a practice that seems to have been around for as long as busy parents have been taking care of babies. Some kind of cradleboard, sling, wrap or other style of on-the-body baby carry can be found in the history of people on every continent.</p>
<p>Attachment parenting advocates are quick to cite the developmental benefits of close and lasting contact — while that&#8217;s certainly a plus, there are plenty of reasons carrying your baby around will help you, too.</p>
<p>For one, carrying a baby with a harness frees up your hands. A carrier isn&#8217;t an excuse for ignoring your baby, but often babywearing is a far more effective way of soothing a fussy infant than any amount of rocking and cooing. The fact that you can catch up on <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-baby-detergent/">washing your baby&#8217;s laundry</a> at the same time racks up the bonus points.</p>
<p>The carrier also means you aren&#8217;t stuck with lugging around a cradle or stroller if a nap sneaks up on you. (That said, having the option to leave your sleeping baby in another room with a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-baby-monitor/">baby monitor</a> while you&#8217;re working is still great for sanity.)</p>
<p>Another reason to prefer babywearing is that it&#8217;s often much less work than some other means of transport. Strapping on a carrier isn&#8217;t instantaneous, but using a stroller means stairs are suddenly insurmountable obstacles. If you can lift your ultra-plush car seat into a shopping cart and let your child sleep, more power to you — but that doesn&#8217;t usually work on trips to the DMV or post office.</p>
<p>Double strollers and Disneyland go together like PB and J, but all of our testers who&#8217;ve bought double strollers still sometimes use a baby carrier for the extra versatility and mobility at the park or for hiking.</p>
<p>Back-carry with an older toddler is a great way to extend the range of your family outings. Especially when you have more than one child walking, a carrier gives you flexibility you just wouldn&#8217;t have otherwise.</p>
<p>This leads us to the other benefit of babywearing: it&#8217;s a great workout! But with the right carrier, you&#8217;ll forget about how much weight you&#8217;re lifting and just enjoy the time spent close and seeing the world together.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Weight range:</b> Our top pick and runner up are both designed to handle weight up to 45 pounds, while the others are rated at 35 or less. That&#8217;s a lot of weight to carry around, but the better weight-bearing designs have stronger construction and more comfortable straps even with a smaller toddler.</p>
<p><b>Crossable straps:</b> If your shoulders are narrower, crossing the straps behind your back can help distribute weight and keep the harness feeling secure.</p>
<p><b>Infant/fetal carry options: </b>All of the carriers we tested are designed to carry infants in a way that doesn&#8217;t unnaturally straighten the hips. These carriers also provide neck support, either as a neck pillow or flip-up head covering.</p>
<p><b>Extra carry modes:</b> While the ergonomic baby carriers of yesteryear were often limited to just inward-facing front and back carry modes, these new carriers all offer a seat that supports baby&#8217;s legs in a posture-friendly outward-facing mode. Some carriers also give instructions for leg-tucked-in fetal position options and hip-carry.</p>
<p><b>Mesh panels for ventilation: </b>On a hot summer day, you&#8217;ll be thankful for all the ventilation you can get. Usually you&#8217;ll need to buy a different mesh version of a carrier, but LÍLLÉbaby makes their All Seasons version with a zip-off panel.</p>
<p><b>Snaps, buttons and toggles:</b> For securing the seat panels and neck support flap, Ergobaby and Infantino use buttons or toggles, while the other manufacturers use snaps. Each method has its own quirks.</p>

<p>While researching for this review, we reached out to Holly Kohlmann, a local babywearing coach, for some advice about getting the best fit in the most popular carry configurations. She offered to help us film this video demonstrating how to use Ergobaby carriers in three commonly-used positions: Newborn, hip-carry, and front-facing carry.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>For three months our seven babywearing testers took these carriers everywhere. On hikes in the Sierra Nevada mountains, in airports moving between connecting flights, festivals and concerts, and even shoveling snow. For context, our testers compared the carriers against other soft structured carriers they&#8217;ve used in the past, as well as slings and wraps.</p>
<h3>Comfort</h3>
[table id=219 /]
<p>While wearing the carriers in sessions of two hours or more, we compared factors like weight distribution, padding, ventilation and adjustment options to decide which carriers would be the most comfortable on a long day.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00R6XEP96/?tag=ybdBBC-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LÍLLÉbaby &#8211; Complete All Seasons</a> has an edge in this test for a few reasons. The thick padding is also more breathable than the other models and there&#8217;s the zip-off panel that reveals a mesh panel for summertime wear. But even without the ventilation, the lumbar pad is bigger and there&#8217;s a little more adjustment range for the straps.</p>
<p>Our babywearing coach notes that some petite parents find the long shoulder straps on the LÍLLÉbaby more of a nuisance than they&#8217;re worth, but none of our testers has specific complaints. The lumbar pad will probably need to go if you have a smaller waist, but with the pad removed it&#8217;s the same as the Ergobaby and smaller than the Beco.</p>
<h3>Convenience</h3>

Easy loading and adjustment of the carriers is essential. For example, we loved the velcro tabs for adjusting the seat width of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0743JQ6DV/?tag=ybdBBC-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ergobaby &#8211; Omni 360</a>, but really didn&#8217;t like fumbling with the extra-large buttons to change other flaps.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Infantino-Fusion-Carrier-Black/47368991" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infantino &#8211; Fusion</a> is tricky to score in this category, since it&#8217;s the only design to use a fully separate set of inner straps. If you unclip the baby-supporting buckles, this carrier doesn&#8217;t just fall off your shoulders like the others do. That&#8217;s pretty convenient for loading and unloading quickly, but the extra straps mean you can&#8217;t really breastfeed while your baby is in this carrier.</p>
<p>Most carriers have an accessory pouch somewhere, and it&#8217;s often a great place to stash your phone or keys when you&#8217;re on a quick errand. LÍLLÉbaby wins this one as well, with a big pouch that&#8217;s easier to reach than the rest.</p>
<h3>Versatility</h3>

[table id=220 /]
<p>All of these carriers give fairly similar instructions for how to carry babies and toddlers at different ages.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00R6XEP96/?tag=ybdBBC-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LÍLLÉbaby</a> is the only company that provided instructions for a leg-tucked-in fetal position, aided by a swaddling blanket tucked inside to replace the giant carrier-within-a-carrier infant inserts of older models like the original Tula and Ergobaby. LÍLLÉbaby gets points for offering clear instructions, though our coach notes that if you&#8217;re carrying a small newborn then <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MG89BG3/?tag=ybdBBC-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LÍLLÉbaby&#8217;s optional insert</a> is easier to use than the blanket, and the ErgoBaby has an edge for simplicity.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Infantino-Fusion-Carrier-Black/47368991" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infantino</a> is the only carrier that won&#8217;t allow crossing the back straps, which makes it a little bit less versatile.</p>
<h2 id="top-pick">The best overall: LÍLLÉbaby &#8211; Complete</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20306" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Winner-Lillebaby.jpg" alt="Lillebaby - Complete" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Winner-Lillebaby-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Winner-Lillebaby-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Winner-Lillebaby-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Winner-Lillebaby-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Winner-Lillebaby-810x540.jpg 810w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Winner-Lillebaby-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Winner-Lillebaby-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Winner-Lillebaby-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Winner-Lillebaby-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Winner-Lillebaby-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Winner-Lillebaby-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Winner-Lillebaby-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Winner-Lillebaby-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Winner-Lillebaby-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Winner-Lillebaby-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Winner-Lillebaby-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Winner-Lillebaby-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Winner-Lillebaby-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
The LÍLLÉbaby<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00R6XEP96/?tag=ybdBBC-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> &#8211; Complete All Seasons</a> really lives up to its name. This carrier is designed to handle any situation you can think of and it&#8217;s competitively priced.<br />
This is an updated version of the Complete, with a few modifications. First, it has the zip-open panel in front that allows for more ventilation. This is a thoughtful addition; in every other case we saw, a completely different carrier is necessary if you want mesh for hiking on a long summer day.</p>
<p>For newborns that are bigger than seven pounds, but too small for the seat pocket made by the shape of the carrier in the narrow mode, LÍLLÉbaby provides instructions for using a swaddling blanket to create a &#8220;fetal carry&#8221; position that doesn&#8217;t squash baby&#8217;s hips. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pKhB3iYC9g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Check out their video here</a>. Some parents find folding and positioning a blanket tricky, but we were satisfied in our testing. We should note that our local babywearing coach prefers and recommends <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MG89BG3/?tag=ybdBBC-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the optional LÍLLÉbaby newborn insert</a> rather than a blanket when she uses this carrier.</p>
<p>LÍLLÉbaby’s belt is well thought out, with a really big lumbar support pad. This is a nice perk when you&#8217;re carrying a heavy toddler on a long walk. Another benefit of this design is that you can remove the lumbar pad if you don&#8217;t like it — other carriers just have padding built into the front section of the belt.</p>
<p>The maximum waist circumference for the belt is lower than average, but at 48 inches it will serve most people well. Plus, you can purchase <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZTCG2Y/?tag=ybdBBC-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a ten-inch extension</a> if you need more.</p>
<p>LÍLLÉbaby is also the only soft-structured carrier manufacturer that offers <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016XUNOTY/?tag=ybdBBC-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">baby carrier stirrups</a> if you really want to test your limits. Stirrups shift the weight of an older child&#8217;s legs from your shoulders to your hips, which can make a big difference on a hike.</p>
<p>LÍLLÉbaby includes a storage pouch in the zip-off panel on the front. This isn&#8217;t a perfect solution, since that panel rolls up for summertime venting and you&#8217;ll lose the pocket, but if you really need a place to stow your wallet, phone or keys it&#8217;s always an option and it&#8217;s easier to reach than a pouch down on the belt. The pocket measures four by five inches, so a bigger cell phone will peek out at the top.</p>
<p>The zip-open panel actually makes itself a big pocket when it&#8217;s zipped up, which is a nifty feature if you find yourself in need of a place to keep something big like a set of passports. Just don&#8217;t stick anything lumpy or sharp in there since it&#8217;s going to be pressed against your baby&#8217;s back.</p>

The name might not be as recognizable as some other brands, but this is a bestseller for a reason. A top-rate carrier that's comfortable and built to last — and it's competitively priced.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KC4VPNU/?tag=ybdbbc-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The biggest drawback of the LÍLLÉbaby is that you have to thread the waist strap through two loops in the seat-support flaps in order to convert from narrow to wide mode. In comparison, the other carriers use velcro, toggles and snaps.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re carrying a toddler and you switch between inward-facing or back carry and outward-facing carry modes frequently, all that threading could get annoying, since you need to thread the belt through the loops and the lumbar pad each time you convert.</p>
<p>Fortunately, if your baby is at an age where they&#8217;re old enough to face outward but still likely to fall asleep in the carrier, you won&#8217;t have to change the seat width to face the little one inward.</p>
<p>If you find that a blanket is too difficult to keep in place when you&#8217;re carrying a smaller newborn, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MG89BG3/?tag=ybdbbc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lillebaby also sells a pillow insert</a> that will help you get the perfect position. Our babywearing coaches say they always recommend buying the insert for a newborn, since they&#8217;ve seen too much confusion about what blanket to use.</p>
<p>If the LÍLLÉbaby were the same price as the Ergobaby, most of the differences would come down to individual fit we&#8217;d tell you to try them both out. The LÍLLÉbaby is almost always about $40 less expensive than the competition, and all our testers were happy with the range of adjustment to get a good fit.</p>
<p>Even LÍLLÉbaby&#8217;s limited-edition patterns (right now there are 21 to choose from) are less expensive than the Ergobaby and they go on clearance from time to time.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The LÍLLÉbaby &#8211; Complete is a do-it-all design at a good price.</li>
<li>Adjusting seat width takes a bit of work, but the rest of the buckles and snaps are easy to use.</li>
<li>A zip-open mesh vent panel gives year-round comfort options.</li>
<li>The big lumbar pad helps make long hours with big kids easier.</li>
<li>A big pouch holds the biggest cell phones.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&#8217;ve been watching the trends in baby carriers for the last 15 years, you&#8217;re probably quite familiar with Ergobaby&#8217;s reputation.The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0743JQ6DV/?tag=ybdBBC-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ergobaby- Omni 360</a> brings together all of the best features of past models to make a versatile, comfortable and high-quality baby carrier.</p>
<p>Founder Karin Frost says part of Ergobaby&#8217;s mission is to make a &#8220;thoughtful&#8221; baby carrier — the Omni 360 has some great features that demonstrate that philosophy.</p>
<p>The big difference between the Ergobaby and the other carriers we tested is how easy it is to adjust seat width. If you&#8217;ve got a bigger toddler who needs full-width seat support when facing in, but you still like to use the front-facing mode once in a while, you&#8217;ll be impressed at how simple the velcro tabs are to adjust. There are still upper flap buttons you need to switch, but it&#8217;s a much quicker process than it is with the LÍLLÉbaby.</p>
<p>The way the shape of the seat &#8220;pocket&#8221; changes as you vary the width and adjust the upper tabs is very impressive. Ergobaby is one of the few manufacturers to convince experts that you really don&#8217;t need an insert for tiny newborns. The LÍLLÉbaby works, and our testers don&#8217;t have any real reservations about recommending it since most babies will only be tiny for a few months, but the Ergobaby design is definitely more elegant. That&#8217;s what makes this the best baby carrier for newborns, in our opinion.</p>
<p>This feature isn&#8217;t enough to make it a better carrier for the other two years you&#8217;ll use it, though. What did bug us frequently was the extra locking tab on the side-clips: Ergobaby decided the usual quick-release buckle needed improvement, so there&#8217;s a tab you have to lift while you squeeze the sides. It&#8217;s not difficult to learn how once you know about it, but it&#8217;s definitely an adult-proof feature when you&#8217;re taking off the carrier for the first time.</p>
<p>One of our testers, R.D., compared the new Ergobaby to her old carrier, the original 2004 Ergobaby. She said it was great finally being able to do hikes in a front-facing carry position with her seven-month-old, which was something she&#8217;d always wanted to try with her first baby. Happily, the Omni 360 also does away with the noisy velcro waist belt of the 2014 Ergobaby &#8211; 360 All Positions model.</p>
<p>R.D. lamented that none of the new Ergobaby models have a chest-panel storage pouch as big as the one on the original carrier. There&#8217;s still a wide and shallow pouch for the rain hood, but a bigger smartphone won&#8217;t fit through the six-inch opening and it&#8217;s hidden under a flap in most modes. The new Sporran-style crotch-dangling storage pouch is functional and roomy enough for the essentials, but it&#8217;s not easy to find the zipper on a pouch you can&#8217;t even see. It&#8217;s really no surprise Ergobaby removes it for most promotional photos.</p>

The no-insert newborn mode is especially good. This is almost just as good as our top pick, but a few missing features and a higher price kept it from taking top prize.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0743JQ6DV/?tag=ybdbbc-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Now that Ergobaby is expanding into other corners of the baby-product marketplace, we hoped we would start to see the special-edition patterns coordinating across different lines. There&#8217;s a diaper bag with a dedicated storage compartment for the carrier, but it&#8217;s only available in one pattern. In our review of the best diaper bags we found that other bags are a better value anyway, but it&#8217;s an opportunity we hope Ergobaby capitalizes on.</p>
<p>If the buttons and storage pouch were a bit easier to work with this would be have landed in first place. As it is, the Ergobaby is a great carrier that only really outshines the competition when you&#8217;re transforming it from one mode to another, which isn&#8217;t something you&#8217;ll do every day. This carrier takes a close second place, but the LÍLLÉbaby was a slightly better carrier overall and is less expensive.</p>
<p><b>Key Takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Ergobaby- Omni 360 is a versatile, flexible design.</li>
<li>Velcro seat-width adjustment makes that part of changing between modes easier.</li>
<li>Seat design is top-of-class for carrying infants without an insert or other workaround.</li>
<li>Other buckles and buttons are more complicated than on the LÍLLÉbaby.</li>
<li>Ergobaby&#8217;s dangling belt storage pouch is kind of annoying.</li>
<li>The price is also higher than our top pick.</li>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a good carrier but aren&#8217;t ready to spend more than $100, the <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Infantino-Fusion-Carrier-Black/47368991" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infantino &#8211; Fusion</a> is an option worth investigating.</p>
<p>Based in our own dear San Diego, Infantino (formerly a part of the Step 2 company, but now owned by an overseas toy manufacturing group) has been making carriers since about 2005. They&#8217;ve always targeted a wider retail market rather than chasing the babywearing enthusiasts who are willing to splurge on more luxurious materials.</p>
<p>The lack of limited-edition designer prints and the lower price might actually make this the best baby carrier for dads — or a certain kind of dad, anyhow.</p>
<p>Infantino&#8217;s carriers share a core design feature with the classic BabyBjorn carrier: The straps and the carry cradle are mostly independent, so you can put the carrier harness on your torso securely before you even pick up the baby.</p>
<p>This is either a great benefit or an inconvenience. One of our testers loved the design and said she found it much easier to set up and get ready to go with the Infantino: the carrier stayed put on her shoulders as she picked up her baby. A few other testers felt like the extra elastic webbing and straps just got in the way.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re hoping to breastfeed in your baby carrier, a design with inner straps like the Infantino is definitely not going to help. It&#8217;s not as restrictive as some of the new BabyBjorn designs with a full mesh panel, but it&#8217;s still going to get in the way.</p>
<p>Unlike the &#8220;crotch dangler&#8221; carrier designs of last century, the new Infantino models are all designed to properly put a baby&#8217;s hips and legs in a natural position. Like the other carriers we tested, the Infantino has a supportive seat (adjustable to grow with your baby) that allows the knees to make a natural M shape when you look at the carrier in the mirror.</p>
<p>The difference we noticed right away is that this carrier seems smaller than the others. The basic dimensions of the support structure — like width between buckles and the height of the neck support point — are nearly identical to other carriers. Infantino has cut-out sections at the sides, though, and the fact that the front panel isn&#8217;t part of the shoulder straps means it doesn&#8217;t need to be full-width to provide the same support through the clip-in strap points.</p>

There isn’t as much luxury in the materials, but it's still a fully-featured carrier. This particular Infantino also features an inner harness that keeps the carrier from falling off when you're loading or unloading your baby.</p><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Infantino-Fusion-Carrier-Black/47368991" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Infantino is the only carrier we tested that won&#8217;t allow crossing the back straps. Since they&#8217;re permanently attached to the front part of the harness with elastic, it won’t slide off before you clip the side support buckles. The inner harness design does mean hip carry mode isn&#8217;t going to work.</p>
<p>Infantino says that this carrier shouldn&#8217;t be used with a toddler bigger than 32 pounds — we think that&#8217;s a bit on the high side. We wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s useless above 15 pounds like some reviewers have, but the useful life is definitely shorter than its $150 competitors.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5TMER6OM8o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infantino&#8217;s training video is here</a> and explains the carrier modes very thoroughly. Check it out if you have any questions about how the carrier works.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Infantino &#8211; Fusion comes in at less than one-third the price of other models, but still provides a full-featured carrier.</li>
<li>The materials and padding used here are definitely not as luxe as our top picks.</li>
<li>Infantino&#8217;s smaller carrier panel gives less coverage than other brands, but the support fundamentals are the same.</li>
<li>The straps for the inner-harness design make this carrier more complex and get in the way if you want to breastfeed.</li>
<li>Loading and unloading your baby can be quicker with this design.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BQFSDHX/?tag=ybdBBC-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Beco &#8211; Gemini</a> covers all the basic functions, but doesn&#8217;t offer much to justify its price tag. There&#8217;s really not much wrong with the Beco, so if you find the style you want at a lower price than the LÍLLÉbaby it&#8217;s a pretty good pick. Beco&#8217;s list price is high, but when they&#8217;re clearing out certain patterns they can go lower than $100, just like the LÍLLÉbaby.</p>
<p>For the extra money, you get a simpler construction and conversion system and thick padding everywhere. That said, all the extra perks from our top picks are missing. If anything, all the padding in the front panel is too thick to be comfortable in hot weather.</p>
<p>The one feature our testers really didn&#8217;t like about the Beco was the snaps for adjusting seat width. Some brands use buttons, and LÍLLÉbaby puts snaps on the outside of the belt, but on the Beco you&#8217;ve got two open female snap rings on the inside of the belt, just ready to dig into your skin. It&#8217;s not a fatal flaw, but some kind of fold-over cover for the snaps (along with a lumbar support pad) would make the Beco more competitive.</p>

<p>When you learn how to adjust the fit and support of a baby carrier, it can really transform the time spent holding your baby. Babywearing not only frees your hands, but it gives your baby a chance to see the world around you while still being protected and supported.</p>
<p>For extra comfort and versatility, we love the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00R6XEP96/?tag=ybdBBC-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LÍLLÉbaby &#8211; Complete All Seasons</a>. This carrier has more supportive padding, nicer finishing touches, and a zip-open vent panel. Just be sure to read the instructions carefully so you don&#8217;t wind up embarrassing yourself <a href="https://www.today.com/parents/ryan-reynolds-baby-wearing-oops-5-safety-tips-you-need-t28436" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like Ryan Reynolds did with his LÍLLÉbaby carrier</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter testing seven top products over four weeks, we found that the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ECHYTBI/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Infant Optics &#8211; DXR-8</a> is the best baby monitor overall. Great image quality and unmatched motorized camera controls make this much better than all the cheap models, and without sacrificing battery life or resorting to touch-screen controls. If you’re not ready to spend more than $160 for a baby monitor, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CZUD4R8?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hello Baby &#8211; HB-24</a> is half the price of our top pick and still offers enough video quality to be very usable, but you lose the motorized control.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>As always, we looked around at other reviews and guides to see what features are must-haves and what’s just fluff. The Wirecutter prioritizes image quality and battery life, while reviews.com focuses on ease of use; The Bump is all-in on premium features like sleep quality tracking.</p>
<p>We considered unorthodox ideas like using a GoPro or an old smartphone as a baby monitor, but the success of those ideas really depends on what equipment you already have; we wanted to get a clear recommendation that will work for <i>everyone</i>.</p>
<p>We didn’t test any wearable vital-sign monitors, either; we’re not judging you if you feel that you need to constantly monitor your infant’s blood oxygen level while they sleep, but many physicians note that <a href="https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/babymonitors.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s not going to help with SIDS risks</a>.</p>
<p>We narrowed our list down to video monitors for less than $200 with good reputations and essential features. On the higher end of that price bracket we looked for nice screens and motorized camera movements. On the budget end, the screens are smaller and you don’t get fancy controls, but we found models with all the essential features and more.</p>
<p>Some features, like noise alerts or thermometers, weren’t available on a few models, but all the video monitors we tested can link up with extra cameras and they’re all great at seeing in the dark.</p>
<p>We also bought one Wi-Fi based camera to test the state of internet-transmitted video monitoring, and we talked in-depth with a fellow parent who’s also a security expert to see what extra risks come along with a “smart” camera.</p>
<p>We included two audio-only baby monitors, since we know some parents just don’t want to put a camera in the nursery. (You’ll also save some money if you skip the camera.)</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs a baby monitor?</h2>
<p>Nap time is the reason we own baby monitors. By the time your little bundle of joy is sawing logs mid-afternoon, you’re usually more than ready to take a break and do something other than sit quietly in the corner. A baby monitor lets you close the door (so you can make some noise) without worrying that you’ve abdicated responsibility. We love our babies, but it’s great to be able to love them from the comfort of a downstairs sofa while they’re asleep in their cribs.</p>
<p>Fear of “what might happen” is also a big driver of baby monitor sales: the original <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/r/isamu-noguchi-radio-nurse-baby-monitor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Radio Nurse”</a> was created by designer Isamu Noguchi for the Zenith Radio Corp. after parental paranoia peaked in response to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindbergh_kidnapping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lindbergh baby abduction</a> of 1932.</p>
<p>Some worry that a monitor might make you more neurotic about nap time rather than help you relax. If you can hear or see anything that happens behind a closed door, though, you’re less likely to interrupt a nap when checking on your baby, and that’s good for everyone. A baby monitor works great in tandem with <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-white-noise-machine/" rel="noopener">a white noise machine</a> to keep your baby from being disturbed without making it hard for you to know if something happens in the room.</p>
<p>Two of our testers for this comparison are dads working from home, and they’re not alone: 3.9 million employees are now telecommuting at least half of their work hours, which amounts to almost three percent of the U.S. workforce. (And that doesn’t even include freelancers.) A video monitor doesn’t mean you can double up and watch your baby while you’re on a call or working at your computer, but if you’re tag-teaming with another caregiver a video monitor can make life much easier.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Video monitoring:</strong> Not everyone wants a video camera in their nursery, but being able to see as well as hear what’s going on can be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Motorized camera adjustments:</strong> The more expensive video monitors will allow you to aim the camera with your remote, which is helpful if the camera needs to be in an awkward position or if you’re monitoring a “baby” who’s big enough to get up and run around the room.</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Manufacturers often list straight-line, no-interference transmission range, but in the real world of concrete walls and wireless interference those numbers probably don’t tell you much. We found that the stronger signals were more stable through walls (from a detached garage, for example), but all of these monitors are usable in a two-story townhouse.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life:</strong> Like range, the number you see on the box might not match your actual experience. The good news: these monitors all have enough battery life to cover even the longest naps. We tested each monitor under the same conditions to make sure you have a fair impression of their relative longevity.</p>
<p><strong>Display size:</strong> With a video monitor, there’s a big difference between watching a blurry lump and being able to clearly see your baby.</p>
<p><strong>Temperature monitor:</strong> If you’re in a different room you may want to keep an eye on room temperature, especially if you live in a place like California where you’re not using a thermostat all the time to maintain room temperature. None of the thermometers we tested had better accuracy than three degrees Fahrenheit, but it might add to your peace of mind.</p>
<p><strong>Wake on noise:</strong> Most of these monitors will wake up from screen-off “sleep” when there’s a sound above a set threshold. (The LeFun WiFi camera is motion activated instead, and our top pick does not have this feature.)</p>
<h2 id="is-wi-fi-safe">Is a Wi-Fi baby monitor safe?</h2>
<p>We talked to a friend and fellow parent, Robert (aka <a href="https://twitter.com/_p0pr0ck5_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">p0pr0ck5</a>), who is a security researcher based in L.A. Being a security guy, he’s innately suspicious of the “Internet of Things” and all the unforeseen problems that come with it.</p>
<p>Now that most of us use Wi-Fi everywhere in our houses for everything from looking at cat pictures to streaming music, Wi-Fi transmission is practically free. Using Wi-Fi also means that you can see your monitor feed from work or your phone — even while you’re traveling. The internet is really the only way to get that kind of amazing flexibility.</p>
<p>Robert says this cheap-and-flexible approach creates the biggest risk. “Too often, IoT devices communicate with the internet without any encryption, making it easy to snoop on what your fridge has to say, what your internet-connected lights are talking about or what video stream your security cameras or baby monitor are sending to their provider.”</p>
<p>Even if your device uses encryption, the biggest risk is still security on the camera manufacturer’s side. Robert notes: “I can use a password that no human or computer in the universe could ever guess, but if my account provider isn&#8217;t handling my password securely, and <i>they</i> are breached by hackers, my ultra-secure password is worthless.”</p>

<p>Wi-Fi baby monitors rely on two-way communication between your camera and a server, and that means someone else might also be able to exploit mistakes that were made in designing the security protocols that should keep the cameras safe.</p>
<p>The worst examples of vulnerabilities are <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/hacking-the-ip-camera-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shockingly bad</a>: “back-door” access to a camera that can overwrite passwords or even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/06/large-botnet-of-cctv-devices-knock-the-snot-out-of-jewelry-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">install malicious software</a>. We checked the one Wi-Fi model we tested against common vulnerabilities, like an open telnet port or easy-to-guess root password. Our untrained tester couldn’t hack it, but is that enough?</p>
<p>Robert was quick to caution that this is a far cry from thorough investigation of the “full stack”: the website, the applications and the infrastructure being used to get video from your camera to a server and back to your laptop or smartphone.</p>
<p>Robert sums it up like this: “We don&#8217;t know the real security risks, because no one with the capacity to properly analyze these things from an unbiased perspective has the resources to do so — and if they do, they <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/security-researcher-to-be-jailed-for-finding-bugs-in-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most likely</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/marcus-hutchins-arrest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don&#8217;t have permission</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>“In a culture where new IoT devices constantly flood the market, consumer perception of function, affordability and integration with other IoT solutions is the main goal. Privacy and security simply are not a focus for the average consumer. Often (<i>very</i> often), the financial and timing costs far outweigh the value add [of a full-stack security audit.]”</p>
<p>After our testing, the value of a cheap-and-powerful device like a $40 camera doesn’t really seem to outweigh the risks. (Especially considering all the extra steps setting it up.) For now, our top pick has a local-transmission-only video camera.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Video image quality</h3>
[table id=261 /]
<p>For the most part, the limiting factor that determines how well you can see your baby with one of these setups is screen quality. The camera sensors in these monitors are pretty good at picking up detail, even in low-light environments. A bigger screen lets you see all of that detail, though it also comes with a bigger price-tag.</p>
<p>In addition to real-world testing in the nursery, we tried to get a more unbiased measurement of picture quality using a 1/4&#8243; grid test pattern. We measured how far away the camera needed to be in order to display the pattern clearly (with zoom turned on, if available). The best results came from the big motorized cameras with correspondingly large screens, while the little screens on more affordable monitors made it difficult to make out tiny details from far away.</p>
<p>All of these systems will work for you if you just want a rough idea of what’s happening in a crib, but it’s definitely nicer to be able to see facial expressions clearly on the big screens.</p>
<p>Night vision, surprisingly, was nearly the same across all of these cameras. Infrared sensitivity of digital camera sensors is very good, and the IR light emitters on the cameras do a good job of showing what’s a baby and what’s not in the dark. There was a much bigger difference in things like auto-white-balance adjustment, which is nice when it works, but is not as essential to your peace of mind.</p>
<h3>Audio quality</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11119" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/audio-quality-testing.png" alt="audio quality test data" width="2000" height="1691" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/audio-quality-testing.png 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/audio-quality-testing-610x516.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/audio-quality-testing-768x649.png 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/audio-quality-testing-885x748.png 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/audio-quality-testing-1500x1268.png 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/audio-quality-testing-295x249.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/audio-quality-testing-1000x846.png 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/audio-quality-testing-360x304.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/audio-quality-testing-375x317.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/audio-quality-testing-414x350.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/audio-quality-testing-320x271.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Audio quality on baby monitors is pretty terrible, but that’s partly because the conditions are worst-case-possible: the microphone is relatively far away from what you’re trying to hear, and you can’t really filter or prioritize frequencies like telephones do.</p>
<p>Parents want to hear everything, but the most important sounds for a baby monitor to transmit (crying, crashes) are pretty easy to recognize even through a tiny and muffled speaker. If you want to calm your baby with the soothing sound of your voice while they’re waiting for you to come to the nursery, though, you might be disappointed.</p>
<p>The real stand-out in our audio tests was Samsung, but instead of being ahead of the pack as they were in the video tests, the audio components disappointed. Voices sound muffled on both ends, and the receiver is just hard to hear if there’s any noise around.</p>
<p>Typically, even poor sound quality is sufficient to hear your baby cry, so this isn’t a disqualification, but Samsung’s system would have ranked higher if they paid as much attention to audio quality as they did to video.</p>
<h3>Range and clarity</h3>
<p>Unless you’re using your baby monitor while camping on the open plains, range is going to be measured in frustration rather than distance. Range on digital wireless devices is basically an all-or-nothing scenario. If you can see the video feed, it’s crisp and clear; once you go beyond the range of the transmitter, the video starts to go blank and you’ll soon get a “no signal” or “out of range” warning.</p>
<p>We found that most of these monitors gave good connection quality in a small townhouse. The Levana shows its limits quickly, though: the feed dropped out frequently when we turned on the other cameras, and while it still picked up video from across the street with no buildings in between, it was by no means a reliable connection at the range limits.</p>
<p>The other three monitors were bulletproof in the house, but only the Samsung gave stutter-free connectivity out in the detached garage.</p>
<h3>Battery life</h3>
<p>For each video monitor, we charged the battery fully and turned off any screen timers to use as much power as possible, then waited for the batteries to run down.</p>
<p>If you need more than a few hours of screen time you should be able to hook up the charger, so even the 4-hour battery life on Samsung’s receiver is sufficient for real-world use. That said, the extra two hours provided by our top picks does make a difference if you forget to charge from one day to the next and want to sit on your patio during nap time.</p>

In addition to that extended battery life, the VTech shines through with top-notch audio quality even at long range.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007NG5UF4/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If you need to move around the house and can’t keep your monitor on a charger all the time, the Levana system will run for 13 hours with the screen on. That’s so far beyond ordinary needs that it didn’t really offset the video quality and range issues when we were ranking our picks.</p>
<h3>Temperature sensor</h3>
<p>For the units that have a thermometer, we compared the temperature to a stand-alone thermometer in the same location to see how accurate they are. The biggest error we saw was seven degrees Fahrenheit, which is not insignificant, but for an $80 camera it wasn’t totally surprising.</p>
<p>The high/low temperature warning is a handy feature that could tell you about something like broken A/C or heater systems, but don’t rely on it for anything critical. The HelloBaby was the only monitor that let us set custom high/low temperature thresholds.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-baby-monitor">Best video monitor: Infant Optics &#8211; DXR-8</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infant-optics-animation2.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ECHYTBI/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DXR-8 from Infant Optics</a> is one of the most popular cameras on the market, with glowing reviews from many parenting sites. We like this camera too, and it’s our top pick for a good match of image quality, battery life and ease of use.</p>
<p>The screen isn’t quite as big as the Samsung touchscreen, but it’s almost as clear. The smaller 3.5&#8243; screen also means you get more battery life than Samsung’s 5&#8243; offering.</p>
<p>The camera also gives you a bit more flexibility with a screw-mount optical zoom adapter. If you’re just watching a cradle during naptime, the zoom shows more detail. In a few years when you’re monitoring a toddler, then you can take off that zoom lens and get a wider view so you won’t need to pan and scan as much to follow the action.</p>
<p>The range and quality of the image from this camera wasn’t quite as good as the Samsung setup, but we did like the audio from the Infant Optics hardware more than Samsung’s. The connection worked wherever we tried it in the house, and it was reliable all the way out to a detached garage.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ECHYTBI/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infant-optics-DXR-8-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infant-optics-DXR-8-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infant-optics-DXR-8-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infant-optics-DXR-8-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infant-optics-DXR-8-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infant-optics-DXR-8-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infant-optics-DXR-8-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infant-optics-DXR-8-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infant-optics-DXR-8.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Overall: Infant Optics - DXR-8</h3><p>The DXR-8 gets you all the key features in an easy-to-use package. Great image quality and motorized camera control make this much better than all the cheap models, but without sacrificing battery life or resorting to touch-screen controls.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ECHYTBI/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The game-pad-style controls were also easier to use than a touch screen, though remembering shortcuts for volume and zoom settings wasn’t as easy as it might have been with dedicated buttons for those functions.</p>
<p>If the only advantage offered by this model were a bigger screen, or pan/tilt control, or the zoom lens accessory or the better transmission range, then we might not have picked this camera as best overall. The fact that it’s better than the $80 cameras in all of these categories is not a small advantage, though. You’re not paying $100 more for any one feature, but for a better-quality package. That’s the kind of difference we like to see in a winning product.</p>
<p>The one surprising omission from this system is a wake-on-sound feature. There’s a feeding timer that can wake you every four or six hours, and an option to make the system warnings (low battery, lost connection) quieter, but no auto-wake. The screen can automatically turn off (to save the battery) after three or five minutes while the sound is still on for you to listen for anything happening, but you’re relying on the sound of your baby to get your attention.</p>
<p>This is a surprising omission, considering audio-only baby monitors have been doing vibrating/beeping notification of a crying baby for a long time now. If having the screen come on to notify you of a loud sound is a big deal, then the Hello Baby &#8211; HB24 (or the audio-only VTech &#8211; DM221 with vibrating notification) is probably a better pick.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ECHYTBI/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infant Optics &#8211; DXR-8</a> is a versatile package with all the essential features, plus a zoom lens add-on that nobody else has.</li>
<li>The image quality here isn’t quite as good as Samsung’s, but the controls and battery life are far better.</li>
<li>This is a solid setup, with good range and good sound quality sealing the deal.</li>
<li>The only feature that’s missing in sound-activated notifications so you can listen to Netflix without being worried you’ll miss any crying.</li>

<h2 id="budget-video">Best budget video: Hello Baby &#8211; HB24</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hello-baby-animation.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Compared to the 5&#8243; screens and motorized cameras on top-ranked models, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CZUD4R8?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hello Baby’s HB24</a> definitely made some compromises to get their price down to around $70. The essential functions, though, are all handled well.</p>
<p>The camera itself is compact and looks a little bit wobbly; we were surprised at how well it worked in testing, though. It seems clear that the limitations on resolution come from the small screen, and the low-light performance is great.</p>
<p>Hello Baby designed the most pocketable “parent unit” monitor/receiver of any that we tried. There’s no belt clip, but the fold-out kickstand works very well.</p>
<p>The tiny 2.4&#8243; screen is bright enough and clear enough to see what’s happening in a crib or watch a toddler playing in the next room, and the digital zoom lets you see a little bit more detail if you need to. Camera placement is definitely the key to making this system work well, but if you have reasonable expectations this system will give you what you need.</p>

<p>There’s a thermometer, eight lullabies, adjustable sensitivity for the sound-activated mode and even a timer that will beep to remind you about your feeding schedule if you don’t already have a plan for that.</p>
<p>Hello Baby’s audio quality is pretty good. There’s not much we can say about baby monitor sound quality except that your expectations should be low. The HB24 is better for both listening and talking back to your baby than Samsung, but that’s really not saying much.</p>
<p>In our transmission range test this model also sits right in the middle: it’s nothing amazing, but for monitoring a room on the other side of your house it should be sufficient. When we took the monitor out to the detached garage there were some spots where the signal didn’t come through, but we always found a spot where it worked.</p>

<p>Some parents don’t want video cameras in their nurseries, and we understand. There’s a good argument for a cheap, reliable audio monitor, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007NG5UF4/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">VTech &#8211; DM221</a> is a great example.</p>
<p>Audio quality in a baby monitor is not hi-fi, but this model lets you hear what’s going on just a bit better than the video camera systems. The big feature VTech brings to the table is that you can mute the speaker and let the parent unit notify you of loud sounds with “silent” vibration. You can set a “beep” notification, too, if you’re worried about falling asleep and missing notification from the baby monitor.</p>

An audio-only monitor will still give you a way to check on your baby’s status, and the vibrate and beep notifications on this model are far more advanced than on any video monitors we tested.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007NG5UF4/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The battery life on this receiver is, at almost 18 hours, pretty astounding. The battery pack itself is nothing special; almost certainly it’s made from a pair of AAA-size NiMH battery cells and the connector plug in a plastic wrapper.</p>
<p>It did start beeping an occasional “low battery” warning after only six hours (less than halfway through the battery’s capacity) to remind you to top it up, but if you’re in a pinch it’s got a lot of reserve battery.</p>
<p>Since most people will be able to plug in at some point before elapsing six hours of baby monitoring, this should be more help than hinderance. Sadly, this means that even though it could comfortably run all night on the battery, you’ll definitely want to plug this one in before you fall asleep lest the battery warning wake you up. The occasional “beep beep” isn’t as loud as the notification that your baby’s crying, but it’s not something you want going off at 2:00 a.m..</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007NG5UF4/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">VTech &#8211; DM221</a> is a fully-evolved audio monitor. If you don’t want video, you don’t have to give up any of the useful monitoring features.</li>
<li>Range and battery life are top notch, and audio quality is as good as any baby monitor we’ve heard.</li>
<li>The low battery warning kicks in early, which is a bit annoying, but it’s usually not hard to have your monitor plugged in most of the day anyhow.</li>
<li>This is the only monitor we tested (other than smartphone apps) that gives a vibrating notification when there’s a loud sound, which can be a great feature if you’re watching a movie or talking on the phone during naptime.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-finalists">Other finalists we tested</h2>
<h3>For the networking guru only: LeFun &#8211; Fi368</h3>
<p>We are tempted to recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00W9B1GT2/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LeFun Fi368</a> camera to more people, but there’s basically one thing stopping us: Wi-Fi itself.</p>
<p>As Wi-Fi-connected cameras go, this one is pretty solid. It has at least rudimentary firewall protocols built in, so it won’t just give itself over to you with easy-to-guess passwords like some other common cameras do. <a href="#is-wi-fi-safe">There are still risks</a>, but that’s true of all Wi-Fi home devices.</p>
<p>Setup is more work than for the non-Wi-Fi cameras, since you can’t tell the camera your Wi-Fi password directly. Instead, your phone will tell the camera your password with audio or a QR code generated by the control app. This setup process requires patient obedience of strange directions, and it is more than a bit creepy when your mobile phone suddenly starts loudly chirping/screeching and the camera gives a happy “bloop” in response.</p>
<p>If you’re fortunate enough to have ethernet cable run to a good spot for a baby monitor camera, then you can avoid that whole setup process and skip straight to setting up an account. Sadly, the camera does not take power-over-ethernet, but it will run off a USB port with the included adapter cable.</p>
<p>Once you’re networked and you’ve set up an account on MIPC.com, things are both great and scary. The web page is kind of slow and hasn’t been updated since NPAPI plugins were made illegal; there’s also no obvious “password reset” function and nothing that makes clear exactly what a “guest” account can or cannot do. It wasn’t clear what plugin it’s using to run video, but it worked on the Chrome browser we tested with.</p>

<p>We tested both the Android and Windows programs for controlling the camera, and they worked quite well, much better than the website. The apps will do everything a baby monitor should with your phone or computer: detect sound or motion and notify you, let you listen or talk back and let you control the camera pan/tilt motors.</p>
<p>If you’re planning to use this in a working-from-home scenario for nap monitoring, that’s pretty great. If you’ve got a spare tablet device around, it’s even better. If you’re expecting to run this from a public terminal or a restricted-access work computer, you might be out of luck.</p>
<p>As far as stories of randomly logging into other people’s nurseries or pranksters playing death metal in the middle of the night … it’s as unlikely you’ll be the victim of cyber pranks as it is that someone will throw a brick through your nursery window, but it’s still something you have no control over. This camera is more secure than a Chromecast (you need the serial number off the camera to even start connecting, you can&#8217;t just walk into range and see the camera pop up on your phone), but that’s not a high bar to clear.</p>
<p>If you’re confident in the security of your home network then this might be a great choice, but for some people the unknowns will be too many and the benefits too few.</p>
<p>The even uglier side of this is that while Wi-Fi works most of the time and enables amazing freedom in our use of the internet, it’s not always reliable for some of us. The thought of one more device to troubleshoot, whitelist or reboot is enough to assure us that the extra $40-$130 for a camera with a dedicated monitor is going to be justifiable for many of the people who just need a baby monitor.</p>
<h3>Samsung SEW3043</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-11108 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo.jpg" alt="the Samsung - SEW3043" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo-1500x1001.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/samsung-sew3043-solo-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>There were some great things about the Samsung SEW3043 video monitor, but on the whole, we just don’t recommend it. Since we tested Samsung has started including a second camera in this package, though the price has also gone up so it&#8217;s still a terrible value.<br />
<strong>Update: After we tested our original lineup in 2018, Samsung has stopped making baby monitors altogether.</strong></p>
<p>The range you can use this monitor at is great, and it was the most immune to interference or drop-outs. The screen is also the biggest, which makes it easy to see what’s going on in night vision mode. Combined with full pan/tilt control, this is a solid video setup on paper.</p>
<p>The performance perks come at a price, it seems: even with a giant lithium-ion battery pack, this monitor died after just four and a half hours of screen-on time. Battery life is sufficient in standby mode (where the screen only turns on for noise/motion) or if you leave it plugged in, but it’s disappointing compared to the life of the other monitors we tested.</p>
<p>Some little conveniences and features look good on paper, but turn out to be detrimental in actual use. For example: this monitor features a belt/pocket clip, but Samsung made it part of the snap-on battery cover. If you actually try to use the clip you’ll hear the monitor clattering to the floor after the whole battery cover pops off under the weight.</p>
<p>The touchscreen controls are also disappointing. It looks nice, and in 2018 maybe a new generation of parents find the icon-based on-screen menu more intuitive than our testers, but we mostly preferred the direction-pad-and-buttons interfaces on the Infant Optics parent unit.</p>
<h3>VTech &#8211; DM111</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-11102 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo.jpg" alt="holding the Vtech - DM111 near a laptop" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo-1500x1001.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vtech-dm111-solo-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JEV5UI8/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">VTech &#8211; DM111</a> is very much like the DM221, our audio-only pick, but stripped of every extraneous feature and $15 cheaper. VTech probably uses the same microphone in the nursery unit and the same speaker in the parent belt pack, but that’s all the DM111 really is. No two-way communication, no rechargeable battery, no vibrate alarm when your baby cries while you’re wearing headphones.</p>
<p>The DM111 doesn’t include any batteries, though it’ll run without them with the included wall adapter. It accepts standard love-them-or-hate-them AAA cells; we used high-capacity <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/90303880/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rechargeable batteries</a> for testing, and they ran for almost 14 hours. The receiver won’t recharge batteries when plugged in like the 221 will, so we think this is really only a sensible buy if you’re not planning to run it on batteries at all and you don’t want to have to think about the extra features of that model.</p>
<h3>Levana &#8211; Jena</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-11113 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo.jpg" alt="monitoring the Levana - Jena while playing piano" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo-1500x1001.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/levana-jena-solo-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We nearly went with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008P8EZOG/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Levana &#8211; Jena</a> for our budget video option, since it has a few very strong design points. In the end, we eliminated it because it was the most susceptible to interference: when other monitors or cameras were turned on in the same room, the receiver would lose connection to its camera even on the other side of a wall or floor.</p>
<p>The range was good with line-of-sight or only one or two walls between camera and monitor, but at nearly the same price the Hello Baby system was more reliable and has better video quality. The Jena’s button layout also isn’t as intuitive as Hello Baby’s.</p>
<p>The Jena was very impressive in one test: for battery life, it bested all but the audio-only systems. Levana managed to get 13 hours of screen-on-time out of its 1800 mAh battery pack, and it comes with an easy-to-use charging dock, too. The Jena also has a belt clip that works, unlike Samsung’s silly clip that seems designed as a prank.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Baby monitors are tricky to test and recommend, since every parent will rely on a monitor in a slightly different way. Video monitors are becoming popular, though, and for obvious reasons: being able to see your baby is a big deal if you’re in the next room and you hear a sound.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ECHYTBI/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infant Optics &#8211; DXR-8</a> Video Baby Monitor has a great camera and a good remote monitor to give you control of the essential features. This isn’t a cheap monitor, and there are some features we’re surprised it doesn’t have, but the design is much better than the closest competition.</p>
<p>For those who can’t shell out more than $100 for a system, two choices really stand out: the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CZUD4R8/?tag=ybdbmon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hello Baby &#8211; HB24</a> doesn’t have the video quality of a top-dollar system, but it works well and has all the features you’d expect to see.</p>
<p>For audio-only monitoring with features like vibrating notification and two-way talkback, VTech has nearly perfected the baby monitor in the DM221.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter three weeks of research, extensive polling of mom groups and five months of testing 13 of the highest-rated sippy cups available, we chose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0193RWAEO?/tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nuk &#8211; Magic 360</a> as the best sippy cup. The Nuk is leak-proof, its lid is easy to disassemble and clean, and the 10-ounce tumbler is just right for small hands. Our runner-up <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GG2C8K0/?tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tommee Tippee</a> is the most leak-proof cup we’ve ever seen, though a bit harder to clean.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Due to the high volume of sippy cup product offerings available, we started by creating a list of the top-rated sippy cups offered across Amazon, Target, Walmart and specialty baby stores.</p>
<p>We polled our friends and a private parenting group online to see what other parents were looking for, what they loved about their cups and especially to find out what they hated.</p>
<p>We then narrowed down the list by looking at the highest number of online reviews and ratings above 4-stars for each retailer and cross-referenced our list with Reddit at /r/beyondthebump, review site <a href="https://www.babygearlab.com/topics/nursing-feeding/best-sippy-cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BabyGearLab</a> and parenting websites <a href="https://momlovesbest.com/feeding/sippy-cups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mom Loves Best</a> and <a href="https://www.lucieslist.com/gear-guides/sippy-cup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lucie’s List</a>.</p>

<p><b>Soft-spout sippy cups:</b> Soft spouts are designed to be gentle on gums while teaching a baby to drink from a spout. They’re sometimes called “trainer cups” or “transition cups,” though those labels are also applied to all the other types. Often a soft spout is designed with air vents to help reduce swallowing air, and it allows much more water to flow through than a bottle nipple does. These are designed to be easy for a baby to grip and sip, though we wouldn’t blame you if you said they’re an awful lot like fancy fast-flowing baby bottles with handles.</p>
<p><b>Spouted sippy cups:</b> This is what most of us think of when we hear “sippy cup.” The spout means a child can control the flow pretty easily and won’t dump a whole cup of milk on his head without <b><i>at least</i></b> giving you a fighting chance. The spill-proof versions of these cups will save you from mopping the floor thrice daily, but the inside of the spout and silicone seal are a pain to get clean. Recently, studies have raised concerns about tongue-muscle development, tooth position and speech pattern problems in kids who use spouts for too long.</p>
<p><b>360° / spoutless cups:</b> This is a relatively new invention, and the list of improvements is impressive: your kid still controls the flow by sucking and the lid stops leaks, but in most other ways it’s just like a regular cup. This style of cup is getting a lot of attention after the freak-out about spouts. Recommended for children 12 months plus, though the learning curve isn’t as bad as we feared.</p>
<p><b>Straw sippy cups:</b> This is the other way to deal with the concern raised about spout-style sippy cups: the straw doesn’t interfere with tongue position as much, and it forces better posture (since you have to hold the cup right-side-up for the straw to work). They’re also easier to clean than spouts, so long as you have a way to scrub out the inside of the straw.</p>

<h2 id="when-to-use-sippy-cups">When and how to use sippy cups</h2>
<p>There are two reasons commonly given for transitioning away from a bottle and getting your child to use a “grown-up” cup: First, dentists warn that sucking from a bottle for a long time means sugar (even in milk) pools around the developing teeth and can lead to early tooth decay. Second, if your kid gets formula or milk in a bottle during the day, he may not want to eat solid food at mealtimes.</p>
<p><a href="https://askthedentist.com/sippy-cup-dangers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Most dentists recommend</a> training your toddler to lift and drink from a regular (non-breakable) open-top cup as soon as you can. Sippy cups (or “transitions cups”) are a way to get you closer to that goal, even if you’re not actually solving all the problems right away.</p>
<p>We’ve seen first-hand the result of letting a child use a sippy cup like a bottle. The soothing effect is cute, and it can seem like a lifeline during weaning, but it’s hard to break the habit and it leads to extra diaper changes. Establishing a routine for when drinks are allowed can cut back on changing time and will also help avoid <a href="https://www.superhealthykids.com/cup-confusion-sippy-cups-bad-baby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the developmental concerns</a> that are getting more and more research attention.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Leak-proof:</strong> If it were easy to teach kids to drink out of open-top glasses, we wouldn’t need sippy cups. Great cups go beyond just slowing down the river of milk coming off the table, though: Leak-proof means you can stow a water cup in a diaper-bag pocket or even inside your tote bag without getting everything soaked.</p>
<p><strong>Easy to clean:</strong> The #1 concern among moms we talked to was mold. Any corners or crannies that trap solids and aren’t easily scrubbed will make mold growth possible, even if you’re just filling a cup with water. All those cleaning problems get <i>much</i> worse if you forget about a cup with milk in it for an afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>Orthodontic and developmental risks:</strong> The concerns about oral health and sippy cups are partly about sugar and tooth decay, but a hard nozzle may lead to crooked teeth or speech development problems the same way thumb-sucking does. Straws and spoutless cups are designed to avoid those risks.</p>
<p><strong>Beverage suitability:</strong> Insulated bottles mean you can carry milk in your diaper bag for an afternoon without worrying about it going bad. If you’re giving your tot smoothies for breakfast, on the other hand, a straw-cup will probably be a better investment (but watch out for tiny straws that you can’t actually drink a smoothie through!).</p>

<h3>Ease of use test</h3>

<p>We tested ease of use with our volunteer toddlers, paying attention to how easy the cups are to grip, the way they handled the weight of the cups, how much effort was required to sip through the spouts or straws, and noted any reactions to specific cups.</p>
<p>All the spout-style sippy cups we tested scored a rating of 5 for ease of use except for the “eco-friendly” sippy cups from Klean Kanteen, Pura and Lifefactory. One two-year-old volunteer stated each was “heaby” (heavy) and handed them back one after the other, though eventually she warmed up to the Lifefactory glass sippy. Each sippy cup was approximately 50-percent full during the testing period.</p>
<p>When you first see the &#8220;360° spout&#8221; cups, you’ll probably be as baffled as we were about how they work. The spill-proof silicone lid inserts mean you can’t just tip the cup back and pour water into your mouth. It took us a few minutes to realize you hold these just like a regular cup, but seal around the lid with your lips and suck like you would from a wide, flat spout. Surprisingly, our toddlers figured it out almost as quickly as we did!</p>
<p>Rating ease-of-use for straw cups is tricky, since kids will probably have no trouble at all with straws unless you switch back and forth between straws and spouts. As soon as you teach one way to drink out of a cup, that’s what will be expected from the next cup you hand them. Our kids became adept at switching back and forth by the end of the test period, but we felt sorry for them trying to drink from the Philips &#8211; Avent for the first few times, since it looks and feels so much like a spout-type cup.</p>
<h3>Leak test</h3>

<p>We rated the sippy cups from a score range of 1-5 (1 being the leakiest) in the following tests: inversion (being held upside down), shaking while upside down and dropping on a hard floor from a height of about 22 inches.</p>
<p>The Nuk Blue Turtle and Jungle Animals cups scored high in early testing, but by the end of five months the ends of the soft silicone spouts had split enough that they now drip steadily when held upside down.</p>
<p>Spout-style sippy cups scored highest overall in these tests, since they use small, tightly closed silicone seals in the tips of their spouts. Sadly, that’s also the reason they’re so hard to clean.</p>
<p>The 360 “spoutless” cups are our favorite for spill-prevention, though they only score a 4 due to some noticeable water spatter when dropped on a hard surface, and they shed a few more drops than the sealed spout cups if shaken upside down.</p>
<p>For a water cup, these are all pretty great; we didn’t feel bad about letting our kids walk around the house or climb into bed with any of them so long as water dribbles were the worst result. For packing in a bag, though, we really like the flat-top shape of the 360 cups best, since any pressure on the top of the cup will just seal it better.</p>
<h3>Hand-washing tests</h3>

<p>We scored easy cleaning on a number of factors that will probably be easily understood by anyone transitioning from baby bottles: how many parts are there, can I fit a cloth/sponge inside to wipe it down, do I need special tools to clean all the parts, and are there any parts that simply can’t be cleaned without an army of microscopic janitors? We scored each cup on a scale of five.</p>
<p>Our test dad has been searching far and wide to find a brush that would fit all the way into the corners of his daughter’s Minnie-Mouse-cup spout, but it hasn’t appeared. The tiny corner-spaces trap solids and grow mold even in a cup that’s used exclusively for water, so he was ecstatic to see that in the Nuk &#8211; Magic 360, even the tiny flow-channels are designed so you can get a scrub sponge into them.</p>
<p>All 13 cups we tested are top rack dishwasher safe, and were fairly easy to clean by hand once all the parts were removed. Straws are probably the hardest parts to clean (in some cases even if you have a special cleaning tool or a supply of pipe-cleaners), but we also docked points for tall or narrow-mouth bottles that basically require a bottle brush.</p>
<p>Note: The Gerber &#8211; Graduates cup doesn&#8217;t technically have many parts to keep track of, but the valve insert is so difficult to get in and out of the lid that we docked an extra point.</p>
<h3>Materials and eco-friendly options</h3>

<p>One of the things you’re probably thinking about more and more as your child grows is “what’s this made of?” Another daily reality is the pile of stuff your kid has chewed up or broken, ready to be thrown out after one more drop on the floor. We gave each sippy cup a rating from 1-5 based on what they’re made from and how long you can use them before they wind up in a landfill.</p>
<p>While there are no certified organic sippy cups, we did give higher scores to “eco-friendly” bottles made from easily recyclable materials like stainless steel and glass, since they’ll last far longer than any of the plastic cups unless you drive over them with a car.</p>
<p>The glass bottle from Lifefactory has an edge for being the only totally non-reactive sippy cup, but we can’t deny that a stainless bottle is more durable. We’ve looked into the safety of stainless steel before on our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/#features-to-look-for">travel mug review</a>, and we still think it’s a solid choice (though, like glass, heavy for smaller kids).</p>
<p>The rest of the cups we tested are free from BPA and other phthalates like those used in PVC, since they’re all made from polypropylene, a common plastic that handles heat and cleaning well. Silicone is used in seals and soft spouts, so there’s no worry of allergic reactions to natural rubbers. Sadly, though the polypropylene and silicone are recyclable by specialized plants, we know that the parts are also probably never going to be sorted and shipped to places that will actually do so.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0193RWAEO?/tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nuk’s Magic 360</a> surprised us in a few ways. We were skeptical about how easy it would be to drink from and how effectively it could replace an old-fashioned sippy cup, but by the end of our testing period we were pretty thoroughly convinced that this is the best cup you can buy.</p>
<p>Nuk licensed the <a href="http://www.wowcup.com/pages/technology.html#.WrVG6-jwZaQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Wow cup” technology from Wow Gear LLC</a>, and their invention is deceptively simple: a tumbler-shaped cup without spout or straw that doesn’t spill if you turn it upside down. The first time we heard a fellow mom describe the “magic” cup she had found, we were convinced she was delusional. Surely no cup could be that good.</p>

There are other spoutless cups on the market, but this one is the easiest to clean.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0193RWAEO?/tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The secret “trick” to this design is that silicone flap on top. It forms a fairly simple one-way valve, but it’s sealed against a channel-filled lid surface underneath; the combo is just stiff and restrictive enough that you need to suck on the edge to get water flowing through.</p>
<p>After a week of using the Magic 360, one of the two-year-old testers seemed to have better control with a no-lid tumbler. It’s not enough of a transformation that we’re giving her an open glass of OJ to carry around on the carpet, but it does seem like it’s helping the transition.</p>
<p>This design isn’t 100% spill-proof: if some small person whom you know and love throws a Magic 360 across the room, a &#8220;magical&#8221; spray of liquid will certainly still come out. Even gravity-powered drops from toddler height sometimes leave drips. That said, turning this cup upside down and shaking does not cause a leak.</p>
<h3>Transition cups and oral health</h3>
<p>The two downsides of a traditional sippy cup are the way the spout sits in the mouth (interfering with the tongue and pushing on developing teeth) and the way it teaches kids to lean their heads back unnaturally. The 360 “spoutless” design deals with both of these problems, and it’s a nearly perfect transition to an open-top cup.</p>
<p>With one of our test-toddlers, we noticed right away that she didn’t use the Magic 360 cup like a bottle when falling asleep — sucking down water for comfort rather than thirst — like she previously has with a spouted sippy cup. She still takes a sip if she’s thirsty, but not out of habit. That means less overnight wetting, and hopefully will help reduce bedwetting when she transitions away from overnight diapers.</p>
<h3>Nuk &#8211; Magic 360 vs Munchkin &#8211; Miracle 360</h3>

<p>Nuk has some minor advantages over Munchkin despite the similarities. If you’re standing in front of a rack of sippy cups and you only see Munchkin’s cups, grab one and go before your toddler pulls down the tower of basketballs in the next aisle. If you’ve got a chance to buy the Nuk, though, it’s our pick of the two for milk and our favorite overall.</p>
<p>For one, we like that the Magic 360 is transparent enough that we can almost always tell what kind of liquid is inside, which hopefully reduces the number of times in a week you’ll be cleaning spoiled milk out of something.</p>
<p>When hand-washing, the Nuk cup has channels or grooves between the plastic and flap rather than holes, and you can actually get a scrubber or sponge on all of that surface area. A dishwasher is going to be far quicker, but one test household didn’t have a dishwasher in their apartment and Nuk’s design didn&#8217;t leave them with worries about missed grime.</p>
<p>Both cups present a big step up from the nightmare of sticking your nose inside the spout of a silicone-sealed sippy cup and vainly trying to find that last bit of hidden, congealed whatever-it-is. Leak-proof performance is almost identical between the 360 cups.</p>

<p>If branding is going to be the deal-breaker for your kid, Munchkin has versions of their cup with Paw Patrol and Hello Kitty, while Nuk has PJ Masks and TMNT. Each maker also offers a variety of generic-but-friendly designs. If you’re looking for Disney characters specifically, there’s a very comparable cup we didn’t test from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019JZOKKW/?tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The First Years</a>.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Nuk &#8211; Magic 360’s spout-free design means this is easier to clean than a traditional sippy cup and doesn’t have the developmental side effects you’ve heard about.</li>
<li>This is the best cup for milk, too, since you can easily see what’s inside.</li>
<li>Leak-proof enough for a bedtime water cup, though there’s a splash if you drop it.</li>
<li>Easy to take apart and clean with only three parts.</li>

<h2 id="leak-proof">Most leak-proof: Tommee Tippee &#8211; Sippee Cup</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GG2C8K0/?tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tommee Tippee &#8211; Sippee Cup</a> is the most complex cup we tested, but it does exactly what it’s supposed to: It prevents spills using a fantastic hidden silicone valve and a better-than-average spout, but it’s still easy to drink from.</p>
<p>You may have heard about this cup a few years ago in less favorable terms: The old sealed one-piece valve was basically impossible to clean and got a full recall. The new design has more parts to keep track of, but you can clean them all thoroughly by hand or in a dishwasher.</p>
<p>We like that the firm silicone spout of the Sippee has a tube-shaped inner passage rather than being hollow, since this prevents things from getting trapped in impossible-to-reach corners and growing mold or bacteria. Although you need a pipe cleaner or straw scrubber to scrub out the tube, it doesn’t have impossible-to-reach corners like most sippy cup designs.</p>
<p>The real win for this design is that it’s as close to totally spill-proof as we can imagine. The silicone valve actually locks the spout closed until you start sucking on it, at which point the pressure change inside the cup opens a little plunger and your kid can drink freely. In our testing, it also seems less prone to the high-pitched squealing that comes from air leaking into or out of a conventional seal on a leak-proof cup.</p>

There are some small parts to keep track of, plus all the developmental worries that come with a spout, but it won’t trap mold the way some spouts do.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GG2C8K0/?tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>This cup would probably leak in your luggage if it were packed upside down in a checked bag on an airplane, but other than that kind of rapid pressure change we couldn’t find a way to make this cup leak. It’s the only one we’d pack in a camera bag.</p>
<p>For all its strengths, the Sippee cup has tiny parts to disassemble and clean and requires an extra cleaning tool. Also, after our first washing test, we also had some major leakage problems because we didn’t get it back together just right. After a year of practice you’ll probably be able to field-strip the parts and re-assemble blindfolded, but that’s not a challenge most parents are looking for.</p>
<p>This cup also comes with all the developmental worries of spout-style sippy cups. We like the Tommee Tippee design enough to feel happy about recommending, but it’s not as amazing as the Nuk &#8211; Magic 360.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Tommee Tippee &#8211; Sippee Cup has a silly name, but it’s the most leak-proof cup we’ve tested.</li>
<li>This is easy for kids to drink from without compromising thorough cleaning or allowing spills.</li>
<li>Any concerns you might have about spouts will still apply, but it’s a semi-soft silicone spout.</li>
<li>Extra parts make for a lot of work to take this cup apart and reassemble it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because it leaks so readily with water and it’s so disposable, we couldn’t in good conscience recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0054YZDWC/?tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Take &amp; Toss from The First Years</a> as top straw cup for water, let alone best cup overall. However, because it’s the only cup we tested with a large-bore straw (just less than ¼” inside diameter, like a typical beverage straw), this is the only one we recommend for blended smoothies.</p>
<p>We tried berry-yogurt smoothies in the other cups, and they simply wouldn’t go. In the Take &amp; Toss, you might have to blend longer to avoid chunks if you’re working with a straw that’s flattened on one end, but it’ll work fine. Yes, you’ll want pipe-cleaners to scrub out the middle of that straw, but otherwise the cup is easy to wash.</p>
<p>The downside to straws like these, compared to the softer straws on the Philips and NuSpin straw cups we tested, is that they’re hard. That makes them easier to insert in the lid and also easier to wash, but some teething toddlers will almost certainly mash the end flat after a week or two, like ours did. It’s a good thing they’re cheap. There are silicone replacement straws available, though if your kid is anything like ours those might get bitten through even more quickly.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0054YZDWC/?tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="" data-srcset="" width="" height="" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best for Smoothies: The First Years - Take &amp; Toss Straw Cup</h3><p></p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0054YZDWC/?tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Straw cups in general are recommended as an alternative to spout-style sippy cups because they don’t force the tongue and teeth into strange positions, and also because they encourage good posture. Unless you buy one of the exotic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JQSITMI/?tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">weighted-straw sippy cups</a>, your toddler can’t hold a straw cup upside down and lean back the way they would with a spout or bottle-nipple, since the straw would then be up in the air.</p>
<p>It was a bit cruel switching our kids back and forth between straw and spout style cups during tests, and you’re really better off sticking with one style of cup if you can. One of our tester households likes the Nuk 360 cup best but uses a straw for smoothies, and for a case like that the Take &amp; Toss is nice to have around.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Take &amp; Toss Straw Cup isn’t water-tight for bedtime and you certainly couldn’t put it in a diaper bag without puddles, but it’s great for walking around with.</li>
<li>It’s easier to wash than every other straw cup we looked at.</li>
<li>The straw is made from thicker material than a standard disposable straw, and will hold up fairly well to biting.</li>
<li>For smoothies, the straw is just the right size.</li>
</ul>

<p>Almost everything we liked about the Nuk Magic cup also applies to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MRZIGVG/?tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin &#8211; Miracle 360</a>. That’s good, because you might not be able to find the Nuk in a moment of desperation, and Munchkin also might sell a character-branded cup or color that your kid prefers.</p>
<p>We did find the Nuk design easier to clean by hand, and we like that it’s transparent enough to tell the difference between apple juice and water, but they’re both great cups.</p>

<h3>NuSpin &#8211; Zoomi Straw Sippy Cup</h3>
<p>There’s a lot to like about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HIOSM1Y/?tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NuSpin &#8211; Zoomi straw cup</a>, but at the end of the day we’re not convinced that a straw is the best way to go for an everyday use toddler cup. There are lots of parents we know who started trying straws in order to make it easier for youngsters to enjoy a healthy smoothie without spoon-feeding them, but a tiny straw like NuSpin uses just won’t work for that.</p>
<p>This is also one of the more expensive cups we tested, and the straw isn’t easy to replace or to clean. If a straw is the way you want to go for a go-to water-drinking cup, this cup has a slight edge over the Philips for how easy it is to clean and it is more leak-proof than the Take &amp; Toss cup.</p>
<h3>Philips &#8211; Avent</h3>
<p>Philips has a huge line of baby products, and they’re all packed with features, but at the end of the day all of those features just makes <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M74D5VC/?tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Avent &#8211; My Bendy Straw Cup</a> harder to use than it should be. The three-piece straw has a valve in the middle to prevent backwash and a curved piece inside the cup to make draining the last drops easier, but all of those pieces create spots for mold or milk-eating bacteria to hide.</p>
<p>The flip-down lid is effective at preventing leaks in a diaper bag and it won’t disappear in a week the way most caps do, but it’s still an extra part to break and it may frustrate a smaller toddler (or impatient parent) when you’re trying to pass a water cup from front seat to back seat in the car.</p>
<h3>Hard-spout sippy cups</h3>

<h3>Gerber Graduates &#8211; Fun Grips</h3>
<p>There’s a lot to like about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00278WA4W/?tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gerber &#8211; Fun Grips</a> design: the shape is hard to tip over, fairly easy to grip and nearly 100 percent leak-proof even after five months of use. All of the usual problems of a hard spout design are present, though.</p>
<p>The spout harbors tiny mold spots and is impossible to fully clean by hand, and to make matters worse the silicone seal insert is held in place by a piece of hard plastic that’s harder to remove than it should be.</p>
<p>Also, If you’re worried that your toddler will trade his milk bottle addiction for a sippy-cup addiction, or if you’re thinking about future orthodontist bills, this design won’t help you at all.</p>
<h3>Munchkin &#8211; Alphabet Sippy Cup</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PTL6W02/?tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin &#8211; Alphabet Sippy Cup</a> is about as ordinary as you can get in a leak-proof sippy cup. It’s a tiny bit easier to clean the silicone seal here than it was on the Gerber cup, but we can’t call it the best by any stretch of the imagination since the spout still holds enough moisture to grow mold and can’t be easily scrubbed.</p>
<p>The leak-proofing isn’t quite as good as Gerber’s, though, and neither cup has any advantage over the Tommee Tippee, let alone Nuk’s Magic 360 cup.</p>
<h3>Eco-friendly sippy cups</h3>

<h3>Pura &#8211; Kiki Stainless Steel Insulated Sippy Cup</h3>
<p>If you’ve always wanted to put an easy-sipping soft spout on your favorite insulated water bottle, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N12BF8O/?tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pura &#8211; Kiki</a> is an insulated bottle made for you.</p>
<p>Pura has got a lot of good press for the recyclable, plastic-free design, and we do like that you can keep milk cold in this bottle for much longer than any of the other cups. The soft spout is fairly leak-proof; far better than the worst sippy-cup spouts, but not nearly as carpet-safe as a Tommee Tippee or Nuk &#8211; Magic 360.</p>
<p>We like that this is a bottle that’s designed to grow with your child, allowing you to change the spout for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IJ7TWNQ/?tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">sport-oriented lid</a> when you’re ready.</p>

<p>There’s a silicone cover to keep dirt out of the spout, which is a nice touch, but if your kids are anything like ours that will be lost in a few weeks. The soft spouts are also going to leak badly if you rest them upside down inside a bag, even with the cover on.</p>
<p>We’d say this is the best easy transition from a bottle, except that it’s so heavy. One of our two-year-olds just handed it back and didn’t want to drink from it. Given enough time, even a smaller toddler can learn to manage the weight, but the soft spout and the weight of the body are mismatched.</p>
<p>Another downside to this design is that the vent to replace what your kid is drinking with air is basically just the seal at the base of the silicone spout. If you tighten this lid too much, your drinking child will leave a vacuum inside the bottle and the soft nipple will get sucked in. Maybe you’re used to that from your baby bottles, but it’s an extra factor to think about when you’re just trying to get a cup of milk into the hands of a crying two-year-old.</p>
<h3>Lifefactory &#8211; Glass 9 oz Sippy</h3>

<p>Glass is a love-it-or-hate-it bottle material, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0767M7B8C/?tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lifefactory’s 9-Ounce Glass Bottle</a> is one of the top sellers in this category. This is the same bottle that&#8217;s all the rage at yoga classes, but in a smaller size and with sippy-style spout included. There are even bottle nipples available in the full range of flow rates if you want to give your infant a head start on bicep curls with a weighted bottle. (Okay, there’s a 4 oz bottle for infants but they can all use the same lids.)</p>
<p>Though the Lifefactory bottle offers an inviting brightly-colored silicone wrap to offset the weight and cold touch of glass, the lack of a vent hole in the lid means (like the Pura) you can’t screw it down all the way. If you do you’ll undoubtedly hear something like “daddy, it don’t works!” Even after unscrewing a bit, it’s the most restrictive spout in our lineup (and it still leaks if you shake it).</p>
<h3>Klean Kanteen &#8211; Classic Sippy</h3>
<p>We like Kleen Kanteen as a company, and we think their insulated bottles are superb, but for toddlers the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ADSHGR4/?tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kleen Kanteen &#8211; Classic Sippy</a> design just doesn’t stand up to the competition.</p>
<p>One test toddler liked this bottle-style sippy least of all: it was hard for her to figure out where to hold it, and cold metal isn’t as inviting to small fingers as it is to a backpacker on a through-hike. We like the finger-loop for easy carrying of the bottle after a toddler says “hold my milk” in anticipation of snapchat-worthy stuntz, but it definitely appealed more to our tester parents than our tester kids.</p>
<p>The materials used here are great: The single-wall steel bottle is nearly indestructible and easily recyclable. That said, there’s the same polypropylene plastic in the spout as you’ll find in the other landfill-packing sippy cups, and the silicone ring that seals the lid to the body can be a pain to get off for a really thorough cleaning.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with this cup is that it leaks, badly. After a few months of use, it drips a few drops every seconds just from being upside down. The spout is harder to clean than most, too.</p>
<h3>Soft-spout sippy cups</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10792" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/other-soft-spouted-cups.jpg" alt="Nuk learner cups" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/other-soft-spouted-cups.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/other-soft-spouted-cups-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/other-soft-spouted-cups-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/other-soft-spouted-cups-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/other-soft-spouted-cups-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/other-soft-spouted-cups-1500x1001.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/other-soft-spouted-cups-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/other-soft-spouted-cups-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/other-soft-spouted-cups-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/other-soft-spouted-cups-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/other-soft-spouted-cups-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We were looking for a cup to recommend as the best cup for transition from a bottle or from breastfeeding, and we tried a few cups from Nuk: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002QCPQ0E/?tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Learner Cup</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004MWJP62/?tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Active Cup</a>. These are the most bottle-like cups we tested, with soft spouts that might appeal to some youngsters who refuse to wean with the hard spout on a conventional sippy cup.</p>
<p>First, the positives: These cups are simple to clean. They’re basically large bottles with high-flow nipples. Everything you’ve learned about cleaning bottles through the first months of parenting will apply here.</p>
<p>On the flip side, these cups are really less of a transition than a stop-gap. Most experts suggest transitioning to an open-top cup because sticking with a bottle can make it difficult to get your kid to eat solid food. If your goal is transition, this will be a change from the bottle or nursing, but not enough of a change to hit those milestones.</p>
<p>The main reason we’re not recommending these cups is that the nipple/spout leaks after a few months. Out of the box these were good performers, but after five months of testing they’ll dribble if you hold them upside down. The snap-on cap keeps dirt out of the spout, but how long do you expect you can keep track of a cap for a cup that a toddler will be walking around with?</p>
<p>The Pura &#8211; Kiki stainless insulated bottle has a similar soft silicone spout that doesn’t have as many leaking problems, but it’s a heavy bottle that’s not going to be an easy transition for weaning. (Even one of our two-year-old testers didn’t like the weight.)</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>We hope this guide has given you helpful information and helped you decide which cup is right for your toddler. We know that you’re depending on this cup to last for at least a few years, and that means you might fill it and wash it <i>thousands</i> of times.</p>
<p>For a leak-proof sippy cup that’s better-designed than average, the updated version of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GG2C8K0/?tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tommee Tippee &#8211; Sippee Cup</a> really is leak-proof and easy for a toddler to drink from. It’s not even more expensive than most cups, though taking the valve apart for cleaning is a bit more work that we’d like.</p>
<p>For smoothies, we know it can be hard to find a straw cup that will actually work and not be impossible to clean. We liked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0054YZDWC/?tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Take &amp; Toss Straw Cup</a> from The First Years for that reason: It’s not an amazing feat of engineering or a durable product that will last for years, but your toddler can actually drink a banana-yogurt smoothie out of it, and you won’t go crazy trying to clean it.</p>
<p>For most families, the best sippy cup is probably going to be the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0193RWAEO?/tag=ybdsip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nuk &#8211; Magic 360 spoutless cup</a>. This isn’t an open-top cup, but it’s so close your toddler will definitely get a chance to feel more grown-up than the other kids with their “baby bottle” cups. Most importantly, it’s easy to take apart and clean after you leave it in the sun over a weekend and a colony of something-or-other grows inside.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Before we began choosing white noise machines, we did a crash course in the science of white noise and its benefits. Articles at <a href="http://www.popsci.com/article/science/fyi-why-does-white-noise-help-people-sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Popular Science</a>, <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/question47.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Stuff Works</a> and <a href="https://psmag.com/news/the-art-and-science-of-white-noise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pacific Standard</a> gave us a good background on types of noise — white and otherwise — as well as why it works to assist sleep and mask sound.</p>
<p>Next, we looked at some blogs that specialize in improving sleep quality, and read their recommendations for white noise machines. The review <a href="http://www.sleeplikethedead.com/sound-machine-white-noise.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sleep Like the Dead</a> was especially informative. Finally, we headed over to Amazon to select our finalists from among the highest-rated and most-reviewed white noise machines.</p>
<p>Many of the experts cited in our initial research noted the important difference between white noise and soothing sounds, such as ocean waves or babbling brooks. <b>Although digitally sampled or simulated sounds like flowing water or wind chimes can be calming, they can also be distracting by causing the mind’s attention to jump from one aspect of the sound to another.</b> Plain, ordinary white noise — the more boring, the better — is the best choice for better sleep, noise masking and concentration. For this reason, we selected finalists that offered white noise and fan sounds, and chose not to review any additional “soothing sounds” that might be included on a given machine.</p>

<h2>What is white noise and how does it help?</h2>
<p>Research suggests that white noise can improve sleep quality, ensure your private conversations aren’t overheard and even enhance your ability to learn. Many parents also use white noise to help their babies sleep better and longer.</p>
<p>White noise is made up of all the frequencies a human ear can hear, sounded all at once. The term white noise is a comparison to white light, which is a combination of all the frequencies of light the human eye can see. At its purest, white noise sounds like a rather high-pitched radio static.</p>
<p><b>Frequency:</b> The height of the wave, or the pitch of a sound, measured in hertz (Hz). For example, middle C on a piano is around 261.6 Hz. A healthy human ear can hear from around 20 Hz to 20 kHz (20,000 Hz). You might feel, more than hear, a very low bass tone at 20 Hz. The human voice is generally between 1.6 and 4 kHz. Electrical devices can emit high-pitched whines above 16 kHz, toward the top range of human hearing. Dog whistles usually start around 23 kHz.</p>
<p><b>Amplitude:</b> The force of the wave, or the volume of a sound, measured in decibels (dB). The human ear can hear sounds beginning just above 0 dB, and can be irreparably damaged when exposed to sounds as high as 160 dB. A human whisper is around 20 dB and normal speaking volume is around 60 dB. Traffic noise is about 85 dB; exposure to prolonged noise louder than that for extended periods of time can cause hearing damage without <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-ear-plugs/" rel="noopener">ear protection</a>. Jack hammers and ambulances are around 120 dB.</p>
<p>Combining all audible frequencies at equal amplitude into one sound can have the effect of cancelling out or covering up ambient sounds. Other “shades” of white noise, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=brown+noise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brown noise</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=pink+noise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pink noise</a>, use a similar frequency-combining technique, but with certain frequencies played at higher amplitude in order to cover up more specific ranges of sound. A quick YouTube search yields samples of each different shade of white noise.</p>
<p>For purposes of simplicity in our testing, we’re using the term “white noise” to apply to any white noise or fan setting on one of our white noise machines, using descriptive language rather than other “colors” to describe differences in tone.</p>
<h3>Better sleep</h3>

<p>Sleeping difficulties can be caused by a number of factors, including street noise, stress, sleep partner noises and tinnitus. While white noise can’t cure all sleep problems, research suggests it can improve sleep in the average bedroom and especially in noisy or disruptive environments, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16139772" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including the ICU</a>.</p>
<p>There are many explanations for how white noise works. Some experts say that white noise blocks out sudden changes or inconsistencies in the sleep environment that could wake you up. Others suggest that the combination of so many frequencies limits the brain’s ability to pick out a single sound among the many, effectively masking any unwanted environmental sounds.</p>
<p>No matter <i>how </i>it works, many people use white noise to help improve sleep. People with tinnitus, or ringing in their ears, can find it helpful to play a low-volume white noise to distract from the sound in their head. White noise can cover up the snores of a roommate or the street noise coming in your bedroom window. And as <a href="https://www.the-guided-meditation-site.com/benefits-of-white-noise.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some meditation practitioners</a> advocate, low-level meaningless noise can help a person clear their mind of stresses and worries in order to relax.</p>
<h3>Fewer distractions and more privacy</h3>
<p>White noise is not sound cancellation — that is, white noise doesn’t work by minimizing or eliminating sound waves. Businesses with open-concept work environments sometimes use <a href="https://speechprivacysystems.com/sound-masking-vs-cancellation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sound cancellation systems</a> to minimize workers’ ability to overhear each other.</p>
<p>But personal white noise machines can be effective for covering distracting environmental sounds or private conversations. In the same way white noise can mask the sound of snores or street noise, it can cover voices from an adjacent conference room or doctor’s examination room.</p>
<h3>Better learning</h3>
<p>Using white noise can help improve learning. <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn_a_00537#.WJSLebYrKi5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Studies have shown</a> that white noise can help with memory and fact recall, and improve information processing. It’s also effective for improving memory difficulties related to aging.</p>
<h3>Why babies love white noise</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.happiestbaby.com/blogs/blog/white-noise-for-baby-sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White noise can mimic the sounds a baby hears in the womb</a> — the muffled jumble of voices, the <i>whoosh</i>ing of mom’s heartbeat, the vague rumble of environmental noises. Using white noise in a baby’s room can replicate this environment and the feelings of safety and comfort it triggers. The <i>shush</i> sound that people instinctively use to soothe a crying baby is a kind of white noise. Placing white noise in a baby’s sleep area can promote deeper and better quality sleep.</p>
<p>Experts caution parents not to place noise machines too close to the baby’s head, however. White noise should be around 50 dB, or about as loud as a bathroom shower, to prevent damage to baby’s ears.</p>

<p>Personal tastes vary a lot regarding sleep environment, but there are some common features to look out for when shopping for a white noise machine.</p>
<p><b>No audible break or patterns in sound loop:</b> White noise machines run for long periods of time, and any recognizable pattern or obvious break in the sound can be disruptive. Some digital white noise machines simply play back a recorded loop of noise that can have subtle patterns that become noticeable throughout the listening period. Noticing an obvious end and beginning in the loop or recognizing a pattern in the noise can be distracting enough to interfere with sleep or concentration.</p>
<p><b>Adjustable volume:</b> Most bedrooms or workspaces won’t have the same level of sound every single day. Being able to adjust the volume of white noise can help mask unwanted sounds no matter how the environment changes.</p>
<p><b>Variety of sounds:</b> It can be hard to know just what you’re looking for in a white noise machine until you try it out. A machine with a wide range of sound options can increase your chances of finding the perfect white noise for your needs.</p>
<p><b>Compact and portable:</b> Humans are creatures of habit. Once we find our ideal environment, we want to duplicate it as easily as possible when we’re away from home. A white noise machine that can be easily packed in a suitcase or overnight bag can make a hotel room or vacation rental much more restful.</p>
<p><b>Reasonably priced:</b>White noise machines can be viewed as investments in better living, but that doesn’t mean folks want to pay very much for one. The seven machines we tested range in price from around $20 to around $80.</p>
<p><b>Digital vs. analog: </b>Analog white noise machines use fan-produced sound with an adjustable outer casing for fine-tuning pitch and volume. Digital white noise machines offer a greater range of volumes and an infinite variety of sounds. Analog machines tend to be quieter, but some people prefer the more natural sound of a fan over digitally produced or sampled sounds. However, normal wear and tear can cause fans to develop patterns or tics over time.</p>
<p><b>Design:</b> Round, oval, heptagonal, tear-drop-shaped. Tall, low-profile, hangable. Push-buttons, dials. Display lights, no lights, adjustable lights. Portable, stay-put-heavy. Black, white, tan, chrome-accented. Some white noise machines are designed for utility, some have had obvious effort put into their appearance. In general, we made sure the design did not influence our ranking of the machine&#8217;s abilities.</p>

<p>Our group of seven white noise machine finalists included three analog machines and four digital machines. We tested only the “white noise” and “fan” functions of each machine, ignoring any other sound options like waterfalls and ocean waves.</p>
<h3>Pushing the buttons</h3>
<p>Each of the three analog machines we tested — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NAPB57J/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HemingWeigh</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GFSF402/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sleep Easy</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HD0ELFK/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dohm</a> — has a power switch and a single rocker switch to select low or high fan. (HemingWeigh has one additional button for the nightlight function.) In addition to buttons, the analog machines each feature an adjustable outer casing with slanted and circular vents in various sizes. Rotating the casing changes the airflow through the vents, affecting the quality and volume of sound produced.</p>
<p>The digital machines had more button options. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E6D6LQY/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">‘LectroFan</a> has three rocker switches to control power, volume, timer and sound options. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D50RZQI/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rohm</a> has four push buttons for power, volume and sound options. And <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002SMJQT4/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sound+Sleep</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A2JBMRE/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HoMedics</a> each have a single dial and seven push buttons for sound options, timer and other functions.</p>
<p>We spent a couple hours running through the range of white noise and fan sounds and their volumes on each machine. We made sure the timers were true and the buttons did what they were supposed to do.</p>
<p>Finally, we cranked each white noise and fan sound on each machine up to its highest possible volume and used a sound meter to measure the amplitude.</p>
<h3>Practical testing</h3>
<p>We conducted our practical testing in two parts. First, we measured how well each finalist masked sounds in an adjacent room. Then, we used each machine overnight for a week to see how it affected our testers’ sleep.</p>
<p><b>Masking household noise</b></p>

<p>Chances are, if you live with a spouse, roommate, child or pet, there are times they make noise when you’re trying to sleep. White noise machines can help to cover up the sounds in rooms adjacent to your bedroom and keep noise-related domestic disturbances to a minimum.</p>
<p>With our white noise machines set up in a quiet room, we used a stereo system to play recorded sounds in an adjacent room. We mimicked the experience of overhearing a variety of common household distractions, such as dogs barking and a TV sitcom playing, then used a sound meter to measure how well each machine covered up the sounds.</p>
<p>On the whole, none of the white noise machine finalists were overwhelmingly successful at masking noises in an adjacent room, but some were better than others. All of the digital machines, for example, were louder than any of the analog machines, and therefore much better at covering sound.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that white noise can be very grating and inhibit sleep at high volumes. Having a white noise machine that can mask noises at very high volume doesn’t necessarily make it the best. However, having the option to make it louder makes it a more versatile machine, which we think does generally make it better.</p>
<p><b>Overnight test</b></p>
<p>Each machine was placed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJk4MC2NC2I" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the same location</a> in the bedroom roughly two feet from the foot of the bed, display facing the bed and speaker facing the ceiling. Sleepers spent some time before bedtime running through the settings to find the right sound and turning the volume to the appropriate level.</p>
<p><b>In overnight tests, our testers overwhelmingly favored the digital machines. The analog machines were simply not loud enough to provide enough sound for a soothing effect.</b> Even when moved directly next to the head of the bed, the analog machines were not loud enough for our testers, although they did note a pleasant stirring of the air that was soothing.</p>
<p>Besides volume, other complaints included display lights that couldn’t be turned off and too-harsh white noise sounds. Testers also noted that some of the finalists’ power cables were quite short, which wasn’t a problem in our testing room, but certainly could be in a hotel room or other non-home situation.</p>
<p>For our testers, who were already used to sleeping with white noise, there was no marked improvement in sleep with any of the machines. However, there were more uneasy nights with some of the finalists, most notably the analog machines, which were too quiet to assist with sleep.</p>

<p>As the only rechargeable white noise machine we tested, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D50RZQI/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Marpac &#8211; Rohm</a> takes top honors for portability with its 12 hours of cordless operation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A2JBMRE/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HoMedics &#8211; Sound Spa</a> can run on an included power cable or four AA batteries, which makes it portable as well, although it is larger than Rohm. Every other machine we tested must be plugged in to work. Moving any of them from one location to another within the same house is no problem at all, and none of the units we tested will take up too much room in a suitcase. However, at two pounds, Sound+Sleep is the heaviest white noise machine we tested and the only one we would consider too heavy to call portable.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life</strong></p>
<p>Rohm and HoMedics are the only white noise machines we tested that have a battery option. Rohm has an internal lithium ion battery, rechargeable via an included USB cable. HoMedics can be powered either by its wall adapter or by four AA batteries.</p>
<p>When Rohm was fully charged, its battery life was between 10 and 12 hours. And at full volume, starting with new batteries, HoMedics gave around 100 hours of operation.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong><br />
As with most electronics, the simpler units are less expensive and the machines with more bells and whistles cost more. The least expensive white noise machine we tested, HoMedics (around $20), looks rather cheaply made, but doesn’t feel flimsy or poorly constructed and the audio is decent quality. Sound+Sleep (around $80) costs four times more than <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A2JBMRE/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HoMedics </a>and looks and feels substantial, well-designed and is jam-packed with sound options, although not much in the way of white noise.</p>
<p>The three analog machines we tested each cost around $30 (Dohm is a little more) and feel mostly interchangeable regarding materials, construction and performance. And our two top finalists, ‘LectroFan (around $45) and Rohm (around $35), each feel well-made but not over-engineered, with no extra buttons or features that could increase their prices.</p>

<p>With the highest scores in nearly all of our tests, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E6D6LQY/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adaptive Sound Technologies &#8211; ‘LectroFan</a> is our choice for the best white noise machine. It’s the only machine we tested that offers a selection of white noise <i>and</i> fan sounds, in addition to being the only finalist to ace our sound masking tests. ‘LectroFan’s simple design and straight-forward controls were great selling points for our testers, with no question about how to operate it or its purpose in the home.</p>
<p>The versatility of a white noise machine that offers a wide range of truly “meaningless” sounds is incredibly valuable. Most white noise machines offer only one or a few sounds to choose from, so you may need to purchase and return several machines before you find just the right one. ‘LectroFan offers 10 fan sounds, from box fan to industrial fan, and 10 white noise sounds, including “champagne” and “chestnut.” Our favorites? Vent fan for working, cinnamon noise for sleeping.</p>
<p>In our testing, ‘LectroFan’s loudest, most grating white noise and large fan sounds covered up all ambient noise and sound from an adjacent room, including the booming explosions of an action movie. As previously noted, you might not want to have this machine at full volume, but it does offer you the option to run it at high volumes in order to mask all kinds of environmental sounds.</p>

Featuring 10 fan sounds, 10 white noise selections and a huge volume range to match anyone's preference.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D50RZQI/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>In overnight tests, ‘LectroFan fit seamlessly in our testers’ nighttime routine. After finding the right white noise and the appropriate volume, our testers gladly used ‘LectroFan every night of its test week. With no display lights to brighten the sleeping area and a small footprint that didn’t take up much space on the tabletop, ‘LectroFan was a welcome addition to the bedroom.</p>
<p>Design-wise, ‘LectroFan is low-profile, geometrical and inconspicuous. It’s available in black or white. At around $45, it’s a little more expensive than most of the other finalists, but a few days of use prove its worth. The nearly 5-foot cable allows the unit to be powered via USB plug or the included A/C adaptor. The three rocker buttons are easy to manipulate even in the dark. The 60-minute timer can be pressed multiple times to add more hours. And to help you find your favorite white noise or fan sound as you’re scrolling through the options, a soft <i>whoop</i> sounds briefly at the beginning of the list. This is a smartly designed machine.</p>

<p>For travel, baby stroller or any other situation where you might not want (or be able) to plug in your white noise machine overnight, we recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D50RZQI/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Marpac &#8211; Rohm</a>. Two white noise settings with a good range of volume and a battery life of up to 12 hours make this white noise machine a winner.</p>
<p>At 3.5 inches in diameter and only 3.8 ounces, Rohm is the smallest white noise machine we tested. It charges via micro USB, so you won’t even need to pack an extra charging cable if you already have one for your phone — although one is provided with the unit. Rohm will operate while plugged in, as well as up to 12 hours (at middle volume in our testing) unplugged with a full charge of its lithium-ion battery. It can sit on a tabletop or other surface, or can be hung by the included lanyard.</p>

<p>Both the bright white noise and deep white noise settings are continuous; we could not detect a pattern of any kind during our overnight or practical tests. Our testers preferred the deep white noise for sleeping, but found the bright white noise similar enough to accidentally use it one night without noticing. Each setting has a volume range adjustable to over 70 dB, and in our testing was enough to cover dogs barking, TV conversation and city noise.</p>
<p>It’s important to note again that the volume should be kept quite low if using in baby’s crib, stroller or car seat. Experts recommend setting it to about the volume of a bathroom shower to prevent hearing damage. That said, this is a great machine for use with babies especially because its portability allows you to provide a consistent sonic environment no matter where you take your little one. Marpac also makes <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D50RYSC/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hushh</a>, which is marketed specifically for use with babies and is identical to Rohm except for a night light and a button lock.</p>
<p>We have one very minor gripe with Rohm. The unit comes with a micro USB cable, but no USB plug adapter. Chances are most people have a few of these around their homes, but at a price point over $30, we would expect such a convenience to be included.</p>
<p>Overall, though, we were pleasantly surprised by this tiny powerhouse. Rohm is a great choice for travelers, campers or anyone on the go who wants to take a little bit of home with them.</p>

<p>We were not blown away by the analog white noise machines. In a sleeping environment our testers wanted a much louder white noise sound than any of the analog machines provided. Overall, in fact, the three analog machines we tested felt more or less interchangeable. They had the same control buttons and the same vented, rotating outer casings. The few extra features on HemingWeigh (see below) didn’t even set it apart to a significant degree.</p>
<p>It came down to sound. Two of the analog machines had a metallic whine or motor noise along with the fan sound that was mildly unpleasant. The one analog machine without the motor noise, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GFSF402/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sleep Easy &#8211; Sound Conditioner</a>, is our choice for the best analog white noise machine.</p>

<p>Sleep Easy is a machine that will probably need to live on your bedside table, rather than on a dresser or another surface across the room. The fan sound is quite low; on the highest setting it’s only 62 dB, which is around the volume of conversational speech. But in a quiet room, the fan sound is especially soothing, and the faint stirring of the air that results from the fan itself is pleasant.</p>
<p>With a tan casing, circular side and top vents, and a black rocker on/off button, Sleep Easy looks a lot like the other two models we tested. However, at less than $30, it’s the least expensive model we tested, which may give it an additional edge on the competition.</p>
<p>This is definitely not a white noise machine for someone looking to mask environmental sounds in their bedroom. But in a quiet environment like a baby’s room or a typically quiet home, or for a sleeper with tinnitus, Sleep Easy is a good choice.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GFSF402/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sleep Easy</a> provides pleasant fan-created white noise without any motor sound.</li>
<li>Highest setting around the volume of normal conversation (i.e. rather quiet).</li>
<li>Best for use in a quiet setting or for sleepers with tinnitus.</li>

Additionally, this machine includes an “adaptive mode,” which manufacturers say listens to your environment and adapts the sound machine to meet your specific needs.</p>
<p>Sound+Sleep is a rather large, sleek-looking tabletop white noise machine with black casing, chrome buttons and a large central chrome dial. At two pounds and nearly seven inches long, this teardrop-shaped machine is the heaviest and largest we tested. An A/C power adapter with a nearly 5-foot cable is included. Despite its relatively light weight, this finalist feels substantial enough not to be especially portable. It’s not really made for travel. And at around $80, it’s the most expensive model we tested.</p>
<p>In our overnight tests, Sound+Sleep got high scores for its deep static white noise sound. Testers liked its volume range and noise masking ability, as well as its non-looping digital white noise. A “display” button that turns all display lights on and off was testers’ favorite feature on Sound+Sleep. Overnight testers did note a kind of musical overtone to the white noise that was not unpleasant, but still noticeable.</p>
<p>In addition to Sound+Sleep’s white noise setting, there are nine soothing sounds (such as meadow and train) and a “richness” button that adds up to two levels of enrichment to each sound. As noted above, we did not test any soothing sounds in this review, focusing solely on the white noise options for each machine.</p>
<p>Adding richness to the white noise made it louder, harsher and higher-pitched. Interestingly, adding richness in our noise masking tests made the sound less effective at masking environmental noises, even though the sound was louder. Our testers overwhelmingly preferred the white noise sound with no richness added.</p>
<p>The other unique feature of Sound+Sleep is <a href="https://www.soundofsleep.com/soundsleep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its adaptive technology</a>, which uses a built-in microphone to detect environmental sounds and then changes the sound accordingly. In our testing, this feature was not impressive. Rather than keeping the settings as you’ve chosen and adapting the sound from that point, the adaptive mode raises and lowers the volume of white noise to match environmental sound. So in a quiet room with occasional bursts of noise such as talking or children playing, Sound+Sleep lowers the volume to nearly undetectable and raises it occasionally when it “hears” a loud enough sound. In our overnight testing, the microphone wasn’t sensitive enough to pick up street noise from the window, so it kept the volume of white noise too low to be effective for sleep.</p>
<p>Overall, we liked the single no-richness-added white noise option and the display on/off button on Sound+Sleep. If you’re looking for several soothing sound options, this might be worth the time and money. But if you’re mostly looking for white noise, look at less expensive models to meet your needs.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A2JBMRE/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sound Spa by HoMedics</a> was our least favorite of the digital white noise machines we tested. The lightweight, low-profile machine has one white noise function (among five other soothing sounds), a three-setting timer and a good volume range.</p>
<p>Weighing in at half a pound and not even two inches high, HoMedics is quite portable even with its 6.5-inch footprint. Made from very lightweight plastic, HoMedics feels rather cheaply made, but the buttons and volume dial are reassuringly responsive. The 6-foot A/C power adapter cable provides continuous power, or you can get about 100 hours of power at full volume from four AA batteries. At around $20, this was the least expensive white noise machine we tested.</p>
<p>The white noise option on HoMedics sounds harsh and thin compared to our top picks, a bit like a heavy rain with the warmer, deeper notes removed. Our overnight testers noted an unpleasant pulsing in the white noise sound, and were annoyed that the display light could not be shut off. Testers abandoned this machine only a few hours into each night of its tests.</p>
<p>Overall, HoMedics is an inexpensive, portable option for consumers who aren’t especially picky about discernible patterns in their white noise.</p>

<p>In almost every test, analog white noise machines <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HD0ELFK/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Marpac &#8211; Dohm</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NAPB57J/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HemingWeigh</a> are indistinguishable. A couple features set HemingWeigh apart, but sound-wise, they are remarkably similar.</p>
<p>They’re both off-white and dome-shaped, with angled vents on the sides, circular vents on top and black rocker buttons on the front. Each creates its white noise sound with an internal fan, and both have a slight mechanical whirring that accompanies the fan sound. Additionally, they both have long power cables and top volumes of close to 60 dB in testing.</p>
<p>Their differences are few. HemingWeigh has a bright night light and two USB ports on its front, neither of which Dohm can boast. And price-wise, HemingWeigh is around $30 and Dohm is about $40.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-8963 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wnm-dohm-bedroom.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wnm-dohm-bedroom.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wnm-dohm-bedroom-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wnm-dohm-bedroom-1500x1001.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wnm-dohm-bedroom-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wnm-dohm-bedroom-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wnm-dohm-bedroom-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wnm-dohm-bedroom-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wnm-dohm-bedroom-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wnm-dohm-bedroom-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wnm-dohm-bedroom-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wnm-dohm-bedroom-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wnm-dohm-bedroom-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wnm-dohm-bedroom-768x512@2x.jpg 1536w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wnm-dohm-bedroom-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wnm-dohm-bedroom-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>All of that said, both HemingWeigh and Dohm provide innocuous fan-created white noise with no discernable patterns and an enjoyable light breeze that stirs the air immediately around the machine in a pleasant way. Neither was loud enough to pass any sound-masking tests or make it through an entire night for our overnight testers, but might be sufficient in a baby’s room or otherwise very quiet bedroom. Both are relatively lightweight and compact, so would likely travel well, especially HemingWeigh with its additional features.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After many hours of real life testing with two babies: dropping diapers, lid flipping, bag changing and room sniffing, we found the Munchkin - STEP to be the best diaper pail overall.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ith dozens of diaper pail models on the market, it can be tough to figure out which pail will best meet your needs. We tested six top-selling diaper pails over six summer weeks, filling them with disposable diapers from two toddlers and seeing how they contained odors. After hours of diaper dropping, lid flipping, bag changing and room sniffing, we concluded that the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BDQDIGM/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Munchkin &#8211; STEP Diaper Pail</a> is the best diaper pail overall. Its superior odor-containment, easy hands-free operation and sturdy design gave this diaper pail an edge above the rest. Our runner-up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00821FLSU/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ubi &#8211; Diaper Pail</a> costs around $20 more, but it’s very sturdy, attractive and uses a standard kitchen trash bag.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>First of all, we limited this review to diaper pails for disposable diapers, since disposables make up an estimated 90-95% of the diaper market. Although some of our finalists are adaptable for cloth diapers, the differences between the two types of containers are significant enough that we chose to focus only on functionality related to disposable diapers.</p>
<p>We began our research by seeing which diaper pails people were talking about most in 2017. We considered diaper pail reviews from only real testing review sites such as <a href="https://www.babygearlab.com/topics/diapering-potty/best-diaper-pail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Babygearlab</a>. There were many other lists out there from big baby brand sites but we put much less weight on their choices since they didn&#8217;t do any testing.</p>
<p>A survey of a moms’ Facebook group helped to pare down the results even further and provide direction for our selection. Finally, we headed over to Amazon to check out the top sellers, read reviews and add to our set of finalists to test. These reviews and user comments also helped us learn what features are most important to folks shopping for diaper pails.</p>
<p>In 2018, the Diaper Genie &#8211; Essentials model was discontinued, and we tested the new Expressions pail side-by side in a household that&#8217;s been using the old model for three years.

<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>Our research revealed that caregivers and gift-givers are concerned about the following when selecting a diaper pail:</p>
<p><strong>Odor containment</strong>: Above all other concerns, a diaper pail should contain odors; this is its primary function and sets it apart from regular trash cans.</p>
<p><strong>One-handed or hands-free operation</strong>: Diaper pails that are easy to open one-handed or hands-free are especially convenient, since one hand is usually occupied with the baby.</p>
<p><strong>Easy bag changing</strong>: The plastic liners that hold the diapers inside the diaper pail should be easy to remove and change, to minimize the unpleasantness of the task as much as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Diaper capacity and unit size</strong>: The pail should be compact, yet large enough not to merit daily emptying.</p>
<p><strong>Keeps out kids</strong>: Lid locks and other deterrents can help keep curious toddlers (and pets) away from the contents.</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: Consider not only the one-time cost of the diaper pail, but also the ongoing cost of purchasing the appropriate liners.</p>
<p><strong>Design and longevity</strong>: Some shoppers may consider whether the pail has an attractive design that blends in with baby’s deécor, and if it has potential for a life after diapers.</p>

<p>But why buy a dedicated diaper pail at all? Can’t you simply throw the diapers away in a regular trash can? Or toss them in the outdoor trash or down the garbage chute one at a time? While these are certainly options, many caregivers prefer a dedicated bin specially designed to minimize odors that they can keep close to the diaper-changing area.</p>
<p>The sealed-lid design of diaper pails is what sets them apart from regular trash cans. In addition to sealed lids, some diaper pails also have built-in odor-masking features, such as the baking soda sachet in the Munchkin &#8211; STEP and the deodorizer disc in the Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver. Others feature two barriers to keep odors at bay, such as the lid-plus-trapdoor design of the Dékor &#8211; Plus and the Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions. Still others are made of materials that won’t absorb odors, such as the Ubbi. For the most part, all of these features are relatively effective in keeping odors at bay.</p>
<p>Some diaper pails feature a child lock that helps keep little hands out. Of the models we tested, only the Dékor &#8211; Plus and the Ubbi have dedicated child locks — although neither one was any trouble for our 20-month-old and 3-year-old testers, who figured them out in minutes. None of the diaper pails we tested claim to keep out pets, and we didn’t specifically test for this. However, it would take a very clever and dexterous dog to work its way into any of the pails we tested. A possible exception is the Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver, which opens if pushed over with enough force.</p>

<p>Diaper pails get daily use in homes with small children, so we knew our testing needed to reflect the realities of caregivers’ lives. We looked at how easy it was to unpack each one from its shipping packaging, how simple it was to assemble and start using, and how nice it looked in the nursery. Our practical testing included all the concerns we identified in our research phase, including one-handed operation, changing the liner and keeping the kids out. We also considered each one’s diaper capacity, how well it contained odors and how they stacked up to in a price comparison.</p>
<h3>Out of the box</h3>
<p>For the most part, all of the pails we tested were easy to remove from their packaging. The Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver was the easiest, in fact, with absolutely no packaging inside the shipping box. The Ubbi and Dékor &#8211; Plus each had more packaging than the rest, including packing foam and plastic bags, which is logical considering their emphasis on attractiveness.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009A4FBQ/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BDQDIGM/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin &#8211; STEP</a> were the only models that required any assembly. They each include odor-masking features that need to be attached inside the lids. Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver has a deodorizing disc and Munchkin &#8211; STEP has a baking soda sachet. Both were very simple to install.</p>
<p>The Dékor &#8211; Plus, Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions and Munchkin &#8211; STEP each have a proprietary “continuous liner” that comes already loaded in the diaper pail. (See below for more on the continuous liner system.) The others all use standard kitchen trash bags, which we needed to insert before testing. For our practical testing, we elected to use unscented trash bags to keep the playing field even with the unscented proprietary liners. However, there are no unscented liners available for the Dékor &#8211; Plus, so in our testing we used the lightly scented liners that came with the diaper pail.</p>
<p>In a physical side-by-side comparison, the Ubbi, Dékor &#8211; Plus and the Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions are more visually appealing than the other models we tested. They are colorful — both models offer several color options to match your nursery scheme — and have sleek, modern shapes that seem more likely to blend into a well-designed nursery than the other models. Diaper Genie earns a bit of an edge here by offering <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HLYR6HM/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">slip covers in three colors and five patterns</a>. The Munchkin &#8211; STEP is solidly middle-of-the-road design-wise, with a tall, bright white plastic exterior. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002IWYXH4/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe</a> has a large blue (or pink) handle that adds an interesting visual element, but overall doesn’t either blend in or stand out in a stylish way. And the Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver simply looks like a plain, rather small trash can, not particularly appealing on any level beyond practicality.</p>
<h3>Practical testing</h3>
<p>In our hands-on testing, we rated each diaper pail for odor containment, ease of one-handed operation and simplicity of changing the liner. We also considered each one’s effectiveness at keeping the kids out, its diaper capacity and how they stacked up to one another in a price comparison.</p>
<p>We tested each diaper pail for two weeks in a home with two diaper-wearers, ages one and three years, each wearing size-four diapers. The pails were kept in two interior rooms — one in a child’s room and the other in a bathroom — and both were in locations where the resident kids had easy access to them. Each pail was used several times per day and emptied at least four times in the course of testing. We also <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-baby-wipes/">reviewed the best baby wipes</a> at the same time.</p>
<h3>Odor containment</h3>

<p>Hands down, the number one most important quality in a diaper pail is its ability to contain odors. Otherwise, why bother with a special container? <strong>Odor containment was foremost in our minds during testing and was given the most weight in our rankings.</strong></p>
<p>In fact, the other characteristics of diaper pails are simply less important than odor containment. If you buy a standard-bag diaper pail hoping to save money on liners, but you can only put in five diapers before it starts to stink up your nursery, you’ll be changing bags too often to see any cost savings. An attractive design quickly becomes unappealing and inconsequential if odor drives you to store it out of sight. Odor control is absolutely essential.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BDQDIGM/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin &#8211; STEP</a> and <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions</a> pails were both tops in this category, reaching bag capacity before the smell became troubling. The Ubbi was a distant third place, releasing odor upon every open, but containing odors exceptionally well when closed. The Dékor &#8211; Plus is next best, allowing odor to escape every time a diaper was inserted, but not smelling after five days with a full bag. Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe and Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver had abysmal results in our testing, releasing odor upon opening to insert a diaper and leaching stink after only a couple days with only a few diapers inside.</p>
<h3>One-handed operation</h3>

<p>One-handed operation is a top concern of reviewers, because one hand is usually on the baby while the other hand disposes of the diaper. All of the models we tested are relatively easy to open with one hand:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009A4FBQ/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver</a> has a push-button that opens a hatch to put the diaper through. The only difficulty with this model was that the bulbous compartment that holds the deodorizing disc is mounted inside the hatch door, and it sometimes gets in the way of pushing fuller diapers through.</li>
<li>Like a city mailbox (remember those?), the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002IWYXH4/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe</a> has a handle you pull up to reveal a compartment to place the diaper in. Push down on the handle to deposit the diaper into the liner. A little foot built into the front of the pail allows you to step and hold it steady during all the handle ups and downs.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00821FLSU/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ubbi’s</a> slide-hatch has a small handle to facilitate opening. It’s an easy quarter-turn to unset the lid lock before opening, and to reset it upon closing.</li>
<li>The snap-close lid of the now-discontinued Diaper Genie &#8211; Essentials is the only lid that has stumped all of our kid testers. The updated <a href="https://www.target.com/p/-/A-51094345" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Expressions model</a> has a push-button pop-up lid that&#8217;s more convenient, and the spring-loaded inner trap door keeps kids out of the diapers themselves, but it&#8217;s not what it used to be.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BDQDIGM/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin &#8211; STEP</a> step-controlled lid reveals a self-sealing opening that a diaper must be pushed through. This was the easiest one-handed operation of all the pails we tested.</li>
<li>The step-controlled lid of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F55P1WW/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dékor &#8211; Plus</a> opens to reveal a trapdoor for diapers to be dropped through. The lid lock for the trapdoor is a simple dial that’s easy to use but can be a little tricky to turn with a diaper in your hand.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changing the bag</h3>
<p>It’s not difficult to change out the liner in any of the diaper pails we tested. Half of the models we tested use proprietary liners and the other half use standard kitchen trash bags. The process for changing the bags in all of them is intuitive and self-explanatory, but we discovered that the models with proprietary liners have a distinct advantage over those that take standard bags.</p>
<p>Reviewers and manufacturers alike often claim the benefits of being able to use standard trash bags, which potentially saves you money because you don’t have to buy more than one kind of trash bag for your home. However, we found that the models with proprietary bags were much more pleasant to change, because their contents are never open to the air during the changing process. This is thanks to the continuous liner design used by the Munchkin &#8211; STEP, Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions and Dékor &#8211; Plus.</p>

<p>The continuous liner is a long tube-shaped roll of plastic liner that hangs down into the diaper pail and is tied off at the bottom to create a bag. Once full, the bag of diapers is cut off the roll using an included child-proof cutter and tied off at the top to create a sealed “sausage” of diapers. Because the full bag is removed through a door on the side of the diaper pail and not by opening the lid, the liner can be tied off without exposing the contents to the air. When the roll cartridge is empty, it is removed and replaced with a refill. While this process is a bit involved to describe, changing the liner on these three diaper pails is not difficult, and is significantly more pleasant than replacing the bags on the other models.</p>
<p>Note that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BDQDIGM/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin &#8211; STEP</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009TJ3J60/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions</a> use interchangeable “continuous ring” proprietary bag cartridges. The Munchkin &#8211; STEP can also accommodate a different, but similarly odor-containing bag design, called the “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009R27JVU/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">snap, seal and toss</a>,” which has a snap-top that allows it to be sealed without exposing the contents to the air. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00389VFH2/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dékor &#8211; Plus</a> has its own continuous ring design.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009A4FBQ/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ubbi, Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002IWYXH4/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe</a> use standard kitchen trash bags. While relatively straight-forward in all of these models, the process for changing the bag in the Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver requires the top of the bag to be open to the air for as long as it takes to remove the bag from the pail. This can be a very unpleasant few moments. The Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe and the Ubbi have similar clever methods for bag changing that keep the bag from opening when you remove it (see more under Runner Up and Other Finalists, below).</p>
<h3>Keeping kids out</h3>
<p>Generally, kids are fascinated by anything they’re not supposed to touch, and even more so if the off-limits item is something regularly used by their parents. Our tester kids were predictably drawn to all of the diaper pails we tested, and gave us good insight into how accessible the germy contents are to curious little hands.</p>
<p>The Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions, Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver and Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe were easy to access. Our 20-month-old tester figured out the push-button open on the Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver and was thrilled to open and close the hatch repeatedly, letting out the diaper smell in small bursts. And the Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe, with its fun handle revealing a hidden compartment, was the best toy in the house during its testing weeks. Countless small items were fished out of the diaper pail after they’d had a toddler-assisted ride down the chute. The Diaper Genie&#8217;s spring-loaded inner trap door keeps kids separated from diapers the same way it keeps smells in, but the flip-up outer lid is just as much a kid magnet.</p>
<p>The child locks on the Ubbi and the Dékor &#8211; Plus were minimally effective at keeping the kids out, but they provided enough discouragement to keep these models from becoming objects of play. Similarly, the lid-control pedal of the Munchkin &#8211; STEP was fun for the kids to step on, but they were put off by the self-sealing diaper hole.</p>
<h3>Diaper capacity</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8136" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dekor-diaper-capacity.jpg" alt="Dekor's diaper capacity" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dekor-diaper-capacity.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dekor-diaper-capacity-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dekor-diaper-capacity-1500x1001.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dekor-diaper-capacity-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dekor-diaper-capacity-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dekor-diaper-capacity-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dekor-diaper-capacity-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dekor-diaper-capacity-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dekor-diaper-capacity-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dekor-diaper-capacity-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dekor-diaper-capacity-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dekor-diaper-capacity-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dekor-diaper-capacity-768x512@2x.jpg 1536w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dekor-diaper-capacity-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dekor-diaper-capacity-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>All of the models we tested had similar capacity, even considering their size differences. Each will hold about 15-20 size four diapers (according to our testing), or about 30 newborn diapers (according to their marketing), although <a href="https://ubbiworld.com/pages/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubbi</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002IWYXH4/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baby Trend’s</a> marketing claim their models can hold closer to 60 newborn diapers. For testing purposes, we defined the diaper pail as “full” if the bag could not hold any more diapers.</p>
<p>In addition to testing diaper capacity, we also wanted to see how well each model contained odors overnight, when full, with the lid closed. In this test, only the Munchkin &#8211; STEP and Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions didn’t stink up the room. The Ubbi and Dékor &#8211; Plus leaked enough odor to be detectable, but not gag-worthy. For the other models, the results of overnight testing were so stinky we couldn’t stand to let subsequent bags fill up because the odor became too unpleasant.</p>
<p>This is a meaningful result to highlight, because diaper capacity means very little if the diaper pail starts to stink with only a few diapers in it. The added convenience and cost-savings of having a diaper pail you can fill to capacity could significantly improve your diapering experience.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>

<p>We saw a significant difference in quality and odor-containment based on price. Our top picks are the two most expensive models, with Munchkin &#8211; STEP at around $56 and Ubbi at about $80. Dékor &#8211; Plus is around $40 and Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe is around $30. Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions, our pick for best lower-cost diaper pail, costs under $25. And our bottom-rated model, Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver, is the least expensive at about $16.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind when considering cost is how much you’ll spend on bags. Ubbi, Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe and Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver all use standard kitchen trash bags. Munchkin &#8211; STEP and Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions take only proprietary bags and Dékor &#8211; Plus can use either its proprietary bags or standard trash bags.</p>
<p>The proprietary refills do cost a lot more than standard trash bags, and that’s a cost that adds up. You could spend $70 more per year on bags for the Diaper Genie, for example, than on standard bags for the Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver. If cost is a primary driver for you, consider one of the models that takes non-proprietary bags.</p>

<p>Our favorite diaper pail was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BDQDIGM/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin &#8211; STEP</a> diaper pail. This easy-to-use, sturdy diaper pail contained odors, kept kids out and was a breeze to empty.</p>
<p>The continuous bag design provides superior odor containment. The bag refills for the Munchkin &#8211; STEP (and Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions) keep the odors in very effectively; diaper smell isn’t even detectable when sniffing the outside of a full bag. The Munchkin &#8211; STEP also includes a deodorizing baking powder sachet that helps keep a nice smell at the opening of the pail. It’s easy to change the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009TJ3J60/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bag cartridge</a> (or the single use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009R27JVU/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">snap, seal and toss bag</a>) and not at all unpleasant to remove full bags.</p>

<p>Design-wise, the Munchkin &#8211; STEP has a neutral look of white plastic offset with chrome-like accents. It’s tall enough that we could insert a diaper without having to bend down. Additionally, not only is it sturdy enough that there’s no fear of it tipping over, having a foot pedal gives it an extra level of stability.</p>
<p>Our tester kids liked opening the lid with the foot pedal and even trying to throw away diapers, but weren’t able to push the diapers all the way through the opening. We saw this as a good thing that meant there was no way they could access the mess inside the liner.</p>
<p>Changing the bag is as simple as opening the door on the side of the pail, pulling down on the bag to make slack at the top, cutting the bag on the child-proof cutter and tying it off. It’s fast, stink-free and intuitive. The Munchkin &#8211; STEP even has a recessed push-button release for the side-access door, so it’s pretty difficult for kids to get into.</p>
<p>The one drawback about this diaper pail is the need to push diapers through an opening that has a valve-style seal. There is an element of “squish” here, and there was one time in our testing that mess escaped from a diaper and got on the liner. This was easily resolved, however, by pulling more liner from the cartridge down into the pail, hiding the mess inside. One other note is that condensation from inside the bag can get onto your hand as you’re pushing the diaper in, but it’s our regular practice to wash hands immediately after changing diapers anyway, so that wasn’t a big deal.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Munchkin &#8211; STEP diaper pail features superior odor control when closed and full of diapers, and also doesn’t allow odors to escape when inserting a diaper.</li>
<li>Easy to use with one hand, and foot pedal provides extra stability when disposing of diapers.</li>
<li>Simple, intuitive, stink-free bag changing procedure.</li>

<p>Our second favorite diaper pail was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00821FLSU/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ubbi</a>. Its sleek design, quality materials and ability to contain odors when closed make this a very compelling choice, especially if you want a diaper pail that coordinates with your nursery.</p>
<p>The Ubbi is a sturdy diaper pail with a lockable sliding hatch in the lid. We never worried it would stay upright upon opening — this was an issue with some of the more lightweight models — and the door for depositing diapers opened easily. It was awkward to try to unlock the lid and slide open the hatch while holding a diaper all with the same hand, but it was doable once we got the hang of it.</p>
<p>The stainless steel construction seals in odors exceptionally well. With the hatch closed, the diaper pail did not smell at all, even on hot days, and only the faintest of smells escaped overnight when the bag was completely full. It also repels odors, so even the interior of the pail didn’t smell too bad after our testing weeks. It may be temping to use <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-baby-wipes/" rel="noopener">baby wipes</a> for cleaning up odors, but a quick wipe-down with a <em>disinfecting wipe</em> removed the minimal lingering odor.</p>

<p>This diaper pail is available in <a href="https://ubbiworld.com/pages/diaper-pail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13 colors and five (limited-edition) patterns</a>, so you’ll probably find one to match your baby’s décor. And the powder-coated steel is easy to wipe clean and looks as high-quality as it feels.</p>
<p>Our main gripe with the Ubbi is how it smells when it’s not sealed shut. There’s a puff of diaper odor that’s released every time the hatch is opened to insert a diaper. If you’re quick, it’ll be a short puff, but it’s still a yucky several moments while the smell dissipates. When you’re changing the bag, opening the lid releases all the odor that steel case has been containing so well. There is a bag-holding ring that helps a bit, so at least you don’t have to come face-to-face with the contents. But it’s a shame that such an otherwise well-designed diaper pail still requires a good amount of breath-holding when changing the liner.</p>
<p>Finally, the Ubbi came in at the very top of the price range for all of our selections, over $20 more than the next most expensive model. As we’ve noted, it does seem like you are getting a higher quality product for that price, so depending on your priorities in a diaper pail, the higher price might be worth it to you. This diaper pail may also have a life beyond diapers, most likely as a pet-waste trash can, since the opening in the lid is a little small for a wide variety of household trash.</p>
<p>Because it did allow odors to escape upon opening, this model couldn’t compete with our top pick, the Munchkin &#8211; STEP, in odor control. However, we liked the Ubbi very much, and would recommend it especially to folks who care a lot about the quality and design of their diaper pail.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Ubbi &#8211; Diaper Pail features easy one-handed operation, although occasionally tricky to unlock and open while holding a diaper.</li>
<li>High-quality, well-designed exterior available in a variety of colors and patterns.</li>
<li>Allows odors to escape when inserting diapers and when changing the bag.</li>
<li>Highest price of all the models we tested.</li>

There is a lot of gear to buy when you’re having a baby, and cost of luxury accessories is certainly a concern for most families. Our pick for the best lower-cost diaper pail is the <a href="https://www.target.com/p/-/A-51094345" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions diaper disposal system</a>.</p>
<p>The name Diaper Genie is synonymous with diaper pails, but reviews of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0713M8Z5L/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">top-of-the-line step-to-open models</a> have always been lukewarm at best. The basic models, on the other hand, have always been award winners. The Diaper Genie &#8211; Essentials was our old budget pick, and the Expressions is a refresh of the exterior design that leaves the smell-stopping mechanism basically unchanged.</p>
<p>With its snap-top/push-and-lock design, the Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions was on par with our top pick, the Munchkin &#8211; STEP, regarding odor control. Smells were minimal or non-existent when inserting a diaper. And even better, the continuous cartridge design allows the bag to be changed without ever allowing those trapped odors to escape.</p>
<p>While the now-discontinued Diaper Genie &#8211; Essentials was the only model we tested that kept the kids out entirely, the new Expressions model has a push-button pop-open lid that toddlers might love to play with. The strong spring on the inner door means your those toddlers still won&#8217;t be able to put anything in, but the update trades away security for a little bit of convenience.</p>

If you're looking for something that's not a white plastic bucket, you can also buy optional slip covers.</p><a href="https://www.target.com/p/-/A-51094345" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Target.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If you like the look of a plain white plastic pail, this model is just as unassuming as any of the others. You&#8217;ve got the option of buying <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HLYR6HM/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a slip-on cover in one of six patterns</a>, though, which makes this pail a bit more versatile than any of the others.</p>
<p>Finally, we have to address the “squish” issue. The Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions’ push-and-lock design functions exceptionally well as an airlock, but it does require you to forcefully push diapers through a pretty tight opening. In our combined years of using this system, we have not seen instances of diaper contents erupting during the “squish,” but online reviewers frequently cite this as a concern — and the competitors like to highlight how their models do not require a “squish.”</p>
<p>Overall, the Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions is a functional, lower-cost diaper pail with superior odor containment. This option is a good choice for those more concerned with budget than design.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions offers superior odor containment when disposing of diaper and when changing the bag.</li>
<li>Optional slip covers make this easier to match with your nursery decor.</li>
<li>Easy one-handed operation, though kids might want to pop the outer lid open.</li>
<li>Requires you to squish diaper through tight opening.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dékor &#8211; Plus</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F55P1WW/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dékor &#8211; Plus Diaper Pail</a> is functional and attractive. We loved its foot pedal for easy one-handed operation, and it’s nice and tall so there’s no need to bend down to toss diapers. The lid opens to reveal a trapdoor to drop diapers through, making this a truly “hands free” diaper pail, since you don’t have to touch any part of the pail with your hand when using it.</p>
<p>If you want to use the child lock, however — which we discovered we definitely needed to do, since that foot pedal and trapdoor combo are so fun for kids to explore — you lose some of the hands-free appeal. Twisting the knob of the child lock while holding a diaper can be tricky, especially if the diaper isn’t a tidy package. Our answer to this dilemma was to place the diaper on top of the trapdoor, then turn the child lock knob and hope the diaper would be heavy enough to force open the trapdoor and fall down inside. This worked about half of the time.</p>
<p>The other major drawback of this model was the stink factor. The trapdoor opens directly into the bag of diapers, letting out smelly air with every diaper deposit. The proprietary continuous liners that come with the Dékor &#8211; Plus are lightly scented, but the diaper odor was still very noticeable with every trapdoor open.</p>
<p>As we noted with the Munchkin &#8211; STEP and the Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions, the continuous bag design is terrific for odor control when changing out the liner. Open the side door, pull the bag down to let out some slack, slice the plastic with the included safety cutter, tie off the top. No need to inhale the full degree of accumulated aroma in that bag. In our opinion, it truly is worth the money for the proprietary refills if it saves us a face full of diaper stink every time we change the bag.</p>
<p>The Dékor &#8211; Plus could have a life after diapers, especially since the trapdoor insert is removeable from the lid casing.</p>
<h3>Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe</h3>

<p>We were surprised by the poor odor containment of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002IWYXH4/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe</a>, especially considering the positive reviews both on Amazon and various blogs. After only a couple days, it began to smell up the room, and airing it out didn’t solve the problem.</p>
<p>With its airlock-style design, you pull up the handle, place the diaper in the compartment and push the handle down to deposit the diaper into the container. It is a great one-handed operation, especially if you steady it by standing on the little foot built into the front of the pail. However, the diaper-holding compartment is also an odor-holding compartment, so every time you pull the handle up, you’re greeted by a puff of diaper smell. Even storing it with the handle in the “up” position didn’t help as much as it should have. Odor leaked out of the container and had the room smelling bad within a couple days.</p>
<p>Additionally, our 1-year-old tester loved to play with the handle of this pail, inserting a toy into the compartment, pulling the handle down and then back up to find that his toy had disappeared! Because there is no child lock on this model, we had to keep it in a room with limited child accessibility.</p>
<p>The best feature of the Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe is the bag insertion and removal. This model takes regular kitchen trash bags or proprietary scented liners. There’s a bag holder ring just under the lid that holds the bag in the pail. To change the bag, you can open the lid in a way that keeps the top of the bag held in the ring, so you don’t need to open the bag to the air and get a face full of stink. This clever design somehow functions better than the similar set-up of the Ubbi, holding in more smell, although still allowing some to escape.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a sturdy, rather short diaper pail with an odor containment problem. Some online reviewers describe having luck with deep cleaning the pail every two or three bag changes, or treating the rubber seal with <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-essential-oils/" rel="noopener">essential oils</a>. But for our money, we’d rather have a diaper pail that requires as little cleaning and maintenance as possible.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009A4FBQ/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver Diaper Pail</a> is just a step above a regular trash can, the main difference being the diaper hatch in the lid. It takes regular kitchen trash bags that are straightforward to install and change, and looks like it could be a typical trash can.</p>
<p>At only 18.5 inches tall, this is the shortest model we tested and also the widest at 14 inches. For some spaces, these measurements can matter a lot; all of the other models feature a “space saving” oval shape, while the Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver is round. We noticed a difference in our testing spaces, where the Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver seemed not to fit as well as the others.</p>
<p>This diaper pail’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000SOXF82/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">deodorizing disc</a>, which lives in the bulbous compartment on the underside of the hatch, did not have a discernible scent or a noticeable impact on odor control. In fact, the compartment holding the disc even got in the way as we tried to insert fuller diapers through the hole, so for us it was more hindrance than helper.</p>
<p>Because the hatch opens directly into the container, odors were released upon opening the hatch. But that wasn’t all — the smells also escaped from the container when it was closed. Partially full of diapers and left in a poorly ventilated room for a couple hours, the Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver made a real stink. We had to air it out overnight twice in its two-week testing period, and we still needed to change the bag more frequently than the other models to avoid having a constantly stinky room.</p>
<p>With its squat, beige container, the Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver isn’t likely to appeal to anyone setting up a designer nursery. And the push-button operation for the hatch was very fun for our tester kids to play with — opening and closing the hatch, inserting small toys into the hole — which was especially a problem when they opened it and walked away, leaving a pungent surprise for whoever entered the room next.</p>
<p>Overall, the Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver functioned as well as we would expect a regular lidded trash can to work as a diaper pail — not very well, unless you empty it every day. That being said, this would function just fine as a regular trash can, although you’d likely just lift the entire lid to throw away garbage, rather than using the hatch. It could also function reasonably well for pet waste, albeit with the same limitations we noted for diaper use. And at just $15.79, it’s a bargain for either use, if you’re prepared to deal with some stink.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>One of the most satisfying things about changing diapers while you&#8217;re on the go with <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-diaper-bags/">a great diaper bag like one of the backpacks or totes we reviewed</a> is that you can leave the dirty diaper in someone else&#8217;s trash. When you&#8217;re at home, unless you&#8217;ve got an outside storage bin close at hand, there&#8217;s really no way to get around temporary diaper containment until trash day.</p>
<p>Our pick for the best diaper pail is the Munchkin &#8211; STEP Diaper Pail powered by Arm &amp; Hammer. The step-lid combined with the self-sealing system and continuous liner design offer excellent odor containment and easy one-handed use.</p>
<p>We also recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00821FLSU/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ubbi</a> if you’re looking for a high-quality, designer diaper pail, and the <a href="https://www.target.com/p/-/A-51094345" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions</a> if you want a functional pail with a lower price tag. Both contain odors when closed and are easy to use with one hand.</p>
<p>As with many purchases, price was a major identifier of the quality and functionality of the diaper pails we tested. In our opinion, odor containment is the most important consideration for any diaper disposal system, and the more expensive models we tested had the best odor control. Think about how much you value a clean-smelling room, and consider budgeting a little more for a quality diaper pail.</p>
