								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter 200 hours of research and side-by-side testing of weed killers in our team’s backyards, we determined that the best overall weed killer is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ARKS3XO/?tag=ybdwdkill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Compare-N-Save &#8211; Concentrate Weed &amp; Grass Killer</a>. It’s the fastest-acting and most thorough weed-destroyer we tested, and it has a great price point and works on the widest variety of weeds. If you’re looking for a proven organic weed killer, we recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HLVFQW7/?tag=ybdwdkill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Natural Armor &#8211; All-Natural Weed &amp; Grass Killer</a>, which killed weeds almost as well as Compare-N-Save.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>A quick Google search for weed killers yields hundreds of results — top brands produce item after item that (even for a seasoned gardener) can seem too similar to distinguish. Some promise to kill weeds in the first two days after application, while others promise to prevent them from growing for an entire season. For our test, we wanted weed killers that produced rapid results.</p>
<p>Products that promised to eradicate stubborn, wild growth in a wooded area weren’t relevant for backyard testing, Instead, we looked for weed killers that promised successful lawn management. If the product description or name didn’t reference lawns, we decided not to test it. Because we wanted weed killers that yielded quick results, we also avoided any that needed to be mixed into the soil directly, which lawn owners are meant to prepare a year in advance.</p>
<p>We turned to Amazon, Home Depot, Lowes and Ace Hardware to see which products were showing up most often in their top-sellers lists. We narrowed our search by choosing weed killers that had at least a 70% approval rating. We supplemented our comparison by watching YouTube reviews of the weed killers we were most interested in testing.</p>

<h2 id="who-buy">Who should buy weed killer?</h2>
<p>It’s safe to say that you shouldn’t wait for a full weed infestation of your yard to justify picking up weed killer. But what about homemade varieties?</p>
<p>Many home gardeners have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcghUO-yfXc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their own weed-killing recipes</a> consisting mostly of vinegar and other kitchen ingredients. These homemade methods can be effective, especially when compared to other natural or organic store-bought varieties. Clearing dead weeds by hand is usually needed because vinegar-based solutions are less effective at <a href="https://www.gardenista.com/posts/landscaping-101-pros-and-cons-of-homemade-weed-killer-garden-herbicide-roundup" target=" rel=">penetrating the roots</a> of weeds with complex root systems, most of which are the weeds in your backyard.</p>
<p>A natural, homemade weed killer is cost effective, but for tackling tough weeds or covering a large area, it’s better to look at bottled options that pack more punch.</p>
<p>Store-bought weed killers might be right for you if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to remove weeds but are either unable or prefer not to do the manual work that weeding requires</li>
<li>Your yard has an area where stubborn bunches of weeds that grow back soon after you’ve removed them</li>
<li>You have a large area to cover and could use a high-coverage sprayer</li>
<li>You’re looking to start totally fresh growth and want to clear away grass and weeds all at once</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Herbicide percentage and composition</h3>
<p>Herbicides are technically the name for the chemicals that comprise a weed killer, but they have become synonymous with the weed-killer mixture that treats them. There are a number of different herbicides, and the general rule is that the higher the herbicide percentage, the stronger the weed killer.</p>
<p>The most common herbicide is <a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/glyphogen.html" target=" rel=">glyphosate</a>, which accounts for the power of nearly all commercially produced weed-killing products. Glyphosate has been <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/05/30/727914874/safe-or-scary-the-shifting-reputation-of-glyphosate-aka-roundup" target=" rel=">getting some heat lately</a> for its potentially harmful effects on the environment and the people who use them. As a result, natural weed killers have risen in popularity and effectiveness.</p>
<p>Glyphosate works by limiting the proteins that plants need to generate growth; the National Pesticide Information Center maintains that pure glyphosate is not dangerous, but most commercial weed killers add ingredients like <a href="https://www.chemicalsafetyfacts.org/surfactants" target=" rel=">surfactants</a> to help the glyphosate penetrate plants, and those may make it riskier; if a surfactant allows herbicides to penetrate plant skin better, it will also penetrate the skin of humans and pets easier as well.</p>
<p>Many of the weed killers we tested contained glyphosate, so we took precaution by wearing protective gloves, masks and shoes.</p>

<h3>Post-emergent vs. pre-emergent treatment</h3>
<p>Weed killers or herbicides can be categorized as post-emergent, pre-emergent or a combination of both. Post-emergent treatment kills weeds that are already growing in your yard; pre-emergent treatment prevents new weeds from growing.</p>
<p>Post-emergent treatment should be spread during peak growing season, because it kills ground cover and, with the right product, penetrates the roots to prevent future germination of weeds. Pre-emergent treatment should be spread in advance of peak growing season, usually in the fall when plants begin going dormant. Most reviewers of weed killers cite both treatments as part of their habitual lawn-care routine.</p>
<p>For the purposes of our test, it was important that we visually saw results, so we only tested post-emergent treatments. If we were to test pre-emergent treatments, we’d only be able to estimate how many weeds might be prevented from growing, or we would have to test for several years.</p>
<h3>Selective vs. non-selective</h3>
<p>A “selective” weed killer is supposed to get rid of only “select” plants, and a “non-selective” weed killer dries out everything it touches. Selective weed killers target certain plans, so you should know what types of weeds are growing in your yard. The most common types of weeds vary by region, but they can be divided into two general categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broadleaf lawn weeds (annual and perennial)</li>
<li>Grassy lawn weeds</li>
</ul>
<p>The differences between the two are germination periods, survival time and plant structure. Dandelions and clover, for example, are broadleaf weeds, and crabgrass and sedge are grassy lawn weeds. A weed killer that may kill broadleaf ground-cover might be ineffective on crabgrass. For the average lawn gardener, it’s helpful to determine which category of weeds are growing in your lawn so you’ll know the complexity of their root structures and how best to kill them.</p>
<p>Selectivity has the potential of weakening a weed killer (though it will save your grass), and as we were trying to determine which weed killer was the best overall, we tested both selective and non-selective weed killers.</p>
<h3>Concentrate vs. ready-to-use</h3>
<p>We tested concentrates that need to be diluted alongside ready-to-use products. Concentrates should be mixed in a separate application bottle, and, if instructions call for it, a surfactant like dish soap can be added. Many people with large yards use concentrates for making bulk quantities of solution, which is more cost effective than buying many bottles of pre-mixed weed killer. Ready-to-use products are equipped with their own nozzles and sprayer mechanisms, which we found helpful for small yards.</p>
<p>Whether you use concentrate or ready-to-use is entirely your preference (we didn’t notice any effectiveness trends), but carefully note the safety equipment and storage needs for handling concentrated products. The cost savings may not be worth the hassle and risk.</p>
<h3>Application nozzle (if applicable)</h3>
<p>For ready-to-use weed killers with an applicator, consider the type of spray you’ll be getting from the nozzle. Some have a concentrated spray for targeting specific plants and their roots. Other nozzles cover a wider area, oftentimes like a mist.</p>
<h3>Coverage (land area)</h3>
<p>Whether the weed killer is in concentrate or ready-to-use form, the amount of its land coverage per container could vastly differ. As a general rule, concentrates are higher-priced but are best for large plots of land. Ready-to-use varieties, which have already been diluted, are better for small yards.</p>
<h2 id="how-tested">How we tested</h2>

    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/best-weed-killer-natural-armor-spray.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Over the course of a week, we tested nine different post-emergent weed killers, five conventional and four natural or organic, in a backyard on broadleaf and grassy weeds. We applied the weed killers on a sunny day when there was no rain in the forecast for at least 48 hours. During preparation, application and observation of the weed killers, these are the main factors we considered:</p>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/best-weed-killer-compare-n-save-mix.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>To prepare, we read each booklet of weed killer instructions thoroughly, and noted how clear they were. If we were left with any questions or had to do supplemental research, we counted this against the products.</p>
<p>We also factored in prep time from opening the package to lawn application, as well as whether we needed special equipment to prep the weed killer. Our ready-to-use weed killers needed no preparation before use, while preparing concentrates required funnels, careful measurement and thorough mixing. Handling concentrates also required extra protective equipment like gloves in some cases..</p>
<h3>Application</h3>
<p>During application of each weed killer, we took notes on how difficult it was to apply the recommended amount of weed killer to plants, and how difficult it was to control or change the field of coverage.</p>
<h3>Safety</h3>
<p>Use of herbicides on an industrial scale requires training, so it’s equally important to take proper precautions when using them in your backyard.</p>
<p>During testing, we noted which chemicals would be harmful to ingest or touch, especially in households with pets and small children who play in the yard, and checked how long we needed to wait before our yards became safe again. Each weed killer we tested had labels for application, storage and mixing, which we heeded and considered as part of our decision-making process.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>We tested 18 equal sections (four square feet each) of lawn area, two for each weed killer. The majority of weeds in each section were dandelions, broadleaf dock, crabgrass and bluegrass. We sprayed each type of weed killer over one section and left all nine sections alone for four hours. If using a concentrate, we mixed it according to directions and applied it with a direct-spray nozzle to spread the mixture.</p>
<p>After four hours, we returned and recorded our initial visual results. Our primary indicators of effectiveness were: browning, wilting, and yellowing. After 24 hours, we again recorded visual results, and using lawn gloves, brushed away any plants that had been visibly affected by the spray. Here we looked for whether weeds were breaking upon contact, and whether the roots had loosened at all.</p>
<p>We visited twice a day thereafter for a week, which was the maximum time period for the weed killers we selected; if they hadn’t worked by then, we marked it a failure.</p>
<p>Consumer reviews reported that sometimes a product worked well for one user and not for another, or the product had inconsistent results. We decided to test two squares at a time for each product, and with one exception, our results were the same across both testing patches.</p>
<p>As we tested, it became clear that if there were no visible results after two days, the weed killer was unlikely to work at all. There were three main tiers of performance: the weed killer worked completely by killing 100% of the weeds, worked a very small amount or didn’t work at all. When it came to eliminating weeds with herbicides, the process was frequently all or nothing.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>A key factor in our selection of best weed killer was price. We bought different quantities of each product for testing, and because some were concentrated and some ready-to-use, we wanted to know how much land, theoretically, each bottle of weed killer could cover for its cost.</p>
<p>We calculated cost per ready-to-use gallon, which equates to just under 1000-square-feet of yard coverage. Our most economical option was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001H1JING/?tag=ybdwdkill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Roundup concentrate</a>, at roughly 80 cents per gallon of mixed weed killer, closely followed by Compare-N-Save at $1.01 per gallon.</p>

<p>Of the weed killers we tested, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ARKS3XO/?tag=ybdwdkill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Compare-N-Save &#8211; Conventrate Weed &amp; Grass Killer</a> was the fastest-acting and most effective at loosening roots and wilting plants, and it was also the most cost effective.</p>
<p>Compare-N-Save’s clear drawback is that it contains a high level of glyphosate — 41% — that could be hazardous to small children and pets. It’s one of the most reviewed weed-killing products on Amazon, and during our testing, we understood why: it worked, and the small 16-ounce container yields an impressive 10 gallons of spray. At just over $1 per gallon, Compare-N-Save is also a cost-effective option.</p>
<p>We saw results after four hours: All the plants in the squares had begun to brown and wilt. By the end of the first 24 hours, every plant appeared completely dead, and many were removed without needing to loosen the soil first. By the end of the second day, we easily pulled out any remaining weeds and even managed to remove a few by simply brushing them away. As we expected from a non-selective weed killer, the grass underneath the weeds was also dead.</p>

You’ll want to use this product if your goal is a clean slate of a lawn to replant and re-landscape entirely.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ARKS3XO/?tag=ybdwdkill-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Other weed killers we tested that claimed to eradicate all weeds killed crabgrass but not dandelions, or vice versa. Compare-N-Save lived up to its claim of killing all weeds entirely, and no other product was as pervasive as the Compare-N-Save.</p>
<p>Other weed killers we tested left behind stubborn leaves or roots, but Compare-N-Save was truly nonselective and killed both weed and grass. If you have a large lawn with lots of different weeds to cover all at once, this is a great choice.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compare-N-Save &#8211; Weed &amp; Grass Killer is effective at drying up both top leaves and roots.</li>
<li>High glyphosate concentrate necessitates careful use.</li>
<li>This product will kill lawn grass as well as weeds.</li>
<li>Out of all the products we tested, this was the fastest and most consistent.</li>

<p>We had doubts about natural weed killers, since our research indicated they weren’t as effective as popular glyphosate-based products. However, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HLVFQW7/?tag=ybdwdkill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Natural Armor &#8211; All-Natural Weed &amp; Grass Killer</a> surprised us by performing comparably with our top pick.</p>
<p>Vinegar is Natural Armor’s active ingredient, and it did the job. Four hours after application, weeds were browned and wilted, and by the next day, their leaves were coming up easily in our hands. By week’s end, we could fully remove the plants and roots, albeit with a bit of effort.</p>
<p>Natural Armor was also easy to use. It’s packaged in a ready-to-use bottle and direct spray nozzle, so we were able to apply it with minimal preparation. The nozzle’s position allowed us to spray directly on top of the weeds and the base of their roots every time.</p>

It’s a safer alternative to leading herbicidal brands and just as effective. Natural Armor can kill your weeds within a week and protect the environment at the same time.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HLVFQW7/?tag=ybdwdkill-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Perhaps the only downside of Natural Armor is its price point. We purchased a 16-ounce bottle for $12.95. For one gallon of ready-to-use spray we’d pay $29.95, a significant amount more per gallon than our leading conventional weed killers.</p>
<p>If you’re environmentally conscious and don’t mind spending a little extra money, Natural Armor is the best natural weed killer that performs just as well as the leading conventional weed killer.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>While Natural Armor took a week to fully kill every weed, we were able to retain our green grass underneath the weeds.</li>
<li>If you have a larger lawn, you’ll find this product a bit pricier than a conventional weed killer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Roundup &#8211; Extended Control Weed and Grass Killer</h3>
<p>Despite RoundUp’s recent bad press, its name is synonymous with weed killer, so we decided to test <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000R0WXI0/?tag=ybdwdkill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RoundUp &#8211; Extended Control Weed and Grass Killer</a>, a concentrate option that does away with a sprayer that many users find ineffective.</p>
<p>In terms of prep, it wasn’t easy working with this concentrate. The bottle isn’t well-designed for pouring, and it got messy — as did the other concentrates. We were glad to be wearing safety gear.</p>
<p>On the plus side, RoundUp’s initial performance was great. It killed all the weeds in the area where it was sprayed and left most of the grass dead as well. If you want to preserve your lawn, RoundUp isn’t for you, but overall it’s excellent for clearing large areas quickly. The dead weeds required minimal effort to manually pull them in just two days after the application.</p>
<p>The results didn’t last the whole week, however; we noticed new weed sprouts toward the sixth day. That failing, and RoundUp’s increasing notoriety, set this weed killer back in our rankings.</p>
<h3>Southern Ag &#8211; 2,4-D Amine Weed Killer</h3>
<p>Consumer reviews for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0072289CA/?tag=ybdwdkill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Southern Ag &#8211; 2,4-D Amine Weed Killer</a> are adamant about its superiority. The <a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/24Dgen.html#whatis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2,4-D acid amine</a> is a strong selective herbicide that is more heavily regulated than glyphosate; it may also have <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/02/agent-orange-in-your-backyard-the-harmful-pesticide-2-4-d/253506/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more dangerous byproducts </a>than glyphosate weed killers.</p>
<p>Southern Ag isn’t available in every region of the country, so if you attempt to purchase it on Amazon, you’ll be notified whether or not it can be shipped to your area, as distribution regulations for Southern Ag vary state to state. We were able to purchase Southern Ag, and although it’s more expensive than our top pick, Compare-N-Save, its performance was comparable.</p>
<p>We followed instructions and mixed this concentrate with water and three tablespoons of dish soap as a surfactant. None of the instructions for the other concentrates explicitly recommended adding dish soap, so we decided to use the solution on only one of the two areas dedicated to testing Southern Ag.</p>
<p>Twenty-four hours later, it was clear just by sight that the dish-soap additive worked. By the end of the week, the square with surfactant was 100% clear of weeds and grass, while the square without surfactant was 75% clear.</p>
<p>Considering its strength, potential danger and potential unavailability, Southern Ag isn’t for everyone. But if you have a large variety of stubborn, mixed weeds, you might consider Southern Ag as a viable option.</p>
<h3>Spectracide &#8211; Weed Stop for Lawns Plus Crabgrass</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001OENXRI/?tag=ybdwdkill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spectracide &#8211; Weed Stop for Lawns Plus Crabgrass</a> was the only herbicidal weed killer we tested that came pre-mixed and ready-to-use with its own spray attachment.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, Spectracide worked well on both dandelions and crabgrass, but it was less effective with other grassy and broadleaf weeds. Forty-eight hours after application we saw dramatic wilting and browning of the dandelions and crabgrass.</p>
<p>After a full week, other grassy and broadleaf weeds had begun to brown and wilt. Although we applied the recommended amount, we surmised that to kill them completely, we would need to spray another application. On the plus side, Spectracide did not affect our grass.</p>
<p>If you have a large yard you want to spray, at about $40 per gallon, Spectracide could get expensive. But if you have a small yard with primarily dandelions and crabgrass, we think Spectracide is worth it.</p>
<h3>Ortho &#8211; Weed B Gon</h3>
<p>As some Amazon reviewers noted, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MKB69IE/?tag=ybdwdkill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ortho &#8211; Weed B Gon</a> gave us varying results, despite having followed the same procedure on two sections of lawn.</p>
<p>Twenty-four hours after application, weeds were flourishing and the grass was still green. After 48 hours, weeds in one section wilted, and after 72 hours, weeds in the second section had wilted. By the end of the week, some broadleaf weeds in both sections had shriveled and died, grass in one section was discolored, dandelions were beginning to bounce back to life.</p>
<p>Some people claim they’ve had success with Ortho Weed B Gon when they’ve used it in conjunction with other treatments, fertilization and in-soil weed control. Overall, though, we weren’t impressed by Ortho &#8211; Weed B Gon’s performance to recommend it.</p>
<h3>Avenger &#8211; Organic Weed Killer Concentrate</h3>
<p>Since there are so few natural weed killers on the market, we gave <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001CJ1ADE/?tag=ybdwdkill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Avenger &#8211; Organic Weed Killer Concentrate </a>a shot. Although Avenger has some devoted users, its performance was poor. After application we saw little change in the weeds for the entire week of testing; one or two had wilted and browned, but the rest were still green and thriving.</p>
<p>If we were weeding a flower bed or other delicate plants that would be harmed by stronger weed killers, we’d consider using Avenger again. However, we’d recommend mixing the concentrate slightly stronger than recommended and dousing each weed one-by-one. As part of regular lawn care, other products in this category win out.</p>
<h3>Green Gobbler &#8211; 20% Vinegar Weed Killer</h3>
<p>Although <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GSGFBRN/?tag=ybdwdkill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Green Gobbler &#8211; 20% Vinegar Weed Killer</a> is as pungent as the chemical weed killers, it’s safe to children and pets 24 hours after application.</p>
<p>Green Gobbler is ready to use and comes with a hose and spray applicator. Application was smooth and mess-free, and after only four hours, all the weeds in had turned brown and, in some cases, white. After five days, we could pry the dead weeds from the soil with minimal effort.</p>
<p>Dandelions were a challenge for Green Gobbler, and although it’s a good product, it wasn’t as effective as Natural Armor.</p>
<h3>Doctor Kirchner &#8211; Natural Weed Killer</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075RQCNWZ/?tag=ybdwdkill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Doctor Kirchner &#8211; Natural Weed Killer</a> is securely packaged with recyclable materials, and a note is included that thanks the user for committing to environmental friendliness. It’s a nice, personal touch, but unfortunately, Doctor Kirchner was only moderately effective. Half the surface area we sprayed showed no visible signs of application. Though it killed both broadleaf and grassy weeds, results were spotty and inconsistent.</p>
<p>Doctor Kirchner could be used sparingly in flower beds and around other delicate plants, where you have the patience and need for multiple, careful applications.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>During our testing, we looked for a weed killer that effectively killed a variety of broadleaf and grassy weeds and was easy to use.</p>
<p>Our top pick, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ARKS3XO/?tag=ybdwdkill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Compare N Save &#8211; Concentrate Weed &amp; Grass Killer</a>, was undoubtedly the most powerful weed killer we tested, relatively easy to use, readily available and affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HLVFQW7/?tag=ybdwdkill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Natural Armor &#8211; All-Natural Weed &amp; Grass Killer</a> is our choice for the best natural weed killer. Natural Armor performed almost as well as Compare N Save for a price that completely justifies the extra security of environmental friendliness and safety.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter six weeks of washing cars, watering plants, hosing off toys and performing other backyard chores with five contenders, we think the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FJF8P8//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Suncast &#8211; Swivel Hose Hideaway</a> is the best hose reel. This &#8220;hose hideaway&#8221; not only keeps your hose out of sight, it also makes coiling and using your hose much easier than any other affordable reel we could find. For a more heavy-duty reel that will survive longer but doesn&#8217;t have as many features, the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00080FGME//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Liberty &#8211; 703-1</a> is hard to beat.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Research for this category was tricky, since there are so many different models and styles available, and since the flaws that kill a hose reel depend mostly on how much abuse you&#8217;re putting it through.</p>
<p>As always, we scanned the retailer pages for ratings and user reviews and found that most people were fairly forgiving of garden hose reel design; so long as a reel works and doesn&#8217;t break right away, most people are happy with what they get.</p>
<p>In the end, we tried three reels made of plastic and two made from steel. We splurged a bit on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00261PYMA//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eley &#8211; Rapid Reel</a>, if only to see how much better a really expensive model is.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVVDasQuyeU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Powerwind</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jh7iGsdrYI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aquawind</a> features on other Suncaster models looked like features that would make the reel too much of a pain to set up and use for the little benefit offered, so we skipped them.</p>
<p>We also checked into designs that are basically <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0742M8X6N?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">air hose reels</a>. They&#8217;re retractable and durable, but you&#8217;ll see <a href="https://terrylove.com/forums/index.php?threads/air-hose-reel-used-as-garden-hose-reel.20407/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a dramatic reduction in flow</a> with the tiny-diameter hoses they come with. We decided to only look at reels that will work with the hose you already have.</p>
<p>A big, heavy-duty garden hose cart with wheels sounds like a great idea, but the affordable products we found have terrible reviews. Reviews of the four-wheel carts we looked at had reports of nightmarishly difficult assembly and raised big questions about long-term durability. We bought two plastic two-wheeled carts because they’re cheap and popular; the metal two-wheel designs all seem to have stability issues and even those cost a lot more money than we expected.</p>

[table id=120 /]
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>For a month of spring yard work, we used these hose reels with 50 feet of <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-garden-hose/" rel="noopener">our favorite Craftsman rubber hose</a> and two 100-foot lengths of <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/WaterWorks-5-8-in-Dia-x-100-ft-Commercial-Duty-Garden-Hose-WWMFT58100/203895464" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the cheapest, stiffest hose we could find</a>.</p>
<p>Setting up each hose reel required slightly different steps, but only the most expensive hose reel actually required any setup work: The Eley came as a box of parts and fasteners. (They were very nice fasteners, though, and the custom-made giant Allen wrench is well made.)</p>
<p>We then moved through a series of specific tests to pinpoint any strengths or flaws in the designs of these reels.</p>
<h3>Build quality</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-12105 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup.jpg" alt="Close-up of hose fitting" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
We ranked the reels based on how we felt about the materials and design after testing. All the plastic reels scored a three here; we didn&#8217;t note anything that made a particular reel feel sub-standard. The Eley, naturally, scored a perfect five — it&#8217;s practically a showpiece for careful manufacturing with good materials.</p>
<h3>Coiling and uncoiling at capacity</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hose-reel-clip.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The way a reel coils and pays out hose is really the most important thing about it and we were surprised at the way our most expensive reel, the Eley, bunched up and overlapped the hose as we used it.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Smart Trak system on the Suncaster &#8211; Swivel Hose Hideaway won us over immediately with fast, even, tight coiling. It&#8217;s not perfect; if you feed a tight kink into the guide it&#8217;ll probably mess up your winding job. That said, if you lay out your hose so it has room to untwist, even a stiff vinyl hose will wind very easily.</p>
<p>We tested the capacity of the reels with the same hose to see how they compare to each other: the manufacturers rate their reel capacity based on some unknown ⅝&#8221; hose and they don&#8217;t specify how picky they were about neat winding.</p>
<h3>Leak tests</h3>

The cheap hoses we tested with only had basic gaskets and we tightened by hand.</p>
<p>The Liberty and Ames reels were the only ones that dripped. The Liberty stopped dripping after we gave the inlet fittings (where the included leader hose connects) some more torque by hand.</p>
<p>The Ames &#8211; Fold &amp; Store was leaking at the elbow-shaped outlet fitting where your <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-garden-hose/">garden hose</a> attaches to the reel and because of the side-pressure our stiff hose put on it, the Ames never stopped leaking while the hose was coiled.</p>
<h2 id="best-for-long">Top pick: Suncast &#8211; Swivel Hose Hideaway</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-12113 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/suncast-cplssm200b.jpg" alt="Suncast product rotated on swivel base" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/suncast-cplssm200b.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/suncast-cplssm200b-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/suncast-cplssm200b-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/suncast-cplssm200b-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/suncast-cplssm200b-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/suncast-cplssm200b-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/suncast-cplssm200b-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/suncast-cplssm200b-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/suncast-cplssm200b-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/suncast-cplssm200b-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/suncast-cplssm200b-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/suncast-cplssm200b-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FJF8P8//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Suncast &#8211; CPLSSM200B Swivel Hose Hideway</a> is, all things considered, just a plastic garden hose reel. This model has a limited lifespan and reviews indicate the plastic hose fitting on the side won&#8217;t survive abuse. It&#8217;s not going to spontaneously fall apart but manage your expectations.</p>
<p>Keeping that in mind, this is an amazing reel for long hoses. We picked this model because it has a built-in winding guide (called a &#8220;level-winder unit&#8221; in industrial spooling applications for rope or cable) that keeps the hose evenly distributed so it doesn&#8217;t bunch or overlap on the reel.</p>
<p>We used two of the cheapest, stiffest 100-foot-long hoses we could find and this reel wrapped up 240 feet without any need to rewrap or correct any overlaps on the spool that could cause binding.</p>
<p>The swiveling base of this hose reel is another great feature when you&#8217;ve got a super-long hose that you&#8217;re dragging all over the yard. The swivel means the hose can roll or unroll easily no matter what side of your lawn you go to, even if you stake down the base.</p>
<p>Note that no stakes came with ours, thought the parts list says they should be included. We really do recommend staking down a reel with an extra-long hose. If you don&#8217;t, this box is light enough to drag across the grass or concrete when you&#8217;re struggling with a long hose.</p>

<p>Suncaster has a version of this reel with <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Suncast-225-ft-Smart-Trak-Wicker-Hideaway-Hose-Reel-with-Brass-In-Out-Tube-CPLSMW212/206093654" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">upgraded brass fittings</a> (though without the swiveling base) that we considered, but on the whole, the parts upgraded (internal tubes and threads) don&#8217;t seem to be the first to wear out. It&#8217;s the retaining clips that keep the inlet assembly together that give up first if you put a strain on the inlet hose, so we wish they would reinforce that part instead.</p>
<p>The biggest beef we have with this design is that the inlet hose fitting doesn&#8217;t have a spinning coupler: attach the hose to the reel side before you attach to your supply, or you&#8217;ll find yourself trying to figure out how to spin the entire box around to get the hose screwed in.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Suncast &#8211; Swivel Hose Hideaway easily wraps even 200-foot-long hoses in a neat, even spool.</li>
<li>This model effectively turns a giant pile of hose into an innocuous piece of yard furniture.</li>
<li>The swiveling base makes using and coiling a long hose that much easier.</li>
<li>You can usually find this for less than $70, so it&#8217;s a bargain for its size and features.</li>
<li>Long-term durability concerns are our only real pause.</li>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00080FGME//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> 703-1 is an entry-level steel reel from Liberty</a> and it represents a great value for someone who&#8217;s tired of plastic garden tools.</p>
<p>Compared to the plastic reels, this is a bit heavier and inspires a lot more confidence. It isn&#8217;t that attractive — the beige powder-coating is fine, but the mixed zinc-plated and cast-brass fittings on the side are kind of hideous. You could mount this on your wall, but if that&#8217;s your plan you should know that Liberty makes more <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GUJT7CC/?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">decorative options</a> that aren&#8217;t available in a freestanding style.</p>

<p>Compared to the Eley (which will set you back $100 more) this isn&#8217;t as nice, but the parallel side flanges on this reel caused fewer problems when winding. It&#8217;s also balanced lower to the ground, so it&#8217;s less likely to tip over if you yank hard on the hose.</p>
<p>The fittings all appear to be off-the-shelf plumbing parts, which means long-term maintenance should be simple. Everything about this reel is a noticeable step down in look and feel from the Eley, but functionally it&#8217;s a better reel.</p>
<p>If you want metal construction and a level-winder guide like our top pick, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N4R6LZH?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Liberty sells one, model 707</a>, but it&#8217;s wall-mount-only and a lot more expensive.</p>
<p>This 703-1 reel is wide and sturdy and only minimal assembly was required. (A couple of wrenches are required for the lock-nuts on the handle.) It leaked around the inlet when we first assembled it, but after we tightened the fitting a bit more it never so much as dripped.</p>
<p>The most frustrating thing about this reel is pushing the rubber feet through the holes in the base; you&#8217;ll almost certainly need pliers to get them through. There are four cheap lawn stakes included if you want to keep this on grass instead of concrete.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Liberty &#8211; 703-1 is well-built but still affordable.</li>
<li>Steel components with a powder-coat finish should survive decades of gardening.</li>
<li>Can be wall-mounted or free-standing.</li>
<li>Capacity for almost 200 feet of hose.</li>
<li>Doesn&#8217;t help you wind neatly, but doesn&#8217;t get in the way.</li>

Also from Suncast, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00023BHRA//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hosemobile</a> is a clever little hose cart that fits in any budget, but doesn&#8217;t disappoint when you use it.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00023BHRA//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Suncast-Hosemobile-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Suncast-Hosemobile-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Suncast-Hosemobile-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Suncast-Hosemobile-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Suncast-Hosemobile-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Suncast-Hosemobile-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Suncast-Hosemobile-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Suncast-Hosemobile-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Suncast-Hosemobile.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Budget Pick: Suncast - Hosemobile</h3><p>This is a cheap reel that may not outlive a good hose, but it's portable and you could buy a few of them for the price of a steel reel.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00023BHRA//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Compared with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FL1KBC/?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ames &#8211; Fold &amp; Store</a>, it&#8217;s actually pretty shocking how much better this is. The fixes are little things, like the angle of the outlet fitting where your hose connects: it&#8217;s made from the same cheap plastic, but the angle Suncast chose means it doesn&#8217;t force your hose sideways and cause leaks the way the Ames does.</p>
<p>This wheeled design doesn&#8217;t fold up and won&#8217;t take much abuse, but since the reel is only big enough for a smaller hose capacity, you&#8217;re not likely to overload the plastic construction. You could probably load 175 feet of hose if you carefully guide it into an even wrap, but 100-150 feet is a more realistic length if you&#8217;re just spooling quickly.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no guide here to help your hose wrap evenly, but the slot in the handle does have two notches that effectively lock a 5/8&#8243; hose in place. That and other little design touches, like the foot-pedal that sticks out to help you stabilize the reel, help make up for the materials.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Suncast &#8211; Hosemobile was the cheapest hose reel we tested, but it&#8217;s far from the worst.</li>
<li>This isn&#8217;t going to hold a really long and heavy hose, but 150 feet is more than enough for most of us.</li>
<li>The wheels and light weight make it easy to move your coil of hose from the backyard to the front.</li>

We bought the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00261PYMA//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eley &#8211; Rapid Reel </a>to see just how much better a hose reel can get if you throw money at the problem. The answer kind of surprised us: this is the nicest hose reel, but it actually doesn&#8217;t do its job as well as the less expensive models we tested.</p>
<p>As expected, the components included are all impressive. Even the purpose-built two-size allen wrench included for assembly is impressive: heavy-duty and with a nice finish. The cast-brass fittings on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0056IVTVU/?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the leader hose are gorgeous</a> and easy to grip without tools, a nice upgrade over other cheap pack-in hoses.</p>
<p>The fact that there&#8217;s an adjustable reel brake is a testament to the thought that goes into these reels. Likewise, the loop of webbing that secures the hose to the reel is a nice touch. Neither of those features is really necessary, though.</p>
<p>This reel will undoubtedly survive more weather (and abuse) than a cheap plastic reel, but an extra hundred dollars doesn&#8217;t solve all the problems in the world of garden hose reels. The sloping flanges on either side push the hose toward the center as it winds; if you aren&#8217;t careful when quickly winding a long hose it might start to overlap itself.</p>
<p>We squeezed on 215 feet of hose and the reel still turned freely, but even at 150 feet, the overlapping problem is frustrating. Eley rates this model for 175 feet of standard ⅝&#8221; hose, but we wouldn&#8217;t recommend it as-sold for much more than 125 feet.</p>
<p>Eley sells an <a href="https://www.eleyhosereels.com/products/extra-capacity-kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extra-capacity kit</a> to make the reel wider for long hoses and that would make the overlapping and bunching less problematic, but that brings the total cost for your stationary hose reel north of $200. On the bright side, installing the kit gives you an excuse to use that really nice allen wrench again!</p>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FL1KBC//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ames &#8211; Fold &amp; Store</a> hose cart checks a lot of boxes on the feature list: it folds for storage, it has wheels to make dragging it around easier, it has a storage bin in the bottom and the slot in the handle even works as a built-in winding guide.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that great in person, though. We&#8217;re not going to fault a plastic hose reel for being made from plastic, but the way the outlet fitting sits on the reel means there&#8217;s a lot of strain on it if you use a stiff hose. One of our cheap hoses has a kink-preventing strain relief sleeve that makes the end five inches very stiff; the sideways force against the fitting on this reel make it leak pretty severely.</p>
<p>Cutting off the strain-relief sleeve made our hose fit better, though it still leaked. Some thread-sealing tape or an extra gasket could probably take care of all the leaking, but you shouldn&#8217;t have to use extra tools to get a fit that doesn&#8217;t leak.</p>
<p>The way this reel sits in the frame, the side flanges don&#8217;t have any extra room to bend or expand out before they&#8217;ll start to rub as the reel turns. The flanges are bar-shaped rather than full circles (which does mean it takes up less space when folded), so when you get more than 100 feet of hose loaded they make a repeated &#8220;thwack, thwack, thwack&#8221; as you&#8217;re turning the handle.</p>
<p>The slot in the handle doesn&#8217;t actually do much to keep your hose tidy on the reel, either; mostly it just keeps your <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-garden-hose-nozzle/">garden hose nozzle</a> in place for storage.</p>

<p>If you want a reel that will survive decades of sun, rain and abuse, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00080FGME/?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Liberty 703-1</a> is well-built and affordable. It held almost 200 feet of bulky, stiff hose and it should be easy to repair or replace the metal fittings.</p>
<p>For those looking for something more portable, we liked the cheap and easy-to-find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00023BHRA/?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Suncast &#8211; Hosemobile</a>. It&#8217;s not going to survive the apocalypse, but if you&#8217;ve got a smaller roll of hose that you want to move from yard to yard this reel will do the job.</p>
<p>If we had to choose one best reel for all our hose needs, though, we&#8217;d take the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FJF8P8//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Suncast &#8211; CPLSSM200B</a> Swivel Hose Hideaway. The Smart Trak guide system does a great job of feeding the spool evenly and the swiveling base means you can move around the yard and pull your hose straight off the reel, never binding it against the side.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter two months of edging lawns, trimming grass and relentless weed destruction on a ten-acre orchard, we’ve picked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I5CZJ4W/?tag=ybdstrg-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; LST136W</a> as the best string trimmer for the average sized home lawn. Perfect for edging your lawn and even for cutting grass on uneven terrain, Black+Decker’s award-winning 13-inch trimmer is light and easy to use but still has plenty of power. For larger field jobs, we like the <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/300638783" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ego &#8211; Power+ 1502-SF</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>First, we looked at reviews and customer feedback for the top-selling trimmers on the market. We also covered the top-placing trimmers from publications like Consumer Reports and the Wirecutter.</p>
<p>We reviewed battery-powered trimmers, because, let’s face it, two-stroke gasoline engines are noisy, smelly and expensive. Gas trimmers earn a place on the trucks of professionals with top power and long run-times, but most homeowners will be happy with clean, quiet and simple battery power.</p>
<p>While we set out to test battery-powered trimmers, we also used some other tools alongside our test lineup for comparison. We included a gas-powered <a href="https://www.stihlusa.com/products/trimmers-and-brushcutters/professional-trimmers/fs70rce/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stihl &#8211; FS 70 R</a> in our tests to see how the electric trimmers compare to the industry-standard workhorse that’s already doing the heavy work for landscapers and ranchers. We also purchased and used a plug-in edge trimmer and trencher, the <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/BLACK-DECKER-Edge-Hog-7-5-in-11-Amp-2-in-1-Electric-Landscape-Edger-LE750/100052063" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; LE750</a>.</p>
<p>We picked a set of top-ranked trimmers in two size categories: trimmers with 15-inch cutting heads as well as compact 12-to-13-inch machines. We bought from brands with good reputations for warranty coverage that are available at major retailers. (In comparison, many commercial-grade brands like Stihl are only available through a dealer network.)</p>
<p>When selecting a trimmer from Ego, we picked the best-priced package at the time, the 1502-S. Ego&#8217;s model numbers are a composite of trimmer model, battery size and extra features. This kit includes a 2.5 AH battery and the 1500 trimmer with &#8220;split-shaft&#8221; folding for storage. <a href="https://lawnparadise.com/ego-weed-eater-56v-cordless-string-trimmer-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This review has a table</a> that explains the differences in kit accessories and features.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a new model that has replaced the -S, called the <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/300638783" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">-SF</a>, with a &#8220;rapid reload&#8221; head in addition to the split shaft. Everything else about the kit is the same, so we&#8217;ve updated links in this review to point to that kit instead.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs-a-trimmer">Who needs a string trimmer?</h2>
<p>While a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-lawn-mower/">lawn mower</a> is basically essential to the health of your lawn, string trimmers and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-leaf-blower/">leaf blowers</a> are a bit more of a luxury. You’re keeping your grass at the right length, what’s left to do?</p>
<p>String trimmers are great with grass and weeds in all of the locations where a mower can’t help. Does your lawn have a corner where your mower won’t fit? Mow it with a string trimmer. A patch of weeds sprouting behind your trash cans? The string trimmer will take care of those, too. Want a clean edge between your grass and driveway? A good string trimmer will make edging easy.</p>
<p>Unless you own a home in a desert or polar region where nothing grows, a string trimmer can probably make your yard work easier.</p>
<p>Because the string that’s doing the cutting is flexible, you can cut right up to a tree or planter or post and not worry about damaging anything. The string will only cut through soft fibrous material like green plants, barely leaving a mark on big trees, concrete or metal. You should still be careful not to hit young trees and flower beds, of course, but it’s much easier to safely get close than it is with a mower.</p>
<p>String trimmers are even more popular on acreages and farms where hillsides and rocky patches make mowing impossible. Even in dry climates where grass landscaping and mowers are scarce, string trimmers can take care of the weeds that pop up.</p>
<p>If you’ve got a lawn that your mower covers perfectly and you don’t mind pulling your weeds by hand, you might not need a string trimmer. If you’ve got a bigger yard, though, there are almost certainly areas a string trimmer can help.</p>
<h2 id="edge-trimming">How to edge-trim your lawn</h2>
<p>While a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-lawn-mower/">lawn mower</a> trims grass that stands up in the air, it won’t do anything about the grass that lies flat or bends over and spreads onto your walkway or driveway. A trimmer can cut those leaves in a precise line along the edge of your lawn.</p>
<p>Edging your lawn with a string trimmer is quick and easy. First, turn the trimmer so it cuts up and down instead of parallel to the ground. Most have a rotating shaft or a multi-position handle so you don’t have to contort your upper body while holding the trigger in this position.</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/edge-trimming.m4v" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Walk the trimmer head down the edge of the lawn. Many trimmers have some sort of guide or another indicator that helps you track where the cutting string will hit. The rapidly-spinning string will slice through any blades of grass that cross over onto your sidewalk and leave a clean edge. Typically the guide is set so that you dig a neat, narrow trench into the dirt along the edge; if you just want to cut the grass, you’ll have to lift the trimmer a few inches and hold it steady while you walk it along the line.</p>

It won’t mow in the corners like a string trimmer, but it will cut small trenches to run wires for backyard lighting projects.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I5CZJ4W/?tag=ybdstrg-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>Edgers like the <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/BLACK-DECKER-Edge-Hog-7-5-in-11-Amp-2-in-1-Electric-Landscape-Edger-LE750/100052063" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; LE750</a> are built for edging and trenching only. A tool like this uses a solid metal blade rather than a flexible string, and this has a few consequences. For one, the whole tool is far more intimidating, and it can’t cut weeds or mow the tricky spots around trees. The edger can do jobs like trenching that aren’t possible with a weed whacker, and the wheels and guides help you cut a very straight and even edge. Think of it as a circular saw for your sod.</p>

<p>Even for edging, we prefer string trimmers over dedicated edgers, because they’re easier to use on curved edges or uneven ground. It’s still tricky to follow a curve perfectly, but if you lose track with a string trimmer you won’t hear the terrifying sound of a metal blade scraping against concrete.</p>
<p>The best trimmers make it easy to switch between horizontal cutting and edging jobs, and our top pick, the Black+Decker, is no exception. You simply hold a button on the shaft and twist the cutting head to go from grass trimming to edging quickly and easily.</p>

<h3>Gasoline</h3>
<p>This is the type of string trimmer you’ve seen working beside roadways. Two-cycle gas engines have all the power you could ask for and can run six hours on a gallon of gasoline. They’re loud, though, and require extra maintenance. There’s also the trouble of mixing, storing and filling the oil-gasoline mix required by two-stroke engines.</p>
<p>We’re not trying to dissuade anyone who needs a gas trimmer from buying one: our test partners still rely on a few reliable and powerful gas trimmers that see all-day use and perform well. For an average-sized yard, though, gasoline is overkill.</p>
<h3>Plug-in electric</h3>
<p>We didn’t test any corded trimmers. They have a great price-power-weight ratio, but the cord is frustrating to work with. The specialized edger/trencher we tested is a plug-in model, and it has great power, but if you’re doing anything other than straight, slow lines close to your house the cord isn’t worth it.</p>
<h3>Battery-powered electric</h3>
<p>Cordless electric trimming is definitely the most pleasant experience of all. These trimmers are much quieter than a gasoline-powered trimmer, and you’re free to move quickly and efficiently around your yard.</p>
<p>The big downside to cordless electric is capacity: battery packs make a painful trade-off between power, run-time and weight. Lithium-based battery technology is getting better every year, so the current generation of tools is widely regarded as a worthwhile compromise if you’re doing small jobs.</p>
<p><a href="#how-we-tested" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Battery life</a> is up to around half an hour for most models, long enough to finish trimming around a house and small lawn without needing to stop for a charge.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Power</h3>
<p>In the world of cordless tools, manufacturers aren’t required to list specific power-draw specs on their tools the way they are with tools you plug into the wall. Makers do tell you about battery voltage, but that’s only half of the electrical story (volts x amps = watts).</p>
<p>Without a rating of the current drawn by the motor, we have to make guesses or extrapolations based on other numbers, like run-time and battery size. Gasoline engines do have a nominal watt power rating (since watts and horsepower are two different ways of measuring power, the rate work is done) and manufacturers like Stihl tell us what to expect from their engines.</p>
<p>We’ve made an estimate for the wattage used by each of the cordless tools. All of these numbers are for available power from the battery system and don’t take into account any waste from inefficiencies of the working machines. Our “cutting power” test scores give a better idea of what each machine can really do with that power.</p>
<h3>A balance between power and noise</h3>
<p>Many professionals rely on two-stroke gas trimmers for all-day landscaping work, and they might be the right tool for your job. That said, the noise of a two-stroke gasoline engine requires <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-ear-plugs/" rel="noopener">hearing protection</a> and will likely disturb your family or neighbors if you like to do yard work in the morning. Some electric trimmers make a bit more noise than others, but none of them come even close to the loudness of a two-stroke engine.</p>
<h3>Battery size</h3>
<p>Batteries are typically sold with a capacity listed in amp-hours, literally the number of hours the battery will be able to send one ampere of electrical current to the motor. As noted above, these tools don’t list how many amps they draw from a battery, so we’ve done the dirty work with real-world tests of working time.</p>
<h3>Cutting width and line size</h3>
<p>The advantages of cutting a wider swath are both efficiency and power. For example, the difference between 13 inches and 15 inches might not seem like a lot, but if you’ve got large weedy patches to attack, the extra cutting with each pass can definitely add up over time.</p>
<p>The bigger advantage to a wider swath is in cutting power. A longer string means that, for the same engine speed, the tip of the cutting line will be moving faster, moving at (for our example) 16,000 feet per minute instead of only 14,000.</p>
<p>The difference between a 13-inch cutting head and a 15-inch head is about 15 percent in both the cutting area and the speed of the string, but there’s more. When you add the fact that a bigger head can take a line that has a 0.080” diameter instead of the skinny 0.065” string in a typical smaller machine, the extra mass makes for yet another 23 percent increase in the force that goes into chopping weeds. (Some big trimmers can load 0.095” or 0.1” line for even more power, and 0.095” is a typical diameter for commercial work where tough weeds are expected.)</p>
<p>Extra force means more electricity is needed from a battery pack, so you’ll see diminishing returns if you’re more concerned about run time than cutting a wide swath through dense weeds.</p>
<p>We’re pretty sure that this is the flaw in Ryobi’s design with the <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/204589659" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">40220</a>: the motor just can’t draw enough current from a 40V battery to get the big 0.08” string going quickly enough. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I5CZJ4W/?tag=ybdstrg-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Our top pick from Black+Decker</a> uses 0.065” string, but the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TLMU9W2/?tag=ybdstrg-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">slightly newer LST540</a> seem to have problems with its heavier string just like the Ryobi.</p>
<p>If you’re even considering running the trimmer for more than one battery charge (about half an hour) in a day, the extra width and power of a bigger trimmer with high-voltage battery is probably worth it (and you might consider gas). If you’re mostly edging and you keep up with garden weeds so you never see half-inch stalks, then a 13-inch trimmer should do the job without extra weight or expense.</p>
<h3>String feed system</h3>
<p>There are a few ways to get more cutting line out when rocks, sticks and concrete wear down or break the string:</p>
<p><strong>Automatic feed:</strong> Popular on smaller trimmers, this feature is included on our top pick Black+Decker as well as the <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Greenworks-40V-String-Trimmer-with-2-Ah-Battery-1-Hour-Charger/47389624" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greenworks</a> trimmer.</p>
<p>This system tries to keep your line at just the right length by letting out a small amount (usually about ¼ inch) every time you stop and restart the trimmer. The line never gets too long, because a small blade chops off any excess line as it spins.</p>
<p>This is handy, but it can waste line if the mechanism is too generous, and can be frustrating to work with if the spool is stingy. (If you burn through a bunch of string cleaning up around a sharp-edged brick planter, for example.)</p>
<p>Some newer trimmers use a hybrid manual/automatic system that will pay out more line when you push a button while the trimmer is running, but this wasn’t available on the top-ranked trimmers we tested.<br />
<strong><br />
Manual feed:</strong> This feature lets you stop the machine, pick up the trimmer head and press a button to pull out more string. This takes time, but you can get very close to the maximum allowed length (determined by the length-trimming blade mounted on the guard) to reduce wasted line.</p>
<p>The trimmer from Greenworks is the only one we tested that has a manual-feed bypass for its automatic system.<br />
<strong><br />
Bump-feed: </strong>This lets you use a spring-loaded clutch system that will release more line when you “bump” the bottom of the trimmer head on the hard ground while it’s running. This is the system used on the 15-inch-width trimmers we tested, from <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/204589659" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ryobi</a> and <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/300638783" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ego</a>.</p>
<p>This takes some getting used to, but if you’re working around rocks, sticks and concrete that quickly wear out your trimmer line, it’s a very fast way to get back to the job. Most commercial-grade trimmers use a system like this.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed-line:</strong> This type of trimmer head is sometimes an option, but we didn’t pick any models with this style. Rather than a spool that feeds out line as it’s used up, a fixed-line head just holds one piece that starts out at exactly the right length and needs to be manually replaced when it wears down.</p>
<h3>A shoulder strap</h3>

<p>None of the models we tested came bundled with a strap, and we tested each of them without one, but if you’re going to be running a trimmer for more than ten minutes at a time you owe it to yourself to use a support system of some kind.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BQ7W86/?tag=ybdstrg-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/arnold-trimmer-strap-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/arnold-trimmer-strap-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/arnold-trimmer-strap-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/arnold-trimmer-strap-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/arnold-trimmer-strap-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/arnold-trimmer-strap-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/arnold-trimmer-strap-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/arnold-trimmer-strap-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/arnold-trimmer-strap.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Essential Accessory: Arnold - Universal Trimmer Strap</h3><p>The universal trimmer strap from Arnold is basic, but it’s a huge relief to shift the weight of the trimmer onto your core muscles.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BQ7W86/?tag=ybdstrg-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>Aftermarket straps are plentiful and cheap; we tested the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BQ7W86/?tag=ybdstrg-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Arnold Universal Trimmer Strap</a>. It works perfectly on all the models except our top pick: the bracket included with this strap won’t quite fasten around the thicker shaft on the Black+Decker tool. The strap itself can clip on various parts of the handle, though, and we didn’t have any problems using it; the Black+Decker is also a trimmer that’s light enough not to need a support strap as badly as the others do.</p>
<p>The shoulder strap attachment bracket should sit right at the balance point of the trimmer. After you adjust the length of the strap to get the trimmer at a perfect height, you can almost work one-handed.</p>
<p>There are more elaborate strap and harness systems available to help balance a heavy commercial trimmer. The trimmer will rub against your hip if you’re supporting it with a strap, so <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MAZK9ZG/?tag=ybdstrg-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the heavy-duty harnesses</a> include some kind of shield to fend off bruises and grass stains.</p>

<p>In addition to testing for lawn-duty use in the city, we sent this lineup of trimmers to an avocado orchard in southern California. The trimmers arrived at the ten-acre grove just in time to begin work cleaning up all the weeds that had sprung up after a fall fertilizer application. Our testers cut weeds ranging from mundane dandelions and crab grasses up to the imposing four-foot-tall horse thistles.</p>
<p>The orchard already uses a selection of gas-powered trimmers, mostly mid-size Stihl models like the <a href="https://www.stihlusa.com/products/trimmers-and-brushcutters/professional-trimmers/fs70rce/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FS 70 R</a>. We’ve included direct comparisons to the Stihl where it makes sense, but as context rather than as a purchase recommendation: we believe that most home users are going to be happier with a cordless electric trimmer.</p>

<h3>Weight</h3>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="#important-features" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our section on features</a>, none of these trimmers were supplied with a shoulder strap, but they really should be. We tested each model without a strap for a few weeks before ordering a generic strap from Amazon.</p>
<p>These trimmers are quite light compared to the gas-powered engines that professional landscapers are using for hours at a time, but that doesn’t mean they’re easy on your shoulders and back. If you’re only planning to do quick touch-up trimming, the Black+Decker &#8211; LST136W is not too bad without a shoulder strap; for any other purpose, get a strap.</p>
<h3>Cutting ability</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9155" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cutting-performance.png" alt="cutting performance data" width="1801" height="1250" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cutting-performance.png 1801w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cutting-performance-610x423.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cutting-performance-1500x1041.png 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cutting-performance-768x533.png 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cutting-performance-885x614.png 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cutting-performance-300x208.png 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cutting-performance-295x205.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cutting-performance-1000x694.png 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cutting-performance-360x250.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cutting-performance-375x260.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cutting-performance-414x287.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cutting-performance-320x222.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cutting-performance-768x533@2x.png 1536w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cutting-performance-300x208@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>This was one of the trickier values to test for. Each of these trimmers will cut grass easily, but the upper limit of cutting capacity is harder to define.</p>
<p>We measured the biggest weed stalks that could be cut cleanly by each trimmer. We tried to bog down the trimmers in extra-dense grasses. We even skirmished with some materials like saplings and vines that are just too tough to cut effectively with string trimmers.</p>
<p>The wattage rating here is a value derived from the nominal capacity and voltage of each battery system divided by how long the trimmers run before shutting off. Between batteries with the same capacity and voltage, a shorter run-time means more wattage is being pulled by the motor.</p>
<p>The chart above rates each tool on a scale of five based on how effectively it cut, but note that the smaller trimmers use thin line that disappears quickly if you’re cutting tough woody material.</p>
<p>There are a lot of similarities between trimmers of the same size, but each manufacturer has taken their own approach to finding a balance of power, battery life and weight.</p>
<p>The Ego trimmer has impressive power, ripping through all but the very toughest weeds. The other trimmers stopped cutting green leafy weeds when stalks got bigger than 0.45 inch, though the Ryobi trimmer often failed on anything bigger than 0.35 inch.</p>
<p>Gas trimmers probably have enough power to cut through very thick material, but the trimming line will usually start to wear away before you reach the limit of engine power.</p>
<h3>Line advance</h3>
<p>The different systems used to release more cutting string have their strengths and failings, but we ranked them here based on how easily and quickly we could get back to cutting at full speed after a rock or vine ate away at our trimmer string.</p>
<p>The automatic-feed systems are okay for general use, but for cutting in the field where string sometimes goes quickly, we preferred a system like the bump-feed that gives some control over how much line is fed out and when.</p>
<h3>Battery tests</h3>

<p>We timed how long each trimmer will run under the same conditions, with the motor running constantly and cutting in dense grass and weeds.</p>
<p>As you can see from the charts, run time tracks pretty closely with the size of battery and amount of power the trimmer puts into cutting. The more work the tool does spinning the trimmer line, the shorter the battery life.</p>
<p>We also timed how long it takes to recharge the batteries with the included chargers; this will be a more important detail for some buyers than others.</p>

<p>The most surprising result is the Ryobi system; the short run-time on a high-capacity battery means it&#8217;s pumping a lot of watts through its motor. The fact that this trimmer also suffered poor cutting performance suggests an inefficiency in the drive shaft system that allows changing to other tool types. (It’s certainly the noisiest trimmer, and more noise is never an indicator of an efficient electric drive system.)</p>
<p>As noted previously, we&#8217;re using a nominal advertised power rating for the Stihl 2-cycle engine (0.9 kilowatts) that seems accurate. It has far more power available than the battery systems, and every fill of the 11.5 oz tank will give you about 34 minutes of run-time.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I5CZJ4W/?tag=ybdstrg-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; LST136W</a> is a compact, lightweight but powerful trimmer that will be ideally suited to most home edging and trimming needs.</p>
<p>Weight is a big consideration here: we liked how easy it was to carry this trimmer around. The fact that it can be collapsed to a smaller size for storage is a great bonus. The other tools fold or come apart, but that makes for an unwieldy package.</p>
<p>None of the conveniences would be a worthwhile trade-off if this trimmer couldn’t keep up with the cutting tasks, but Black+Decker managed to hit a sweet spot for efficiency and power. The motor tackled thick, overgrown grass that bogged down even the big Ryobi trimmer, and it managed to cut heavy stalks (like the pictured fig-tree shoots) better, too.</p>

<p>If you’re dealing with household chores like trimming lawn edges and cutting weeds around flower beds, this trimmer does amazing work given how light it is.</p>

Perfect for city lawns and gardens, it also out-cuts some bigger models if you take it out to the back 40.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I5CZJ4W/?tag=ybdstrg-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>Even better, there’s an easy-to-use speed dial that will vary the amount of juice the motor is using: if you’re just trimming a bit of grass or light weeds, you can turn it down and get even longer runtime from the battery. We ran all our tests with the power cranked up to full and were still satisfied with the battery capacity, but it’s nice to know that you can go for longer if you’re not pushing the performance envelope.</p>
<p>There are definitely jobs that this trimmer is too small for, but the motor and battery aren’t really the limiting factor. If you’re working around sharp stones or tough plants like vines, then the 0.065-inch trimming line will disappear quickly.</p>
<p>With unexpected line breaks, and it was sometimes frustrating having to wait for the Black+Decker’s automatic feed system to pay out more line. We even bypassed it a few times by opening up the spool and unwinding a few turns manually after losing a big chunk of string. Bigger machines with 0.080-inch line won’t last too much longer when dealing with tough material, but they are designed to quickly feed out more line after it breaks.</p>
<p>Probably the biggest disappointment of this machine is the length of the shaft and the difficulty of attaching a standard shoulder strap bracket. If you’re much taller than six feet, you might be annoyed by how far you need to stretch your arms to reach the ground with the optimal cutting angle.</p>

<p>Adding a shoulder strap helps, since your arms aren’t carrying all the weight anymore. Since the shaft of this tool is too thick for a “universal” strap bracket, we had to improvise an attachment point; it’s not pretty, but it works. If you’re shorter in stature, the adjustable-length shaft is very easy to set at exactly the right length for good posture and easy work.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Black+Decker &#8211; LST136W is the lightest trimmer we tested, and collapses neatly for easy storage.</li>
<li>The weight savings don’t cost you much in terms of cutting power, and we were impressed with how capable this 13” trimmer is in the field.</li>
<li>33 minutes of working time is close to average, but there’s a handy power dial feature to save power when you’re only doing light cutting.</li>

<p>If you scoff at the term “lightweight” and are looking for a battery-powered trimmer to replace a gas model, <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/300638783" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ego’s Power+ ST1502-SF</a> is made to fit your needs.</p>
<p>With a higher-voltage “Power+” battery system that pumps up the wattage available to its motor, Ego’s trimmer also uses commercial-grade 0.095-inch line that will cut heavier material better than any of the other electric trimmers we tested.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/300638783" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ego-power-1502-sf-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ego-power-1502-sf-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ego-power-1502-sf-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ego-power-1502-sf-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ego-power-1502-sf-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ego-power-1502-sf-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ego-power-1502-sf-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ego-power-1502-sf-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ego-power-1502-sf.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>For Heavier Work: Ego - Power+ 1502-SF</h3><p>For overgrown grasses and big weeds: Ego’s 15-inch trimmer is quiet and powerful. Its commercial-grade line effectively cut through thick growth better than any of the other electrics we tested.</p><a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/300638783" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Home Depot</button></a></div></div>
<p>The available power comes at a price: with only 36 minutes of runtime despite the massive 2.5 amp-hour battery, this machine is just barely viable for big jobs on an acreage. (This trimmer runs at a higher voltage than the others, so the battery has more cells inside.) It’s heavy enough to make your shoulders and back sore the first couple of weeks you use it. That said, this is lighter than the Ryobi 15” trimmer or a gas-powered model, and a shoulder strap is a good idea anyhow.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the battery charger got the same treatment as the rest of the machine, with an integrated cooling fan and beefy power supply. The charger reliably refilled the 2.5 AH battery in less than 45 minutes. That’s impressive even compared to the Greenworks charging system, which only had to refill 2.0 AH and took an hour.</p>
<p>We don’t really have anything bad to say about the Ego trimmer, and it was far more powerful than the Ryobi’s competing model, but we found that for city lawn work it was a bit overkill.</p>
<p>You can definitely do most of the jobs this trimmer will do with the Black+Decker, and our top pick has a wire guide and rotating head for easy edging jobs. The Ego’s hand grip lets you hold the trimmer sideways to do edging, but it doesn’t feel like a purpose-built solution the way our top pick does.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Ego &#8211; Power+ 1502-SF has a 15-inch cutting head with commercial-grade cutting string and a 36-minute runtime.</li>
<li>Ego has dropped the gauntlet and puts gasoline-powered toolmakers on notice. There are still pros who don’t have the option of waiting for a battery to charge every half-hour, but for the rest of us, this is the best big trimmer to buy.</li>

<p>Greenworks has released <a href="http://www.walmart.com/ip/Greenworks-40V-String-Trimmer-with-2-Ah-Battery-1-Hour-Charger/47389624" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the 2101602 trimmer</a> as part of their G-MAX system, and while it doesn’t make top grade, it’s a very capable machine.</p>
<p>The biggest hindrance to this trimmer is weight and ergonomics. While the Black+Decker tool weighs in at a very slim 6.8 pounds, Greenworks only managed 7.8, with a smaller battery, and with a drop in cutting power.</p>
<p>The performance of this trimmer is acceptable for most situations: the line only reaches 12-inches diameter compared to the Black+Decker’s 13-inch, but Greenworks has two lines spinning at the same time, like the big 15-inch trimmers do.</p>
<p>We felt that they were on fairly equal footing in terms of cutting power if you dial back the Black+Decker control wheel to 85 percent power, which roughly matches any difference in runtime, too.</p>
<p>If you don’t think you’ll ever want to cut anything heavier than grass, the Greenworks will save you some money and charges a bit more quickly, but we really liked the option of bumping up the power just a little bit with Black+Decker’s system.</p>
<p>The one case where we’d recommend this trimmer over the Black+Decker is if you’re much taller than six feet. The Greenworks trimmer’s longer reach makes it a bit easier to find a balanced handle position, and mounting a “universal” shoulder strap isn’t as tricky.</p>

<p>The Ryobi line won top spot in <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/products/string-trimmer/ryobi-ry40220-290051/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Reports’ roundup</a>, and <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-string-trimmers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wirecutter</a> liked this one enough to give it runner-up pick.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/204589659" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ryobi &#8211; RY40220</a> trimmer gives you a ton of options. If the first thing you’re looking for is a tool system that will let you do hedge trimming, roto-tilling and leaf blowing with a single battery and motor module, then it might be worth considering.</p>
<p>Sadly, Ryobi’s lawn tools aren’t compatible with their cordless shop tools. Ryobi’s 40-volt system doesn’t offer nearly the same power as the <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/300638783" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ego 56 volt system</a>, either, nor is it significantly cheaper.</p>
<p>On the whole, this trimmer was pretty disappointing. It’s loud: not nearly as loud as a two-cycle gas engine, but far louder than any of the other electric trimmers we tested. It’s also heavy, about one pound shy of a gas-powered trimmer and two pounds more than the Ego (despite that bigger battery).</p>
<p>In thick, tall grass or against stout weeds, the Ryobi just didn’t seem to have enough power to keep up. The worst-case scenario for this particular tool seems to be thick grass: clumps of tall quackgrass that Black+Decker’s light-weight trimmer buzzed through easily seemed to be too much for Ryobi’s motor or drive system.</p>

<p>On vines and thick stalks like the fig saplings pictured above, the motor would slow down enough that the cutting string started wrapping instead of cutting, and we had to move much more slowly and more deliberately to cut weeds efficiently with this trimmer.</p>
<p>Those tough-cutting situations are not great for<em> any</em> weed whackers since tough stalks and vines will also start wearing and breaking your trimmer line. We’d prefer to use up the line more quickly, though, if it means we can get through occasional patches of heavy weeds without bogging down.</p>
<p>Ryobi’s bump-feed system works well, with slightly more consistent re-loading than Ego’s, so it’s not a total failure as a serious tool. Without more power to cut through tough spots, though, the refinement seems a bit of a waste.</p>
<p>Ryobi has also faced some criticism in customer reviews over the batteries they sell. <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Ryobi-40-Volt-Lithium-Ion-Cordless-Attachment-Capable-String-Trimmer-2-6-Ah-Battery-and-Charger-Included-RY40220/204589659#customer_reviews" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Some users</a> are <a href="http://disq.us/p/1lw2z39" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting</a> that their batteries won’t charge anymore after a few months. There are some unrealistic expectations in the Home Depot customer reviews: cordless lawn tools shouldn’t be expected to run for more than 30 working minutes. Failing to charge, though, is a serious problem.</p>
<p>We haven’t had any problems with our Ryobi battery yet, and we didn’t see the problem mentioned in the other major reviews, but we’ll update if ours kicks the bucket.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Trimming grass and weeds around your lawn is one more step in a mowing routine that can really make the difference between a lawn that’s merely cut and a lawn that looks carefully maintained.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We looked at top-rated blowers from publications like Consumer Reports, Popular Mechanics and GardeningProductsReview.com. We looked primarily at brands that are well-reviewed and easy to find and purchase. (Sorry, Stihl; a one-brand authorized dealer network might be a good place to buy tools for a landscaping company, but we like our internet comparison shopping.)</p>
<p>This lineup includes blowers with customer reviews that indicate more than just satisfactory performance and models regarded as quiet and efficient. We picked two models with vacuum and bagging options, both well-regarded for their capabilities there.</p>
<p>Gasoline-powered blowers have taken a real beating in the press this year, especially after <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/20/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/20blowerwe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a number of towns in New York</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/realestate/on-banning-on-leaf-blowers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Jersey</a> decided to ban them during the summer months when they’re mostly used to clean up grass clippings, not to collect leaves. There is even a lobby organization dedicated to eliminating gas-powered landscaping tools, especially blowers.</p>
<p>Hand-held gas blowers didn’t make this review since, aside from those noise and pollution complaints, they’re both expensive and require more maintenance than many homeowners will want to deal with.</p>
<p>We did include a bigger backpack-style gas-powered blower to see what the extra power can do (and how much noise it really makes), and we also had a giant 9 HP walk-behind blower on hand for comparison.</p>

<h2 id="blower-types">Blower types</h2>
<h3>Plug-in electric</h3>
<p>Most of the blowers we tested fall into this category. <strong>A cord does limit the distance you can move around your yard, but there’s a huge advantage: all the power you’re using is stored in the grid, so you don’t need to carry around a fuel tank or a heavy battery.</strong></p>
<p>Plug-in blowers are very good at providing just the right amount of power for backyard leaf-blowing, and many also give you the option of vacuuming and mulching leaves for bagging or composting. (There are gas-powered leaf vacuums, but they’re becoming less and less common.)</p>
<p>This style is a compromise between clean, quiet operation and available power. If we had to pick just one blower for an urban backyard, it would definitely be plug-in.</p>

<h3>Cordless, battery-powered electric</h3>
<p>Battery-powered tools have been evolving steadily since Black &amp; Decker created the first battery-powered drill using Nickel-Cadmium cells back in 1961. We’re now seeing widespread use of Lithium Ion cells, very similar to the battery in your laptop or cell phone, which don’t have nearly as many problems as older battery types.</p>
<p><strong>Battery power is very convenient for short bursts of moderate power, like daily sweeping on a small yard and a driveway</strong>. If you need to work for longer than 20 minutes, though, the long charge time makes this a poor choice. You can buy additional battery packs to work longer, but the cost of a battery is a significant part of the tool’s price.</p>
<h3>Gasoline</h3>
<p>If being tethered to an electrical outlet just isn’t an option, gasoline-powered blowers are another way to go.</p>
<p><strong>Professional landscapers use gas-powered blowers not only for freedom of movement, but also because gas motors put out far more power than a compact battery is capable of.</strong> We tested the Echo &#8211; PB-580T: a backpack-style blower with almost four times more working power than DeWalt’s 20V battery model.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VQO3JO8/?tag=ybdleaf-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/echo-pb-580t-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/echo-pb-580t-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/echo-pb-580t-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/echo-pb-580t-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/echo-pb-580t-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/echo-pb-580t-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/echo-pb-580t-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/echo-pb-580t-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/echo-pb-580t.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Power for Pros: Echo - PB-580T</h3><p>Echo’s two-stroke engines are powerful and reliable, and the backpack design makes it relatively easy to carry for long periods.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VQO3JO8/?tag=ybdleaf-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The downsides to a two-stroke gas engine are also readily apparent. You need to mix special oil into the gasoline (or buy pre-mixed fuel), and the difference in noise levels is huge.</p>
<p>We measured 95 dBA of sound pressure at the distance of an operator’s ear, which means you should <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-ear-plugs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use ear plugs</a> if you’re working with a blower like this for more tham <a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2016/02/08/noise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an hour per day</a>. It’s slightly less than a typical gas-powered chainsaw or <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-string-trimmer/">string trimmer</a>, though.</p>
<p>That said, It’s easy to see why gas-powered tools are still popular among professionals. If you keep fuel on hand in a small gas can, you can run your blower for six hours. We didn’t test a hand-held gas blower because the electric models were so highly rated, but gasoline still has a place on a property with lots of ground to cover.</p>

<p>This is a special category of leaf blower for people who need to clear a large area of pavement or concrete quickly. They’re mounted on wheels because they weigh about 150 pounds, but the amount of power on tap is pretty impressive.</p>
<p>Our test partners at the orchard use an older model of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0073W5TGI/?tag=ybdleaf-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Little Wonder Optimax blower</a> for clearing driveways. With a 270 CC Honda engine attached directly to a giant fan, it’s rated to push 2260 cfm of air — more than five times what our top electric blower puts out.</p>
<p><strong>That means you can clear a long driveway as quickly as you can push the blower, but it won’t do much for a big lawn with the on-road-only wheels.</strong> It also has a nasty habit of peeling up loose sod and destroying flower beds if you’re not careful where you point it. For clearing the driveway it works very well, unless you have a steep slope: these beasts are much easier to roll down a hill than they are to push back up.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-need-a-vacuum">Do you need a vacuum for mulching?</h2>

<p>There’s a bit of controversy surrounding leaves, mulching and bagging.</p>
<p>Leaves and grass clippings are organic material that grows from your lawn, so there’s no question that removing them is also removing nitrogen and other plant nutrients from your lawn’s natural life-cycle.</p>
<p>What’s more, curbside pickup of bagged leaves might not even be available in your area. Leaves have to be composted, rather than going to a landfill, and it takes even more energy to transport all the leaves to a city composting site than it does for you to bag them.</p>
<p>That said, if you’ve got trees dropping all their leaves on your lot in October, you’ve got to do something with them (and blowing them into the street doesn’t count). If you just let the leaves accumulate, they’ll block the sunlight that your grass needs to store energy for winter — or worse, the leaves can get soggy and musty.</p>
<p>Many experts <a href="https://www.scotts.com/en-ca/library/lawn-basics/dont-rake-those-leaves-mulch-them-your-lawn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advocate mulching organic material back into your lawn</a> with a mower that chops up leaves and spreads them as it cuts. (This is often called a “mulching mower,&#8221; but some people use that term to refer to a mower that collects mulch in a bag.)</p>
<p>Research like <a href="http://archive.lib.msu.edu/tic/mitgc/article/199866b.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this study from Michigan State University</a> definitely shows that mulching leaves back into the turf is good for your lawn. A <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-lawn-mower/">lawn mower</a> like our top pick from Honda will shred the leaves small enough that they filter down into your turf and nearly disappear.</p>
<p>Some homeowners strive to achieve the pristine green that you can only get by collecting leaves and clippings, and a blower with vacuum options is one tool that can help. <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/leaf-blowers/do-you-need-a-leaf-blower-vacuum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Reports has published this guide</a> that discusses strategies for using a leaf vacuum.</p>
<p>We definitely appreciated having the vacuum options on two of the blowers we tested, but we found them most useful for selective work. <strong>Collecting leaves around a pool or fountain, for example, is much easier when you can suck up the leaves instead of accidentally blowing them into the water.</strong></p>
<p>Mulching leaves is a valuable part of lawn management, but we can’t say that there’s a leaf vacuum on the market that will make bagging an entire lawn worth of leaves easy.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><em><strong>Cubic feet per minute</strong></em> is a measurement of overall volume of air the blower can move and should always be a relatively accurate measurement of overall power.</p>
<p><em><strong>Miles per hour</strong></em>, on the other hand, is a measurement of the speed of the air that’s coming out of a blower. The speed will change, though, depending on how much room the air has to move: a small opening will yield higher speeds with more blasting power, while a wide nozzle might be much better at moving a wide swath.</p>
<p>There’s no definitive standard for where or how to measure airspeed, so we’ve done <a href="#how-we-tested" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actual testing</a> with weighted test objects and common tasks to give you an idea of how the blowers put their power to work.</p>
<p><em><strong>Amps</strong></em> is a measurement of the amount of electricity that travels through a circuit each second. Corded electric tools will always tell you how many amps they pull, since you need to know that number in order to choose a big enough cord and avoid blowing your 15A circuit breakers.</p>
<p>Cordless tools, on the other hand, will rarely advertise how much energy they’re actually consuming, nearly always emphasizing the voltage and capacity (amp-hours or watt-hours) of the battery instead.</p>
<p><em><strong>Watts</strong></em> measure the total amount of energy used, and we can even include a rating for gasoline engines. These numbers are provided by the manufacturers, and they’re only measuring the amount of energy that’s used up rather than the amount of actual work done, but it’s a handy reference for the size and power of a machine.</p>
<p><em><strong>Mulch Ratio</strong></em> is how much space you’ll save if you mulch your leaves instead of raking them into a bag whole. Consumer Reports has found that the manufacturers’ listed ratios are exaggerated by four or five times, though, so we don’t put much stock in these numbers when picking machines. Toro lists “97% reduction to half-inch pieces,&#8221; while Worx claims an 18:1 reduction.</p>

<h3>Test 1: Force</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9273" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/force-testing-data.png" alt="force testing results chart" width="1801" height="1415" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/force-testing-data.png 1801w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/force-testing-data-610x479.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/force-testing-data-1500x1179.png 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/force-testing-data-768x603.png 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/force-testing-data-885x695.png 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/force-testing-data-300x236.png 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/force-testing-data-295x232.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/force-testing-data-1000x786.png 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/force-testing-data-360x283.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/force-testing-data-375x295.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/force-testing-data-414x325.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/force-testing-data-320x251.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/force-testing-data-768x603@2x.png 1536w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/force-testing-data-300x236@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>If you need to move debris and gravel or to lift damp leaves out of your grass, then this is the chart that’s going to be most important.</p>
<p>We used a small weighted box to see how much brute force each blower has when you give it a big surface to blow against. The chart lists the distance our two-pound weight was pushed beside the manufacturer’s rating for total blower output in cubic feet per minute.</p>
<h3>Test 2: Air speed</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9274" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/air-speed-testing.png" alt="air speed test results" width="1801" height="1415" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/air-speed-testing.png 1801w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/air-speed-testing-610x479.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/air-speed-testing-1500x1179.png 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/air-speed-testing-768x603.png 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/air-speed-testing-885x695.png 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/air-speed-testing-300x236.png 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/air-speed-testing-295x232.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/air-speed-testing-1000x786.png 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/air-speed-testing-360x283.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/air-speed-testing-375x295.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/air-speed-testing-414x325.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/air-speed-testing-320x251.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/air-speed-testing-768x603@2x.png 1536w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/air-speed-testing-300x236@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>If you’re primarily blowing loose leaves to clear a big area, then this is most important chart to look at.</p>
<p>We measured how far each blower could throw a plastic pouch full of leaves with a quick-moving airstream. The chart includes the manufacturer’s assessment of air speed in miles-per-hour. The test object weighed four ounces, and the results line up with performance we observed sweeping leaves in our field tests.</p>
<p>For example, we see that the outlet tip on the Toro blower makes the air go faster than the giant tube on Echo’s blower, so the Toro was able to keep up when blowing leaves around even though it doesn’t move as much air overall.</p>
<p>The Worx blower, on the other hand, is only slightly better than the tiny Greenworks blower despite the narrow nozzle. It just doesn’t move enough air to be effective at clearing large areas.</p>
<h3>Test 3: Noise levels</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9275" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/noise-level-test.png" alt="noise level test results" width="1801" height="1345" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/noise-level-test.png 1801w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/noise-level-test-610x456.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/noise-level-test-1500x1120.png 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/noise-level-test-768x574.png 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/noise-level-test-885x661.png 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/noise-level-test-300x224.png 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/noise-level-test-295x220.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/noise-level-test-1000x747.png 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/noise-level-test-360x269.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/noise-level-test-375x280.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/noise-level-test-414x309.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/noise-level-test-320x239.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/noise-level-test-768x574@2x.png 1536w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/noise-level-test-300x224@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We measured the noise levels of each blower with our calibrated sound pressure level meter setup in three positions: at ear height, from 50 feet away and from 50 feet with the variable-speed control (if the blower has one) turned all the way down. Measurements are A-weighted (as most industry regulations require) and averaged over 30 seconds using Room EQ Wizard to ensure consistency.</p>
<p>For reference, some ordinances prohibit sound levels as low as 50 dBA before 7 AM in residential communities. 65 dBA at 50 feet is a common daytime maximum, so be careful using any blower around sensitive neighbours. More and more towns are beginning to ban loud leaf blowers, even electric blowers, so find out about local ordinances. <a href="http://nonoise.org/lawlib/cities/cities.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nonoise.org</a> has a good collection of information from many American cities if you can&#8217;t find info on a local county or city website.</p>
<p>What about safety for you, the owner of the blower? Unless you’re blowing for more than a few hours every day, only the gas-powered blower is loud enough reach <a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2016/02/08/noise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noise exposure levels that cause damage</a>. Even the backpack blower isn’t as loud as a chainsaw or a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-string-trimmer/">weed wacker</a>, but if you’re using any blower for a full day at work you should definitely be wearing hearing protection such as <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-ear-plugs/">ear plugs</a>.</p>
<p>Regarding safety, note that because sound pressure is measured on a logarithmic scale, every 3dB change represents a doubling in sound intensity. So, in terms of the health of your ears, a 6dB difference is four times more sound.</p>
<p>We tested an additional data point: if you just need to blow a few leaves off your walk early on a Saturday morning, most of these blowers do offer a speed control that will let you turn down the noise. The DeWalt cordless blower was really the only one that was quiet enough to consider using in a noise-sensitive situation, and it’s still not below the 50dB threshold that’s often used before 7 AM.</p>
<p>The way your neighbours perceive the sound of your lawn tools is not the same as measured results, of course. The decibel scale represents power in a logarithmic slope, but <a href="http://conradaskland.com/blog/decibel-levels-and-perceived-volume-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our brains respond in an even less linear way to changes in sound</a>, and your family might not even notice a difference of 3dB, even if it is a lot more power. <strong>Your neighbor’s sleeping baby or dog will probably not care if you’re below a legally allowable noise level, but it’s good to know where you stand.</strong></p>
<h3>Test 4: Power comparisons</h3>

<p>Compared to the capacity and voltage comparisons between battery-powered tools, comparisons of plug-in appliances might seem pretty boring. Bigger is better, right? There’s a catch, though, to drawing all that current from the wall plug: you need to be careful about using a big enough cable to get power to your tool.</p>
<p>The official National Electrical Code listing for cable conductor sizes involves some complex math and is more concerned with wiring inside your walls than lawn tools, so we rely on interpretations in <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/c/factors_to_consider_when_choosing_extension_cords_HT_BG_EL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the guide published by Home Depot.</a></p>
<p>16-gauge cords are common and will work well for our big plug-in blowers at 50 feet, but that’s not the end of the story. Wire heats up when you run electricity through it, and the longer the cable is, the more it will heat up.</p>
<p>If you need to buy a 100’ cord or tie two 50’ cords together, you should go up in size to 14-gauge wire. (Smaller number, bigger wire.) A 14-gauge extension cord is not as easy to find or inexpensive as a 16-gauge cord, but it’s well worth the cost when you consider what might happen if you melt a cord running too much current through it.</p>
<p>For battery and gas-powered blowers, we’ve provided the average running times we achieved after a season of leaf-blowing. Refilling a gas tank is quick compared to waiting on a battery charger, but don’t forget to keep some gas and two-cycle oil on hand in a gas can, or it could take you significantly longer to go re-supply at a gas station or hardware store.</p>
<h2 id="top-pick">The best electric leaf blower: Toro &#8211; 51621</h2>

<p>Toro’s top-selling blower, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TNCJU3E/?tag=ybdleaf-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">plug-in model 51621</a>, comes with a kit that includes mulching and bagging accessories as well as a variety of different air-shaping nozzles. This is a versatile kit, but we picked it primarily for its raw power output.</p>
<p>In testing, we found that this blower could move bigger debris and throw leaves much farther than most of the other blowers, and it was better at loosening leaves out of long grass. <strong>In our distance test, el Toro threw our weighted test objects almost as far as the big backpack blower did.</strong></p>

It's easy to handle, quieter than a gas-powered blower and comes complete with accessories for vacuuming and bagging leaves.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TNCJU3E/?tag=ybdleaf-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The added accessories do make a difference, though. Being able to switch to vacuum-mode means you can do jobs that simple blowers can’t. The included oscillating tip makes it a little bit more efficient for sweeping off wide areas of concrete, though we didn’t notice much change when we were working on grass.</p>
<p>Toro’s blower isn’t perfect. To use it as a vacuum, you can exchange the blower tube for a bag, and the guard over the intake fan for a vacuum tube. The fit of the guard is snug, and changing the accessories could have been a little bit easier. That said, the recall on a close competitor, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FREQBXE/?tag=ybdleaf-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker’s BV5600</a>, was over a very similar guard that was so loose it would fall off. We’ll take a bit of prying over lacerated fingers any day of the week.</p>

<p>Black+Decker’s BV5600 got a good review from The Wirecutter and Popular Mechanics and goes together as a kit in a similar way. Beyond the safety recall, Consumer Reports gave it a much lower score because it lacked power, so we stuck with the Toro.</p>
<p>If you’re planning to use this blower for long periods of time on the lowest power setting, the big speed controller does have a tricky habit of bumping to “off&#8221; if you jiggle it or even if you shake the blower.</p>
<p>It’s easy to ramp the speed up and down if you have a free hand, but it’s not like the trigger-control on the DeWalt cordless blower that lets you flick precise blasts of air. The speed control works if you need to turn things down for careful work around flower beds, but low-speed work is not its strong suit.</p>
<p>The cord lock integrated into Toro’s handle is not the best we’ve used, but we figured it out without needing to look it up in the manual and we never had a cord come unplugged.</p>

<p>With a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OS7ETIA/?tag=ybdleaf-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">50-foot extension cord</a> most people should have no trouble cleaning their lawns and patios with this plug-in blower, but if you need more length be sure to get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NNYZV6/?tag=ybdleaf-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">14-gauge extension cords</a>: this blower draws 12 Amps, and that means typical 16 gauge cords will start getting too hot if you daisy-chain them out to 100 feet.</p>
<p>Another feature that solidified the Toro’s spot in first place is a blue hook that slips over the blower tube and gives you a way to wrap your extension cord neatly around the blower for storage. We prefer to hang our cords on a hook in the garage, but Toro is providing real options that the other manufacturers just don’t seem interested in.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TNCJU3E/?tag=ybdleaf-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Toro &#8211; 51621 blower/vacuum</a> has far more power than the other blowers in its class, but it manages to be a little bit quieter than the other plug-in models, too.</li>
<li>Plug-in power means you need a cord long enough to reach wherever you’re blowing, but you’ll never have to worry about batteries or fuel.</li>
<li>Toro includes extra nozzles for specialized work and a well-designed vacuum function, making this a complete package.</li>
<li>No cord included: if you need more than 50 feet of reach make sure to get a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NNYZV6/?tag=ybdleaf-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">heavy-duty 14-gauge cord</a>.</li>

<p>A 20V lithium-ion battery can’t deliver as much power as a gas engine or a 120V extension cord, but the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TL72F2E/?tag=ybdleaf-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dewalt &#8211; DCBL720P1</a> earned our respect with usable power and the freedom of lightweight cordless use.</p>
<p>If you’re lifting leaves that have been sitting on a lawn for a week and settling into the grass, the amount of power this blower offers might be disappointing, and the Toro blower can run circles around it doing tough jobs.</p>
<p>If you just want a blower for sweeping leaves off your sidewalk and into a pile, though, the cordless design means you can move quickly. If you’re concentrating on one spot a cord isn’t a big hindrance, but this blower excels at roaming up and down long driveways just as well as clearing hard-to-reach gutters or the corners behind your trash cans.</p>
<p><strong>Effectively, this blower makes up for a lack of reach by making it easier to get close to the leaves you’re blowing.</strong> That also means it’s a bit easier to be careful about not blowing leaves across property lines or damaging flower beds, but it also means you’ll spend more time walking.</p>

This is a simple tool, but it does its job well.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TL72F2E/?tag=ybdleaf-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>The lower output also means this is also a very quiet blower, and the variable-speed trigger is by far the easiest to use of the bunch. (There’s also a locking thumb-lever that keeps the speed where you want it if you’re doing a bigger job.) It’s still as loud as a vacuum cleaner, so you’re not going to be some kind of lawn ninja who clears leaves unnoticed, but it’s a nice perk.</p>
<p>For spending an entire morning collecting leaves off your yard, this wouldn’t be our first choice, but it’s very convenient not having to worry about cords or gas cans when the leaves start falling and you just want to clear off your deck.</p>
<p>At the end of the day this didn’t make our top pick because an 18-minute runtime is just not going to be enough for some jobs, and stopping in the middle of a job to wait more than an hour for charging is just a pain. This is a worst-case runtime, though, with the trigger locked on full and no breaks. If you take full advantage of the smooth and easy trigger control you should be able to get five or ten more minutes out of a battery, but it’s difficult to translate that to real-world time walking around your yard without defining exactly how much force you need to push your leaves and how far you need to push them.</p>
<p>If you’ve already got one or two of DeWalt’s 20V Max batteries (or one of the new batteries for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H9BLJ4S/?tag=ybdleaf-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Flex-Volt 20V/60V</a> system) then the run-time limits might be less of a problem, but this still isn’t a tool for big jobs.</p>
<p>At the end of our testing period, we have mixed feelings about this blower. The price is especially hard to swallow, basically double what you pay for a good plug-in blower like our top pick. But this blower can go anywhere without worrying about cords, and it doesn’t have the inconvenience and weight of a gas-powered blower. <strong>This might make it sound like a niche tool, but we found ourselves reaching for the DeWalt first when doing frequent, easy jobs like blowing off walkways after mowing.</strong></p>
<p>As is the case with most cordless tools, this blower is very handy and great to have around, and you might be surprised at how little you notice the power difference compared to the ease of working without a cord. (Just don’t forget to charge the battery when you’re done.)</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TL72F2E/?tag=ybdleaf-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dewalt &#8211; DCBL720P1</a> isn’t the perfect tool for every job, but it has just the right amount of power for most leaf-blowing.</li>
<li>The battery isn’t going to astound you with its capacity, but there’s enough working time for weekly yard chores.</li>
<li>Remembering to charge the battery is a bit of a pain, but it’s still faster and easier to drop the battery in a charger after each use than to untangle a heavy extension cord or remember to fill a gas can.</li>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VQO3JO8/?tag=ybdleaf-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PB-580T from Echo</a> is a representative pick: this was a well-reviewed and economical choice from a wide field of two-cycle gas blowers. This is the kind of tool you’ll know well if you’re working professionally around yards and parks, but some homeowners with property backing onto parkland might consider it too.</p>
<p>The downsides, naturally, are many. Starting never took more than a few pulls if we followed the prime/choke/throttle/pull procedure carefully, but that’s still a lot of steps compared to the power-and-go simplicity of electric blowers. The run time was good and refuelling was pretty easy, but those are still factors you don’t have to worry about with our top pick.</p>
<p>Gas-powered blowers are also becoming increasingly less popular with neighbours and city councils, so think carefully about who might be affected by your leaf-blower choices.</p>
<p>Pre-mixed gas like <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/TruSouth-Trufuel-50-1-Pre-mixed-Fuel-Oil-6525638/202532877" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TruFuel</a> is a handy way to keep fuel on hand for occasional use, but it’s not cheap. The <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/ECHO-16-oz-2-Cycle-50-1-Motor-Oil-for-Engines-6450006/100033949" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">brand-name oil additive</a> with handy measuring bottle makes it easy to add when you’re filling a gas can, and if you’re refilling that a few times per season it definitely pays off.</p>
<p>The noise that this machine makes is unmistakable. It rumbles, buzzes and chatters at idle like most two-stroke engines do, but it actually put out less noise energy (however distinctive it might be) when idling than the big electric blowers did at their lowest speeds.</p>

<p>Of course when you pull the trigger to spin the fan up this is a loud machine. You’d be wise to wear hearing protection like ear plugs when you’re doing big jobs, but it doesn’t put out the ear-splitting volume of something like a chainsaw.</p>
<p><strong>There are other options if you have a yard too big for a cord: handheld gas blowers like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003VYC31Q/?tag=ybdleaf-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hitachi &#8211; RB24EAP</a> costs less than a backpack blower, but they don’t put out significantly more air than our electric top pick.</strong> There are also bigger lithium-ion cordless systems, like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DVO8Y6I/?tag=ybdleaf-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">56V Power+ from Ego</a> (out of stock when we purchased our testing group) that put out an impressive amount of air, but can’t run longer than about 20 minutes on a battery.</p>
<p>The backpack blower is a tool that makes no compromises: it goes where corded blowers and even the big walk-behind gas blowers just can’t go, but it can keep going for as long as you can keep topping off the fuel tank. It’s not a vacuum or mulcher, and it’s not lightweight or quiet, but if you need to clean a ¼-mile-uphill driveway it’s practically perfect.</p>
<h3>Worx &#8211; Trivac WG509</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-8809 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/worx-corded-electric-leaf-blower.jpg" alt="Worx" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/worx-corded-electric-leaf-blower.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/worx-corded-electric-leaf-blower-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/worx-corded-electric-leaf-blower-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/worx-corded-electric-leaf-blower-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/worx-corded-electric-leaf-blower-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/worx-corded-electric-leaf-blower-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/worx-corded-electric-leaf-blower-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/worx-corded-electric-leaf-blower-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/worx-corded-electric-leaf-blower-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/worx-corded-electric-leaf-blower-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/worx-corded-electric-leaf-blower-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/worx-corded-electric-leaf-blower-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>There are things to like about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MN4YCKK/?tag=ybdleaf-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TriVac WG509 from Worx</a>, but on the whole it’s just not competitive.</p>
<p>The only reason we might recommend this blower over the Toro is if you need to switch quickly and frequently between blowing and vacuuming leaves: Worx made this blower so you can leave the bag attached all the time, and switch the output between the bag and the blower tube with a simple flip of a lever.</p>
<p>As a blower, though, it’s just not great. The outlet nozzle is small and hides underneath the large vacuum tube, which makes it tricky to maneuver in tight spaces. It has more power than the cordless DeWalt blower or the little GreenWorks blower, but compared with the Toro it’s very underwhelming.</p>
<p>As a vacuum the shape and handle are well-designed, but for blowing we found the Toro’s pommel-grip handles made it easier to sweep and pile direct leaves. The Worx blower is a pound heavier, too, even without the bag attached.</p>
<p>For nearly the same price, the Toro electric blower is much more powerful, more versatile, and easier to use.</p>
<h3>Greenworks &#8211; 24012</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-8805 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/greenworks-electric-blower.jpg" alt="Greenworks" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/greenworks-electric-blower.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/greenworks-electric-blower-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/greenworks-electric-blower-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/greenworks-electric-blower-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/greenworks-electric-blower-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/greenworks-electric-blower-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/greenworks-electric-blower-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/greenworks-electric-blower-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/greenworks-electric-blower-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/greenworks-electric-blower-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/greenworks-electric-blower-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/greenworks-electric-blower-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Greenworks makes a lot of inexpensive lawn tools, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0030BG1CC/?tag=ybdleaf-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">24012</a> is pretty much what you’d expect. The best thing about it is definitely the price, but it deserves the high 4.5-star overall rating on Amazon since it does what it can within a budget.</p>
<p>In testing, this blower doesn’t move very much air. There’s enough to move leaves around, more than the cordless DeWalt and almost as much as the big Worx multi-function machine, but it’s not any easier to carry around or use than our top pick from Toro.</p>
<p>Greenworks didn’t provide any consideration for vacuuming, different blower patterns, variable speed or easy cord-wrapping. Even the on/off switch is about as basic as it could be.</p>
<p><strong>The amount of noise it makes is the one thing that’s remarkable: with a small fan spinning quickly trying to move as much air as it can, this was the loudest electric blower we tested.</strong> It’s a high-pitched whine, too, definitely something your neighbours and family will notice.</p>
<p>We paid $30 for the Greenworks blower, and that does count for something; if you don’t already have a long extension cord, it’ll cost almost as much as this blower does. Note that the tiny motor does means it’ll safely run on a cheap 16-gauge extension cord all the way up to 100 feet.</p>

<p>Finding the very best leaf blower for your particular situation is sometimes a tricky exercise, even without factoring price or power. You can really only pick two of the following traits: Ease of use, run-time and freedom from cords.</p>
<p>For those whose primary concern is quickly clearing a driveway or patio, extra power might not be all that important. The 18-minute runtime of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TL72F2E/?tag=ybdleaf-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dewalt &#8211; DCBL720P1</a> isn’t its best feature, but it’s enough time to do the jobs this blower is best at.</p>
<p><strong>Right now, it really is still worth the hassle of a power cord to gain the power and run-time of a blower like our top pick.</strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TNCJU3E/?tag=ybdleaf-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Toro &#8211; 51621</a> is a blower that will do everything you need a backyard blower or vacuum to do, if you have a long enough cord. If you’ve already got one of those for a plug-in <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-lawn-mower/">lawn mower</a>, the Toro is an easy pick, but for nearly everyone else we still think it’s a great machine and worth the hassle.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter spending a whole season mowing a 4,300 square-foot lawn with self-propelled gas, electric and manual lawn mowers, we’ve selected the <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Honda-21-in-3-in-1-Variable-Speed-Gas-Walk-Behind-Self-Propelled-Lawn-Mower-with-Auto-Choke-HRR216VKA/308769340" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Honda &#8211; 21&#8243; HRR216K9VKA</a> as the best lawn mower. With a 160cc engine, the Honda’s cord-free, self-propelled operation gives you plenty of power to get through weeds and overgrowth. If you’ve got a smaller lawn and you don’t want to deal with gasoline and engine maintenance, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002ZVOLXE/?tag=ybdig-23" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greenworks &#8211; 22502</a> electric is a great option.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>For our lineup, we selected an assortment of manual, electric and gas-powered mowers. As always, we tried to avoid products with consistently negative reviews that mention the same problems. We narrowed our selection to mowers from top brands with good reputations for warranty, reliability and quality.</p>
<p>Lawn sizes have been shrinking. <a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/chars/pdf/soldlotsize.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recent census data</a> shows that 95-percent of new houses sold have a lot smaller than ¼ acre (and the houses on those lots are getting bigger, leaving even less space for turf). So, we excluded riding mowers from our review and focused on the benefits of powered mowers relative to calorie-powered manual push mowers on a moderately-sized lawn.</p>
<p>We capped the price of the gas models at $400 since there were lots of good options. There are many other features to be had beyond that price range, but unless your lawn is bigger than 1/2 acre, it probably won’t make sense for you to spend much more.</p>
<h2 id="the-six-best">Compare the best lawn mowers</h2>
[table id=50 /]
<h2 id="important-features-to-consider">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Mower type</strong> &#8211; This is typically recommended by lawn size, but there are plenty of options; even within the broader gas/electric/manual categories there’s much to consider.</p>
<p><strong>Bagging and mulching options</strong> &#8211; Some people will want to bag their clippings. We found that while all of these mowers are capable of bagging, you’d have to buy a separate attachment for the manual mowers. Overall, the design of the bigger self-propelled mowers made removing and emptying the clipping bag easier than the electric models.</p>
<p><strong>Self-propel or push-assist</strong> &#8211; This makes the work much easier, but it comes with noise, smell, maintenance concerns and a CO<sub>2</sub> footprint. On the flip side, people-powered mowers are quiet and pollution-free, but they’re only efficient if you’re mowing on a rigid schedule to minimize the amount you’re cutting with each pass.</p>
<p><strong>Electric powered mowers</strong> &#8211; Electric motors offer great performance, but until battery technology can improve, these models require power cords which introduces a set of compromises compared to other style mowers.</p>
<p><strong>Cutting height adjustment</strong> &#8211; This is something most people won’t be adjusting frequently, but it’s still something you’ll have to deal with at least once on all mowers.</p>
<p><strong>Cleaning and storage</strong> &#8211; This is another big usability consideration. Each mower has its own set of folding-handle quirks, plus nooks and crannies that need to be brushed out or washed off.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-properly-mow">How to properly mow a lawn</h2>
<p><video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" muted="" width="100%" height="auto"><source src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mowing-animation.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video></p>
<p>Mowing a lawn often includes other maintenance aspects like perimeter cleaning with a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-string-trimmer/">string trimmer</a> and clearing clippings or debris with a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-leaf-blower/">leaf blower</a> which we cover on those respective articles Below we&#8217;ll stick to strictly mowing tips.</p>
<h3>Direction</h3>
<p>The “stripe” pattern  clearly visible on most sporting fields comes from the fact that mowers push the grass over slightly while they trim and alternating directions when mowing will create contrast in the way those ‘rows’ of clipped grass reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>Generally<strong> the back-and-forth stripe pattern is also the most efficient way for you to mow at home. </strong>If you start by mowing around the perimeter a few times, you&#8217;ll have some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headland_(agriculture)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;headland&#8221;</a> room to turn around at the end of each long row without fussing about grass you might miss when you turn.</p>
<p>Cutting in a concentric spiral pattern from the outside perimeter is also viable if you’re looking to minimize the stripe effect; Some also find the right-angle corners easier than 180° turns.</p>
<p>(If you really want to get fancy, reel mowers or powered mowers with a roller attachment push the grass flat enough to create the contrast needed for the intricate patterns you sometimes see on ball diamond outfields. David Mellor, groundskeeper for Fenway Park, even <a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/1575041510/?tag=ybdmowr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">wrote a book on the subject</a>.)</p>
<p>The best practice is to rotate your mowing pattern 90 degrees (start at a right angle to your previous pattern) every few mowings to keep grass from being pushed down too much in one direction.</p>
<h3>Types of grass</h3>
<p>There are basically two “regions” of grass-growing in the United States: “warm-season” grasses in the South, “cool-season” grasses in the North and a narrow “transitional zone” where it’s common to cross-seed types from both regions.</p>
<p>Seed producers like <a href="https://www.pennington.com/resources/grass-seed/grass-101/recommended-grasses-for-regional-climates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennington</a> and <a href="http://www.scotts.com/smg/goART3/Howto/what-are-warm-season-grasses/33800021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scotts</a> have lots of great info about the different varieties you might have in your yard. It’s a good idea to get to talk with a lawn-care professional in your area who can help you understand the quirks of growing locally (especially weeds and disease).</p>
<p>The biggest difference between these regions and the varieties you’ll find there is in the timing of peak growth: warm-season grasses grow the most during the summer, then go dormant and turn brown during the cooler winter months; cool-season grasses grow the most in spring, slow down when it gets hot, then have another growth spurt in the fall before winter dormancy.</p>
<h3>Grass height and mowing frequency</h3>
<p>When you’re deciding how tall you want your grass, the most important thing to remember is that <strong>if your grass is too short, it can&#8217;t absorb sunlight.</strong> Photosynthesis doesn’t happen without leaf area, and all of the other qualities of good turf are dependent on that energy. Basically, longer is better for the health of the grass.</p>
<p>This is especially important in non-growing seasons: the grass will be stressed and needs plenty of leaf and root area (with stored energy from the growing season) to continue thriving. Mow when the air is cool and avoid mowing right before hot weather is in the forecast.</p>
<p>Some warm-climate species, like Bermudagrass, are cut as low as a half-inch on sporting fields. This requires daily mowing in quick-growth seasons, though. (And plenty of water to keep it healthy.) See our in-depth review we did on <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-garden-hose/">garden hoses</a> too.</p>
<p>There’s another benefit to keeping lawn grass on the longer side. While the grass is soaking up all the sunlight with lush, long leaves, it’s keeping that sunlight away from any weeds that might be trying to start underneath.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, never remove more than a third of the leaf area in one mowing. So if you’re mowing down to two inches, mow again before the grass hits three inches. <a href="https://www.pennington.com/resources/grass-seed/lawn-maintenance/lawn-mowing-101#Recommended%20Mowing%20Height" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennington provides a handy chart</a> of mowing height for common grass types.</p>
<h3>Mulching grass vs. bagging</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6446 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bag-vs-mulch-settings.jpg" alt="selector switch for bag vs. mulch" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bag-vs-mulch-settings.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bag-vs-mulch-settings-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bag-vs-mulch-settings-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bag-vs-mulch-settings-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bag-vs-mulch-settings-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bag-vs-mulch-settings-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bag-vs-mulch-settings-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bag-vs-mulch-settings-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bag-vs-mulch-settings-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bag-vs-mulch-settings-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
In very sandy soil mulching can cause some problems, since there aren’t as many organisms to consume clippings, but in most cases mulching regular clippings back into the turf is highly recommended by grass experts and municipalities alike.</p>
<p>Earthworms, fungi and other primary consumers in your lawn’s ecosystem thrive on the clippings and turn the mulch back into available nitrogen for your lawn. (So it’s not just easier than disposing of bags: it means less fertilizer!)</p>
<p>So long as you aren’t trimming off more than an inch of grass, and you aren’t mowing when it’s wet, the clippings should easily scatter down to soil level and form a helpful layer of worm-food. You can even mulch the leaves that fall off your trees!</p>
<p>All of the mowers we tested are mulch-ready except for the Sun Joe 401E, which requires an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LP8YE80/?tag=ybdmowr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">optional attachment</a> to safely funnel the clippings (and any debris you may accidentally find in your grass) to the side. The other powered mowers will require a quick conversion from bag-mode with an included plug or a moveable flap.</p>
<p>Because bagging is occasionally beneficial (if you have to wait for your lawn to dry in the spring and the grass gets really long, for example) we also tested the bagging features of all the powered mowers. (Manual-power reel mowers aren’t very good at cutting tall grass, but you can get <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052WIRMO/?tag=ybdmowr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">leaf-catcher attachments</a> if you really don’t want to mulch.)</p>
<h3>Mowing wet grass</h3>
<p>While it’s good to mow when the air is cool, <strong>avoid mowing grass that is wet from watering or rainfall</strong>. When fibers in the leaves get wet they get tougher, so the cut takes more work and can leave a ragged edge on the leaf.  It requires you to sharpen your blades more frequently, too.</p>
<p>Plus, if you’re mulching your clippings, wet mulch all over your lawn is just as bad as it sounds — clumpy and prone to get musty. If you don’t have a way to dispose of them within a few days, having bags of wet mulch sitting in your garage is even worse.</p>
<p>Mowing wet grass is just a bad idea. A little dew in the morning generally won’t slow you down much, but if the grass is soaked it’s best to wait for the sun to come out.</p>
<h2 id="mower-maintenance">Mower maintenance</h2>
<p>Mowers are tools and tools need to be taken care of if you want them to keep doing a job well. Storage in a clean, dry place should be a given, but there are a few specific tasks that you’ll have to get used to if you want a mower that will keep your lawn looking its best:</p>
<h3>Sharpening</h3>
<p>All cutting edges require routine sharpening, even mower blades. <strong>Plan on sharpening at least once a season if you don’t want to bruise or tear your grass.</strong> Checking the blades for uneven wear and other problems is smart, but checking the grass to see how well you’re cutting is the surest way to determine the condition of your mower blades.</p>
<p>Sharpening more than once a season should only be necessary if you’re cutting heavier material like a lot of twigs (or the bane of every mower, hidden gravel/sand left over from winter snow piles.)</p>
<p>Fiskars claims that the steel and tight-tolerance-design used in their reel mower will cut cleanly for the life of the mower, but they still sell <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006FALD78/?tag=ybdmowr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a sharpening kit</a> and it works like all the other reel-mower sharpening kits. An abrasive compound wears away high spots and leaves a keen edge when you spread it on the blades and run the reel backwards against the stationary cutting bar. (If dismounting drive chains or spinning mower reels with a hand drill aren’t your idea of fun, you can usually find a local handyman or landscaper who will do the job for you.)</p>
<p>Powered mower blades have edges more like axes and you can sharpen them in nearly the same way. A vise or other clamp to hold the blade steady and a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VTO5N2G/?tag=ybdmowr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">carbide scraper</a> or good steel file are all you really need to bring the edge back to a chisel-shaped apex that will be able to slice paper and keep your lawn looking crisp and green.</p>
<h3>Winterizing gas mowers and oil changes</h3>
<p>If your lawn is covered in snow (or simply not growing) for more than a month every year, there are storage tasks you&#8217;ll need to remember for gas engines. Old gasoline can go stale or dry out and create a layer of varnish inside your engine. You need to either add <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00125ZMD2/?tag=ybdmowr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a stabilizer</a> to your mower’s gas tank and fill it before storage (pretty easy, but the mower will be heavy) or get all of the gas out of the system.</p>
<p>Like your car, a mower’s four-cycle gasoline engine uses oil for lubrication, but unlike your car it doesn&#8217;t run the oil through a filter to clean out debris. Nearly everyone will recommend annual oil changes before storage as part of a winter routine.</p>
<p>Spark plugs in a mower should last for a long time, but you should check them annually or as directed in your owner’s manual. People fool themselves into replacing electrical components arbitrarily if mowers won’t start, but it’s well worth learning how to spot signs of failure as a part of annual maintenance.</p>
<h2 id="gas-electric-and-manual">Gas vs. electric vs. manual mowers</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6491 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gas-electric-manual-mowers.jpg" alt="gas vs electricity vs manual mowers" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gas-electric-manual-mowers.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gas-electric-manual-mowers-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gas-electric-manual-mowers-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gas-electric-manual-mowers-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gas-electric-manual-mowers-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gas-electric-manual-mowers-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gas-electric-manual-mowers-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gas-electric-manual-mowers-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gas-electric-manual-mowers-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gas-electric-manual-mowers-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>All the mowers we tested will cut well enough once the blades hit the grass. The biggest differences come down to how much effort is required from a homeowner to get there and cover ground efficiently.</p>
<h3>Manual reel mowers</h3>
<p>These are the greenest of mowers, powered by whatever you&#8217;ve had for breakfast. They’re relatively simple tools that do one job: they cut grass quietly and efficiently for as long as you can push them.<br />
Beyond the sustainability and simplicity, they’re lighter and easier to store: no cord, no gas, no worries. If you like the idea of augmenting your lawn-mowing cardio with a bit more resistance, you should consider a reel mower.</p>
<p>The biggest weakness to the reel mower is that it&#8217;s not effective with thick or tall grass. This is a tool that will make you regret every time you forget to mow by making you work much harder. Have a lot of overgrown weeds? You’ll want to look elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Electric mowers</h3>
<p>If your lawn is big enough that just thinking about pushing a reel mower is exhausting, an electric powered mower is one way to ease your burden without the weight, noise, smell and maintenance concerns of a gasoline engine.</p>
<p>Even compared to the Fiskars Max, the electric mowers we tested were light and easy to maneuver. They’re still louder than the manual mowers, since there’s a 14-inch or 20-inch steel blade swinging around under the deck. However, your neighbors and family will still have less reason to complain about your Saturday-morning routine.</p>
<p>There’s not nearly as much to maintain on an electric mower as on a gasoline-powered mower, but keeping the deck clean and inspecting the cord for wear are still important tasks you’ll need to perform.</p>
<p>Managing the cord on an electric mower is similar to the annoyances of working with a household vacuum cleaner but on a larger scale. Running over the cord with the mower is, obviously, something you must never do. You also don’t want to trip on it, drop it in a pool, accidentally unplug it or plug it into a socket that can’t provide the 12 Amps of AC power needed by these engines.</p>
<h3>Gas powered self-propelled mowers</h3>
<p>The bigger your lawn, the more you’ll appreciate the self-propelled mower: these machines are designed to help you cover a lot of ground quickly by pulling themselves along at up to four MPH. So, all you really need to do is steer.</p>
<p>The gas mowers we tested have engines that provide around five horsepower to get through thick or long grass. (These are very similar to the engines you’ll find on a small Go-Kart.) Naturally, having all of that internal combustion power at your fingertips also brings noise and smells that other kinds of mowers won’t have.</p>
<p>While your time mowing will be much easier, the biggest drawback to gas-powered mowers is in maintenance. Like a gas-powered car, these mowers need fuel, oil changes and air filter and spark-plug checkups. Maintaining a small engine is very simple: you can do a mower oil change in minutes and even teach you kids how to do it. However,  it’s not for everyone. Naturally, there are mechanics who will do all of these services for you, for a fee.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Our test lawns (front and back) total to around 4,300 square feet. We cut at the recommended height of 2.5 inches multiple times with each mower. Some mowers got a bit of an extra workout at the beginning of the season due to overgrowth, but we made sure to mow with them again once they reached normal heights to be fair.</p>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>Initial setup was one of the big differentiators for the mowers. Some had great instructions, while others were misleading and confusing. Each of these machines required some setup time since they come disassembled. The Great States mower stood out as most frustrating to set up.</p>
<h3>Bagging</h3>
<p>We tested the bagging feature on all the mowers that included it. We also compared all of the features used for normal lawn mowing including setup of the cutter height and ease of storage.</p>
<h3>Overall usability</h3>
<p>Weight and size were some of the most important factors that we noticed. A bulky mower is more difficult to store and transport and extra weight also requires some practice to get clean turns and avoid damaging lawns.</p>

Both models of self-propelled gas mower that we we tested are well built machines. This was a very close call, but <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Honda-21-in-3-in-1-Variable-Speed-Gas-Walk-Behind-Self-Propelled-Lawn-Mower-with-Auto-Choke-HRR216VKA/308769340">Honda &#8211; 21&#8243; HRR216K9VKA</a> has included design and ergonomic considerations that make it a better mower.</p>
<p>Honda has models in the $500 and $600+ range which add features and functions you may be interested in: electric starting or the option to stop the blade and idle down the engine rather than shutting off and re-starting every time you need to stop, for example. We stuck to our $400 budget and feel confident that most will be happy with the performance of this machine on an average lawn like ours.</p>

Plenty of power and great design considerations — even the pull start was easy to use. If you need the power and speed of a self-propelled mower, this is your best bet for under $400.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CSN4Y4A/?tag=ybdmowr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>Honda engines have a reputation for easy starting and this one is no exception. Even with just a pull-start (and needing to re-start every time we stopped to pick up a piece of debris), we never had any trouble getting this mower going.</p>
<p>Self-propelled mowers are heavy and can cause damage in wet soil when making a tight turn. Turning while in motion was very manageable on the Honda, but avoiding lawn damage with a heavy mower requires getting to know the wet spots on your lawn and developing a feel for the balance of the mower.</p>
<p>We tested the mowers in wet grass to see how they’d fare, and the Honda did stall on the wettest grass we tested — probably because the chute clogged up with the wet clippings we were bagging. Other reviewers claim their machine didn’t stall with wet grass, but very wet grass is definitely not something any mower is designed for.</p>
<p>After running electric mowers and manual mowers, the Honda was definitely louder, but it’s not like a straight-pipe Harley or a chainsaw.</p>
<p>Adjusting cutter height requires individual settings on each wheel — this is a bit annoying, but most people won’t have to adjust often.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6453 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/honda-detail.jpg" alt="speed selector" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/honda-detail.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/honda-detail-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/honda-detail-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/honda-detail-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/honda-detail-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/honda-detail-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/honda-detail-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/honda-detail-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/honda-detail-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/honda-detail-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the mower is pulling itself forward whenever the engine is going, variable speed control helps for working slowly around turns or near edges of a curb. Honda’s thumb-controlled walk-speed setting was easy to use and felt more natural than the “personal pace” adjuster on the Toro, which was another mower we tested.</span></p>
<p>Honda&#8217;s switch controlling the bagging / mulching flap is also nicer than the Toro’s lever, with a solid engagement that clicks reassuringly in place. Honda claims that their blade system cuts better with two blades, but with a yard the size of the one we tested it was difficult to tell the difference. Suffice it to say, the Honda and Toro both cut well.</p>
<p>The foldable handle has quick-release locks for folding and storing the handle, whereas the <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/Toro-Recycler-22-in-Personal-Pace-Variable-Speed-Electric-Start-Gas-Self-Propelled-Mower-with-Briggs-Stratton-Engine-20334/100659631" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Toro</a> uses spin-off fasteners that take more time. Honda also includes padding on the handles of their machine, where Toro leaves you with plastic.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We stored our mowers in a raised shed in the backyard. The shed isn&#8217;t super roomy, so storage size and maneuverability were something we noticed. At 84 pounds the Honda is still light enough to lift on its back wheels to roll in, but lifting it to move around in a tight space is noticeably more difficult than with the non-gas models.</span></p>

<p>Compared to the heavy gas mowers the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002ZVOLXE/?tag=ybdmowr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greenworks &#8211; 22502</a> electric powered mower feels incredibly light: at 56 lb, it’s about 30 lb lighter than the Honda. This makes it far easier to turn without skidding, not to mention easier to handle when you’re putting it away. There’s a lot of plastic involved in keeping that weight down, of course, but the Greenworks still feels more like a serious lawn mower than the other electric model we tested. It’s a simple machine and doesn’t need unnecessary bulk.</p>

<p>The Greenworks mower has a 20-inch mowing width and height can be adjusted from 1.5 inches to 3.75 inches with seven height settings total. In the price range we tested, most electric mowers cut a much narrower track (the Sun Joe is a 14-inch and a comparable <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HH4K6V0//?tag=ybdmowr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black and Decker</a> model is 15 inches) which means you’ll finish 20-30 percent more quickly with the Greenworks.</p>
<p>The Greenworks came ready to go for bagging, side discharge and mulching, where the Sun Joe only lets you bag unless you buy extra accessories. Setup was a piece of cake, though we should note that the box it came in was not taped shut — the outer shipping box was secure and nothing was missing, but it was a possible sign of lax shipping quality control.</p>

<p>Greenworks made height adjustment very easy: adjusting one lever controls cutting height on the entire mower. On the other hand, the Sun Joe required individual wheel adjustments, as did the gas powered models we tested.)</p>
<p>This mower has a side discharge chute, but it requires an attachment to keep open. You have to insert a plug in the back of the mower and add the chute on the side to spread clippings to the side.</p>
<p>One of the disappointing things we noted was that clipping shreds occasionally spray out from the catch basket around the perimeter of the deck. This isn’t a big deal, but it&#8217;s not something that happened with other mowers.</p>
<p>Dumping the clippings can be slightly awkward since there’s a crossbar that supports the handles. This is an issue on both electric models we tested, but not on the gas models (which have larger, more robust handlebars that don’t use a cross-brace.) This doesn’t stop you from removing the bag, but you have to be aware of where your hands are and bend in awkward ways.</p>
<p>Mowing with an attached power cord is not fun. You’re chained to the plug, dancing a tango with the mower to avoid the cable getting clipped. It’s manageable if you start near the plug and work going away from the cord, but annoying to say the least. Water in pools or puddles is also an electricity-related hazard you’ll have to pay attention to with a long cord.</p>
<p><strong>Note that the Greenworks mower doesn’t come with an extension cord</strong>; you’ll need to buy a fairly heavy cord, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0052WIRMO/?tag=ybdmowr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">at least 14 gauge</a> if you’re going longer than 50 feet. 16GA is okay at 50 feet, but you’ll want something longer than that unless you have electrical outlets on every corner of your lawn. You’ll also have to coil the cable carefully after you use it, either a careful straight coil or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpuutP6Df84" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over-under</a>, unless you want to spend time every week untying a bunch of knots and dealing with a spiral-shaped cord after a year of twisting and untwisting it from sloppy coils.</p>
<p>We felt this mower was ideally sized for our lawn and having no exhaust fumes was great, but it still made a lot of noise relative to manual mowers. Plus, we really missed being cord free after our time with the gas mowers.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Like any electric mower, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002ZVOLXE/?tag=ybdmowr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greenworks &#8211; 22502</a> 20&#8243; mower is lighter and easier to maneuver, but you&#8217;re tied to an electrical cord.</li>
<li>Greenworks gives you a lot of mower for your money; it&#8217;s much more efficient and better built than the other electric mower we tested.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s not as quiet as the manual mowers, but not having to deal with the noise and smell of a gasoline engine is a huge plus.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0045VL1OO/?tag=ybdmowr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fiskars &#8211; Staysharp Max</a> is wonderfully simple. It’s solid and precise. Plus, with an 18-inch wide reel it covers ground more quickly than even the Sun Joe electric mower we tested (the Fiskars also costs more though.) Manual mowers use a scissor-like blade system that usually makes a grinding or swishing noise, but Fiskars takes pride in their carefully aligned blades and resulting lack of noise.</p>
<p>Before starting we knew we were going to be in love with manual mowers for the eco-friendly aspect, quiet operation and lack of gas exhaust. The Fiskars mower was indeed very enjoyable to cut with.</p>

<p>A quiet mower means you don’t feel guilty bugging your neighbors if mowing early in the day or late in the evening. A great perk is that you can talk on the phone or listen to music with non-sealing earbuds while mowing with this machine.</p>
<p>We wore gloves while mowing (since you need to be even more diligent about clearing debris with a manual mower) but were surprised at how comfortable the padded handles are on the Fiskars.</p>
<p>Fiskars went for a very wide cutting area, two inches wider than the Great States mower. This lessens cutting time, but all that width makes it more cumbersome to maneuver in the shed. We feel that it’s well worth the tradeoff and had no issues maneuvering on the turf.</p>
<p>Out of the box, setup was pretty simple, requiring a few screws to connect the handles to the body. The handles fold up (without locking), which saves space, making storage easy compared to non-folding handles.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6447 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fiskars-height-settings.jpg" alt="height adjustment" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fiskars-height-settings.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fiskars-height-settings-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fiskars-height-settings-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fiskars-height-settings-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fiskars-height-settings-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fiskars-height-settings-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fiskars-height-settings-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fiskars-height-settings-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fiskars-height-settings-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fiskars-height-settings-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Adjusting height on this mower is even easier than on the gas powered models — it’s just one lever in the front instead of adjusting four wheels individually. It’s also marked at 1 inch (shortest) to 4 inches cutting height. On other models you kind of just have to know the height range and wing it, so this was a nice touch on the Fiskars.</p>
<p>To give this manual mower a workout, we used the 1.5-inch setting on overgrowth at first. It was easy in some parts, but extremely difficult towards the end, in patches that weren’t even super tall. On subsequent mowings, it was a breeze. Unlike with gas or electric mowers, you definitely have to spend more time clearing the lawn of twigs and debris before mowing so you don’t jam up the mower.</p>
<p>The adjustable chute can let you direct clippings forward or backward as needed. There’s no included bagging option and even with the optional clipping-catcher this mower can’t suck up and pulverize leaves and small twigs like the powered mowers can.</p>
<p>With extra lawn-clearing time and smaller cutting width, a manual mower can be more work and will take longer than powered lawn mowers. However, if you’re trying to reduce your carbon footprint and don’t ever let your grass get overgrown, this may be the mower for you.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>

<li>Great build quality, fit and finish; this mower is more expensive than a cheap plug-in mower and it shows.</li>

<p>Immediately, we noticed the <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/Toro-Recycler-22-in-Personal-Pace-Variable-Speed-Self-Propelled-Electric-Start-Gas-Lawn-Mower-with-Briggs-Stratton-Engine-20334/100659631" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Toro 22&#8243; Recycler&#8217;s</a> excellent packaging: high quality plastic wrap on all the parts and the engine keeps everything tidy during shipping.</p>
<p>While we appreciated the padding and a few control details on the Honda just a bit more, Toro really knows their stuff too. The handle and connectors on this mower are excellent.</p>
<p>One setup detail that lost Toro some points is how hard it is to add oil to the B&amp;S engine and check the level. Waiting for the oil to drip down into the crankcase so you can read the dipstick accurately is a tedious process and the min/max markings on the dipstick are not present as depicted in the manual. Instead, there are only dots. There’s very little room for error, so setting up the mower for the first time involved a lot of waiting/re-dipping to make sure we got the right amount of oil.</p>
<p>We had trouble with the electric starting system, too. We charged the starter battery as directed, but it didn’t work. The instructions for initial startup weren’t especially clear, either. The starter button didn’t work in an intuitive way and the manual talks about a key-start that our mower doesn’t have. So for our review, the tester started the mower manually, just like the Honda. The Toro we tested does include the electric starter at the same price as the Honda with pull-start only.</p>
<p>Wheel height adjustment on the Toro isn’t as easy as other mowers. You have to adjust each wheel individually. Plus, the front wheel height adjustment tab was bent on the machine we received.</p>
<p>Eventually <strong>the first Toro we got had to be exchanged</strong>, since the metal tab on a wire that looks up to the blade control lever was broken. This rendered the machine unable to start. Home Depot swapped this out for us without problem.</p>
<p>Toro’s “personal pace” drive speed feature works just fine, but we preferred the thumb control of the Honda. On the Toro you have to hold the fixed handle in one hand and control speed with another handle that slides up and down. It&#8217;s not difficult to use, but it&#8217;s not as easy as Honda’s system.</p>

Unpacking the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00002N691/?tag=ybdmowr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Great States &#8211; 16&#8243; 415-16 mower</a> was definitely a low point. Terrible setup instructions meant we had to undo assembly we’d already done to fit the handles into the lower mower part. The plastic twist knobs that hold the handle fasteners together are poor quality, to say the least. In fact, you could cut yourself while tightening them. That being said, it’s a tool-free setup process.</p>
<p>At 16 inches of cutting width, (two inches less than the Fiskars, but much lighter overall), this machine is definitely more maneuverable. The quality of build feels lower than Fiskars, but not too bad considering it’s less than half the cost.</p>
<p>The cutting height on the Great States ranges from 0.5 inch to 2.5 inches compared to the Fiskars’ 1-4 inches. You really don’t need the 4-inch range unless you are cutting down overgrowth, but this might matter in a few cases.</p>
<p>The lack of motor noise and exhaust is still a great reason for choosing this manual model, but the cutting blade makes a grinding sound that&#8217;s louder than the Fiskars precisely-adjusted cutter. The Great States is also slightly harder to push than the Fiskars.</p>
<p>This is a tool that gets the job done for less than $100 and will likely last for many years (with a design that’s been around longer than you probably have.) There are even folks with yards larger than ½ acre who happily use this machine to mow. When it comes down to details, though, the Fiskars is a much nicer mower.</p>

Setting up the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0029TLUOA/?tag=ybdmowr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sun Joe 14&#8243; MJ401E</a> was drama-free, with a good (non-folding) attachment design for the surprisingly comfortable padded handles, but the budget price shows through: this mower looks and feels like a toy. While it is more agile than most of the other mowers, it is very plastic, very light and very basic. At about $40 less than our winning electric model, this should be treated as a basic mower.</p>
<p>Sun Joe doesn’t even include the parts needed for mulching at this price point; If you only ever bag and need to stay within a low budget, this will get the job done. The relatively smaller clippings compartment fills up fast, though. We had to dump out 5-6 times on a small lawn, though that’s partly on account of some overgrowth we were chopping through.</p>
<p>Another disappointment was the very flimsy-feeling height adjuster, which uses a spring-loaded adjuster on each wheel axle and makes you turn the mower on its side to adjust. With three settings, it’s adequate for basic lawn care.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Mowing your own lawn is one of those rites of passage for do-it-yourself home ownership. Like other jobs you do around your house, it will save you money compared to professional care, but it may take you more time and involve more cursing than you expected. We hope one of these mowers will help make your weekly lawn chores more enjoyable and less frustrating.</p>
<p>If you’ve got a smaller lawn and you’re excited about the idea of a brisk walk back and forth across it every Saturday morning, the Fiskars is probably an ideal machine for you. Smooth, quiet and precise, like the scissors the company is famous for, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00002N691/?tag=ybdmowr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Staysharp Max reel mower</a> can help you keep your lawn looking its best without the noise and complications powered mowers bring.</p>
<p>If you’ve got a few weeds that are invading your lawn or if you anticipate dealing with overgrowth after a wet spring, a powered mower will mean less straining — not to mention the time it’ll save. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002ZVOLXE/?tag=ybdig-23" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greenworks 22502</a> has a 20-inch cutting blade that lessen the number of rows you’ll need to walk. Plus, it’ll make quick work of just about any foliage found in an urban lawn-care setting. It’s ready to go for bagging out of the box, too.</p>
<p>And if you’ve got a lawn bigger than ¼ acre or if you think you’ll appreciate the one-switch conversion between mulching and bagging, the <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/Honda-21-in-3-in-1-Variable-Speed-Self-Propelled-Gas-Mower-with-Auto-Choke-HRR216K9VKA/203709643" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Honda HRR216K9VKA</a> cuts a wide swath quickly and efficiently through leaves, twigs and tall weeds. A self-propelled machine takes a bit more maintenance than an electric, but annual oil changes might seem a small price to pay compared to the headache of dancing around a cord on a larger lawn.</p>

<h2 id="why-qualified">Why trust us?</h2>
<p>We read through gardening forums, garden hose reviews, and the r/gardening subreddit to determine what consumers care about most when choosing a garden hose. We then spent 30 hours over the course of six weeks testing each of our garden hose finalists.</p>
<p>Since we also reviewed the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-garden-hose-nozzle/">best garden hose nozzles</a> at the same time, we were able to test the compatibility of each garden hose with a wide range of popular garden hose nozzles.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-found">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>In order to determine which of our garden hose finalists was best overall, we ran each of them through a series of tests designed to analyze how each garden hose would perform in real-life situations. This was aided by actual watering and gardening of our front and backyard over the course of a month and a half.</p>
<p><strong>A lot of what we measured had to do with the overall ergonomics of each garden hose</strong>. We made note of which garden hoses would tend to get stuck while being pulled around the yard, as well as how easy &#8212; or unwieldy &#8212; they were while being dragged around. We also looked at how easy it was to attach and detach each hose to the spigot, as well as to each of the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-garden-hose-nozzle/">garden hose nozzles</a> we were testing.</p>
<p>We recorded how often each hose kinked, which we also tested by measuring how tightly we could squeeze each hose before water flow would stop.</p>
<p>We measured water flow from each garden hose as well. We tested this by measuring how long it took each garden hose to fill a five gallon bucket of water, and the distance each garden hose could spray when held horizontally at a height of five feet.</p>
<p>Finally, we considered the overall build quality, including the materials used, and the durability of each hose &#8212; particularly in very hot and very cold conditions.</p>

<h2 id="why-50">Why we only tested 50-foot hoses</h2>
<p>If you look through our list of the six best garden hoses, you’ll notice that all of the hoses we tested are 50 feet long. This wasn’t an accident.</p>
<p>While researching what gardeners and others who use garden hoses look for, we found that 50 feet appeared to be the sweet spot for garden hoses in almost all situations.</p>
<p>For the most part, 25 feet usually isn’t quite long enough to be useful as an all-around tool &#8212; with the notable exception of those who live in an apartment or townhome and only have a small porch or patio. On top of that, the difference in cost between 25 and 50 foot hoses typically isn’t all that significant.</p>
<p>On the other hand, 100-foot hoses are typically longer than most people need. More importantly, 100-foot hoses are significantly more expensive than 50-foot hoses, sometimes they’re more than double the price!</p>
<p>A 50-foot hose is the ideal size for a number of reasons. First and foremost, most people simply don’t need more length than that. For those that do, we think that simply connecting another 50-foot hose is preferable to a 100 foot hose.</p>
<p>If a 100-foot hose leaks, rusts, or otherwise wears out, you have to replace the entire thing. If one of your 50 foot hoses breaks down, you can simply replace the one that breaks. In addition, walking around the yard with a 100-foot garden hose in tow &#8212; which is heavier and more prone to kinks &#8212; is simply an unnecessary difficulty.</p>
<p>Unless you have a very specific need for a 100 foot hose, we think most people are much better off with a 50 foot garden hose.</p>
<h2 id="new-hose">When is it time to buy a new hose?</h2>
<p>Replacing a garden hose comes down to more than just aesthetics. If you’ve had the same garden hose for 10 years, and it’s been sitting outside in the sun for most of that time, it’s probably time to consider a new one.</p>
<p>Over time, garden hoses can start to break, leak, or corrode. When this happens, the hose will waste water, and the corroded elements can even be harmful to plants, animals, or even children drinking from the hose. Even worse, hoses that have been left undrained for extended periods of time can develop harmful levels of bacteria.</p>
<p>There are a number of benefits that come with a new garden hose. For many, the most notable benefit is the fact that there won’t be any corrosion inside the hose, particularly on the fittings on each end of the hose.</p>
<p>You’ll also have water that is cleaner and safer for anything living (plants and people alike) that receive water from the hose.</p>
<p>If you’ve decided that it’s time to buy a new hose, be sure to follow these simple steps to ensure the longevity of the hose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the water out of sunlight when not in use.</li>
<li>Drain the hose when not in use. This is particularly important in very hot and very cold conditions.</li>
<li>Use a garden hose nozzle, so that dirt and bacteria can’t get into the hose as easily.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="think-about">Important features to consider</h2>

<p>When buying a new garden hose, there are a few things to consider.</p>
<p>The most important thing to think about is what you plan to use the hose for. While a standard hose will be sufficient for most situations, for some it might be worth investing in a specialized garden hose.</p>
<p>For example, if you plan to have pets, your children, or even yourself drinking from the hose at any point, it is strongly recommended that you use a garden hose that doesn’t have any potentially harmful components, and is certified as a “drinking water-safe” hose.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t plan on having anyone or anything drink from the hose, it’s still worthwhile to look at what materials the hose is made from. When possible, avoid hoses that expose water to brass, since <a href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/07/sipping-from-the-garden-hose-think-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is evidence</a> that the lead in brass can cause health problems.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you plan on using your hose in extreme heat or cold conditions, a hose that is designed to handle those conditions &#8212; even if it’s more expensive &#8212; could actually save money (and time) in the long-run, since it should last much longer than a regular hose.</p>
<p>It’s also worthwhile to consider how heavy, and therefore unwieldy, the hose is. This is particularly important if the hose will be used by children or the elderly.</p>
<p>Finally, if you want peace of mind that your hose will last for many years, our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-hose-reel/">garden hose reel review</a> has some great picks for storage options that will keep your hose out of the sun.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always great to know you&#8217;re covered in case you get a hose with a hidden flaw, so choosing a hose with a long-term or lifetime warranty is a good idea as well.</p>

<h3>Craftsman inventory update</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0035HLLJ4/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">listing we used when we bought product for testing is still active</a>, but it appears that Sears has swapped that product (keeping the same part number, 69602) for a round hose that appears to have a thinner outer layer and doesn&#8217;t have the nickle plating on the fittings. Recent reviews on the Amazon and Sears sales pages are mixed, but everyone who says they have both prefers the old style.</p>
<p>We found an Amazon listing that appears to have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XXN0J7K/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the 25-foot hose in the old style</a> and updated links in this post; there&#8217;s also <a href="http://www.kmart.com/craftsman-5-8-in-x-50-ft-all-rubber/p-043W885180110001P" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a listing for the old-style 50&#8242; hose at kmart.com</a> but it appears to be out of stock. As near as we can tell, the hose we reviewed was manufactured by Continental at their ContiTech factory, but we haven&#8217;t located an exact replacement to test. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B1050XA/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Continental&#8217;s retail-packaged hoses</a> use a different fitting that some reviewers say is not as crush-proof, but it should be the same EDPM rubber hose.</p>
<p>Original review:<br />
As soon as we started testing the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XXN0J7K/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Craftsman &#8211; Premium Rubber Garden Hose</a>, we had a feeling it was going to be the top pick. After spending a month and a half testing the Craftsman hose along with our other five finalists, this feeling was confirmed.</p>
<p>The Craftsman gardening hose is easily the best option overall. Unless you have specific garden hose requirements &#8212; for example you’ll be drinking from the garden hose or using it in particularly cold weather &#8212; there really isn’t a reason to choose any hose other than this one.</p>
<h3>Build quality and durability</h3>
<p><strong>Right away, the Craftsman garden hose felt like a premium product</strong>. The rubber was heavy and study in our hands, yet the hose was still flexible enough to walk around the yard with ease.</p>

<p>This premium feel makes sense, given the materials that are used in the construction of the Craftsman hose. In addition to using a heavy rubber, the hose utilizes nickel-plated brass connectors, which helps prevent any harmful materials from leaking into the main part of the hose, and by extension, into the water itself.</p>
<p>The durable health-conscious design of the Craftsman rubber hose is a large part of the reason the hose is regarded as one of the safest garden hoses on the market. In fact, the consumer reporting organization Healthy Stuff rated the Craftsman rubber hose as <a href="http://www.ecocenter.org/healthy-stuff/samples/50-ft-craftsman-premium-heavy-duty-rubber-garden-hose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the safest on the market today</a>.</p>
<h3>Ergonomics and functionality</h3>
<p>Most of us that have used a garden hose have at some point experienced a kinked hose. You know the feeling, you’re going about your watering, when suddenly the water sputters to a stop. You look back, try to shake the kink out, but ultimately have to walk over and manually unkink the hose &#8212; just for it to happen again 30 seconds later.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this is something that we didn’t experience a single time while testing the Craftsman garden hose. No matter how much we walked around the yard with the hose &#8212; twisting around bushes and weeds in the process &#8212; we never lost water flow.</p>
<p>In fact, we had to squeeze the hose pretty tight just to get water flow to stop. Our experience indicated to us that it is nearly impossible to kink the Craftsman hose under normal working conditions.</p>

<p>The Craftsman hose was also very easy to attach and detach from the spigot and from our various garden hose nozzles. When <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-hose-reel/">we tested five of the best hose reels and carts</a> we were always happy with how easy it was to turn the Craftsman fittings and get a leak-free seal.</p>
<h3>Overall value</h3>
<p>Overall, we feel that the Craftsman premium garden hose is one of the best values currently on the market. For less than $40, you’ll have a heavy-duty hose that won’t kink and should last for years and years.</p>
<p>On top of that, the Craftsman hose comes with a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer, so you can rest assured that Craftsman stands behind their product.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Craftsman Premium Rubber Hose, you simply need to try it out for yourself. We had never used a garden hose quite like this one before. For the price, and with the lifetime warranty that comes included, this is an easy choice for most garden hose users.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XXN0J7K/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Craftsman Premium Rubber Garden Hose</a> is our top pick for best overall garden hose.</li>
<li>It is both durable and easy to use.</li>
<li>The lifetime warranty, combined with a price point below $40, makes this a no-brainer for most consumers.</li>

<h2 id="cold-weather">Best for cold weather: Clear Flow &#8211; Flexible</h2>

<p>We had never seen a garden hose quite like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M8UUWV2/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Clear Flow &#8211; Flexible</a> before. Unlike every other garden hose we tested, the Clear Flow hose is completely flat when not in use.</p>
<p>While we think that the Craftsman rubber garden hose is better for typical use, the Clear Flow hose is an effective and innovative design, which is ideal for cold weather. The Clear Flow hose is also great for situations where space is at a premium &#8212; for example, in an RV.</p>
<h3>Build quality and durability</h3>
<p>This design is a big part of what makes the Clear Flow hose such a great option for cold weather situations, since water naturally drains out of the hose &#8212; something that is critical in freezing or near-freezing conditions.</p>
<p>The hose itself is made out of durable polyurethane. Unlike many other hoses, which use brass or other metals in their construction, there is essentially zero risk of lead or other contaminants leaking out of the hose into the water.</p>

<p>The Clear Flow hose is also completely made out of recyclable materials. This means that the hose won’t take up landfill space, or ultimately harm the environment, even when it’s time to get a new one.</p>
<p>The hose itself lays very flat while not in use. However, once you turn on the water pressure, it will inflate and become much easier to handle. While the Clear Flow hose doesn’t feel quite as sturdy and durable as the heavy rubber of the Craftsman hose, it still feels well-constructed, and should be able to handle typical yard terrain without any issues.</p>
<h3>Ergonomics and functionality</h3>
<p>While the Clear Flow did feel strange in our hands at first, we eventually became comfortable with it. We found that using a garden hose nozzle is absolutely essential with this hose — without one there simply isn’t enough pressure built up in the hose to be useful.</p>
<p>Thanks to the design of the Clear Flow hose, it’s also nearly impossible to kink. In addition, the polyurethane glides over the yard without getting stuck on rocks or other debris in the way. Also, despite its unique design, all standard garden hose nozzles were able to fit without any problems.</p>
<p>The Clear Flow hose is rated as safe to use for drinking potable water, largely due to the fact that it isn’t built out of any harmful materials. However, the hose is also aided by the fact that that it is transparent.</p>
<p>Since the UV rays from sunlight can hit the water inside the hose directly, bacteria and other harmful organisms aren’t able to fester between uses of the hose.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2078 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow01-1.jpg" alt="Photo Credit Kimberly Lostroscio" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow01-1.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow01-1-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow01-1-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow01-1-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow01-1-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow01-1-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow01-1-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow01-1-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow01-1-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GardenHoses_ClearFlow01-1-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Finally, while the 10 year warranty that comes with the Clear Flow hose isn’t quite as impressive as the lifetime warranty on the Craftsman hose, it is still a long time for one hose to survive. The fact that Clear Flow is able to offer this warranty is a strong indicator of the build quality and general confidence they have in their product.</p>
<h3>Things we didn’t like about the Clear Flow Hose</h3>
<p>While there was plenty we liked about the Clear Flow garden hose, we did have some issues with it as well.</p>
<p>First and foremost, you absolutely must use this hose with a nozzle. Without a garden hose nozzle, there simply wasn’t enough pressure to make the hose usable. In fact, when we first turned the hose on without a nozzle, we were almost ready to write it off as a poorly designed product. With a nozzle on, however, is another story altogether.</p>
<p>This hose is also pretty awkward to use at first. It really doesn’t feel like any other hose we’ve used before. However, the learning curve doesn’t last too long &#8212; after using the Clear Flow hose once or twice you shouldn’t have any trouble.</p>
<p>Lastly, this hose is fairly expensive, averaging nearly twice as much as our top pick, the Craftsman rubber hose. If you don’t have a specific use-case for this hose, such as RVing or cold weather, you’re probably better off saving your money and going with the Craftsman hose.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, if you have a specific need for the Clear Flow hose, it is a solid option and well-worth the money. However, for those who just need a standard hose for regular yard work, it’s hard to justify the cost, and trade-offs, you’ll have with the Clear Flow.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M8UUWV2/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Clear Flow &#8211; Flexible</a> utilizes a unique design which is best suited for cold weather.</li>
<li>The Clear Flow hose is also useful for RVs and other places where space is limited.</li>
<li>There is a premium associated with the Clear Flow hose.</li>

<p>If you plan on regularly drinking from your outdoor garden hose, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003P9XAAU/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Water Right &#8211; 400 Series</a> might be worth the extra cost. We found that it functions essentially like a regular hose, except that it is certified by both the NSF and the FDA to be made from materials that are safe to drink from.</p>
<h3>Build quality and durability</h3>
<p>The Water Right garden hose is made from a polyurethane resin that is free from toxic materials, such as lead and BPA.</p>
<p>The hose itself utilizes lead-free fittings that appeared to be high-quality and built to last for many years, even under heavy use.</p>

<p>The Water Right hose is fairly flexible and difficult to kink. While Water Right claims that it works perfectly in extremely hot and cold conditions, we weren’t able to verify that ourselves in San Diego. However, we did find a number of reviews online that corroborate their claims.</p>
<p>Since it’s advertised as a drinking water-safe hose, we wanted to see how the water tasted. Unlike the water from other garden hoses, which often has a distinct flavor, the water from the Water Right hose tasted clean &#8212; as if it was straight from the tap.</p>
<h3>Things we didn’t like about the Water Right garden hose</h3>
<p>There isn’t anything wrong with the Water Right hose, per se. If you want a hose that is safe for drinking out of, and if that particular feature is important to you, then it is likely worth the (significant) premium you’ll pay over a hose like our top pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XXN0J7K/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Craftsman</a>.</p>
<p>However, you’ll pay for this functionality, both in terms of the cost, and from the fact that water pressure is reduced compared to other hoses.</p>
<h2 id="others">Other finalists we tested</h2>
<p>The remaining three hoses we tested are certainly viable options. However, our testing convinced us that our three top picks work better, and are a better value.</p>

<h3>Camco Drinking Water Hose</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004RNR9QY/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Camco</a> is a decent hose, and significantly less expensive than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003P9XAAU/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Water Right</a> hose. If you are looking for a hose that is safe to drink from and is also inexpensive, the Camco hose is worthy of consideration.</p>
<p>However, during our testing we found it to be fairly unwieldy, and we didn’t particularly enjoy using it. The Water Right 400 is better, but you’ll be paying significantly more for the upgrade.</p>
<h3>Gilmour Flexogen</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00002N674/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gilmour Flexogen</a> is a solid garden hose overall. It is very difficult to kink, feels solid and durable in our hands, and attached to our spigot and the various garden hose nozzles easily.</p>
<p>We found it to be most similar to our top pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XXN0J7K/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Craftsman Premium Rubber hose</a>. However, for a few dollars more, you can get the Craftsman, which we found to be a stronger choice overall.</p>
<h3>Teknor Apex NeverKink Pro</h3>
<p>We were disappointed by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00INTILWY/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Teknor Apex hose</a>. Their major selling point is that it is highly flexible and doesn’t kink. While this is true, it also gets twisted up very easily, even after several days of use. The NeverKink was also the most unwieldy of the hoses we tested.</p>
<h2 id="long-term">Long term testing notes</h2>
<p>After continued use of the Craftsman, our opinion hasn&#8217;t changed: it&#8217;s a great, multi-purpose garden hose. The hose has rarely kinked, the 50-foot reach easily covers most large-sized lawns, and it continues to show no signs of wearing down.</p>
<h3>Craftsman inventory update</h3>
<p>In 2019, the writing is on the wall for Sears. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0035HLLJ4/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon listing for hose we loved is still active</a>, but it appears that Sears has swapped that product (keeping the same part number, 69602) for a round hose that has a thinner outer layer, doesn&#8217;t have the nickle plating on the fittings, and isn&#8217;t made in the U.S. anymore.</p>
<p>We found an Amazon listing that appears to have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XXN0J7K/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the 25-foot hose in the old style</a> and so we&#8217;ve updated links in this post to that item. If you&#8217;re not as worried about crush-proof fittings, there&#8217;s a good bet <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B1050XA/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Continental&#8217;s 50-foot garden hose</a> is the same synthetic-rubber hose they used to make for Craftsman, but with less-impressive connectors.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you’re looking for the best standard garden hose, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XXN0J7K/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Craftsman Premium Rubber Garden Hose</a> is hands-down your best bet. It is a durable and easy to use hose that should last for many, many years.</p>
<p>For those who need a more compact hose, and for those who live in parts of the world where it gets very cold, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M8UUWV2/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Clear Flow Garden Hose</a> offers an innovative design that should last for many cold winters.</p>
<p>If having a hose that is safe to drink from, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003P9XAAU/?tag=ybdhose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Water Right 400 hose</a> is worth your consideration &#8212; however you’ll pay a notable premium over hoses like our best pick, the Craftsman.</p>

<h2 id="why-qualified">Why we are qualified to test garden hose nozzles</h2>
<p>We spent 30 hours over the course of a month and a half in our backyard, testing each of the garden-hose nozzles to determine which would work the best in real-life conditions.</p>
<p>We also tested each of the nozzles with <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-garden-hose/">several of the best garden hoses</a> in order to compare how each nozzle would work with different types of hoses.</p>
<p>While we did use a series of qualitative tests to determine which nozzle was best, ultimately our decision came down to using our finalists extensively before we could make a recommendation.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-found">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We used several different metrics to determine which garden hose nozzle is best:</p>
<h3>Durability</h3>
<p>First we looked over each nozzle&#8217;s overall build quality and durability. We considered everything from the materials used to the likelihood that the individual components would jam or otherwise break down over time.</p>
<p>The number of moving parts within the nozzle was an important consideration as well. Since garden hose nozzles are frequently dropped and often wet, it’s important that a nozzle not be susceptible to corrosion or rapid wear and tear.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1478" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/moving-parts.png" alt="moving parts" width="880" height="557" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/moving-parts.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/moving-parts-610x386.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/moving-parts-360x228.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/moving-parts-375x237.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/moving-parts-414x262.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/moving-parts-295x187.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/moving-parts-180x114.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/moving-parts-320x203.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></strong></p>
<p>One way we tested durability was by dropping each nozzle on concrete and then checking whether any particularly weak components could potentially break after a relatively short period of regular use.</p>
<h3>Ergonomics</h3>
<p>We also tested each garden-hose nozzle ergonomically. Since watering your garden or washing your car (or for any other chore you would use a garden hose) can require holding a garden hose for an extended period of time, it’s important that the nozzle is easy to hold — particularly for those who might not have a strong grip.</p>
<p>We also looked for nozzles that could “lock” into place so that water would continue flowing even without a hand squeezing the nozzle itself. While each nozzle had different locking mechanisms, we made sure that all the finalists we tested could lock into place.</p>
<p>We looked at how comfortable each nozzle was when held for an extended period of time. We also noted how easily the nozzle locked into place and switched from one “mode” to another.</p>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>When testing each nozzle, we looked at the functionality that each one offered. In practice, people buy garden hose nozzles for a variety of reasons, and there is no single set of functions that will work best for every application.</p>
<p>That said, we did look at the specific functions on each nozzle. The most important functions we looked for were spray patterns, a locking mechanism and ease of use. We also recorded how far each nozzle could spray in the “jet” configuration.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1476" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/jet-distance.png" alt="jet distance" width="880" height="724" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/jet-distance.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/jet-distance-610x502.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/jet-distance-360x296.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/jet-distance-375x309.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/jet-distance-414x341.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/jet-distance-295x243.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/jet-distance-180x148.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/jet-distance-320x263.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Finally, we made note of how easy it was to actually use these functions and how well they worked together.</p>
<h3>Longevity</h3>
<p>In general, garden hose nozzles are fairly inexpensive. As a result, many people expect to replace them every year or so. However, just because something is relatively inexpensive doesn’t mean you should settle for a product that breaks after light or moderate use, which wastes both time and money.</p>
<p>While we couldn&#8217;t get a full sense of the longevity of each nozzle during our six weeks of testing, we did notice which nozzles looked like they were starting to wear down and those that looked as good as new.</p>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2100" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Nozzles_Group01-1-1.jpg" alt="Group of Nozzles" width="900" height="600" /></p>
<h2>Do you need a garden hose nozzle?</h2>
<p>If you don’t yet have a garden hose nozzle or have an old one that is still attached to your garden hose, you might be wondering whether or not it’s worth spending money to buy a new one.</p>
<p>In general, if you already have a garden hose nozzle that is working, and you don’t have a specific function that it is failing to do, you probably don’t need to buy another one — at least until your current one stops working.</p>
<p>However, if you have a specific function you’re looking to do — such as use a mist or shower-spray pattern to water your garden — you could be better off investing in a new garden hose nozzle.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you have a garden hose but don’t have a garden hose nozzle at all, we strongly recommend you get at least a simple nozzle. This will prevent dirt and other contaminants from getting into your garden hose.</p>
<p>Garden hose nozzles will help you use less water. Without a nozzle, you’ll have water running constantly while the spigot is on. With a nozzle, water will only be running when you are actively trying to water something.</p>
<p>Garden hose nozzles also make it easier to run a direct stream of water specifically where it needs to go and in a spray pattern that works best for a given activity. Nozzles also prevent dirt from splashing around when watering your garden.</p>
<h2 id="considerations">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>When buying a garden hose nozzle, there are a few things worth thinking about before making your decision.</p>
<p>First and foremost, think about what you’re going to use the nozzle for. As an example, a gardener would typically want a nozzle that has a shower-spray pattern and potentially a mist option as well.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a garden hose nozzle used for washing a car should have a strong (but not too strong) jet-spray pattern and and is durable enough to handle the inevitable falls onto driveway concrete.</p>
<p>It’s also worth taking your hand and wrist strength into account. If children or the elderly will be using the nozzle, it’s useful to have one that is comfortable and easy to put into a “locked” position.</p>
<p>If you plan on having <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-garden-hose/">multiple hoses</a> — for example, one in the front yard and one in the back yard — it may be worth considering two different nozzles, depending on how you plan to use each of them.</p>
<p>Finally, while some people do simply accept that they will need to buy a new garden hose nozzle every year or so, not everyone thinks this way. If you plan on having a garden hose nozzle that lasts for years before it needs to be replaced, be sure to take the build quality and any applicable warranties into consideration when making your choice.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: SprayTec &#8211; 9-Pattern Hose Nozzle</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2095 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Nozzles_Spraytec01-1-1.jpg" alt="Spraytec Hose Nozzle" width="900" height="600" /></p>
<p>When choosing the best overall garden hose nozzle, we wanted an option that would appeal to the greatest number of people while also being affordable, durable and easy to use. While some might be able to get away with a more basic garden hose nozzle, such as our other topic pick, the Gilmore, we found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YQ73WBW/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SprayTec &#8211; 9-Pattern Hose Nozzle</a> was worth the additional cost.</p>
<h3>Durability and ergonomics</h3>
<p>First and foremost, the SprayTec is among the most durable of all the nozzles we tested. In addition to having an all-metal body and trigger, the tip of the nozzle itself is rubberized, making accidental drops onto concrete essentially a non-issue.</p>
<p>The grip was notably comfortable as well, which made the SprayTec easy to use, even for extended periods of time. The locking mechanism located on the bottom of the SprayTec handle also contributed to the ease with which the nozzle could be used for 10 minutes or longer.</p>
<h3>Functionality and reliability</h3>
<p>The SprayTec has nine different spray patterns to choose. In actual testing, we found the most useful to be the jet, shower and mist settings — however, the other six settings could conceivably be useful for someone with a specific need for them.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1477" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/spray-pattern.png" alt="spray pattern" width="880" height="693" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/spray-pattern.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/spray-pattern-610x480.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/spray-pattern-360x284.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/spray-pattern-375x295.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/spray-pattern-414x326.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/spray-pattern-295x232.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/spray-pattern-180x142.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/spray-pattern-320x252.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Since we tested garden hoses at the same time that we were testing garden hose nozzles, we were able to test the compatibility of the SprayTec nozzle with six different hoses. The SprayTec was easy to install and remove from all of the hoses we had,  and the combination of the SprayTec and the Craftsman hose was our favorite combination overall.</p>

<p>In terms of reliability, we saw no evidence of leaking from the SprayTec, even after extensive use and dropping it on the ground more than a dozen times. In addition, the SprayTec nozzle came with five rubber washers, which will extend the reliability and useful life of the nozzle.</p>
<p>Finally, the Spraytec nozzle has a lifetime 100-percent money-back guarantee. SprayTec wouldn’t be able to do this, unless they were confident in the long-term reliability of their product.  During our testing, we saw every indication that their confidence was warranted.</p>
<p>Overall, the Spraytec garden hose nozzle is an excellent all-around nozzle. It is compatible with all standard garden hoses, is easy to use and reliable and will work for almost every garden hose-related function we could think of.</p>

<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The SprayTec &#8211; 9-Pattern Hose Nozzle is our top pick due to its durability, build quality and a wide range of useful spray patterns.</li>
<li>The metal body and rubber coating on the handle and tip of the nozzle contribute to the SprayTec’s comfort and durability.</li>
<li>The lifetime money back guarantee gives buyers peace of mind.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="most-durable">Most durable: Bon-Aire &#8211; Original Ultimate</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2108 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Nozzles_Bon-Aire01-1-1.jpg" alt="Bon Aire Hose Nozzle" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>While the SprayTec garden hose nozzle is certainly a durable nozzle and a great choice overall, we found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001L0DFA/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bon-Aire Ultimate Aluminum Hose</a> to be a compelling choice as well.</p>
<h3>Durability and ergonomics</h3>
<p>The first thing we noticed when testing the Bon-Aire nozzle was just how durable it was. In addition to being made with “aircraft-grade aluminum,” the thick-yet-soft rubber made the nozzle essentially impervious to drops on the ground.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001L0DFA/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bon-aire-ultimate-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bon-aire-ultimate-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bon-aire-ultimate-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bon-aire-ultimate-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bon-aire-ultimate-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bon-aire-ultimate-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bon-aire-ultimate-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bon-aire-ultimate-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bon-aire-ultimate.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Most Durable: Bon-Aire - Original Ultimate Hose Nozzle</h3><p>Made from aircraft-grade aluminum and heavy-duty rubber, the Bon-Aire is our most durable pick.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001L0DFA/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>From an ergonomic perspective, there was a lot to like about the Bon-Aire as well. The nozzle is very easy to twist from side to side, which makes turning the Bon-Aire on and off, as well as switching from one spray pattern to another, very easy to do.</p>
<p>Despite being easy to twist, the twisting function never felt loose or unstable and never moved unless done intentionally. The Bon-Aire nozzle also can be turned off by twisting it to the left or right, meaning that you’re never more than three settings away from turning the nozzle off.</p>
<p>Bon-Aire claims that this “two-way shutoff system” is patented. While we weren’t able to independently verify this claim, it is a significant advantage if true — and we have no reason to think otherwise.</p>
<h3>Functionality and reliability</h3>
<p>While the Bon-Aire doesn’t have quite as many spray patterns as the SprayTec, the five it does have should be more than enough for most people.</p>
<p>The jet-spray pattern is most noteworthy, since it was the second strongest jet-spray pattern of all the garden hose nozzles we tested. We measured a distance of 315 inches when the nozzle was held at a height of five feet — second only to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MP3JFHO/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dramm 9-Pattern Spray Nozzle</a> at 324 inches.</p>
<p>The shower-spray pattern wasn’t quite as evenly spaced as the SprayTec, but we found that it should be more than sufficient for most situations where a shower-spray pattern is required.</p>
<p>The remaining three spray patterns probably wouldn’t be used by most people; however, the soaker setting could be useful for potted plants.</p>
<p>In terms of reliability, the build quality of the Bon-Aire nozzle leads us to believe that this nozzle should last for many years, even if it is banged up a fair amount during use. The fact that there is only one moving part increases the likelihood that the Bon-Aire nozzle should work well long-term.</p>
<p>In addition, the one-year warranty, while not quite as impressive as the lifetime warranty offered on the SprayTec nozzle, still indicates that Bon-Aire is confident in their garden hose nozzle.</p>
<h3>What we didn’t like about the Bon-Aire Aluminum Nozzle</h3>
<p>There wasn’t much we didn’t like about the Bon-Aire nozzle. However, we do believe that some will find the form factor somewhat strange and awkward. The front of the nozzle is fairly large and can be uncomfortable for those with smaller or weaker hands who need to frequently turn the water on and off.</p>
<p>However, we think that this is a minor negative overall, and the Bon-Aire Aluminum Nozzle is an excellent, durable option.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Bon-Aire Aluminum nozzle is one of our top picks, thanks to its durability and strong build quality.</li>
<li>Bon-Aire’s two-way shutoff system makes it easy to turn the nozzle on or off regardless of which spray pattern you’re using.</li>
<li>With only one moving part, the Bon-Aire should work reliably for many years.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cost-effective">Budget pick: Gilmour &#8211; Zinc Pistol Grip</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2102 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Nozzles_Gilmour02-1.jpg" alt="Gilmour Hose Nozzle" width="900" height="600" /></p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00002N68C/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gilmour-medium-duty-nozzle-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gilmour-medium-duty-nozzle-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gilmour-medium-duty-nozzle-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gilmour-medium-duty-nozzle-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gilmour-medium-duty-nozzle-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gilmour-medium-duty-nozzle-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gilmour-medium-duty-nozzle-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gilmour-medium-duty-nozzle-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gilmour-medium-duty-nozzle.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Budget Pick: Gilmour - Zinc Pistol Grip</h3><p>A simple and proven garden hose nozzle that is less expensive than our other two top picks.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00002N68C/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If you’re looking for a straightforward and reliable garden hose nozzle without the extra features, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00002N68C/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gilmour &#8211; Zinc Pistol Grip</a> is a worthwhile option. Coming in at a fraction of the cost of our other top picks, the Gilmore garden hose nozzle is an effective and cost-effective garden hose nozzle for less than $5 on Amazon.</p>
<h3>Durability and ergonomics</h3>
<p>Built out of metal, the Gilmour nozzle is fairly resistant to cracks, especially when compared to garden hose nozzles built from plastics. However, we did notice a vulnerability with the trigger. After being dropped a few times, we noticed that it was slightly less stable than when we first started using the nozzle.</p>
<p>While this decrease in stability wasn’t a huge problem in the six weeks we tested the Gilmour nozzle, we think it’s reasonable to expect that the Gilmour nozzle would be more susceptible to breaking or becoming less reliable over time.</p>
<h3>Functionality and reliability</h3>
<p>Unlike our other two top picks, the Gilmour nozzle doesn’t have multiple spray patterns to choose from. Instead, the Gilmour is a “traditional” garden hose nozzle with a jet-spray pattern when fully engaged that becomes less intense and more spread out the lighter you press on the handle.</p>
<p>The Gilmour does have a locking mechanism, which makes extended use easier. The nozzle also has a screw that can be tightened or loosened, depending on what spray pattern you want to lock the Gilmour into. However, the locking mechanism and screw are moving parts that are fairly exposed and run the risk of jamming or otherwise degrading over time.</p>

    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Nozzles_Gilmour_Lock_animated.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Given the low cost of the Gilmour relative to other nozzles, you can go through at least two or three before spending the same amount as you would on our other top picks. In addition, since the Gilmour nozzle is made from metal, it can easily be recycled.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the Gilmour &#8211; Zinc Pistol Grip is backed by a three-year warranty from the manufacturer, so if it breaks within that timeframe, you might even be able to get a free replacement.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Gilmour &#8211; Zinc Pistol Grip is an inexpensive and well-established design that functions well as a basic garden hose nozzle.</li>
<li>While not as durable as our other top picks, the Gilmour is less than half the cost and is still fairly durable.</li>
<li>For those who only need a basic nozzle, the Gilmour is a viable option.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-others">Other finalists we tested</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2097" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Nozzles_NON-Finalist01-1-1.jpg" alt="Group of Hose Nozzzles - Non-Finalists" width="900" height="600" /></p>
<p>The remaining four garden hose nozzles we tested each had their own pros and cons. However, we felt that our top three picks were able to do the job better than these four:</p>
<h3>Dramm 9-Pattern Revolver Spray Nozzle</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MP3JFHO/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dramm revolver nozzle</a> was the closest of the remaining four to be recommended by us. It functions similarly to the SprayTec nozzle and has a unique design feature that allows water to flow by clicking the valve open. The Dramm was also fairly comfortable in our hands and had the longer jet-spray distance.</p>
<p>However, we had concerns about the long-term durability of the Dramm nozzle, specifically due to the use of exposed plastic in both the handle and the nozzle. After dropping the Dramm nozzle several times, we saw scratches and early signs of wear and tear.</p>
<p>Dramm does offer a lifetime guarantee. However, for those who want a multi-function garden hose nozzle, we think the SprayTec (which also has a lifetime warranty) is a better option for your money.</p>
<h3>Orbit Mini XL Fire Hose Nozzle</h3>
<p>We thought we’d like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003LY4I3W/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Orbit nozzle</a> much more than we did after testing. The design was intriguing since water can stream from the nozzle without needing to hold down or lock the handle.</p>
<p>In practice, however, we found the Orbit nozzle to be unnecessarily complex. There are multiple settings that felt redundant during our testing, and the multiple spray patterns available simply didn’t work as well as either the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YQ73WBW/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SprayTec</a> or the Dramm nozzles.</p>
<p>While the Orbit fire hose nozzle was an interesting idea in theory, it was underwhelming in practice.</p>
<h3>Home Depot brass twist nozzle</h3>
<p>We went to our local Home Depot to see what the typical consumer could get by walking into a store (versus having a garden hose nozzle delivered by Amazon). Since brass twist nozzles are among the most popular and highly rated designs, we gave <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/Orbit-5-in-Adjustable-Brass-Nozzle-27928/100659304">Home Depot’s version</a> a shot.</p>
<p>While we did like the sturdy and simple design of this brass nozzle, the Bon-Aire nozzle functioned in a similar manner, while also being easier to use and having more functionality. On top of that, the health issues regarding brass made the Bon-Aire an easy choice over this particular nozzle.</p>
<h3>Home Depot fire hose nozzle</h3>
<p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/Orbit-XL-Stream-Fire-Hose-Nozzle-27991/203019986">Home Depot fire hose nozzle</a> worked similarly to the Orbit fire hose nozzle and our conclusion was largely the same. While we thought the fire hose design was innovative and potentially useful, we ultimately determined that there were simply better options to choose from.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you’re using a garden hose, you’re almost always better off using it with a garden hose nozzle attached. Of the six garden hose nozzles we tested, we found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YQ73WBW/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SprayTec</a> to provide the best overall value and functionality. The SprayTec’s durable build quality, alongside its ergonomic design and nine spray patterns, makes it our top garden hose nozzle overall.</p>
<p>For those focused primarily on durability, our favorite pick is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001L0DFA/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bon-Aire aluminum nozzle</a>. If you’re simply looking for an expensive yet well-built garden hose nozzle with a classic and time-tested design, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00002N68C/?tag=ybdnozl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gilmour nozzle</a> is worthy of consideration as well.</p>
