								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter more than 30 hours of initial testing and over six months of long-term testing, extensive discussions with our 10-person focus group and several conversations with nationally recognized research doctors like Dr. Rapaport, we determined that the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X8ZVY62/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Brookstone &#8211; Shiatsu Neck Massager</a> is the best neck massager on the market. Its premium build quality, simple operation and effective pain relief make it a strong winner.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-chose">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>While researching neck massagers, we discovered that <strong>there isn’t a defining industry leader</strong> or even a group of brand names that are strongly associated with the category. On top of that, there are literally hundreds of options available on Amazon and other stores. For someone with lots of muscle aches and pains, the selection can be overwhelming.</p>
<p>In order to narrow the list down, the first thing we did was eliminate any massagers that didn’t have at least a four-star rating on Amazon. We also looked for massagers that were positively reviewed by at least a few websites, including Consumer Reports and others.</p>
<p>Another decision we had to make was whether to limit the finalists to electric massagers or include one of the many “manual” massagers available as well. After speaking to several doctors, including Dr. Rapaport of Emory University, we decided to stick with electric massagers only.</p>
<p>There were a few reasons that led us to this decision. <strong>Ultimately, it was the fact that</strong> <strong>high-quality electric massagers will produce the therapeutic and medical benefits of a neck massage more consistently</strong>. Manual massagers, on the other hand, require the user to have strength, flexibility and at least some knowledge of technique.</p>
<p>Plus, having an electric massager is just more relaxing in general.</p>

<p>Any time we test a product that has one primary purpose, the most important metric is, of course, how well it performs that task. While that was also true for neck massagers, measuring “pain relief” can be difficult to quantify. One person&#8217;s rating of a muscle ache or pain could be completely different than the next person&#8217;s.</p>
<p>In order to make our data more qualitative and to control for the variety of ways that people rank muscle aches and pains, we gathered a group of 10 different people, with a range of ages and other demographics, as an ad-hoc focus group.</p>
<p>Along with the focus group we looked at the functionality of each massager, how easy they were to set up and transport, as well as the materials used and overall build quality of each massager.</p>
<h2 id="focus-group">Using a focus group to gain insight</h2>
<p>We took an in-depth look into each of our five finalists. However, determining a “best” neck massager can be subjective, since everyone’s opinion on what constitutes a “good” neck massage can differ.</p>
<p>We used the feedback from our focus group participants alongside our own analysis and testing of the products to determine the best option available.</p>
<p>One of the primary benefits of using a neck massager is the fact that, unlike a professional massage therapist, it can be used any time. <strong>Daily or weekly use of a neck massager is key to maximizing the health benefits of neck massage in general, so our focus group questions were oriented around metrics that would indicate (and encourage) regular use of the product.</strong></p>
<p>We wanted to know how much better (or worse) their muscles felt before and after using each massager and whether their overall pain level was reduced in a significant way.</p>
<p>These are the results of our focus group:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3933 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/focus-group-scores.png" alt="focus group results chart" width="880" height="540" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/focus-group-scores.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/focus-group-scores-610x374.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/focus-group-scores-360x221.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/focus-group-scores-375x230.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/focus-group-scores-414x254.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/focus-group-scores-295x181.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/focus-group-scores-180x110.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/focus-group-scores-320x196.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Aesthetics and style</h3>
<p>While the appearance of each neck massager is certainly not the most important measurement used when picking a product, it still makes a difference in the purchasing process.</p>
<p>If the product owner thinks the item looks tacky, more often than not it’ll end up in the closet or a drawer somewhere and will probably be used less often. If, on the other hand, a massager is well-designed, it’ll be more likely to stay in the bedroom or living room, where it will probably be used more often to reduce muscle aches and pains.</p>
<p>Our top pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X8ZVY62/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brookstone</a>, slightly edged out our top portable pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZDOAVHA/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gideon</a>, with respective scores of 7.1 and seven.</p>
<h3>User friendliness</h3>
<p>When we selected our five neck &amp; shoulder massager finalists, we made a point of selecting products that were simple and straightforward to operate to help relieve some pain without causing operation pains.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3936 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brookstone-buttons.jpg" alt="brookstone buttons" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brookstone-buttons.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brookstone-buttons-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brookstone-buttons-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brookstone-buttons-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brookstone-buttons-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brookstone-buttons-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brookstone-buttons-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brookstone-buttons-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brookstone-buttons-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brookstone-buttons-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The only exception, the PurePulse, is still fairly simple to operate once you&#8217;ve read the instructions. However, it is certainly more complicated to operate than the other finalists. This was ultimately reflected in the score the PurePulse received amongst our focus group participants.</p>
<p>In this category, our top portable pick, the Gideon, slightly beat out the Brookstone with scores of nine and 8.9.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>We asked each of our focus group participants to rate the overall design of each massager. Unlike the “aesthetics and style” question, design is more closely linked to general usability, as well as the ergonomics and layout of the neck massager itself. In this category, the Brookstone was far ahead of the pack with a score of 8.5. The PurePulse, on the other hand, only achieved a score of 3.8.</p>
<h3>Pain relief</h3>
<p>Pain relief is, of course, the most important measurement when rating neck massagers. For the purposes of our focus group, we asked our participants to group anything that could be considered “pain relief” — including relaxation, muscle ache reduction, decreases in muscle tension, improved blood circulation, sense of well-being and reduction in any pain they had before using the massager — into this category.</p>
<p>All of our finalists fared reasonably well in this category, but our top pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X8ZVY62/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brookstone</a>, was hands-down the standout.</p>
<h3>Would you use it again?</h3>
<p>This question is somewhat redundant to the rest of the questions we asked, but we really wanted to drive home the point that a neck massager is only beneficial if it is actually used. Once again, the Brookstone led with a score of 8.5. In comparison, the PurePulse only earned a score of 5.6.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-know">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>Neck massagers can be used simply as a basic relaxation tool. If you aren’t looking for specific health benefits, you can choose any high-quality option and likely be satisfied with a pain and stress-relieving neck massage.</p>
<p>However, if you are interested specifically in the health benefits of neck massage or have other health issues that may limit which massagers you’re able to use effectively, it’s important to choose a product that is suitable for you.</p>
<p>One of the most important considerations when choosing a neck and shoulder massager is deciding how you want the pressure applied to the muscles themselves. Among our finalists, there were three different methods: arm strength, body weight and electrical power.</p>
<p>Both the Brookstone and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0754MVRXN/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LiBa</a> use arm strength to generate pressure. While each of these massagers has rotating shiatsu-style nodes, the majority of the pressure is generated by pulling down on the massager using your arms.</p>
<p>For those who are able to properly utilize this design, it offers significant flexibility, both in the amount and the specific location that pressure is applied. However, individuals who don’t have the necessary arm strength or dexterity or who simply don’t want to have to pull while receiving a massage, should probably consider a different option.</p>
<p>The second method of generating pressure is body weight. Both the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZDOAVHA/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gideon</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BOYA2M2/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zyllion</a> use this method.</p>
<p>Another important consideration is portability. If product use will be limited to the home, then any of our finalists are viable options. If you plan on using the neck massager at work or in the car, portability becomes a more important factor.</p>
<p>If you work at a desk, you probably won’t be able to use the Brookstone, since it requires your arms to be used to apply pressure on your neck. While you could certainly take a break from work to use the Brookstone, using the Gideon (which is our top portable massager) is easier and will allow you to continue working at the same time.</p>
<h2 id="health-benefits">The significant health benefits of massage</h2>
<p>There is a growing body of research on the many benefits of massages and the latest research indicates that there are substantial benefits directly associated with massages — neck massages in particular.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone has the means or time, to visit a massage therapist one or more times each week. Fortunately, according to the doctors we spoke to, neck massagers (such as the ones we are reviewing here) provide many of the same benefits.</p>
<p>The reason for this is fairly straightforward: Within the neck, there is something known as the “neurovascular bundle”. Stimulating this bundle, for example with a shiatsu-style neck massager, leads to reduced stress levels, increased relaxation and decreases in inflammation, among other benefits.</p>
<h2 id="massage-benefits">Massage benefits for specific health conditions</h2>
<p>We spoke with several medical experts. Most notable was our conversation with Dr. Mark Rapaport, a <a href="http://www.psychiatry.emory.edu/faculty/rapaport_mark.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chairman at the Emory University School of Medicine</a> who has published more than 180 peer-reviewed studies for a variety of prominent publications. Our conversation with Dr. Rapaport was also instrumental in conducting our review of the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/foot-massagers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best foot massagers</a> as well.</p>
<p>In addition to providing health benefits to generally healthy individuals, neck massages also provide significant health benefits for a wide variety of health conditions.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><div class="ybd-expert"><div class="ybd-expert-outer"><img class="  ybd-expert-headshot" data-src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/avatar-nophoto.png" /><div class="ybd-expert-inner"><h4 class="ybd-expert-title">Expert Consulted:</h4><h5 class="ybd-expert-person">Dr. Mark Rapaport</h5><p class="ybd-expert-person-title">Chairman - Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Emory University School of Medicine</p></div></div></div></span></p>
<p>Our conversation with Dr. Rapaport educated us to the fact that individuals with a generalized anxiety disorder were recorded to have dramatically lower cortisol and stress levels, with increases in oxytocin levels and a general sense of well-being, after receiving a neck massage.</p>
<p>Another excellent example of how neck massages can provide health benefits comes from the studies which indicate that massages lead to decreased stress levels in women who have recently undergone a C-section. The corresponding decrease in cortisol levels and increased levels of oxytocin are excellent both for the mother and her newborn child.</p>
<p>There is also a growing body of research indicating that massages can have a significant impact on inflammatory markers. This helps reduce the time needed to heal from injuries or surgery and could potentially have dramatic benefits for individuals suffering from autoimmune disorders such as arthritis, Crohn’s disease and even allergies. Dr. Thomas Best of Ohio State University is one of the leading researchers in this field.</p>
<p>While the specific benefits are still being researched, one thing is clear: Neck massages offer significant benefits both for healthy individuals and those suffering from a wide range of medical conditions.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brookstone-Shiatsu-Neck-Massager-Pound/dp/B06X8ZVY62?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brookstone &#8211; Shiatsu Neck Massager</a> was our top pick overall for a variety of reasons. In addition to feeling like the most “premium” product among the finalists, the versatility of the massager alongside the simplicity of operating it made the Brookstone an approachable and effective tool.</p>
<p>One of the things we liked most about the Brookstone was the ability to directly control where the massager was working and the precise intensity at any given moment on your muscles. While massagers like the Gideon and the Zyllion can technically be placed anywhere along the neck, shoulder or back, the Brookstone allowed for much more precise and fluid control.</p>
<p>That added control means we could also target very specific muscles on our neck and back. This was ideal for focusing on tough knots that would otherwise be difficult — if not impossible — to reach.</p>
<p>This was also the case with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0754MVRXN/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LiBa neck massager</a>. However, there were other issues with the LiBa that took it out of contention for the best choice overall. <strong>Most notable and significant was the fact that</strong> <strong>the material on the Liba started to wear down after just a few weeks of testing</strong>. Compared to the Brookstone, we predict that the Liba would last far less time with regular use.</p>
<p>Another thing we particularly liked about the Brookstone was the visual and physical aesthetics. In addition to looking and feeling like a high-quality product, the material itself was sturdy and stable, while also having just enough “give” to make the product flexible and easy to use.</p>

<p>The controls of the Brookstone were very simple as well. After putting your arms through their respective openings, there are three buttons on the left side: one to turn the massager on and off, one to turn the heat on and off and one to reverse (or lock) the direction of the shiatsu nodes. That being said, it’s worth noting that all of our finalists were essentially as easy to operate.</p>

<h3>Things we didn’t like</h3>
<p>While the Brookstone was hands-down the best product we tested, there were a couple of things we didn’t like.</p>
<p><strong>First and most significant for those who are elderly or have a medical condition, the Brookstone massager requires moderate arm mobility and strength</strong>. While a healthy 30-year-old will have no problem in this regard, it could potentially be an issue for others.</p>
<p>If you’re concerned about the strength and mobility needed to use the Brookstone, here’s a good rule of thumb: if you can easily put on a heavy sweater, you should have no problem using the Brookstone.</p>
<p>The other issue we had with the Brookstone was the lack of portability. In addition to requiring a wall outlet to operate, we would have liked the cord itself to be a little longer. We found that using a surge strip or extension cord in conjunction with massager made things much easier.</p>
<p>If portability is a major concern for you, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XJTVPXU/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brookstone does offer a wireless version of their massager</a>, which can usually be purchased for about $30 more on Amazon.</p>
<h3>Findings from the focus group</h3>

<p>Our focus group largely matched our own analysis and testing of the Brookstone. The most notable numbers in the focus group were the “user-friendly” and “pain relief” scores, which were 8.9 and 8.7 out of 10, respectively.</p>
<p>On the user-friendly metric, individuals in our focus group liked that there weren’t lots of buttons or settings and no one needed to read the instruction manual that came with the massager. The three icons are self-explanatory and universal as well.</p>
<p>For pain relief, which is, of course, the single most important metric, users in our focus group thought the kneading shiatsu-style massage did a particularly great job of loosening and relaxing the shoulder and neck muscles.</p>
<p>The Brookstone also did a solid job in the mid and lower back area, however, both our focus group and our own testing indicated that the massager performed best in the neck and shoulder area.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Brookstone is the most effective massager we tested.</li>
<li>The build quality of the Brookstone exceeded the other massagers, particularly the LiBa, which looks very similar.</li>
<li>This model requires a wall outlet. If you want a portable model, try the Brookstone Cordless.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZDOAVHA/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gideon neck massager</a> is another strong choice and may even be better for those who have medical conditions or are otherwise unable to exert the arm strength and mobility that the Brookstone massager requires.</p>
<p>The Gideon is controlled with a simple switch located about halfway down the power cord. Controlling the Gideon is easy as well, with only three options to choose from.</p>
<p>One of the biggest downsides to our top pick, the Brookstone, is the fact that it needs to be plugged into the wall (or any AC outlet) and that the included power cord is only about three feet long. The Gideon massager, on the other hand, has a much longer power cord (about seven feet long) and also comes with a car charging adapter.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZDOAVHA/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gideon-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gideon-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gideon-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gideon-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gideon-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gideon-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gideon-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gideon-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gideon.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Most Portable: Gideon - Massage Pillow</h3><p>The Gideon has simple controls and can be easily used on the couch, in the car, and in an office chair.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZDOAVHA/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>This, along with the Gideon’s smaller size, makes the Gideon far more portable in practice. The Gideon is best for those who want to have a neck massager outside of the home — particularly in the car and office. The Gideon, with its “pillow” shape, is also well-suited for use while laying down.</p>
<h3>Things we didn’t like about the Gideon</h3>
<p>The Gideon neck massager is a strong product and is probably the best option for some people. However, there were a few things we didn’t like about the Gideon that prevented it from being our top pick overall.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the Gideon simply isn’t as effective at relieving pain. While the Gideon certainly works well, particularly in office chairs and while laying down, it wasn’t able to penetrate as deeply or precisely as the Brookstone. If you’re looking for the most accurate and powerful neck massage, the Brookstone is the way to go.</p>
<p>We also found that while that Gideon certainly does work for the neck, it stands out the most on lower parts of the back. <strong>In other words,</strong> <strong>the Gideon is better suited for those who want to use it in their car, bed or office chair</strong>.</p>
<h3>Findings from the focus group</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3942 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gideon-use-on-back.jpg" alt="gideon use on back" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gideon-use-on-back.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gideon-use-on-back-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gideon-use-on-back-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gideon-use-on-back-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gideon-use-on-back-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gideon-use-on-back-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gideon-use-on-back-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gideon-use-on-back-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gideon-use-on-back-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gideon-use-on-back-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The Gideon’s focus group scores were strong but not outstanding across the board, with all scores but one somewhere in the seven to eight — the one exception being user-friendliness. This is particularly noteworthy for those who are less technologically-savvy and also makes the Gideon a great gift for a grandfather or grandmother who prefers simple electronics.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Gideon massager works in both the home, car and office.</li>
<li>The Gideon is less precise but easier to use for those with reduced arm strength and mobility.</li>
<li>The Gideon has the highest user-friendliness score among our finalists, with a score of nine out of 10.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-others">Other finalists we tested</h2>
<p>The other neck massagers we tested all had their strengths and weaknesses. While any of them are viable options, we determined that both the Brookstone and the Gideon offer a better value overall.</p>
<h3>PurePulse</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3945 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pure-pulse.jpg" alt="pure pulse" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pure-pulse.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pure-pulse-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pure-pulse-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pure-pulse-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pure-pulse-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pure-pulse-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pure-pulse-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pure-pulse-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pure-pulse-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pure-pulse-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LOUW1WU/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PurePulse</a> was the most unique product we tested and most people probably won’t be comfortable using a product like this in the home.</p>
<p>Unlike the other neck massagers we tested, the PurePulse massager uses electrical pulses to stimulate the muscles, which in turn essentially “resets” the muscle, allowing them to relax. <strong>The PurePulse is FDA-approved and in fact, many massage therapists and chiropractors frequently use them on their patients</strong>.</p>
<p>The Pure Pulse is fairly inexpensive when compared to the other massagers on our list and is also the most portable — the four AA batteries the massager uses lasted several hours during our testing.</p>
<p>There are three major downsides that prevented the PurePulse from being one of our recommended products.</p>
<p>First, the adhesive pads will need to be replaced from time to time and most people will want to have their own pads for sanitary reasons. <strong>Second,</strong> <strong>our focus group indicated that this was the least user-friendly massager, with multiple settings available.</strong> Finally, the massage itself is also somewhat disconcerting for some people, since electrical pulses cause muscles to tense and loosen without conscious control from the person using the massager.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the PurePulse does work well and is utilized by healthcare professionals all over the world. It’s worth giving a try if you’re willing to experiment.</p>
<h3>Zyllion</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3946 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zyllion.jpg" alt="zyllion" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zyllion.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zyllion-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zyllion-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zyllion-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zyllion-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zyllion-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zyllion-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zyllion-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zyllion-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zyllion-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BOYA2M2/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zyllion</a> was similar in many ways to the Gideon massager. However, both in our own testing as well as the feedback from our focus groups, we found that the Zyllion didn’t perform as well as the Gideon across the board.</p>
<p>If you’re trying to decide between the Zyllion and the Gideon, we think you’re better off with the Gideon (it’s usually a few dollars cheaper <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZDOAVHA/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">on Amazon</a> as well).</p>
<h3>LiBa</h3>
<p>Those looking for a budget option may appreciate the value offered by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0754MVRXN/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LiBa neck massager</a>. The LiBa looks similar in many ways to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X8ZVY62/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brookstone</a>. However, the LiBa costs anywhere from one-third to one-half the cost of the Brookstone.</p>
<p>When the pressure was applied using the arm straps, the massage rollers would often get stuck. This was definitely not meant to do while sitting at a chair or couch. When sitting and using the massager on your back, the rollers sometimes moved the actual leather casing, causing the rollers to get stuck and twist the leather. You would have to manually move realign the rollers back to the mesh portion that they belonged in.</p>
<p>While the LiBa is worth considering at that price point, it’s important to remember that there are significant differences between the two. Most important is the diminished build quality we found when testing the LiBa massager. <strong>By the end of our testing period, the LiBa was already starting to look somewhat worn and we doubted it would last more than a year or two with regular use.</strong></p>
<p>After about eight months of testing this item, a wire came loose and it hung within the right roller portion. The rollers broke the wire causing the red lights to go out. Shortly after the Liba stopped working altogether.</p>
<p>The shiatsu nodes in the LiBa also aren’t as effective as they are on the Brookstone. As a result, putting significant amounts of pressure on the LiBa causes the nodes to slow down significantly, particularly when compared to the Brookstone.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The benefits of a neck massager are numerous and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X8ZVY62/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brookstone massager</a> offers the best combination of pain relief, blood circulation, relaxed muscles, ease of use and value from the five finalists we tested. If you want a high-quality product that will last for years to come, the Brookstone is a strong choice.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more portable massager that is easier for those with limited arm strength and mobility to use, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZDOAVHA/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Gideon</a> is a strong option as well. Ultimately, the key is to find a product that you&#8217;ll actually use so that you can maximize the numerous health benefits associated with regular massages.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we picked our test products</h2>
<p>When we first started researching the electric foot massagers market, we discovered that there were lots of products available, but relatively few that were highly-regarded. This meant that the first step was eliminating products that had significantly negative reviews on Amazon.</p>
<p>We also limited our focus to foot massagers that were mentioned positively on forums, professional reviews, and Reddit threads. Finally, we spoke with <a href="http://www.psychiatry.emory.edu/faculty/rapaport_mark.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Rapaport</a> &#8212; a nationally-recognized doctor with experience in psychology, behaviorial science, and the benefits of massage therapy &#8212; as well as other doctors who helped us determine which electric foot massagers (as well as which <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-neck-and-shoulder-massager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neck massagers</a>) were best suited to have a positive impact on health.</p>
<p>We also strongly prioritized massagers with heating functionality &#8212; however we did make an exception for the MedMassager, both because of the significant number of positive reviews it had as well as the fact that it is designed to work differently than Shiatsu and heat-based foot massagers.</p>
<p>Once we narrowed the list, we looked for massagers that had the best combination of features and specs, and ordered the five products from that curated list to test in our office.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Once we had our list of five finalists, we assessed each of them individually based on a number of criteria, including ease of use, effectiveness, and features offered. We also took weight, portability, and power usage into account.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3957 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart.png" alt="feature comparison chart" width="880" height="561" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart-610x389.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart-360x230.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart-375x239.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart-414x264.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart-295x188.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart-180x115.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart-320x204.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>In general, we were looking for foot massagers that were easy to operate, comfortable on our feet, and had a substantially positive impact on how our feet felt after five to 10 minutes in the massager.</p>
<p>Secondary metrics we looked included the power usage of each foot massager while in use, the weight of each massager, whether the massagers had a handle for easier portability, and whether there was an automatic shutoff built in.</p>
<p>While these features did have an impact on our selection of finalists as well as our top picks, they were secondary to the actual operation and benefits of each electric foot massager.</p>
<h3>Foot massage focus group</h3>
<p>During testing, we realized that massaging preferences can be fairly subjective. Some people prefer intense ones that really get the knots out, while others prefer a more gentle and soothing massage; possibly with some heat to relax their muscles.</p>
<p>While we did our best to assess each machine as objectively as possible, ultimately we realized that having a larger sample size, which included a wider range of people, would help us find the best possible product.</p>
<p>We came up with five different metrics and asked 10 people to rate each of the electric foot massagers on a scale of one to 10 using those metrics. We also made sure each person had walked a lot that day, and felt like they could really use a foot massage.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3958 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results.png" alt="focus group reults" width="880" height="608" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results-610x421.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results-360x249.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results-375x259.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results-414x286.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results-295x204.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results-180x124.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results-320x221.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Aesthetics</h3>
<p>For this category, we asked each member of the focus group to rate the appearance of the foot massager. If they were to own the massager in question, would they put it somewhere easily visible in a living room or bedroom, or hide it away when not in use?</p>
<h3>User Friendliness</h3>
<p>For the user friendliness rating, we asked each member of the focus group to describe how easy it was for them to figure out how to use the massager. This included both turning the massagers on and off as well as adjusting the massager to their desired settings.</p>
<h3>Comfort</h3>
<p>We distinguished “comfort” from the “pain relief” metric. For comfort, we asked our focus group to limit the rating to their comfort without the massagers turned on.</p>
<h3>Pain Relief</h3>
<p>This is the key measurement, and was used to compare how each person felt before and after they used the foot massager.</p>
<h3>Want to use it again?</h3>
<p>We used this metric as a way to gauge the “overall” score each member of our focus gave to the massagers. We specifically asked them not to consider the cost when providing this rating.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the survey made it clear that the </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JKS3HXS?th=1/?tag=ybdftm-20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RENPHO – Shiatsu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the favorite when taking into account all categories. Our testers found it to be the most attractive looking massager, the most comfortable and very user friendly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Relaxzen was a close runner up, ranking as well as the RENPHO in terms of aesthetics and pain relief. It ranked highest of our finalists in terms of being user friendly. However, our testers found it less comfortable than our top choice and were less likely to use it again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MedMassager also stood out for the significant pain relief it offered — even if the aesthetics were rated lower than average by our panel of testers.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 update</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We originally chose the Brookstone as our top pick, but it has been discontinued since we first published this article. For our update, we once again read through professional reviews, Reddit threads and Amazon reviews to find an additional three products to test in our office.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A focus group of four testers of varying ages (one of whom had completed a 5k the same day) provided us with their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">impressions and numerical rankings of the additional products. We compared these with the scores of our original models to determine our top choice.</span></p>
<h2 id="what-to-think-about">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>If you decide to purchase a foot massager, the first step is to determine what the primary purpose of the massager will be. If you’re getting one for a specific medical condition &#8212; such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or an inflammatory disease like arthritis &#8212; there are certain features you’ll want to make sure your choice includes.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you simply want a foot massager as a way to relax after a long day, you can be a bit more flexible about which massager you choose. You may want to consider an <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-anti-fatigue-mat/">anti-fatigue mat</a> for all-day standing relief. Insoles may help relieve the source of your pain too. See our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-insoles/">insoles review</a> to see if its something else you should add.</p>
<p>Once you know the primary purpose of what you&#8217;re looking for, the next step is to find the one that offers the features you want. Some of the features you should think about include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the massager heat up?</li>
<li>Are there intensity settings?</li>
<li>Is the massager easy to carry?</li>
<li>How noisy is the massager?</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll also want to decide whether you want a foot massager that is designed to improve circulation in your foot, or more of an “all-purpose” option. If your top priority is improving circulation, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IF89MY/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MedMassager</a> is hands-down the best massager on the market. This one uses a design that oscillates a platform to massage instead of Shiatsu style rollers.</p>
<p>If you want more of an all-purpose massager, it’s worth looking into the specific features and settings of each machine. In general, a product that provides heating, variable levels of pressure, and a shiatsu-style massage will be effective for general wellness.</p>
<p>It’s also worth considering the weight and portability of the foot massager as well &#8212; particularly for the elderly or those with health conditions. Having a handle can make a massager significantly easier to move around, and of course the lighter a product is, the easier it is to move around when needed.</p>

<p>One interesting consideration that we didn’t realize until we started testing was the challenge of using MedMassager in an apartment, hotel, or anywhere else that your floor is someone else’s ceiling. That’s because the MedMassager works by creating fairly strong vibrations &#8212; which can potentially be felt, and heard, from the floor below.</p>
<h2 id="health-benefits">The health benefits of massage</h2>
<p>In order to learn more about the benefits of massage, we spoke with Dr. Mark Rapaport of the Emory University School of Medicine. Dr. Rapaport has an extensive history of studying how massage helps, and is the Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Emory University.</p>
<p>Dr. Rapaport also has more than 180 articles published in peer-reviewed publications and has received grants from nationally recognized organizations, including the National Institute of Mental Health.</p>
<p>We spoke with Dr. Rapaport on the phone, and got some great insight into the significant and wide-ranging impact of massages on the mental, physical, and psychological health.</p>
<h3>General benefits</h3>
<p>According to Dr. Rapaport and the research studies he has published, massages have a number of substantial health benefits. These range from reductions in anxiety and irritability to a decrease in unhealthy levels of cortisol. Massage can also modulate immune function and increase levels of the “feel-good” hormone oxytocin.</p>
<p>Massage therapy is increasingly recognized as a powerful medical treatment, with benefits for everyone from cancer patients to reducing post-pregnancy discomfort. Even if you’re in great health, massage can significantly increase your quality of life.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Rapaport, massage in healthy individuals can decrease allergic responses and potentially harmful inflammation in the body, and can even improve temporary bouts of depression in otherwise healthy individuals.</p>
<h3>Medical benefits</h3>
<p>For individuals who have particular medical needs, massage can have an even more profound impact. For example, women who have recently given birth via “Cesarean section” (otherwise known as a C-section), can experience <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27502807" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly lowered levels of anxiety and pain</a>.</p>
<p>Individuals with severe flus and other systemic infections benefit from massages due to an increase in lymphatic flow, which helps to flush out the disease more quickly. This is also the case for terminally-ill individuals who are receiving palliative care.</p>
<p>Perhaps most interesting impact massage has on individuals suffering from one of the many forms of cancer. According to the doctors we spoke to and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26991721" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several peer-reviewed studies</a>, massage has a statistically significant impact on the vital signs of cancer patients.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Rapaport, a NIH study studying fatigue in cancer survivors also indicated a marked decrease in fatigue and other symptoms. Those studies are being followed up with a more detailed look into inflammatory markers, and how massage might improve those as well.</p>
<p>The bottom line is this: massage has been unequivocally proven to have substantial health benefits both for healthy individuals, as well as those with a wide range of medical conditions.</p>
<h2 id="health-benefits-foot-massagers">The health benefits of foot massage</h2>
<p>One concern that people considering a foot massager bring up is whether a mechanical option can effectively do the job of an actual massage therapist.</p>
<p>While there are certainly benefits associated with having an actual person performing the massage, the doctors we spoke to said that many of those translate to mechanical foot massagers as well.</p>
<p><strong>In fact, since the specific massages are complex, and the shiatsu/oscillation is so well programmed in certain mechanical massagers, in some cases individuals can be even better off with a mechanical option.</strong></p>
<p>That being said, a highly-trained massage therapist will always be better than a mechanical massager. But when comparing the one-time cost of a foot massager to a massage therapist, it is certainly more cost-effective to have a mechanical foomassager &#8212; if nothing else than to supplement relatively infrequent massages from a licensed therapist.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best overall: RENPHO &#8211; Shiatsu</span> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23199" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu.jpg" alt="Renpho - Shiatsu massager" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When choosing products to test for our 2019 update, we knew we wanted at least one finalist with features similar to our original top pick (which has since been discontinued). Just like our original choice, the </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JKS3HXS?th=1/?tag=ybdftm-20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RENPHO – Shiatsu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> effectively combines Shiatsu-style rollers with air compression and heat to relax the muscles in your feet and remove tension that built up during the day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RENPHO ranked nearly equal in comparison to the Brookstone by our panel of testers. Even before we tallied the final scores, the impression this model left on our testers made us fairly certain it would earn the highest ranking. They liked the way it looked and the customizable experience meant that each of our testers found their own “sweet spot” after playing with the varying modes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The touch buttons are large enough and spaced far enough apart that you can easily control them with your feet. However, our testers preferred the remote control. The programmable settings &#8211;low, medium and high&#8211;are straightforward and easy to understand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you combine the variables of kneading intensity and air compression, the RENPHO caters to all users. Those who prefer a strong massage might combine a high intensity with high air compression, while those who are more sensitive might prefer low or medium settings.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JKS3HXS?th=1/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="" data-srcset="" width="" height="" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Top Pick: RENPHO - Shiatsu</h3><p>Ranked highest by our focus group, the varying selections in terms of kneading intensity, air compression and heat gives the user a customizable massage experience.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At only eight pounds, the RENPO is easy to move from room to room. Our testers liked the aesthetics, saying they would be willing to leave it out in the living room if they were having company over. It’s easy to clean, with a hard plastic shell that can be wiped down.  The cloth cover (where you insert your feet) is detachable and machine washable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing to note is that while it can accommodate different size feet with no adjustments needed, it reaches its limit at a men’s size 12. Two of our testers who wear a men’s size 12 reported that the space was just big enough to fit their feet, and was a little tight getting inside.</span></p>
<h3>Aesthetics</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RENPHO is priced moderately compared to our other finalists, and consistently scored high across the board in our focus group. In fact, the average score of 8 was far ahead of the rest of the pack, with Relaxzen coming in second place with an average score of 7.8, and the overall average for the seven massagers coming in at 6.9. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our testers agreed that while the size might necessitate putting the RENPHO away before guests arrive, the design was attractive enough to leave it out and the massager could seamlessly integrate into any room. </span></p>
<h3><b>User friendliness</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When researching products, we found that some had needlessly complicated controls and functionality. While customizability and flexibility are valuable, overdoing it on something relatively simple like a electric foot massager adds more difficulty than benefit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operating this machine was fairly straightforward, with clearly marked low, medium and high settings for knead and air intensity. Heat is as simple as turning on and off, and the time setting is color coded to easily determine which setting (15 or 30 minutes) is on. The remote control corresponded exactly to the settings on the massager, with LED lights to see which setting is active.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone in our focus group had an easy time using this foot massager, which is why it had the second-best score among our finalists </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(behind only the Relaxzen and tied with the</span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IF89MY/?tag=ybdftm-20"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">MedMassager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<h3><b>Comfort</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lining is fairly comfortable, although the polyester fabric isn’t as plush as the Relaxzen. You can feel the massagers underneath your feet before you turn it on, but they aren’t knobby. Our testers used it without socks for a fair comparison with other finalists; however, the manual recommends wearing socks (which does make it more comfortable).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The massager as a whole received a score of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">8.1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of 10 for comfort. While that seems slightly low for a top pick, it was the best scoring massager overall, and was well-above the average of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">7.0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>Pain relief</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pain relief is one area where this machine particularly shined, and was one of the primary factors in our naming it our winner. After all, the purpose of a foot massage is to make your feet feel better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we used the foot massager, the consensus was that the air compression and the Shiatsu-style kneading massage worked particularly well to improve blood flow and relax the muscles. After about 5 minutes using this machine, we felt pretty great.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our impressions were backed up by the focus group as well. This massager earned a score of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">8.9</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of 10 from our 10-person focus group, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which was the highest rating of all the remaining finalists</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>Want to use it again?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all four of the other metrics ranking so high, it came as no surprise that our everyone in our focus group was interested in trying it again in the future &#8212; leading to a score of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">9.6</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of 10.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before conducting the focus group, we already had this foot massager marked as our likely top pick based on our own testing and assessment. However, </span><b>with a total score of </b><b>43.7</b><b> out of 50 in our focus group, the </b><b>RENPHO’s</b><b> place as our top pick was solidified.</b></p>
<h3><b>Things we didn’t like</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, we found this massager to be the best option available. While it was relaxing, there were a couple of issues we noticed while testing that are worth mentioning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most significant issue is that it takes a while for the heat to fully activate. During our testing, we noticed that it took about 30 seconds to start heating up, and another minute and a half (for a total of two minutes) before the heat was significant enough to have a positive impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a foot massage that might only be five to 10 minutes, this is somewhat of an issue. Our solution was to let the massager heat up for about a minute before putting our feet in, which was an effective workaround.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we would have preferred that the massager heat up more quickly, it is reasonable to expect heat to take some time to turn on, and none of the other massagers we tested were any better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, those with big feet might not be comfortable with this machine. The massager itself is rated to fit individuals with shoe sizes up to 12</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.5</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, however </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">two</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the people in our focus group had a shoe size of 12 and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mentioned that it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> felt a little too “snug”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This massager is an excellent choice, and is easily the best foot massager we tested thanks to its effective foot massage technique, attention to style and aesthetics, and comfort and usability.</span></p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JKS3HXS?th=1/?tag=ybdftm-20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RENPHO – Shiatsu</span></a> foot massager was our top pick thanks to its effective foot massage technique.</li>
<li>The massager is easy to use, with clearly marked buttons.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only significant downside is the size limit, fitting only up to a men’s size 12.</span></li>

<h2 id="best-for-circulation">Best for circulation: MedMassager &#8211; 11 Speed</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3272 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/med-massager-1.jpg" alt="MedMassager massager" width="900" height="596" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IF89MY/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MedMassager</a> is very popular online and is frequently recommended by doctors as a way to improve circulation in the feet.</p>
<p>Unlike the other massagers we tested, this device uses oscillations to stimulate the skin and muscles to improve circulation instead of Shiatsu-style kneading massage with rollers. This results in a distinctly different foot massage experience.</p>
<p>This device has 12 settings, one through 11 and an “off”, which makes operation fairly straightforward. Operating the massager is as simple as twisting the knob to the desired intensity and putting your feet on the rubber pad. This machine has many intensity levels but it only has one oscillating motion, and no heat function.</p>
<p>According to the company that makes the MedMassager, the massager’s lowest setting operates at 1,000 RPM and the highest operates at 4,000 RPM. This means there is significant variance between each of the settings, making it easy for anyone to choose one that is right for them.</p>
<p>When first using this, we found that the oscillations were a little intense and took some getting used to. However, once we got past the initial surprise, there was no question this massager was relaxing the muscles not only in our feet, but in our lower legs as well.</p>
<p>One feature that is often overlooked is the “Arch Bar” located across the top of the massager. According to the doctors we spoke to, this bar is used to directly stimulate the tendon in the arch of the foot &#8212; known as the plantar tendon.</p>
<p>For individuals that have periodic or frequent foot and leg cramps, the stimulation of this tendon can provide significant relief. Even if you don’t have cramps or another medical condition (such as in our case) using the bar felt great.</p>
<p>One other minor detail that we appreciated was the fact the company has their website and phone number printed on the top of the massager.</p>

<p>While they won’t be earning any style points for that one &#8212; especially when compared to the Brookstone &#8212; it is useful to have that information available for those who have questions or problems with their massager. For the elderly or sick, this can be a particularly significant convenience.</p>
<p>Finally, this device has excellent build quality, which means it will last for many years. In fact, the it comes with a one-year warranty, with an option to purchase a three-year warranty for $29.99, or a lifetime warranty for $39.99.</p>
<p>Even if you choose not to purchase the extended warranty, the fact that such a robust one-year warranty is included speaks volumes about the quality of the MedMassager.</p>
<p>While this machine isn’t as relaxing or “therapeutic” as our top pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EP5EC2I/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brookstone</a> foot massager, we felt quite relaxed once we were done with our 10 minute session.</p>
<h3>Things we didn’t like</h3>
<p>While there are plenty of positive things to say about the MedMassager, there are a few negatives that stood out to us during our testing and focus group.</p>
<p>The first, and perhaps most significant issue is primarily limited to individuals that live in apartments (or anywhere else that your floor is someone else’s ceiling).</p>
<p>Since the this deviceworks by oscillating at a very rapid rate, vibrations are also transferred to the floor. What was surprising was just how significant those vibrations could be, to the point that we could feel them even when standing 15 feet away.</p>
<p>If you live in an upstairs apartment, the oscillations could be prohibitively loud and irritating for your downstairs neighbors &#8212; particularly if the floors aren’t that thick. If you do decide to get one of these and you live in an apartment, make sure you ask your downstairs neighbor if they can hear when the massager is being used.</p>
<p>Another design feature we would have liked to see was a handle. Unlike the Brookstone electric foot massager, the MedMassager doesn’t have an easy way to carry it. That, in conjunction with its 11 pound weight, could pose a problem for some users.</p>
<p>Finally, the it&#8217;s a specialized product. That has several implications, such as a lack of a heat function and just a general inability to be an all-purpose foot massager. This device is great for those who are looking for exactly this type of product, but others might find it lacking in certain respects.</p>
<h3>Focus group results for MedMassager</h3>
<p>This one came in second place, with a final score of 38.5 out of 50. The areas where the it was weakest were in aesthetics and comfort, with a score of 6.8 and 6.1 respectively.</p>
<h3>Aesthetics</h3>
<p>With its utilitarian appearance and somewhat-tacky large-font phone number printed on top, looks like it would be better suited for a doctor’s office instead of a living room. That’s because for most of the product’s history it was used in a doctor’s office.</p>
<p>The MedMassager has been used by doctors, physical therapists, and other medical professionals for years. It’s only relatively recently that this device has been marketed directly to consumers.</p>
<p>While this led to a somewhat weak “aesthetics” score, it’s worth noting this device&#8217;s appearance is also a reflection of the trust medical professionals have placed in it over the years.</p>
<h3>Comfort</h3>
<p>Compared to the Brookstone, as well as the other foot massagers we tested, the MedMassager is not as comfortable. This is largely due to the fact that the other foot massagers we tested allow you to sit back with your feet flat, whereas this one is set up on an angle.</p>
<p>Again, this is a reflection of the MedMassager’s primary role as a medical device in the past, so it’s worth taking the 6.1 comfort score with a grain of salt. That being said, if you’re looking for a purely relaxing, “spa-like” foot massager, the MedMassager might not be the way to go.</p>
<h3>User friendly</h3>
<p>One area where the this device particularly stood out in our focus group was it’s user friendliness score At 9.1 out of 10, this was the highest user friendly rating of all the massagers we tested &#8212; including out top pick, the Brookstone.</p>
<p>This rating matches our own assessment of the MedMassager. Operation is extremely straightforward, with a single knob turning anywhere from off to 11 for varying degrees of intensity.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3273 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/med-buttons-1.jpg" alt="MedMassager controls" width="900" height="596" /></p>
<h3>Pain relief</h3>
<p>Despite its simple operation, the MedMassager proved to be effective at pain relief; as reflected in its 8.2 out of 10 score. Once again, the MedMassager was second only to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EP5EC2I/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brookstone</a> (9.2).</p>
<p>One frequent comment from our focus group was that the pain relief from the MedMassager was mostly noticed after the massager was over. This stands in contrast to the other massagers, which provided pain relief right from the beginning.</p>
<p>The MedMassager is an excellent &#8212; if somewhat specialized &#8212; foot massager. If you’re looking for a foot massager that improves circulation, this one should be at the top of your list.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IF89MY/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MedMassager</a> is the best for improving circulation</li>
<li>The massager doesn’t have certain important features, such as a carrying handle, a heat function, or kneading massage capabilities.</li>
<li>This device is the most specialized of the massagers we tested, which means it is ideal for those who need its specific features, but won’t be right for everyone.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-foot-massagers">The other products we tested</h2>
<p>The remaining three foot massagers we tested all had one thing in common: they were decent, but not outstanding, products. There wasn’t anything glaringly wrong with them, but they didn’t excel neither.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relaxzen</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23198" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2.jpg" alt="Relax Zen " width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Relaxzen was our second-highest rated massager in the aesthetics category; it looks like a pair of soft slippers and all our testers agreed they would feel comfortable leaving it out in a living room or bedroom. If you’re looking for a foot massager on a budget, this would be our recommendation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mechanics are more simplistic than our other finalists. The only variables it offers are a change of direction and the choice of adding heat. Our focus group gave it only a 6.75 rating for comfort, but it rated slightly above average with a score of 8 for pain relief. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best Choice Products</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23197" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu.jpg" alt="Best Choice Products - Shiatsu" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our focus group testers jokingly referred to the </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0170XC7XM?th=1/?tag=ybdftm-20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best Choice Products – Shiatsu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as “Darth Vader” due to its sleek black appearance. Its heavy weight and large size made it less aesthetically appealing than our top pick, although one tester pointed out that it would fit right in with a modern design nail salon. It rated average for all categories, with mostly scores of 7 across the board. It has an open toe design, meaning that you don’t have to place your toe in an enclosed space as with some of our other finalists.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One issue we noted was that the remote control needed to be held very close to the panel in order to change the settings. The terms on the remote control and the device control panel don’t align; it took some deduction to figure out that “personality” on the remote control was the “custom” setting on the device. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the Best Choice offers a decent massage and is easy enough to use but our focus group were relatively lukewarm about this model.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3959 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runners-up-1.jpg" alt="foot massager runners up units" width="900" height="600" /></p>
<h3>uComfy</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DSICT1Y/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">uComfy</a> did an all-around decent job. Its appearance is fine, but feels somewhat dated, and the foot massage itself was close in quality to the Brookstone. However, the controls on this device didn’t work great, and there wasn’t much variation between the settings.</p>
<p>In our focus group, the user friendliness score was 6.8, which was towards the bottom of the list. It performed in the mid-seven range for the rest of the metrics, and was the closest of the remaining three to be considered an “honorable mention”.</p>
<h3>Homedics Deep Kneading</h3>
<p>We were disappointed by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DPMDWAA/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Homedics massager</a> because there were several very positive reviews. It is the simplest and most straightforward device we tested featuring Shiatsu style kneading massager rollers. However, we found the quality of the massage to be underwhelming.</p>
<p>The underwhelming foot massage was also supported by our focus group, which gave the Homedics massager a comfort and pain relief rating of 5.1 and 5.5 respectively.</p>
<h3>3Q</h3>
<p>The 3Q was similar to the uComfy in the sense that the controls don’t offer much variation. Features are basically limited to turning kneading, air pressure, and heating on or off without any variation in intensity. There are also two programs to choose from, without any description about how they differ.</p>
<p>In the focus group, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H8Z7DIM/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">3Q</a> received a score of 6.5 out of 10; the lowest of all our finalists. We think this score matches with our own experience as well.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discontinued products</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brookstone &#8211; Shiatsu</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We originally named the </span><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EP5EC2I/?tag=ybdftm-20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brookstone &#8211; Shiatsu </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">our top pick, but it is no longer available. In addition to looking the best, it was easy and straightforward to operate and provided the right amount of pressure and intensity on pressure points on our feet. Shiatsu-style rollers, air compression and heat work together to knead out muscle tightness in the feet and promote overall relaxation. Unsurprisingly, our top pick for the 2019 update possesses similar features.</span></p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The health impact of foot massagers are significant and scientifically proven. Whether you are an average healthy adult or you’re recovering from a pregnancy or even a chronic illness, foot massagers can improve your blood pressure and circulation, reduce unhealthy levels of cortisol from your body, and provide you with a general sense of well-being.</p>
<p>The other three products we tested did an acceptable job. However, if you’re going to spend $100 or more on a foot massager, we think its worth getting a product that will perform well for many years.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of publishing this article, the </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JKS3HXS?th=1/?tag=ybdftm-20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RENPHO – Shiatsu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> falls in the middle price range of the massagers we tested. Given its higher ratings in terms of above average ratings in every category we considered, we think it is more than worth it. This is especially true given the adjustable settings and strong ability to personalize the experience, more so than our other finalists.</span></p>
<p>If you want a more medically-focused product and aren’t as concerned about getting the “spa treatment”, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IF89MY/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MedMassager</a> is a proven product that has been used by doctors and physical therapists for years to improve circulation.</p>
<p>If you enjoy relaxing to massages from time to time, or have a medical condition which requires regular massages, foot massagers can be a valuable and cost-effective supplementary device.</p>
