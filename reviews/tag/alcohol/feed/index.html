								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent a month using the best insulated tumblers side by side with water bottles and travel mugs. We found that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RTIC &#8211; 30 Ounce Tumbler</a> gives you all the same insulation performance and better leak-proofing at less than half the price of the best-known <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YETI &#8211; Rambler</a>. If you&#8217;re willing to pay, YETI does give you a slide-open spout that&#8217;s less annoying, though you run the risk of dribbles and drips.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>There are over 20,000 listings on Amazon for &#8220;insulated tumbler.&#8221; YETI is the undisputed brand king, with a tumbler that&#8217;s now even more popular than their ultra-rugged (and expensive) coolers. As with all things that are mass-produced and insanely popular, the number of competitors (and imitations) has expanded just as quickly as YETI&#8217;s profit numbers.</p>
<p>We read and watched dozens of YETI tumbler reviews and comparisons to narrow the mile-long list down to four of the best insulated tumbler cups. <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-tumbler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wirecutter</a>, as always, provides some in-depth testing, and <a href="https://www.savingfreak.com/best-tumbler-yeti-vs-rtic-vs-orca-vs-ozark-trail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saving Freak</a> compares the costs and benefits of the various copycat brands. GearJunkie, like most sites, only <a href="https://gearjunkie.com/yeti-rambler-tumbler-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passes a verdict on the YETI</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY5Kryq62SQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What&#8217;s Inside</a> tried to do a controlled test, but wound up destroying one of their samples.</p>
<p>In our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/" rel="noopener">water bottle review</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/" rel="noopener">travel mug review</a>, we&#8217;ve seen Klean Kanteen and Hydro Flask go head-to-head competing for a position in our tests. <b>For the first time, Hydro Flask offers something substantially different from Klean Kanteen: a bigger cup that actually matches what everyone else is offering.</b></p>
<p>Between the various well-known brands that are just barely different from YETI, RTIC is budget-friendly and offers a flip-cap lid that at least compares in functionality to the Mag-Slide on the new YETI lids.</p>
<p>CamelBak has an interesting contender in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LA4PUMc/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KickBak</a>, and it fared well in Wirecutter&#8217;s insulation test, but customer reviews of the lid are scathing so we skipped it.</p>
<p><b>We decided to test only the 30-ounce tumblers in this review, since they&#8217;re the most popular and represent a type of drink carrier that&#8217;s really different from a </b><a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/" rel="noopener"><b>16-ounce travel mug</b></a><b>.</b> It also allowed us to compare them directly to our favorite 30-ounce insulated <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/" rel="noopener">water bottle</a> to see what difference that narrower opening makes. We selected representatives from a range of prices to see if insulation quality really changes when you buy a $40 tumbler instead of a $16 tumbler.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-get">Should you get a tumbler, water bottle or travel mug?</h2>
<p>Like <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/#best-insulated-water-bottle" rel="noopener">insulated water bottles</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/" rel="noopener">travel mugs</a>, an insulated tumbler will keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold. The vacuum insulation also stops that slippery condensation from forming on the sides and leaving a puddle on your furniture.</p>
<p>The choice between a travel mug and an insulated tumbler is a tricky one. In most ways, these products serve an identical purpose for most people: They maintain temperature, and they&#8217;re convenient to sip from (no screw-top like an insulated water bottle).</p>
<p>The big difference with a tumbler is the lid. <b>While a travel mug is still designed for easy-access sipping, many tumblers don&#8217;t have any kind of stopper at all to slow down your sipping pleasure.</b> The lids are simple and easy to clean, but they offer far less insulation than good travel mugs. The best travel mugs keep your coffee hotter and your laptop (not to mention pants) safer from spills.</p>
<p>A tumbler is also available in much larger sizes than popular travel mugs. You can buy a thermos or a giant insulated water bottle, of course, but those aren&#8217;t easy to sip from.</p>
<p>So, the ideal setting for an insulated tumbler is on a hot afternoon where you want to keep your drink insulated, but you&#8217;re more worried about convenience more than spills. Drinking something cold poolside on a scorching-hot day is a perfect example. Reading on the patio in the early morning with a cup of coffee is also a case where the tumbler works better than an ordinary cup.</p>

<b>Size:</b> The most popular tumblers hold around 30 ounces, and among the friends and coworkers who use them daily, that was unanimously the preferred size for sipping cold beverages or ice water.</p>
<p><b>Spout stoppers:</b> Flip-up stoppers and slide-over stoppers are the two common approaches to keeping a tumbler closed. Look closely at what you&#8217;re buying, though: Many tumblers are made with a few different lid styles if you look for them.</p>
<p><b>Base diameter:</b> Do you need to keep your tumbler in a car cup holder? Check the size just to be sure, but most cup holders are designed to hold extra-large restaurant-size paper cups, which these tumblers mimic.</p>
<p><b>Painted, coated or brushed finish:</b> Color coordination is a nice benefit of painted or powder-coated tumblers, but they&#8217;ll show signs of wear eventually. Brushed stainless steel looks great even if it gets scratched, and there&#8217;s nothing that will peel off after a few years.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Everyday use tests</h3>
<p>Our tester used these tumblers in place of his usual water bottle and coffee mug for two weeks. At work, around the house, in the car and at the park, they all kept beverages handy. The 30-ounce size was bigger than our testers preferred for a morning cup of coffee, but for keeping hydrated (or keeping a rum and coke chilled) it&#8217;s just about perfect.</p>
<p>The differences between the mugs seemed smaller and smaller as we got used to them. The flip-lid from RTIC doesn&#8217;t flop around as much as most travel mug lids in this style, which was our biggest concern. The slide closures on the YETI and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0769CQYVS/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican &#8211; Traveler</a> were easy to use, though not any more so than the flip lid.</p>
<h3>Cleaning test</h3>
<p>Cleaning these tumblers and lids was easy, even by hand. Compared to popular travel mugs like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZI5XNO/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo &#8211; West Loop</a> with its springs and levers on the inside of the lid, a tumbler lid is dead simple to clean.</p>
<p>What about the dishwasher, though? <a href="https://www.rticcoolers.com/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTIC</a> and <a href="https://www.hydroflask.com/caring-for-your-hydro-flask/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hydro Flask</a> say that you should hand-wash only, while <a href="https://www.yeti.com/en_US/are-yeti-tumblers-dishwasher-safe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YETI</a> specifically claims their tumblers will survive dishwashing. (Pelican doesn&#8217;t comment either way.) Given the number of outright contradictions we&#8217;ve seen over our years researching vacuum-insulated products, we&#8217;re not surprised by either answer. Extra-hot drying cycles will make the metal expand and contract, so there&#8217;s some risk to every mug, but the biggest problems are usually with color coatings and glued-on plastic pieces.</p>
<p>If you want to keep your insulated tumbler looking and working its best, hand-washing is the safe way to go. But it seems clear that one trip through the washer won&#8217;t destroy the insulation if you find a week-old smoothie in the back of your truck.</p>
<h3>Insulation test</h3>
<p>We took our four tumblers and our <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07996C56J/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">top-performing insulated water bottle</a> and filled them all with 28 ounces of hot water. Temperature ranged from 190 to 194 degrees Fahrenheit, which is on the upper end of coffee temperature after brewing.</p>
<p>We then checked on the heat loss for the next six hours, and again at 12 hours. The chart below models the results for easy comparison. (The raw data had a difference of four degrees Fahrenheit in starting temperature. The chart shows an adjusted starting temperature, but the temperature change from one sample to the next is as recorded.)</p>
<div id="visualizer-18187-1920464695" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-18187"></div>
<p>The differences between these tumblers is so small that it would be impossible to tell them apart. The real difference is between the tumblers and the water bottle: because the vacuum-sandwich stainless steel walls provide the most effective insulation, the wide lid of a tumbler is a real liability. Even the fact that the Hydro Flask tumbler has no seal to keep steam in made only a tiny difference in the test.</p>
<p>We also added the results from an old test of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp 16-ounce travel mug</a> to this chart for comparison. <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/#how-we-tested" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The testing conditions were different</a> (starting temperature was lower, and we didn&#8217;t test for as long), but we&#8217;ve normalized the starting point on this graph so the sample intervals line up. It&#8217;s clear that even a small narrow-neck bottle keeps heat better than the tumblers.</p>
<h3>Ice test</h3>
<p>In our research, we saw so many variations of the ice test, we were a little surprised that there wasn&#8217;t some kind of consensus. Instead, it seemed that every test had a slightly different result. The real problem with an ice test is getting around the margin of error: It&#8217;s hard to know if you&#8217;re measuring the temperature of the water or the ice cubes. (Infrared thermometers are also often used, and those <a href="https://blog.thermoworks.com/thermometer/how-to-use-an-infrared-thermometer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only read the surface temperature</a> of the water, not the temperature of the whole bath.) It&#8217;s also tricky to ensure that all your ice is the same temperature going in.</p>
<p>We ultimately decided not to repeat an ice test because the insulation performance is so clearly demonstrated by a hot-water test. If heat coming into the cup is any different than heat escaping, the amount of time it takes for that difference to show is measured in hours. If you really want the best insulation possible to keep ice frozen all day long (or if you want to keep small amounts of liquid nitrogen, or something similar), a sealed narrow-neck bottle is still your best bet.</p>
<h3>Leak test</h3>
<p>In our travel mug tests, we went as far as putting the mugs into a spin dryer to see if they would leak in the most extreme circumstances. By comparison, most tumblers will spill some of your drink when you tip them sideways. We filled each tumbler with water and turned them upside down to see if any of the stoppers actually prevent leaks.</p>

Don't put this in a bag with a laptop, but if you knock it over it's not going to dump your drink.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The RTIC&#8217;s lid is surprisingly secure, given the competition. You can usually hold this cup upside down, or even leave it sitting on a table upside down, and not see more than a few drops. As soon as you shake it or drop it on the floor, though, all bets are off. (The more fluid you have inside, the more explosive the spill will be when the flip-cap pops open.)</p>
<p>Of the two brands that are trying sliders, YETI is fairly successful, while Pelican&#8217;s lid is a hot mess. It&#8217;s not clear exactly what the issue is, since the basics of the mechanism seem the same, but the Pelican lid always dribbled a stream of water when we turned it upside down. The YETI &#8220;Mag Slider&#8221; lid isn&#8217;t as magical as it sounds, but it works fairly well to stop anything more than occasional drips.</p>
<p>Hydro Flask gives you nothing to work with for spill prevention. If you really want the color options and tapered form factor they&#8217;re offering, they do have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07943NMYX/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a straw lid option</a> that might be better at stemming the flow of sticky drinks in case of an accident.</p>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RTIC &#8211; 30-Ounce Insulated Tumbler</a> is the best bargain in this lineup, and it&#8217;s our top pick overall. The stopper actually prevents some spills, and compatible accessories are easy to find. This is an updated version of the RTIC, but the old <a href="https://www.amazon.com/RTIC-30-oz-Tumbler-Pink/dp/B019D9HESO/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">all-metal-no-stopper version</a> is still available.</p>
<p>Without buying and trying out these tumblers, it&#8217;s easy to make assumptions about performance. &#8220;Maybe the steel is thinner,&#8221; you think. &#8220;Maybe the vacuum is actually less of a vacuum.&#8221; Our testing shows, though, that If there&#8217;s anything fancy that other brands are doing to improve theoretical insulation performance, the giant plastic lid is an equalizer that levels the playing field.</p>
<p>In every case we&#8217;ve seen (even among top-class insulating mugs and bottles from Zojirushi, Thermos and Hydro Flask) a big lid means mediocre insulation. Improving the insulation of a tumbler without making the lid area smaller is like adding better insulation to your house while the doorways and windows are sealed with plastic sheets.</p>

The plastic base is a drawback, but the price makes this a real winner. If you're picky enough about durability or insulation that a budget model is a turn-off, you should probably check out a travel mug or thermos anyhow.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>So, what is the difference that brings the price down? The plastic &#8220;foot&#8221; on this new RTIC is less tough than the YETI if you drop it on a hard surface, but the difference in price more than makes up for that.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important consideration when it comes to recommending a bargain-priced tumbler is availability: <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-30-Ounce-Double-Wall-Vacuum-Sealed-Tumbler/171452737" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ozark Trail</a>, <a href="https://www.target.com/p/zak-designs-174-30oz-stainless-steel-tumbler/-/A-52542332" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zak! Designs</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Steel-Tumbler-Insulated-Greens/dp/B01AZB6TQW/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BEAST</a> and a dozen other companies are also producing similar tumblers at low price points, but inventory (and new brands) come and go seasonally. RTIC has been around since the beginning of the fake-YETI game, and availability online is always good. That popularity also means that accessories (like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0779M1CBK/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this handle</a>) will actually be designed to fit this cup.</p>
<p>The main feature that bumped this tumbler to the top of our lineup is the spill-proof lid. If you don&#8217;t want the flip-cap to stick up into your face when you&#8217;re drinking, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019D9HESO/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">older version of the RTIC</a> with no stopper is going to be just as good at insulating your drink. Note that the outer dimensions are slightly different; old-style handles don&#8217;t fit new-style mugs with the plastic foot.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The RTIC &#8211; 30-Ounce Insulated Tumbler is a bargain-priced drink vessel that will keep your beverage just as cold (or hot) as other brands.</li>
<li>This flip-up lid stopper is the only option we found that really prevents leaks, though it&#8217;s still not safe to put in a bag.</li>
<li>RTIC compromises on quality very slightly, with some plastic parts, but the vacuum insulation is all that it needs to be.</li>

If you want something better than a budget-priced tumbler, there&#8217;s no way to beat the original <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YETI &#8211; Rambler</a>. YETI didn&#8217;t technically invent this category of drinkware (similar insulated travel mugs have been around for a very long time), but they created a new market with big 30-ounce tumblers targeted at outdoor enthusiasts who loved their coolers for camping and tailgating.</p>
<p>This is not a Yeti thermos: You can easily beat this kind of insulation with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07996C56J/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">narrow-neck bottle from Klean Kanteen</a>, for about the same price. If you want the easy-filling and easy-sipping convenience of a tumbler, YETI has the same performance drawbacks as the other brands.</p>

The magnetic slider is more convenient than a flip-up stopper, but it doesn't make this cup leakproof. The main reason to pick this tumbler is if you've gotta have that logo.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The one category YETI manages to squeak ahead of some competition is in spill prevention. The Rambler&#8217;s slide cover actually stops most (but not all) leakage and only lets drops escape. In comparison, the Pelican will dribble out a stream. The RTIC is more leak-proof, but the YETI really is ready for those times when your friend fires up the motor on the jet boat and you haven&#8217;t finished your drink.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a YETI for coffee that&#8217;s a little different than the classic 30-Ounce Rambler, there&#8217;s also the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BM72ZXT/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YETI &#8211; 14-Ounce Rambler Mug</a> for about $10 less. The small amount of coffee it holds compared to the large lid surface means it&#8217;s only going to keep your coffee hot for about 45 minutes, but compared to six minutes for an open-top ceramic mug for some people this is exactly what they&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>The other case where this is an obvious pick is if you&#8217;re buying a gift. Nothing says &#8220;I only sorta love you&#8221; like a knock-off version of a trendy product. If you know someone who actually wants a YETI, the price difference is worth it.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The YETI &#8211; Rambler is the product that got everyone buzzing about giant insulated cups, and they&#8217;re still the most recognizable.</li>
<li>The price of this tumbler is high, and it doesn&#8217;t keep your drink any hotter or colder than others.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll get drips if you hold the YETI upside down or drop it on the floor, but this lid is good at keeping your drink inside.</li>
</ul>

In many ways, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0769CQYVS/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican &#8211; Traveler</a> hits the optimal price to performance ratio in this lineup, but that doesn&#8217;t make it the best buy.</p>
<p>Pelican is a company that makes quality flight cases for sensitive equipment, and in many ways they&#8217;re like YETI: a small company who established a niche with a specific product, then started building a brand around it. This tumbler is a bit different than the rest, and if you love the screw-on lid with the bigger spout area it&#8217;s a good buy.</p>
<p>The slide-cover lid isn&#8217;t as good at sealing against leaks as YETI&#8217;s lid, though. It dribbles a small stream if you hold the cup upside down. If you really want to keep your drink in, the flip-up lid on the RTIC (or the old-style <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071KW6MRN/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican Snap Lid</a>, which you can still buy in 2018) is a better choice.</p>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079445ZGP/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hydro Flask &#8211; 32 Ounce Insulated Tumbler</a> is a notable contender from one of the big names in the world of insulated drinkware. Many publications give it a win for the sleek profile and brand reputation.</p>
<p>About the only feature that really stands out, though, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07943NMYX/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the straw lid</a>. If you want your insulated tumbler to look like a Big Gulp, this is the way to go. It&#8217;s a hefty price tag, though: The straw lid was a $13 accessory for a $40 tumbler when we checked. The basic lid that comes with the tumbler is claimed to be designed for good insulation, but without even a stopper to keep heat from circulating in and out it doesn&#8217;t make any difference.</p>
<p>If you or the person you&#8217;re buying for already have a Hydro Flask water bottle, buying a matching tumbler for use around the house is a nice touch. They&#8217;re good looking tumblers, but they don&#8217;t perform any better than the other brands to justify the huge price difference.</p>

If you primarily want an insulated cup to drink coffee from, we think a sealed and better-insulated travel mug is a smarter pick than a tumbler. If you want to carry water around with you, likewise, water bottles are better at making water portable while keeping it colder (or hotter.)</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re just looking for the functionality of the classic SOLO party cup with the benefit of better insulation, the double-wall stainless steel vacuum-insulated tumbler checks all the right boxes.</p>
<p>The brand everyone knows is YETI, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">our best buy pick from RTIC</a> beats that cup in two ways: first, RTIC is selling their cup at less than half the price with no loss in performance. Second, the RTIC has a flip-up spout stopper that actually keeps your drink inside, even if you turn it upside down and shake it.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t like the flip-up lid or if you don&#8217;t like supporting imitation products, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the YETI &#8211; Rambler</a> has an updated lid that&#8217;s pretty good at keeping drinks inside without sticking a flap in your nose.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After two weeks testing six top coolers with 50+ wine bottles, we found a freestanding dual-zone model by EdgeStar that stood out as the best wine cooler.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter two weeks of testing with over 50 bottles of wine, we found that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MDXTDTB/?tag=ybdcool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EdgeStar &#8211; 34 Bottle</a> outperformed its competition to earn our pick for best wine cooler. The EdgeStar not only chilled bottles the quickest, it also kept them at the most consistent temperature. The EdgeStar is a bit pricey, but the extra investment is a benefit for any level of wine drinker.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>When searching for a wine fridge to purchase, a quick search can reveal an overwhelming amount of results. When choosing which coolers to test, we spent hours researching how they work, where to store in your home or office, how to properly store wine bottles and best practices for cooling and serving wine.</p>
<p>For this review, we focused on freestanding and countertop units to test the best variety of wine coolers.</p>
<p>Once fully educated on wine coolers we took to top appliance retailers like Amazon, Home Depot, Sears and Best Buy to research all the options available. Online reviews from users are a huge help when looking through all the options, but in some instances, we had to read between the lines for what was a user error (based on our research) and what was a real concern. Most reviewers had questions or comments surrounding the specifics on where and how to store the wine fridge, rather than about the wine they were about to store.</p>
<p>After deciding which products to test and characteristics to look for, we headed to the local wine shop to buy cases of wines in bottles of all shapes and sizes. We tested factors like ease of assembly and how long it took the cooler to get to storage temperature. Next, the fun part began with testing the capabilities of cooling both red and white wines. Finally, we checked for accuracy and consistency throughout the unit.</p>

<h2 id="why-and-how">Why and how to chill wine</h2>
<h3>Preservation</h3>
<p>The majority of the wines you will find at your local store are best enjoyed within a few years of the label date. Is it realistic for the average wine drinker to store bottles of wine for more than a year? The short answer is no. If you are looking to store wines for maturing or expensive fine wine, it&#8217;s best to invest in a professional grade wine cellar.</p>
<p>When storing wine for preservation (even if just a few days or weeks), the following best practices are recommended:</p>
<p><strong>Cooled, not chilled:</strong> Ideal storage temperatures for white wine are between 49-55 °F and for red wine between 62-68 °F. Going lower in temperature can increase the risk of wine freezing, which can also push the cork out. Going higher can risk aging the wine more quickly, which may result in flat flavors.</p>
<p><strong>Secure and steady:</strong> Keeping the temperatures consistent and not allowing a quick drop or rise is best for preserving your wines. Also, be sure to set the feet on the base of the wine fridge so it doesn’t rock or shake the wine.</p>
<p><strong>Lights out:</strong> Natural and artificial lights can be harmful to prolonged storage. Try to find a naturally dark area in your home for your wine fridge.</p>
<p><strong>Humidity:</strong> For those who store wine long term, they need to ensure the cork doesn&#8217;t try and spoil the wine.  As long as the room has a humidity between 50-80% (which most homes do) and you store your wine on its side, this won’t be a problem for your short term storage.</p>
<h3>Proper storage temps for red and white wine</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6774 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ideal-wine-temp.jpg" alt="Ideal Wine Temperatures" width="900" height="684" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ideal-wine-temp.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ideal-wine-temp-610x464.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ideal-wine-temp-768x584.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ideal-wine-temp-300x228.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ideal-wine-temp-295x224.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ideal-wine-temp-885x673.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ideal-wine-temp-360x274.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ideal-wine-temp-375x285.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ideal-wine-temp-414x315.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ideal-wine-temp-320x243.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>It is important to understand that storing and serving temperatures are not the same. White wines store best between 49-55 °F and red wine between 62-68 °F. Most experts agree that if you are storing your wine in a dual zone wine fridge, you should take your bottle out of the wine fridge about 30 minutes prior to serving in order to bring it to optimal temperatures.</p>
<p>Place the red on the table or in a decanter to warm up slightly and the white should go in a bucket of ice to cool slightly. This best practice will also allow the wine flavor to develop as you drink the bottle.</p>
<p>If you are using a single zone wine cooler, it is recommended to store both red and whites at 55 °F. Reds can still go right to the table to serve but your white wine should probably spend about 30 minutes in the kitchen fridge to be brought down to serving temperature before placing it in a bucket of ice and pouring.</p>
<h3>Benefits of a wine fridge vs regular fridge</h3>
<p>Some may ask why they can’t store wine in their normal refrigerator. In doing our research, we were surprised to find the lengthy list of reasons why other than simply lack of storage space. We found that fridges don’t have the humidity control that&#8217;s best for wine storage. Additionally, they vibrate when running, have a quick drop of temperature and lower internal temperatures. The biggest shocker was that it could affect the taste of the wine.</p>
<p>The average temperature of your home refrigerator is 40 °F which is too cold for your wines, plus it will also dry out the cork. If the cork of your bottle dries up, the wine will absorb smells in your fridge such as onions, garlic and your favorite takeout, resulting in the altered flavor of your wine.

<p>It seems that wine cooler options can be as vast as the wine industry itself. Based on our research we found that there are three important factors to consider before picking out the best unit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where will you store your wine fridge?</li>
<li>What is the average temperature of the room you choose?</li>
<li>Will you be storing red wine, white wine or both?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Freestanding vs. built-in vs. countertop coolers</h3>
<p>We will start with freestanding units since we found that they dominate the market when we were searching for options. These units are standalone, plug in and go coolers that can be added to any room. Freestanding units are designed with the vent on the back of the unit and need two to four inches of space for proper ventilation, therefore they cannot be placed in a cabinet or directly against the wall.</p>

<p>Built-in units are best for those who would like to have their wine fridges directly installed with their cabinetry or inline with any appliance currently in place. Because they are designed with the vents in the front, there is no need to worry about the surrounding space. However, a good thing to consider is that built-in units require the most work to install. Standard sizes are available that may fit most spaces, but for some, the units may require a complete renovation of your space to properly fit the height and width of your current counters.</p>
<p>If space or ability to easily move your wine cooler is a concern, we recommend considering <strong>countertop freestanding units</strong>. These fridges are compact, designed to hold only a few bottles of wine and sit directly on the counter, table, bookshelf or wherever suits your needs best.</p>
<h3>Compression vs. thermoelectric technology</h3>
<p>To keep temperatures consistent, you will want to keep your unit in a colder room if you can. This is due to the internal range of temperatures inside the units. Single zone units are typically designed to have a choice of internal temperatures with a range of about 20 degrees (45 °F &#8211; 65 °F degrees) and dual zones can be as low as a 10-degree difference per zone. If the room is warm or humid, you will probably not be able to reach those lower temperatures for properly storing your white wines (depending on the technology the unit uses).</p>

<p>For rooms that tend to be warmer, your best bet would be choosing a compression unit. Compression wine coolers use traditional refrigerant and compressors to keep the fridge chilled. In most compression units, you will find the minimum temperature range to be lower than other units. This is due to their ability to keep the internal temperature consistently chilled. Even in a warm room, the compression unit would be able to reach temperatures as low as 40 °F. However, this may also result in a higher energy bill, so we recommend avoiding warm areas, such as a backyard bar or a garage.</p>
<p>For more moderate temperature rooms, thermoelectric wine fridges are an energy-efficient choice. How do they work? Thermoelectricity uses electric currents that pass through ceramic cooling nodes to chill the tiles facing into the unit. A fan then pushes the chilled air through the unit. The reason thermoelectric units are better for moderate temperature rooms is that they typically only lower temperatures about 20 °F from the room temperature itself. For example, if your living room is consistently at 75 °F, your thermoelectric unit could struggle to stay consistently at the storage temp of 55 °F.</p>
<p>Outside of their temperature limitations, both compression and thermoelectric units have their pros and cons. We will explain further in the individual tests below.</p>
<p>An important note for those who live in California: according to the <a href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/appliances/2014rulemaking/documents/comments/AHAM_Comments_Appliance_Efficiency_Rulemaking_technical_changes_2014-11-2014_TN-72524.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California Energy Commission (CEC)</a>, not all thermoelectric units have passed the Appliances Energy Regulations. Since we are based out of Southern California we tested both compression and thermoelectric units that have passed all CEC Regulations.</p>
<h3>Single vs. dual cooling zone units</h3>
<p>If you are looking at keeping one type of wine over the other, single zone units might be best fitted for you. They are single compartment wine coolers that can only be set to one internal temperature.</p>
<p>Conversely, dual zone units are best if you like to store both red and white wines in your fridge. They have isolated compartments with separate temperature controls to store wine at their ideal temperature.</p>
<p>We tested both single and dual zone units for this review.</p>
<h3>Other important features to consider</h3>

<p>According to reviews and usability, we found the following features are most important when choosing the best wine cooler for your home:</p>
<p><strong>Built-in lock:</strong> This may be an important safety feature to consider if you have children in the house.</p>
<p><strong>Insulated door and/or tempered glass:</strong> Wine and sun do not mix. To safeguard your wine, it is best to choose a unit with tempered glass.</p>
<p><strong>Adjustable feet:</strong> Not all floors are created equal. If your wine fridge does not sit flat, it could increase the vibration of the unit (which can disturb the wine sediment).</p>
<p><strong>Storage shelving size:</strong> All wine fridges will store your standard sized bottle. If you enjoy larger bottles of wines (champagne) or your favorite bottle has a longer neck, it may not fit on most shelves. Consider a fridge with a basket or larger top shelf.</p>
<p><strong>Bottle capacity:</strong> Our research found that once the owner was able to store wine correctly, their collection grew quickly. We recommend going with one size up from what you think you would need as chances are you will fill your fridge quickly.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Assembly</h3>
<p>Once all of the wine fridges were delivered, we tested out of the box assembly and convenience to set up. Four out of the six units came ready to plug in and go. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MDXTDTB/?tag=ybdcool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EdgeStar</a> and NewAir came with the handle separate from the unit, so you could decide if you would like it on the left or right side of the cooler. In addition to the handle, the buyer can adjust the hinges on the door to open in the direction they choose. We loved this option to be able to best fit your room design.</p>

Per the instructions, all the compression units needed 24 hours before starting to store wine. This is because they needed time to stabilize the internal temperature of the fridge. Surprisingly, we found that after one hour, each of the compressor units were down to the cooling temperatures we set. However, we still recommend waiting for the full 24 hours to ensure that internal temperatures are steady.</p>
<p>Thermoelectric units cooled and stabilized temperatures faster than the compression units. Per the instructions for these units, the fridge needed two hours to cool. However, we found they were ready in only one hour. In doing further research and testing, we found that these wine fridges needed the full two hours in order to stay cool when adding bottles and opening the door.</p>

<p>Once both the compression and thermoelectric fridges were given enough time to regulate the internal temperature, we readjusted and started our tests. For dual zone coolers, we set the chilling temperatures to 49 °F for white wine and 62 °F for red wine. For single zone fridges, we set the temperature to 55 °F. We chose those temperatures because they were the lowest recommended storage temps for each wine type.</p>
<p>We used cases of both red, white and sparkling wines at room temperature. Bottles read 70 °F before being added to the fridges. The temperature was checked every 15 minutes for two hours. We did this by using a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-digital-meat-thermometer/" rel="noopener">kitchen thermometer</a>. We also tested the inside air temperature with an infrared thermometer.</p>
<p>For our top three performers, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MDXTDTB/?tag=ybdcool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Edgestar</a>, <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/frigidaire-18-bottle-wine-cooler-black/4277500.p?skuId=4277500" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Frigidaire</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GY7AGG6/?tag=ybdcool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Haier</a>, we found that red wine can be chilled within an hour. The EdgeStar &#8211; 34 bottle wine cooler was the quickest at 30 minutes. The Frigidaire &#8211; 16 bottle wine fridge was a close second at 45 minutes and the Haier &#8211; 16 bottle wine cellar only needed 60 minutes.</p>
<p>Since white wine needed to drop at least 20 degrees, we had to wait a bit longer. We found that the EdgeStar came out on top again, only needing 45 minutes to cool the wine to the optimum temperature. The Haier cooled white wines in an impressive 60 minutes, while the Frigidaire needed almost two hours. All of the other fridges we tested needed a full two hours to bring both red and white to storage temperature.</p>

<h3>Accuracy and consistency</h3>
<p>We first checked if the temperature was the same as what was on the display, using both a kitchen thermometer and infrared thermometer. Then, we checked the consistency of the temperature from the top, bottom, left and right of the inside of each cooler.</p>
<p>All instructions included a disclaimer that temperatures can vary two degrees from what is on the display. The Frigidaire dual zone temperature was two degrees cooler than what was listed, but that temperature was overall consistent throughout the fridge. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MDXTDTB/?tag=ybdcool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EdgeStar</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GY7AGG6/?tag=ybdcool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Haier</a> were both accurate and consistent across the board.</p>

<p>The single zone coolers didn’t maintain temperatures as consistently throughout the unit. In fact, they ranged as much as four degrees from top to bottom and side to side. When conducting research and reading reviews, we found that this was a major concern and flaw with some designs.</p>
<p>How did the temperatures vary? The location of the fan or vent was the coldest place in the fridge. Where the fan entered the unit, temperatures were accurate to what was set. Farther away from the fan, the temperature rose an average of three degrees, even in the smaller units.</p>
<p>Another variable to consider is how much the temperature fluctuates when the door of the wine fridge is opened. This is important if you find yourself rearranging your collection or adding and taking out bottles frequently. On average, the coolers increased five to seven degrees and took about 30 minutes to reach chilling temperatures again after they were opened. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GY7AGG6/?tag=ybdcool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Haier’s</a> cooler showed the biggest fluctuation of temperature when opening the door for 60 seconds. It also took nearly 20 minutes to return back to its original temperature.</p>

[Product update 8/16/2019: The original Edgestar wine cooler we tested model #CWF380DZ has been replaced with the #CWF340DZ. The storage capacity and dimensions are exactly the same, despite the new one having only six pull out shelves instead of six. The new model also has the controls moved from the outside of the unit inside. It still has dual temperature zones boasting identical except one degree cooler specs for the top zone. All links on this post have been updated to the new model.]
<p>The <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MDXTDTB/?tag=ybdcool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EdgeStar- 34 bottle wine cooler</a> </strong>is the largest, heaviest and most expensive cooler that we tested, but the results spoke for themselves. There is only one step to putting this unit together. The door handle comes separately, but easily attached by peeling back the insulation and removing the caps for an easy install. You can also choose to place the handle on the left or right side with the adjustable hinges. Once the handle was on, we found that the cooler reached the cooling temperature in just about two hours.</p>
<p>Once the EdgeStar was ready to chill your wine, it only took 30 minutes for reds to get to the proper storing temperature and 60 for whites. This is half the cooling time of other units we tested.</p>

Not the cheapest option on the market, but well worth the price tag for all the added features.</p><a href="" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>The attention to detail was unmatched compared to other units, which includes the dual temperature displays that were easy to adjust and read with a blue light in both zones. Structurally, it included a whopping three-inch separator between the red and white zones to ensure proper cooling. Other units only had a one-inch separator between the red and white wine zones.</p>
<p>Other things that stood out about the EdgeStar unit included the sleek design and shelving. Other units had steel shelving that pulled right out, while the EdgeStar offers a wood stopper with wrapped shelves that pull out just enough to quietly grab the bottle. A favorite feature of the EdgeStar was the design of grooves in the shelving. It accommodates bottles placed forward or backward, helping to optimize space and create more room on the top shelf for those larger bottles of wine.</p>
<p>We couldn’t find many things to whine about when testing this unit. If we must dig, there are no up or down arrows on the temperature controls, you simply push the “top display” or “bottom display” button until you reach the end of the temperature range for it to start over. The upper unit, for white wines, has a range of 41-54 °F and the bottom unit, for red wines, has a range of 54-64 °F. Since this is the biggest unit we tested, just make sure you have the proper amount of space for placement and ventilation.</p>
<p>More than just a fan favorite, the EdgeStar &#8211; 34 bottle wine cooler will impress your guests and store your wine with a professional level of accuracy</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The EdgeStar &#8211; 34 bottle wine cooler offers impressive timing to bring wine to storing temperatures. Reds were ready after a quick 30 minutes and white wines only 60.</li>
<li>A favorite feature was the oversized shelving with wrapped wire and an edge wood stopper, keeping your bottles safer than other units.</li>
<li>This dual zone cooler has a three-inch separator between zones to ensure proper temperature and includes blue display lights to help you search through both your red and white wines.</li>

<p>We loved that in addition to the six sliding shelves, there is a bottom basket that had plenty of space for the non-standard bottles of wine or champagne. The NewAir also has an impressive temperature range, going as low as 39 °F.</p>

<p>When conducting our research, we found that people are concerned with single zone units keeping a consistent temperature throughout. We tested two single zone wine coolers and found that both validated people&#8217;s concerns and didn’t test consistently. The NewAir had an average of four-degree difference from the top of the unit to the bottom. You can use this to your advantage and place the red wine bottles towards the top of the cooler, where the units tend to be warmer. The coolest spaces were towards the bottom where the vent was located.</p>
<p>It is important to note that when we opened the door to put the wine in or take it out, the overall cooler temp rose five to seven degrees each time. However, it did cool off again within 15 minutes. This unit is best placed in an area with minimal sunlight. It has an insulated door, but the glass does not block out UV rays.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The NewAir &#8211; 33 bottle is the best single zone wine fridge that we tested, with a professional look and easy temperature controls. It holds both red and white wines at the perfect temperature.</li>
<li>The basket on the bottom of the NewAir is perfect for champagne or oversized bottles.</li>
<li>Extra features include a safety lock, insulated door and blue display light to easily find your favorite bottle of wine.</li>

<p>During testing, we did find a few minor inconveniences with this cooler. Though it&#8217;s a small unit that holds only eight bottles, we were surprised to learn there was a temperature difference of two degrees from the left to the right side of this fridge. It also took two full hours for bottles placed in this fridge to reach optimum temperature. So this is not a unit for someone who would like to quickly cool bottles for serving purposes.</p>
<p>Overall, the Frigidaire eight bottle countertop wine fridge is a nice choice for those with limited space and looking to store just a few bottles at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The best smaller unit we tested, the Frigidaire &#8211; Eight bottle cooler fits right on your countertop, bookshelf or under a desk.</li>
<li>The easy to control digital temperature display makes the Frigidaire perfect for both red and white wines in one space.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s ready to plug in and go in under an hour, so we appreciated that the Frigidaire is a lightweight option that can travel with you.</li>

<p>If storing more than 30 bottles is a little much for you, we recommend going with the <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/frigidaire-18-bottle-wine-cooler-black/4277500.p?skuId=4277500" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Frigidaire 18 bottle wine cooler</strong></a>, which is a narrower unit that is great for tight spaces. The Frigidaire was our second best pick for overall wine fridge unit thanks to its convenient design, ability to regulate the overall temperature and solid insulated door with protective tempered glass displaying only the red wines.</p>
<p>A feature unique only of the Frigidaire is the door. While the top half has display glass to be able to see your red wines, the bottom half is a solid insulated door to add another layer of protection for your white wines from UV rays.</p>

<p>Once plugged in, this cooler only needs one hour to cool down to storage temp in both zones. Now ready to store wine, we used bottles that were at room temperature of 70 degrees to test the cooldown times,  we found that the Frigidaire chills red wines to storage temp in an impressive 45 minutes. The white wines dropped about 10 degrees in one hour and ultimately took nearly two hours to reach final proper storage temperature.</p>
<p>During testing, we found that the Frigidaire 18 bottle fridge fluctuates about two degrees from what the display temperature says. The cooler was tested in different rooms with different amounts of light and was consistently two degrees colder when storing red wine and two degrees warmer when chilling white wines.</p>
<p>Something to note &#8211; the manual on each cooler did note that chillers can range two degrees up or down depending on the room temperature, humidity and ventilation. Although all chillers were tested in the same environment, the Frigidaire was the only fridge that was consistently two degrees different.</p>
<h3>Haier &#8211; 16 bottle dual zone thermoelectric wine cooler</h3>

<p><em><strong>[Update: we reached out to Haier in March 2018 about this being out of stock, and got a reply from a GE rep telling us Haier merged with GE in 2016 and they have now stopped producing wine fridges to focus on their larger appliances. These Haier fridges are still available from 3rd party sellers so we&#8217;re leaving links live below.]</strong></em></p>
<p>We would recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GY7AGG6/?tag=ybdcool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Haier &#8211; 16 bottle dual zone wine cellar</a> for the casual or occasional wine drinker. This is another great option for those who may be tight on space or are only looking to store a few bottles at a time.</p>
<p>Like the Frigidaire, there was no assembly out of the box required with this cooler. It was ready to plug in and go. We preferred the blue LED temperature display on this unit compared to the Frigidaire’s soft green display and the full glass display allows you to see all the wine you store.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GY7AGG6/?tag=ybdcool-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/haier-16-bottle-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/haier-16-bottle-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/haier-16-bottle-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/haier-16-bottle-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/haier-16-bottle-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/haier-16-bottle-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/haier-16-bottle-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/haier-16-bottle-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/haier-16-bottle.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Space Saving Pick: Haier - 16 Bottle</h3><p>Refined features like the blue display light, UV protected glass door and touch screen panel.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GY7AGG6/?tag=ybdcool-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>We found that the Haier only needs one and a half hours to cool down. Once chilled, it only took one hour to cool both red and white wine options. A word of caution: when placing bottles in or removing them, we found that this wine fridge&#8217;s overall temperature rose quickly and took about 20 minutes to settle back to the desired temperature.</p>
<p>To better understand the capabilities of this unit, we tested the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GY7AGG6/?tag=ybdcool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Haier</a> in different rooms with different amounts of sun. We found that the top section storing red wines stayed consistently two degrees below what the display read, but was overall accurate for the white wines.</p>
<h3>Insignia &#8211; 16 bottle wine cooler</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6691 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/insignia-solo.jpg" alt="Insignia Wine Cooler" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/insignia-solo.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/insignia-solo-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/insignia-solo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/insignia-solo-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/insignia-solo-300x200.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/insignia-solo-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/insignia-solo-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/insignia-solo-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/insignia-solo-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/insignia-solo-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for something with a large amount of versatility in storage and movability, the <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/insignia-16-bottle-wine-cooler-with-wine-tote-black/4222901.p?skuId=4222901" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Insignia &#8211; 16 bottle wine cooler</a> is a nice value add to your kitchen or bar. Ready to go right out of the box, it only takes one hour to cool to storage temperature. Bottles can be stored from front to back or sideways. The bottom shelf also can hold bigger bottles like champagne or can be removed completely to fit 12 cans of wine or soda.</p>
<p>While it is very easy to just turn a dial to set the temperature to “normal”, we didn’t like that there was no adjustable temperature control. The dial was in the back of the fridge, which required us to remove any bottles on the shelf to adjust it. The Insignia performed well but took nearly two hours to chill both red and white wines to storage temperature.</p>
<p>Overall, the Insignia was about half the cost of the Frigidaire &#8211; 18 bottle cooler, but we discovered that you get what you paid for. So, we would recommend spending the small amount of extra money to buy the Haier.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>When it comes time to perfectly preserve a favorite bottle of wine, consumers look for a unit that keeps temperatures consistent, has the proper space for their collection and is easy to use with minimal upkeep. That&#8217;s why we chose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MDXTDTB/?tag=ybdcool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>EdgeStar &#8211; 34 bottle dual zone wine cooler</strong></a> to out chill its competition.</p>
<p>While the <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/frigidaire-18-bottle-wine-cooler-black/4277500.p?skuId=4277500" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Frigidaire</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GY7AGG6/?tag=ybdcool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Haier</a> and are also great options for a smaller space and less storage, we choose the EdgeStar for its capacity and variety in storage capabilities, ability to keep wines stored at an accurate and consistent temperature and attention to detail in the design.</p>
<p>The smaller countertop units will get the job done, but due to lack of space and options, might quickly become a source of frustration. These units also underperformed when regulating temperature throughout the unit.</p>
<p>Regardless of the size, a wine fridge is a useful appliance to have on hand for just about any wine drinker. The convenience of properly storing your favorite bottles, clearing up space in your fridge and ability to pick up that extra “just in case” bottle will expand your interest in this multibillion-dollar industry.</p>
<p>We can’t help but love all the extra features found in our top pick, the EdgeStar 34 bottle free-standing, compression, dual zone wine cooler. All the attention to detail made us say &#8220;wow&#8221;, but if the price makes you say &#8220;wow&#8221; too, then we recommend the <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/frigidaire-18-bottle-wine-cooler-black/4277500.p?skuId=4277500" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Frigidaire &#8211; 18 bottle wine cooler</a> for you.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter using Amazon’s top-reviewed electric wine opener for 18 straight months and analyzing 20 additional models, we narrowed our list down to five finalists.

<p>As I checked out of Trader Joe&#8217;s with 30+ bottles of wine and told the checkout staff about the plan to test out automatic wine openers, he quickly questioned me back &#8212; “I don’t get why people use electric wine openers. The traditional corkscrew works just fine.”</p>
<p>He had a point&#8230; the traditional corkscrew <i>does</i> work just fine, but it specifically works fine for a certain set of people. Not everyone wants to use a corkscrew, or will be consistently successful at using one.</p>
<p>For example, I’m pretty goofy. Coordination has never been my strong suit. I had, with frequency, suffered from open-failure with a corkscrew. The cork broke, I got cork in the wine, or we couldn’t get the cork out, period.</p>
<p>It wasn’t every time out, but it was enough to be frustrated. After a bottle or two, the success rate would very frequently get worse.</p>
<p>Due to this frustration, I got to the point where I put my pride aside and asked my wife to open the wine for us most of the time. As you might imagine, it wasn’t a great feeling.</p>
<p>Enter electric wine openers. I basically lucked into buying my wife the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YFI0O6/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oster</a> for Christmas, and it turned into a gift for me. I was never going back.</p>
<p>The electric wine opener isn’t for everybody. It’s not as pinky-in-the-air elegant as a corkscrew. You won’t find one at a five star restaurant. You’re probably not going to impress your date with it. And <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/RRFPHKP0PP0JQ/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">according to some reports</a>, you might not want to trust them with fancier bottles of wine.</p>
<p>But if you’re simple, don’t raise your nose when drinking a bottle of wine, and prefer function over elegance, electric wine bottle openers are a great fit for you.</p>
<p>In addition, a great additional benefit of automatic wine openers is that they’re far superior to corkscrews if you have arthritis or another disability. You might have always loved the corkscrew, and that’s okay, but you’re starting to feel some discomfort in your hands and are looking for another option. Electric wine openers can offer some relief.</p>
<h2 id="trust">Why you should trust us</h2>
<p>As I mentioned above, I’ve been using an electric wine opener for a year and a half, and have opened an estimated 300+ bottles using them. I pretty much fit the stereotype of the ideal user &#8212; love wine (but not in a need to buy a $200 bottle kind of way), am a bit uncoordinated, and prefer function over elegance&#8230; but without sacrificing quality.</p>
<p>I spent 40+ total hours researching electric wine openers, asking other experts and crowd-sourcing amongst users of Reddit. Unfortunately, the /r/wine/ subreddit wasn’t very helpful, so I took to Google and Amazon to compare and contrast the reviews and feedback on many of these openers.</p>
<p>This led me to compare ~20 units until I narrowed down my options to a final five, including the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Oster-FPSTBW8207-S-Electric-Bottle-Opener/dp/B003YFI0O6/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oster</a>, which was the highest rated on Amazon and the product I already owned, and had been using with frequency.</p>
<h2 id="the-five-best">Compare the best electric wine openers</h2>

<h2 id="test">How we tested</h2>
<p>First, we broke the wine openers into several judging categories and areas of value: battery life, foil/top cutter, product quality, and of course, ease of opening the wine.</p>
<p>Battery duration has a few positive benefits. First, having used one of these for a year &#8212; and drinking several dozen bottles of wine/being a disorganized person, there were several unfortunate scenarios where I forgot to place the opener on the charger, which led to a dead opener in times of need.</p>
<p>Second, electric wine openers have value for commercial applications, such as catering, so if that’s you, you probably don’t want an opener that dies after a few opens. So, battery life can be important.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, cold testing these on actual wine from start to end would have been pretty tough to do without spending thousands of dollars, so we did the best next thing and ran the battery from full to end, gave it a full 24 hours to charge, and then did so again three times in order to create an average.</p>

<p>Overall, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FPSTBW8207-S-Electric-Bottle-Opener-Silver/dp/B003YFI0O6/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oster</a> led the pack by a considerable margin, with an average battery life of 53:52. The Pyora, Wine Enthusiast and Secura models ran in a similar 40+ range, with Ozeri at the back of the pack with a 25:49 average. If you need the opener for commercial applications, the Oster is your best bet.</p>
<p>If you need an opener for everyday use, it&#8217;s possible battery life will never come into play if you&#8217;re consistent &#8212; and the top four models will make that especially certain. If you even forget once, it&#8217;s possible the Ozeri&#8217;s battery life may come back to bite you, but it has other positive features to make up for that as well.</p>
<p>After the battery test, we used each opener on six different bottles of wine, all of different varietals, simply to see if there was any variation based on the type of bottle we opened, and also to get a significant sample size with each bottle in order to get a true impression.</p>
<p>When cutting, we judged overall build quality and simplicity. When opening, we judged ease, consistency, and also the hold firmness required to open the bottle &#8212; a characteristic that could make a big difference for those with a disability or arthritis.</p>
<p>Across the six bottles, if the open went flawlessly and didn’t require a strong grip on the base or the top, it was judged as “good”.</p>
<p>If the open went flawlessly but required a strong grip, or if it didn’t require a strong grip but had something strange happen (such as a readjustment or strange sound, signifying bad build quality) it was judged as “fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the open went poorly/didn’t happen at all, or something else erroneous happened, it was judged as “bad.&#8221; Fortunately, this only happened once with the Secura, which shockingly had the bottom partially crack on the very first open!</p>

<p>Overall, the Pyora, Ozeri and Wine Enthusiast models performed best in our test opens. They each required little pressure to operate, had predictable results, and had no real problems from start to finish. The Oster and Secura, on the other hand, required additional strong pressure to operate with consistency.</p>
<p>One thing that also quickly became apparent in the testing was the superiority of the transparent bottom design. Transparency made it easy to predict where in the opening process you were, while the closed base of the Oster resulted in more unpredictable and occasionally failed opens. If coordination isn&#8217;t your thing, the transparent base automatically puts the other four models ahead of the Oster.</p>

<p>The foil/top cutter was a small detail that most of the wine openers did well, since the act of creating a circular blade that could cut out the top of the wine was pretty straightforward. However, there were subtle differences that made some cutters more preferable than others.</p>
<p>The Ozeri wine opener, the cheapest of the lot, reflected the price, as its foil cutter felt cheap and had a confusing design. To cut open a bottle of wine, you have to “clamp” the sides of the opener in order to express pressure on the bottle. However, this same clamp, attached to the top of the opener, feels as if it’s the function that actually allows you to remove the foil cutter from the base.</p>
<p>In actuality, all you have to do is turn the cutter right in order to remove the top. For experienced or frequent owners, this will frequently become obvious, but for first-time users or guests in your home it could become irritating.</p>
<p>Otherwise, upon evaluating other cutters it became obvious the transparent cutters were the most valuable. Non-transparent cutters make you guess/predict the exact moment you’ve made it to 360, often causing incorrect guesses or second tries. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01261VEOG/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secura</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wine-Enthusiast-Electric-Push-Button-Corkscrew/dp/B002EOHXFK/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wine Enthusiast</a> models offer transparent cutters, which made them the most attractive of the lot.</p>
<p>Overall, the marginal improvement of a slightly better cutter should not make or break your electric wine opener decision. However, it is a product difference that we noticed amongst the different versions, and can indicate a slightly better opener.</p>
<h2 id="overall">Best overall: Wine Enthusiast</h2>

<p>In terms of overall performance, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wine-Enthusiast-Electric-Push-Button-Corkscrew/dp/B002EOHXFK/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wine Enthusiast</a> led the pack. Wine Enthusiast’s model was one of the three that had the easiest-to-use transparent design&#8230; the see through end removed any guesswork when removing your cork.</p>
<p>The highest rated model on Amazon, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FPSTBW8207-S-Electric-Bottle-Opener-Silver/dp/B003YFI0O6/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oster</a>, had a covered end that resulted in guesswork, unnecessary pressure, and sometimes, failed attempts when removing the cork.</p>

<p>After purchasing, we also realized Wine Enthusiast offered a version of the same model with the best foil cutter style we tested, a transparent one. Transparency here, just like the base, removes the guesswork of non-transparent cutters and will guarantee you aren’t left fumbling with second and third attempts at removing the foil.</p>
<p>The blue light emanating from the base when plugged in also makes for a nice, subtle nightlight the next time you need to fumble through the kitchen for a late night snack.</p>
<p>And while the battery life didn’t outshine any competitors, it was right on par, making it, along with Wine Enthusiast’s strong reputation for quality product design, big influences in our decision to crown Wine Enthusiast&#8217;s model the best overall wine opener.</p>
<h2 id="easiest">Easiest to operate: Ozeri &#8211; Nouveaux</h2>

<p>By far, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ozeri-Nouveaux-Electric-Removable-Elegant/dp/B002YENQ4M/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ozeri &#8211; Nouveaux</a> was the easiest, loosest grip wine opener we tested, which came as a surprise for the lowest-price product of the bunch. However, its high rating shined through, making it a great pick for anyone with arthritis or any other issues preventing them from using a corkscrew or applying a lot of pressure to the bottle.</p>
<p>Other options, while feeling more elegant/high-end, required a lot of pressure, both from the top and the bottom, in order to remove the cork. The Ozeri required some pressure, but still very little, a pleasant surprise for a product on the lowest price end of the models we tested.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YENQ4M/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ozeri-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ozeri-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ozeri-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ozeri-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ozeri-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ozeri-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ozeri-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ozeri-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ozeri.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Easiest to Use: Ozeri - Nouveaux</h3><p>Despite the low cost, the Ozeri required very little pressure to open most wine bottles.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YENQ4M/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>On the negative side, it should still be understood that the Ozeri had the worst battery (so keep it plugged in), and also, the overall stability/product quality made it feel like it could have a short shelf life. It’s also not a product that will visually exude premium to house guests.</p>
<p>However, given the ease of cork removal and overall quality of what it’s tasked to do &#8212; open your wine, it’s a great option for those with arthritic issues or anything else that may require high pressure on their bottles.</p>
<h3 id="budget">Also our budget pick</h3>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t have arthritis, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YENQ4M/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ozeri</a> is a high-quality product that should find its way onto any budget-conscious shelf.</p>
<p>If you like to drink wine but don’t care about sticking your pinky in the air or the need to impress guests, the Ozeri is a great option for your repertoire. It’ll open wine with ease and offer exceeding value over its price point.</p>
<p>The only negative to the model is its battery life, so if you open two or more bottles, make sure you remember to plug it back in.</p>

<p>It’s not perfect or elegant due to the high pressure it requires on the top and bottom to remove many corks, but it gets the job done. Since neither the cutter nor the bottom of the opener is transparent, you’ll have to guess at timing as well.</p>
<p>Despite this, it’s a great fit for high-turnover environments, such as catering, where you may need to open dozens upon dozens of bottles in one evening &#8212; and also don’t want the wine opener to die out. And if you’re opening enough bottles, there’s no doubt the frequency of your opens will make the cutter and timing issues almost nill.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01261VEOG/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secura</a> felt like a poor man’s version of the Oster. On our first try, the base slightly frayed, which was shocking. From there, a few of the openings made slight “crack” sounds that made me wonder about the long-term viability of this product.</p>
<p>In addition, the Secura needed more hand-grip overall in order to keep it tightly in place and remove the cork from the base. Two of the tests resulted in the wine bottle moving despite a fairly strongly grip.</p>
<p>On the positive side, the Secura’s transparent cutter that made foil removal easy was the best option of the bunch, but as mentioned, it’s the least important feature of wine openers. It did, however, illuminate that our pick for best overall, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002EOHXFK/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wine Enthusiast</a>, also had a transparent cutter option of the same opener available.</p>
<h3 id="gifting">Pyora</h3>

<p>As previously mentioned, the Pyora electric opener was right on par with the Oster in terms of consistency, performance and battery life, but its main drawback was the need to buy it as part of a set. Pyora has since discontinued this set.</p>
<h2 id="future">What we’ll test in the future</h2>
<p>Although 18 months of testing has already been done on the Oster, it became clear that wasn’t the best long-term model to evaluate.</p>
<p>The cheaper <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YENQ4M/?tag=ybdopnr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ozeri</a> identified itself as a leader in the pack with some questions about durability&#8230; if it can keep up with other models, it’s possible it can pass Wine Enthusiast’s opener and take the number one slot.</p>

<h2 id="why-qualified">Why trust us?</h2>
<p>I’ve been a whiskey drinker since the day I turned 21 and was ordered a Jack and Coke at the bar by one of my friends. In the years since then, I have expanded my palate quite a bit and have already tried more than 50 different whiskeys — some expensive, some not-so-expensive. While certainly not an old-and-gray whiskey veteran, I have tried more than enough whiskey to appreciate and understand the nuances of this amazing spirit.</p>
<p>In preparing for this article, I spent more than 40 hours reading through more than one hundred articles, blog posts, whiskey forums and Reddit threads. I wanted to learn everything I could about whiskey stones: what people thought of them, how often they were used, why some people seemed so adamantly opposed to them and whether or not the stones actually provided a benefit to whiskey imbibers.</p>
<p>We also reached out to several whiskey stone manufacturers and distilleries in order to hear from those who would presumably know best. We received several responses and had useful and informative conversations with company representatives and a few assistant master distillers.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, I found that many of the distillers had little to no opinion on whiskey stones in general and some of them had never even used or heard of them.</p>
<p>Most of their advice was limited to “enjoy your whiskey in whatever way you prefer,” and one of the master distillers I spoke to said that he had never even seen whiskey stones!</p>
<p>However, I was able to glean some useful pieces of information from my conversations with experts, which we were able to use in determining the best whiskey stones on the market.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-found">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>The 40+ hours spent researching and speaking with experts in the industry helped us narrow our focus and build a “short list” of whiskey stones to test in-house.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we were able to narrow the field by using the information gathered during our research to find the brands that had the most consistently positive coverage, which included favorable reviews on sites like Amazon and Google, as well as positive mentions and review articles on both whiskey and non-whiskey websites and blogs.</p>
<p>We also looked for products that had what we considered to be prerequisite criteria: everything from being made from food grade material to simple things like the inclusion of a freezer-safe container or bag.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-166 alignnone" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/whiskey-stone-finalists.jpg" alt="whiskey stone finalists" width="790" height="541" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/whiskey-stone-finalists.jpg 790w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/whiskey-stone-finalists-610x418.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/whiskey-stone-finalists-180x123@2x.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/whiskey-stone-finalists-375x257.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/whiskey-stone-finalists-414x284.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/whiskey-stone-finalists-295x202.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/whiskey-stone-finalists-180x123.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/whiskey-stone-finalists-320x219.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/whiskey-stone-finalists-295x202@2x.jpg 590w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>From there, we were able to further narrow the field so that we would have a representative sample of the major material types that whiskey stones are made of. More specifically, we chose whiskey stones made from soapstone and steel.</p>
<p>Finally, we made of point of including at least one “brand name” in each material category, so that we could determine if there was a notable difference between brand-name whiskey stones and some of the lesser-known brands.</p>
<p>We were a little surprised to find that, yes, the big brands in this product category actually did earn their reputation in the whiskey stone market. More specifically, Balls of Steel and the Teroforma soapstone whiskey stones performed better than the lesser-known brands in their category.</p>

<h3>A brief overview</h3>
<p>According to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, more than $2.7 billion worth of Bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey was sold in the United States in 2014, representing an increase of more than 21% over the past decade. Along with the growth in whiskey sales, there is a robust market for accessories, which of course includes whiskey stones.</p>

<p>The history of whiskey stones is actually a lot shorter than some might expect. Based on our research, we found that whiskey stones were first created in 2007 by Anna and Andrew Hellman, founders of Teroforma.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://whiskystones.com/pages/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their website</a>, they were the inventors of whiskey stones and the first to create a commercial product out of them. Despite that, we found that whiskey stones made out of stainless steel performed significantly better in our trials than any of the soapstone whiskey stones — including the Teroforma stones.</p>
<p>We also found that there are very strong opinions both in favor of and opposing the use of whiskey stones. While it’s true that whiskey stones are not for everyone, we concluded that the right whiskey stone, used properly, can actually have a significantly positive impact on the whiskey drinking experience.</p>

<p>Before getting into the situations best suited for whiskey stones, we should start by stating that whiskey stones are not for everyone, nor for every situation. A significant portion of the negative reviews can be traced back to the fact that the stones were not used for their intended purpose.</p>
<p>More specifically, whiskey stones are not designed to be a replacement for ice in a mixed drink (such as Jack and Coke), nor are they effective at making your drink ice cold. Instead, stones are best used by those who want to chill their drink into the 40° to 60° range, which is considered by the master distillers we spoke to as the ideal temperature range for drinking whiskey.</p>
<p>You should consider buying whiskey stones if you enjoy the nuanced flavors in whiskey and prefer the temperature to be cooler than room temperature — particularly if you live in an area where “room temperature” can mean 80° or higher. Instead of over-diluting your drink with <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-portable-ice-maker/">ice</a>, whiskey stones make it possible to chill whiskey without any dilution or, as is often preferable, with just a few drops of water to release the flavors of the whiskey.</p>
<h2 id="the-controversy">The controversy behind whiskey stones</h2>
<p>If you look online, you’ll find no shortage of people opposed to whiskey stones. Their oppositions vary widely: Some simply believe that whiskey stones are ineffective at chilling their drink, while others claim that having stones in your glass of whiskey can be a hazard if the stones fall on your teeth or into your mouth.</p>
<p>Essentially, the argument is that whiskey should either be taken neat (whiskeys with complex flavor profiles that shouldn’t be diluted) or that ice is a viable and more effective, method of chilling (for whiskeys in mixed drinks).</p>
<p>There is no disputing the fact that whiskey stones can get in the way of an otherwise “neat” drink. There&#8217;s also a risk that the whiskey stones might tumble out of the glass and into the mouth of an unsuspecting imbiber.</p>
<p>One solution would be to pull the whiskey stones out of the glass once the drink&#8217;s been chilled. This is a reasonable and viable option, since most whiskey stones (including our recommendations) come with tongs designed to easily place and remove whiskey stones.</p>
<p>Another solution is to simply use whiskey stones that won’t tumble into your mouth, or onto your teeth, while being used. This was a major consideration when ranking the whiskey stones in our study.</p>
<h3>Whiskey stones require advance planning</h3>
<p>Whiskey stones also require maintenance and forethought, since they need to be placed in the freezer for hours prior to use and cannot be reused until they have been refrozen — for a social gathering in which many will be drinking, this can be a prohibitive requirement and explains why bartenders typically dislike whiskey stones.</p>
<p>Bartenders certainly have many reasons to dislike whiskey stones. In addition to needing hundreds of stones on a busy night, the logistics of storing and washing the stones, along with the risk that they could be stolen by patrons, explains why  bartenders and many bars have such disdain for whiskey stones.</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most convincingly, is the fact that chilling whiskey can mask some of the flavor — particularly at temperatures below 45 to 50 degrees. This is one of the reasons it is considered poor form to put ice into a glass of expensive whiskey.</p>
<p>There is without a doubt validity to many of the arguments against whiskey stones. In fact, in my initial research I came upon so many of these arguments that I began to doubt whether whiskey stones were worth using at all.</p>
<p>However, upon further research and actually testing the whiskey stones myself, I was able to determine that there is certainly a place for whiskey stones, both for amateur and experienced whiskey drinkers alike.</p>
<h3 id="the-argument">The argument in favor of whiskey stones</h3>
<p>The biggest argument in favor of whiskey stones &#8212; and the argument that whiskey stone manufacturers highlight most frequently &#8212; is that they make it possible to chill a drink without any dilution. While the importance of that point could be disputed, there is no disputing that an effective whiskey stone would achieve this goal.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-220" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/unnamed-1-1.png" alt="Whiskey Temperature" width="790" height="475" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/unnamed-1-1.png 790w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/unnamed-1-1-610x367.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/unnamed-1-1-180x108@2x.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/unnamed-1-1-375x225.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/unnamed-1-1-414x249.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/unnamed-1-1-295x177.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/unnamed-1-1-180x108.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/unnamed-1-1-320x192.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/unnamed-1-1-295x177@2x.png 590w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>One of the arguments against whiskey stones is that they don’t chill a glass of whiskey as much as a glass of ice. Although true, it&#8217;s important to remember that a glass of whiskey starts losing its complexity around 45° to 50°, so the fact that whiskey stones don’t chill as much as ice is intentional and by design.</p>
<p>When speaking to one of the master distillers from the WhistlePig distillery, their recommendation was also to keep the temperature in the 45° to 60° range. We kept this in mind when testing whiskey stones.</p>
<p>The 45° to 60° range makes even more sense when put into the context offered by Scotch Whisky distilleries: Scotch Whisky is produced and was originally consumed almost exclusively in Scotland, where the ambient temperature is lower than in many other parts of the world.</p>
<p>By using whiskey stones to lower the temperature of your whiskey (and Scotch Whisky in particular), what you’re really doing is bringing the drink to a temperature that expert distillers have optimized it for over centuries of trial and error.</p>
<p>None of the whiskey stones we tested went below the 45° range; however, the whiskey stones made out of soapstone did have a difficult time keeping the temperature below 60°, even with a starting temperature of 64° — which is one of the major reasons why our top two picks were not made from soapstone.</p>
<p>The risk of whiskey stones tumbling out of the glass and causing potential damage to one’s teeth can be essentially neutralized by choosing a whiskey stone that is designed to avoid this exact problem. The design of the Balls of Steel best fits this category and is one of the primary reasons that product is our top pick.</p>
<p>Ultimately, those who argue against whiskey stones — like bartenders — typically have legitimate yet biased reasons. Others might be using the wrong stones, such as soapstone,  that ultimately fail to sufficiently chill the whiskey.</p>
<p>All that being said, when used in the proper setting — for example, in a home among one to four drinkers — and when the right product is used, whiskey stones can indeed chill a glass of whiskey to the perfect temperature and also allow a few ideal drops of water to be added for an optimal whiskey-drinking experience.</p>

<p>Once we had narrowed our list of whiskey stones to seven finalists, we needed a way to further differentiate between them to determine which would be our top recommendation.</p>
<p>We used a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to rank each of the products, which included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Appearance of the whiskey stones</li>
<li>Packaging quality, including materials used and whether there was any residue that needed to be washed off before the stones could be used</li>
<li>The inclusion of accessories such as a freezer bag, tongs and instructions or guidelines</li>
<li>Amount of time needed to freeze each stone before it was ready to chill whiskey</li>
<li>Amount and duration of chilling the stones can produce in 3 ounces of whiskey</li>
<li>Overall impression of each whiskey stone, from the perspective of someone who enjoys whiskey, with a focus on whether the overall experience is enhanced or hindered by the whiskey stones</li>
</ul>
<p>To test the impact on the temperature that each of the whiskey stones had, we measured three ounces (about two shots, or a healthy pour) into regular tumbler glasses, and measured the temperature in each using a digital food thermometer.</p>
<p>We then recorded temperature measurements every 5 minutes until 45 minutes had passed, then continued to measure every 15 minutes until a total of two hours after our starting point. You can check out the results of our temperature testing directly below.</p>

<h2 id="our-top-pick">Best stones overall: Balls of Steel</h2>
<p>During our testing, the one brand of whiskey stones that stood out above all the others was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AM3PMD0/?tag=ybdwhs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Balls of Steel by OriginalBOS</a>. No other product came close to having the full package the way OriginalBOS offers it, and they are hands-down the whiskey stones to get for anyone considering giving whiskey stones a try.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-167 alignnone" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/our-top-whiskey-stone-pick.jpg" alt="our top whiskey stone pick--balls of steel" width="790" height="523" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/our-top-whiskey-stone-pick.jpg 790w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/our-top-whiskey-stone-pick-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/our-top-whiskey-stone-pick-180x119@2x.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/our-top-whiskey-stone-pick-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/our-top-whiskey-stone-pick-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/our-top-whiskey-stone-pick-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/our-top-whiskey-stone-pick-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/our-top-whiskey-stone-pick-320x212.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/our-top-whiskey-stone-pick-295x195@2x.jpg 590w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The Balls of Steel come in a small package and includes two balls, a small set of tongs and a bag to put the balls in while they sit in the freezer. One minor point that stood out is the slightly rounded shape of the tongs, which actually made it much easier to both put the BOS into and take them out of the glass.</p>
<p>The rounded tongs, while seemingly minor, are indicative of the overall experience I had when using BOS — namely, that the company had a great passion for their product and a strong attention to detail.</p>
<p>The BOS also has a notably shorter freezing time when compared to the rest of the whiskey stones we looked at, particularly those made out of soapstone. While the soapstone whiskey stones typically suggest “at least 4 hours” in the freezer before use, BOS is ready after just 90 minutes.</p>
<h3>Attention to Detail</h3>
<p>It is clear that the folks over at OriginalBOS paid close attention to detail when designing their product. The spherical shape just makes more sense from an ergonomic perspective, especially when compared to the square shape of most whiskey stones. Instead of tumbling around the glass, the BOS has a smooth, ball bearing-like effect in the glass.</p>
<p>In addition to looking classy and modern, the shape and smooth movement of the BOS had the added benefit of moving in a way that minimized the risk of the stone suddenly tumbling onto my teeth — which is less than I can say for some of the other whiskey stones we tested!</p>

<p>As a long-time whiskey drinker, I prefer drinking my whiskey in a Glencairn whiskey glass whenever possible. For those who might not know, the Glencairn glass is the first and only whisky glass to be endorsed by the Scotch Whisky Association and its “tulip” shape allows the dram to aerate, while the inward-curving shape of the glass helps to concentrate the smell of the drink, thereby optimizing the “nosing” experience.</p>
<p>The downside with the Glencairn glass is that, because it is significantly smaller than a traditional tumbler — with an even smaller opening at the top — most whiskey stones are simply awkward inside the Glencairn glass. Even worse, some of them don’t fit at all!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-162" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/makers-mark-puck.jpg" alt="Maker's Mark whiskey puck, doesn't fit!" width="790" height="523" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/makers-mark-puck.jpg 790w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/makers-mark-puck-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/makers-mark-puck-180x119@2x.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/makers-mark-puck-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/makers-mark-puck-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/makers-mark-puck-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/makers-mark-puck-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/makers-mark-puck-320x212.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/makers-mark-puck-295x195@2x.jpg 590w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Not so with the Balls of Steel.</p>
<p><strong>When I put the BOS into the Glencairn glass, it felt like these were whiskey stones that were created by genuine whiskey lovers.</strong> Unlike every other whiskey stone we tested, the BOS fit perfectly into the glass and rolled around in the glass in a distinctly satisfying way.</p>
<p>It was immediately apparent that the makers of BOS were familiar with Glencairn glasses, and I would be surprised if their product testing process did not include the use of those glasses. Perhaps most importantly, the BOS did not tumble towards my teeth — more than I can say for the other whiskey stones that were tested!</p>
<p>We also tested the BOS in a regular tumbler. While the ergonomics were not quite as impressive as they were in the Glencairn glass, the BOS still moved around the glass smoothly, which made it much more difficult for someone using BOS in their whiskey to inadvertently drop one of the stones onto their teeth.</p>
<p>One other aspect of the BOS whiskey stones is the fact that the company that produces them, OriginalBOS, donates 15 percent of net proceeds to testicular cancer research at The MD Anderson Cancer Center.</p>
<p>OriginalBOS partnered with the MD Anderson Center to create a special fund that specifically goes towards testicular cancer research. While this is not necessarily reason alone to buy a product, the fact that our top pick also happens to incorporate an important cause only solidifies the choice further.</p>
<p>OriginalBOS also utilizes great website design. The company clearly has put effort into — and takes pride in — their Internet presence and wants their customers to have the best online buying process possible.</p>
<p>One final note on the Balls of Steel. While we conducted our testing of all the whiskey stones using Glenfiddich 12, I enjoyed and was so intrigued by the experience of using the Balls of Steel that I followed up the following evening by opening the bottle of Glenfiddich 21 I’d been saving and sipping on a glass over the course of an hour and a half.</p>
<p>In the past, when taking a dram of Glenfiddich 21, I’d pour a few drops of water into the glass to open up the flavor. This time, however, I was able to add the drops of water while also chilling my drink with the Balls of Steel.</p>
<p>I found that this offered me the best of both worlds: In addition to adding just the right amount of dilution to open up the flavor profile of the whisky (something that simply cannot be done with a piece of ice), I was also able to chill my drink, which mellowed out the flavors without dulling them at all.</p>
<p>This experience, more than any other, convinced me of the value and ideal application of high-quality whiskey stones like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AM3PMD0/?tag=ybdwhs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Balls of Steel</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Metrics from our testing of the Balls of Steel:</strong></p>

<p>Based on temperature data alone, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KYGRMEW/?tag=ybdwhs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kollea</a> should have been our top pick. In addition to chilling the whiskey more than any other product we tried (including Balls of Steel), Kollea maintained temperatures cooler than every other product tested over the entire two hour testing period. If you&#8217;re looking to chill your glass of whiskey as cold as possible without dilution, Kollea is unquestionably a viable option.</p>
<p>From a visual standpoint, the Kollea steel whiskey chillers are fairly appealing. However, in our opinion, the Kollea whiskey chillers are simply too large to be practical. In smaller glasses like the Glencairn, they take up so much space and tumble around so much on the sides of the glass that there is likely a risk of the glass itself shattering with their use.</p>
<p>With traditional tumbler glasses, the problem isn’t quite so pronounced, but the Koella chillers are large enough that trying to drink from the glass with them still inside is not recommended — if only for reasons of dental health.</p>

<p>That being said, the Kollea chillers are so effective at chilling whiskey that they could reasonably be used to chill a glass for 5 to 10 minutes (or as long as desired) then pulled out of the glass using the included tongs.</p>
<p>Using them in this way isn’t as convenient or effective as simply leaving them in like you can with the Balls of Steel, but it is effective. For those who don’t actually want to leave the whiskey stones or chillers in their glass while they drink, it could actually be a preferable option over the Balls of Steel, since the Koella chillers did chill the whiskey faster and to a lower temperature than the Balls of Steel.</p>
<p>We found that the Koella chillers reached a minimum temperature about 10 minutes after being placed in the glass. If you&#8217;re looking to get the maximum chilling effect but also want to pull the chillers out before drinking, this looks to be the optimal time to do so.</p>

<p>Being the first product to market is always commendable, since you are creating a category that didn’t exist prior to your innovation and are opening up endless possibilities for your company (or others) to iterate and improve on your original idea.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017WUQIZQ/?tag=ybdwhs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Teroforma</a> has the distinction of creating the first known commercial whiskey stones back in 2007. The stones were created out of milled soapstone and set the stage for dozens of imitators over the years. There’s little doubt that Anna and Andrew Hellman (founders of Teroforma) are both flattered (and perhaps somewhat irritated) that their idea was copied by so many others so quickly.</p>

<p>Teroforma whiskey stones held their own against the other non-steel whiskey stones we tested. While the Maker’s Mark disk did get slightly colder for a brief period, within about 15 minutes the Maker’s Mark disk was quickly losing its ability to chill, whereas the Teroforma stones were able to provide a consistent few degrees of chilling for about 40 minutes.</p>
<p>This, in conjunction with the fact that the Maker’s Mark disk doesn’t even fit into a Glencairn glass, makes the Teroforma Whiskey Stones the best soapstone whiskey stone we tested and worthy of an Honorable Mention.</p>
<p>From the moment we opened the packaging of the Teroforma whiskey stones, it was readily apparent that the Hellmans take great pride in their product. Unlike the other soapstones we tested, the Teroforma stones had a very consistent, clean appearance, with no residue or anything else that might negatively impact the taste of a whiskey they were placed into.</p>
<p>This is likely due to the Teroforma whiskey stones being milled in the Teroforma workshop, thus allowing the company to produce a product of consistent quality.</p>
<p>Even though the Teroforma were the best-performing soapstone whiskey stones, they still failed to come close to matching any of the steel whiskey stones we tested, both in the amount of chilling, length of chilling and (for our top BOS pick) overall ergonomics.</p>
<p><strong>Metrics from our testing of the Teroforma Whiskey Stones:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lowest temperature: 59.5° (a decrease of 4.5°)</li>
<li>Time under 55°: Zero minutes</li>
<li>Time under 60°: 10 minutes</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-problems">Other finalists we tested</h2>
<p>While all of the finalists we tested were able to chill whiskey to some extent, most had at least one or two problems that could understandably lead consumers to have a negative opinion of them. In general, soapstones tend not to chill whiskey very much or for very long, while stainless steel stones/chillers can be heavy and clunky.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://makersmarkshop.com/whisky-disk-set-of-4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maker’s Mark disk</a> was both clunky and ineffective at keeping its drink chilled. This was disappointing, as we had high hopes that the bourbon distillery would have produced a better product — they should probably stick to spirits.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CIXQ5C4/?tag=ybdwhs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Great White</a> stones performed almost as well as the Kollea stones. However, since they look and feel almost identical, anyone considering Great White would be better off with Kollea instead.</p>
<p>Both the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ARLHYMO/?tag=ybdwhs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spirit Stones</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005D78RPU/?tag=ybdwhs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sipping Stones</a> had the least amount of chilling, and their drinks started gaining temperature after about 15 minutes. An argument for both of these products is that you could remove them from the drink entirely if you only want to chill it four or five degrees.</p>
<p>For anyone considering whiskey stones, we strongly recommend using one of our top three recommendations: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AM3PMD0/?tag=ybdwhs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Balls of Steel</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KYGRMEW/?tag=ybdwhs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kollea chillers</a>, or (for those who strongly prefer soapstone) the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017WUQIZQ/?tag=ybdwhs-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Teroforma Whiskey Stones</a>.</p>
<h2 id="long-term">Long-term testing notes</h2>
<p>We first published this post back in February 2016. Ten months later, the Balls of Steel are still holding up well and are just as effective as the first day we plunked them into our glass of Glenfiddich. The Kollea stones still get occasional use when sharing whiskey with a friend, but Balls of Steel are always the first choice. The Teroforma stones have actually improved with time, becoming smoother and easier to manage</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also done some more comparisons of whiskey with a cube of ice versus whiskey stones. It come down to personal preference, but it does seem like ice cubes simply melt too much water into a glass. We&#8217;ve found that what works best is to splash a few drops of water into the glass, then use the Balls of Steel to chill the glass a few degrees.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p><strong>Although the “original” whiskey stone was made out of soapstone by Teraforma, we found that the steel iteration performed substantially better, both in the amount and speed of chilling they were able to achieve, as well as overall duration.</strong></p>
<p>While soapstone does offer a more “natural” look, the fact is that most simply do not have the ability to chill 2 to 3 ounces of whiskey very much or for very long. Even the best-performing soapstone, Teroforma, only chilled the whiskey 4.5° before beginning to gain temperature 20 minutes after being placed in the glass.</p>
<h3 id="maximizing-your-whiskey">Maximizing your whiskey stone experience</h3>
<p>Whiskey stones require forethought and afterthought, since they need to be frozen before use and should be cleaned fairly soon after use as well — although this is more crucial for soapstone than steel.</p>
<p>You should also make use of the linen bags included with your whiskey stones. They help prevent flavors in the freezer from being picked up by the stones, while also making it easier to find and keep track of them in your freezer.</p>

<p>If you are looking for the best chilling available from a whiskey stone, then a steel product, like Balls of Steel or Kollea, are the only way to go. The duration and amount of chilling is more than double any of the soapstone options.</p>
