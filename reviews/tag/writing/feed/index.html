								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter our four testers used six backpacks for two months, we&#8217;ve determined that  <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-north-face-mainframe-laptop-backpack-dark-gray-heather-zinc-gray/5968000.p?skuId=5968000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The North Face &#8211; Mainframe</a> is the best laptop backpack for less than $150.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>Backpacks for carrying laptops are everywhere, and there are tens of thousands of designs to pick from. The essential features are pretty obvious: A laptop backpack has to carry your laptop and other daily essentials in a comfortable and secure way, but should also give you easy access when you need your most frequently-used items.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re gear enthusiasts at Your Best Digs, with a team that&#8217;s mostly made up of remote contributors. We all have bags we love, and most of us have owned bags we loathed.</p>
<p>After writing down a list of features that we consider absolutely essential, we started our research by collecting data about what influences the preferences of backpack buyers. We polled the gear nerds in the office and the digital nomads on our remote teams about the qualities they consider essential to a perfect laptop bag.</p>
<p>Access to a laptop and the accessories that come with it were (predictably) top of the list, but the other priorities were split. When we broke down our results into groups of people with different budgets, the preferences were more consistent.</p>
<p><strong>It was pretty clear that the more you spend, the more important the aesthetic of a backpack becomes.</strong> Those willing to spend big bucks on a backpack also prioritized waterproofing.</p>
<p>Of our survey-takers who didn&#8217;t want to spend as much money on a backpack, the biggest priority was functionality. Features like sunglasses pockets and bags that don&#8217;t fall over started filtering to the top in this group.</p>
<p>Our lead researcher for this review has owned a Tom Binh bag for a decade, and he spent some time searching the Tom Binh official forums for opinions about what makes a particular bag best for certain scenarios. (People on the Tom Binh forums like to talk about bags a lot.)</p>
<p>We considered all the recommendations from websites that actually tested for specific qualities, like Outdoor Gear Lab, as well as sites that focused on summarizing the strengths of different bags, like PackHacker, TheBrokeBackpacker and Wirecutter.</p>
<p>We took the priorities from our research and started searching retailers for high-quality backpacks with essential features and good design. We also checked out budget-friendly bags with high review counts and good overall scores from people who had purchased them.</p>
<p>We scoured subreddits like r/bifl, r/onebag and r/digitalnomad for recommendations from people who aren&#8217;t paid to review bags, and we also spent a long time watching YouTube reviews, mostly from the travel-focused &#8220;one bag&#8221; minimalism crowd.</p>
<p>We also spent some time away from computer screens and looked at bags in person at local retailers like REI and Best Buy. We&#8217;re happy we did, because we would have missed all our top picks if we had only looked at Amazon.</p>
<p>After we put together a list of 30 top-rated backpacks that fit our criteria, we had to cull the herd to a short list that really hit our core priorities. <strong>We found six bags with all the essential features plus some key perks that made them stand out.</strong></p>
<p>We decided to test bags that were mostly in the $50–$100 price range. We did test one $130 bag, however, to see if our testers noticed the difference high-end materials can make.</p>
<p>We skipped the really cheap bags we researched after reading too many accounts of bad zippers, bad stitching and uncomfortable straps. If you just want something cheap that will carry a laptop, you can use nearly any backpack and even get decent protection with a padded sleeve.</p>
<h3>What about premium bags?</h3>
<p>We like a lot of bags in the $200-and-up price range that we didn&#8217;t test. From the nine premium bags we researched in-depth, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EH3CM4C" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Incase &#8211; Icon</a>, the <a href="https://blackember.com/pages/waterproof-urban-backpacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Ember &#8211; Citadel</a>, the <a href="https://www.tombihn.com/collections/laptop-bags/products/synapse-25?variant=7593508110399" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Binh &#8211; Synapse</a> and the <a href="https://www.goruck.com/rucksacks/compare-rucksacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoRuck &#8211; GR1</a> came the closest to making the grade.</p>
<p>When we talked to our friends and coworkers about expensive bags, they all had very different ideas about what they wanted. Some people want a leather briefcase that will make a good impression at business meetings, while others want a pack with adjustable suspension for comfortable all-day trail use.</p>
<p>We decided not to try picking just one or two of these &#8220;ultimate upgrade&#8221; bags to test, but we hope that the testing we did with less expensive bags can help you find out about the features that make a great bag.</p>

<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Internal capacity:</b> Typically listed in liters, this is a measurement of how much space a pack has to hold bulky items. A 20-liter backpack is just big enough for a laptop and a few books, 25 liters gives you room to stash a sweater, and a 35-liter bag can usually replace a carry-on suitcase for weekend trips.</p>
<p><b>Fall protection: </b>There are three ways a good backpack can keep your computer safe from falls. First, the laptop pouch can be sewn so that its bottom is higher than the bottom of the bag. Second, the pocket can include foam padding to absorb shock and pressure. Finally, a pouch that holds your laptop tightly means there&#8217;s less room for it to knock around inside when your bag is bumped.</p>
<p><b>Fabric weight:</b> Fabrics are graded by weight in &#8220;deniers,&#8221; and 1000-denier nylon yarn is the extra-rugged stuff woven into the canvas-like materials used for suitcases and outdoor gear. The 500-denier yarn most bag manufacturers use is still resistant to abrasion and rips, but it&#8217;s significantly lighter and more supple. As saving weight becomes even more important, manufacturers are more likely to use thin 200-denier fabric in a &#8220;ripstop&#8221; weave that won&#8217;t fall apart if you get a hole.</p>

<p><b>Fabric type:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Nylon</b> is the gold standard for a tough, light-weight polymer that resists wear, heat and stains. The main downside to nylon is that it absorbs water, which makes it more difficult to dye and can lead to soggy-feeling fabric if you&#8217;re caught in the rain.</li>
<li><b>Polyester</b> is sometimes substituted to allow colors or textures that aren&#8217;t possible with nylon. It&#8217;s not as tough as nylon, but it&#8217;s very slightly more heat resistant and the fabric itself won&#8217;t get soggy.</li>
<li><b>Dyneema, Spectra and Kevlar</b> are extra-tough filaments (like fishing line) that are sometimes woven into the ripstop pattern of lightweight nylon to make it stronger.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Waterproof treatments: </b>Most fabric used in bags is given at least a quick spray with a durable water repellent (&#8220;DWR&#8221;) treatment. This coating will keep water in droplets and help it roll off your bag instead of soaking in. If your bag is sitting in the water or puddles form on the top of the bag, you need a fabric with a heavier waterproof backing and sealed seams to keep your gear dry.</p>
<p><b>Specialized pockets:</b> We looked specifically for bags that had some way to carry a water bottle or travel mug in an easy-to-reach place while you&#8217;re wearing it. Glasses don&#8217;t demand as much specific space, but a convenient pocket that will protect them from scratches is a nice bonus.</p>

<p><b>TSA checkpoint-friendly features:</b> Since 2008, the Transportation Safety Agency has had <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/releases/2008/08/15/checkpoint-friendly-laptop-bag-procedures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a specific set of rules</a> that allows you to keep your laptop inside some kinds of bags while clearing security checkpoints. Bags that meet these guidelines have a fold-out laptop sleeve or pouch that gives an unobstructed view of the laptop to the X-ray machine. The advantage is that you don&#8217;t need to pull your laptop out and put it in a bin, but sometimes these bags are actually less convenient for everyday laptop use.</p>
<p><b>Anti-theft features:</b> The most common and functional security feature we saw is a set of rings on some bags&#8217; zippers that lets you lock them together with a small padlock. Other features like embedded cut-proof steel mesh tend to add a lot of bulk and weight, so we discounted bags that included them.</p>
<p><b>Sternum and waist straps:</b> Even the best shoulder straps can only do so much for keeping a heavy load balanced and in place. A connecting strap across your chest or an extra strap around your waist will keep a backpack from slipping, shifting and flopping, which is especially important if you&#8217;re on a bike or running to catch a bus.</p>

<p><strong>We gave our six top bags to four testers, each with their own personal taste and set of needs.</strong> Two of our digital nomads are remote-working editors for Your Best Digs, and they rely on an Ogio backpack and a Tom Binh messenger bag, respectively.</p>
<p>One tester is a regional account manager who carries his laptop in a Timbuk2 backpack to different cities every week, and he gave us some perspective on the suitability of bags for air travel and on-the-road organization.</p>
<p>Our last tester is a biomechanical engineering PhD candidate who carries her laptop all over the University of California Irvine campus every day. She normally uses a North Face &#8211; Recon backpack, and she&#8217;s an avid hiker, so she provided some insight into the way laptop-focused bags compare to trail gear.</p>
<p>Our testers took these bags on planes, trains and motorcycles. We carried laptops ranging from 12-inch ultralights to full-size 15-inch models. We loaded each bag with our everyday complement of things like chargers, headphones, books, water bottles and lunches.</p>
<h3>Fit for different laptop sizes</h3>
[table id=257 /]
<p>While the average laptop is thinner and lighter than anything we could imagine a few decades ago, those of us with big desktop-replacement machines need their bags to be just as supportive and protective as ever.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as simple as saying that a bigger backpack will be better for more people, though. Our testers with slim or compact laptops felt much happier when using bags that kept their computers from flopping around.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ESKY9FU/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Swissgear &#8211; 1900</a> has, technically speaking, the biggest laptop pocket. That pocket is really a full-size section of the backpack, though, and it only has a velcro strap to keep a laptop from flopping around. If you keep your laptop in a neoprene sleeve and value the checkpoint-friendly design that might be totally fine, but most of us worried about how much our machines clunked around in the Swissgear bag.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F118789%2Frei-co-op-ruckpack-18-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REI &#8211; Ruckpack</a> had the opposite problem: While this slim and utilitarian bag will technically hold a 15-inch MacBook Pro, such a wide laptop will push out on the Ruckpack&#8217;s side pockets and make the bag much less usable than it should be.</p>
<h3>Comfort and stability</h3>
<p>After carrying laptops, lunches and other day-to-day loads for four weeks, our lead tester tried wearing each pack with 20 lbs of weight inside for ten minutes at a time while working at his desk and walking around the block. By the time he circled back to his first pack for a second try, it was clear which designs were actually comfortable under a bigger load.</p>
<p>The trail-born pedigree of The North Face &#8211; Mainframe and Mystery Ranch &#8211; Rip Ruck made them easy choices for comfort. The surprise was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H7WPYJ/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Targus &#8211; Work + Play</a> pack, which was still surprisingly comfortable with a full load.</p>
<h3>Waterproofing</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/waterproof.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Our team is fortunate enough to live in a climate without much unexpected rain, so none of our testers had to use these bags in a real downpour.</p>
<p>But we did test for waterproofing anyhow. We put a paper towel into each of the pockets and compartments of the six bags and then thoroughly drenched them with the soaker head from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-garden-hose-nozzle/">garden hose nozzle review</a>. Next, we blew the remaining water off the bags with a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-leaf-blower/">leaf blower</a> to simulate the worst conditions for waterproofing, like cycling in the rain.</p>
<p><strong>All of the bags have some kind of water repellent coating to help shed water.</strong> If you just get caught in a quick downpour while you&#8217;re walking to your car, you probably won&#8217;t have to worry about any of these bags letting water in.</p>
<p>Under a sustained downpour, though, most bags will let you down. Only <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-north-face-mainframe-laptop-backpack-dark-gray-heather-zinc-gray/5968000.p?skuId=5968000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The North Face &#8211; Mainframe</a> was able to keep any water from seeping in, undoubtedly because it features a flap that covers the main zipper and backing trim behind the other zips.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F129538%2Fmystery-ranch-rip-ruck-sack-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mystery Ranch &#8211; Rip Ruck</a> is a close second in this category, with its beefy water-resistant YKK Aquaguard zipper that has a polyurethane coating to minimize leaks. We still saw some drips seep through under the full blast of our test downpour, but the fabric on the Rip Ruck absorbed less water overall and dried out more quickly than the Mainframe.</p>

<p>Our testers all preferred the look, feel and features of <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-north-face-mainframe-laptop-backpack-dark-gray-heather-zinc-gray/5968000.p?skuId=5968000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The North Face &#8211; Mainframe</a> mid-size laptop backpack. With 24 liters of storage capacity but only one main compartment, this bag strikes a great compromise between carrying enough gear and keeping a sleek, minimalist profile.</p>
<p>The North Face is a top manufacturer of sporting goods, with a devoted following among those who use their gear on the trail and those who just want to look like they do. The Mainframe is based on many of the best features of the big <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LFE73T0/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">30-liter Surge travel pack</a>, cut down to the size of smaller daypacks like the Recon and Jester. The Mainframe has only one main compartment and a clean, no-nonsense set of accessory pockets.</p>

<p>Despite being a bag designed for sale at Best Buy exclusively, The North Face didn&#8217;t cut any corners with the build quality. The Mainframe uses heavy YKK coil zips with cast metal pulls all over. The fabric used is mostly 210-denier ripstop Cordura nylon, with a heavier Oxford-weave polyester-nylon bottom panel to help with long-term wear.</p>
<p><strong>This was easily the most-loved style among our testers, too.</strong> The outside zips, loops and straps are just enough to indicate a serious piece of gear without making you look like you got lost on your way to a campsite. Best Buy only buys this in gray, but the fabric has a nice texture and pattern that goes with basically everything.</p>

The style, comfort and versatility made this a winner with each of our testers.</p><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-north-face-mainframe-laptop-backpack-dark-gray-heather-zinc-gray/5968000.p?skuId=5968000" target="_blank"><button>See Price at BestBuy.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The waterproofing on the Mainframe, as mentioned above, is excellent. Water won&#8217;t get in through the flap-covered zippers, even after a thorough soak and a blast of wind. It&#8217;s not a dry bag, though: The Nylon fabric will soak up water if you leave it sitting in the bottom of a kayak. If you do get caught in a downpour, make sure to empty the bag, and let the fabric dry out.</p>
<h3>Not as good for 17-inch laptops</h3>
<p>While the Mainframe is technically just big enough to hold the old 17-inch 2011 MacBook Pro (which is 10.51 inches wide and just under an inch thick), it&#8217;s not going to help you with a massive gaming laptop. For example, the new 17-inch chassis from Clevo (customized and re-packaged by specialty brands like Sager and Falcon Northwest) fills up 11.6 inches in pocket width and more than 1.6 inches in thickness.</p>
<p>The Mainframe doesn&#8217;t make any allowance for thickness in the cut of the pouch; the pocket panel is cut about a half-inch wider than the back panel of the pack so it puffs out, and the stiff padding materials will bend around a laptop to allow a thicker laptop to fit. Even an old 14&#8243; Thinkpad is a tight fit when you slide it in.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a good thing on the whole; modern laptops tend to err on the side of slimness. When we were carrying a Surface and a MacBook Air, they practically disappeared in the bigger laptop pockets and moved around a lot when we walked with them, but the Mainframe keeps slim laptops snug.</p>
<p>In addition to the main laptop compartment, the Mainframe also has a padded tablet pocket, at 8 by 11 inches it&#8217;ll hold a mid-size tablet like the 10.5-inch iPad Pro or Surface Go.</p>
<h3>Useful organization for essentials</h3>
<p>The big, vertical zippered pockets on the Mainframe are a great compromise between a second full-size compartment and a smaller set of handy outside pockets. <strong>These pockets are just right for easy access with the bag slung over one shoulder and pulled in front of your chest.</strong></p>
<p>A fleece-lined glasses pocket is great for fragile and scratch-prone items, but it&#8217;s big enough to nestle a full-size pair of folding headphones.</p>
<p>For hydration on the go, the side water-bottle pockets are also basically perfect. They&#8217;re stretchy elastic mesh, so they don&#8217;t look baggy when empty, and they can secure anything from a compact 12-ounce water bottle to a 32-ounce insulated monster like <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/">our beloved Klean Kanteen</a>. The side compression straps also make these bottle pockets great for lugging a compact tripod.</p>
<p>One thing this bag doesn&#8217;t do well is keep your lunch separated from your books. With only the one main compartment and a slim profile, stuff gets squished together when you start walking with this pack on.</p>
<p>Of all the bags we tested, the Mainframe was the model everyone loved most. It&#8217;s a great backpack for small to mid-size laptops up to 15 inches, and organization features are ideal for keeping accessories handy during a day at work or the library. It can&#8217;t carry enough clothes for a weekend trip, but for bombing around town it won&#8217;t slow you down.</p>

If the Mainframe is still too big for your minimalist setup, the <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F118789%2Frei-co-op-ruckpack-18-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18-liter Ruckpack from REI</a> impressed all of our testers with its thoughtful design that gets the maximum possible utility out of a tiny bag.</p>
<p>Let’s get the drawbacks out of the way: The Ruckpack is not very waterproof, and the thin ripstop nylon doesn&#8217;t inspire as much confidence as the heavier fabric on other bags. The zippers on the Ruckpack are also the smallest in this lineup of packs.</p>
<p>If you fill up the laptop pouch completely with a 15-inch laptop (or even a clunky older 14-inch) you&#8217;ll lose most of the functionality of the side organizer pocket and the water bottle pocket. This bag really only shines if you&#8217;re carrying a laptop that’s 13 inches or smaller.</p>
<p>REI sells a 28-liter version of this back that&#8217;s an inch wider and should be better for carrying a full-size laptop, but it&#8217;s not any less expensive than the higher-quality North Face bag.</p>
<p><strong>The real selling point of the Ruckpack is the organization features.</strong> One zippered side pocket can hold pens, a wireless mouse, every day carry tools and pocket-sized notebooks. There&#8217;s even a dedicated glasses pocket tucked inside. Access to essentials couldn&#8217;t get much better than this.</p>

<p>This is a top-loading bag, and it&#8217;s small. If you only need to carry a small laptop and stuff a sweater and a paperback in the main compartment, the design is fantastic. Even loading up headphones, spare chargers and notepads, we were impressed at how well it carries.</p>
<p>If you want to get your laptop in and out of a backpack as quickly as possible, the zip-around shape of this top flap isn&#8217;t ideal. You basically need two hands to open and close this backpack easily.</p>

All of the things that make this ideal for the trail also make it excellent at carrying your laptop and essential accessories. If you need to carry a 15-inch or bigger laptop, though, this will be too small. </p><a href="hthttp://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F118789%2Frei-co-op-ruckpack-18-pack" target="_blank"><button>See Price at REI.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The shoulder straps on the Ruckpack are fully featured, with an adjustable-height sternum strap and a waist belt you can tuck away or remove altogether. The padding on these straps is good for the amount of gear you could reasonably pack inside.</p>
<p>If you find yourself carrying jugs of water or bags of flour, you&#8217;ll definitely want to use the extra straps to take as much weight off your shoulders as you can.</p>
<p>For a slim and budget-priced bag, we were impressed to find a full-size water-bottle pocket that&#8217;s not just floppy netting. The cinch strap does a good job of adjusting for different bottles, and the cinch strap can make this side pouch a good spot for long and bulky items as well. There are even elastic loops and hidden ladder straps if you want to attach pouches or trekking poles.</p>
<p>The only problems we had with the Ruckpack are excused because of the compact size or the price constraints. For a budget-priced bag carrying a compact laptop, the design sensibility on offer here is top-tier.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H7WPYJ/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Targus &#8211; Work + Play Fitness</a> is our pick for the best 17-inch laptop backpack. With ample space for a large laptop, but not so many random pockets that you&#8217;ll lose your wallet and keys, this is a big bag that&#8217;s also smart.</p>
<p>Our testers didn&#8217;t rate this bag highest for any one factor, but when we went back and compared bags for how they looked and how well they helped us carry stuff, a few of us gave Targus major bonus points.</p>
<p>This Targus laptop bag carries well. It&#8217;s a bag that feels smaller than it really is, and that&#8217;s almost always a sign of great bag design. The straps are comfortable, and there&#8217;s a sternum strap to keep it from slipping off your shoulders on a long trek or bike ride.</p>
<p><strong>The perfect application for this bag is for anyone who hits the gym mid-day or on the way to work.</strong> For those people, the shoe compartment, laundry bag and toiletry organizer are excellent features that set this bag apart.</p>
<p>Note that the shoe compartment at the bottom of this bag is vented, which makes it better for the stated application but hurts the water resistance of the bag.</p>
<p>There is a small coat-hanger style hook that peeks out of the top of this backpack and attaches to a strap that runs all the way down to the bottom seam. For accessing toiletries and the laundry bag in a locker room, that&#8217;s a really great feature. In some offices, it might also work, but we can&#8217;t see it being useful in a coffee shop.</p>
<p>One downside to a full-zip main compartment design like this is that you might accidentally open the bag farther than you intend. If you just want to get your laptop out and wind up dropping books on the floor, that&#8217;s annoying.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear if this laptop pocket qualifies as TSA-checkpoint friendly. If you have anything in the laundry bag ,and you don&#8217;t separate the velcro-attached shaving kit, it certainly wouldn&#8217;t be. But with the right load-out and an understanding TSA crew, you might be able to keep your laptop in the pouch going through security.</p>

It's not as stylish or rugged as some backpacks, but the features are well-designed.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H7WPYJ/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p><strong>Even if you don&#8217;t use all of the features as they were designed, the pouches and pockets are great for keeping your giant laptop and accessories in order.</strong></p>
<p>Compared to the Swissgear and other full-size backpacks we tested or researched Targus hit a good balance of size and function. Some large bags have too many pockets and pouches, and that makes it hard to remember where you stashed seldom-used accessories.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a giant backpack that will replace your suitcase, but it is a great bag to carry large laptops and bulky items in a sensible way. Many people could probably get away with using this as a weekend carry-on.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve got a giant laptop, there are two ways to carry it in a backpack. You can find a bag like the Targus with a built-in sleeve or pouch that will cradle your big-boned device and keep it from moving around, or you can forget about trying to find the perfect bag and just throw it in a full-size compartment.</p>
<p>Targus made this bag with a pouch that&#8217;s 11-inches wide and an inch thick when empty, which makes it big enough to hold most modern 17-inch desktop replacements. It&#8217;s far more secure than the giant flip-out compartment SwissGear uses, though some bigger laptops won&#8217;t fit.</p>
<p>The pocket features a flap that completely encloses the laptop, which mostly gets in the way when you want to quickly insert or remove your machine. Most bags just use a simple strap for this kind of extra security. Fortunately, you can tuck the flap inside the pocket and mostly forget it&#8217;s there.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re carrying a tablet with your giant laptop, there&#8217;s also a padded tablet pocket in the second compartment.</p>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>The quality of materials on the Targus bag is less impressive overall than on the Swissgear or Dakine packs, but comparable to the REI. The mesh padding on the back is ample, but a few of our testers raised concerns about how it will hold up over time.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of recognizable zipper brand names or over-sized coils, the zippers on this bag were actually some of the smoothest-zipping we found. Dakine gets points for using YKK zippers on a backpack that costs less than $60, but Targus seems to have found a supplier that gives even better bang for the buck.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a 17-inch laptop, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H7WPYJ/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Targus &#8211; Work + Play Fitness</a> gives you carrying capacity without forcing you into a giant bag.</li>
<li>Open-flat design is great for travel or even the locker room, not ideal at a coffee shop.</li>
<li>The organizer pockets in this bag are aimed at gym use, but they work for organizing other accessories too.</li>
<li>If you change shoes at the office, definitely check out this bag.</li>
<li>Targus bags are easy to find, but are priced fairly high.</li>

<p>If you&#8217;re tired of stretched-out water bottle pockets and broken zippers, and if you take one look at the latest trendy fake rucksacks and shake your head, <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F129538%2Fmystery-ranch-rip-ruck-sack-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mystery Ranch offers the Rip Ruck</a>.</p>
<p>For laptops up to 15 inches, this backpack includes a great carry pouch with elastic bands at the side to keep the fit snug. It&#8217;ll take thicker models than the Mainframe, since the main restriction here is the width of the pack rather than the size of the pouch. There&#8217;s a tablet pouch integrated into the laptop pouch, and there are also document sorters in the laptop compartment which are great for large books, notepads and magazines.</p>
<p>The laptop compartment in this backpack is nearly perfect. It&#8217;s the rest of the bag that was polarizing.</p>
<h3>Materials and comfort</h3>
<p>This is a bag made from 500-denier Cordura nylon, which is an industry standard for rugged durability. It&#8217;s coated on the inside for good water resistance, and this worked very well to keep this bag from feeling soggy after a good dousing.</p>
<p>Mystery Ranch has built their brand around beefy YKK Aquaguard coil zips in surprisingly versatile configurations, and these are very good at keeping out water without relying on flaps. <strong>This is the fastest bag to get gear in and out of, and it only let in droplets of water in our simulated downpour.</strong></p>
<p>Padding on the shoulder straps of the Mystery Ranch makes the bag cushy above all else. The thick padding has enough contouring and a functional adjustable-height sternum strap. There is no waist belt.</p>
<p>The fit and stability of this pack when it&#8217;s weighed down mostly feels like a half-baked version of the fully-adjustable suspension system that Mystery Ranch uses on bigger bags. That said, if competition for this bag is supposed to be the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G4ZYFXI/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kanken</a> or other classic leather-and-canvas rucksack designs with skinny or un-padded straps, the Rip Ruck is pure joy.</p>
<p>One of our testers was quick to note that he was very disappointed that the so-called &#8220;black&#8221; Cordura nylon was an inky-green and didn&#8217;t match the black straps and zippers. The other styles available make that contrast look less accidental, but this is not a bag for people who are picky about aesthetics.</p>
<h3>Too many zippers</h3>
<p>Mystery Ranch is probably best known for the three-zip design they use on hiking and hunting backpacks, and the Rip Ruck gives you a sample of that utility. The zip on the biggest compartment opens and closes on each side independently, but not up and down for duffel-style packing like other Mystery Ranch bags.</p>
<p>We love the design philosophy of Mystery Ranch, and we love the convenience of opening the one part of a pack you need access to. Most Mystery Ranch bags don&#8217;t offer a quick and easy way to get a laptop out of the suspended pouch, though.</p>
<p>The Rip Ruck is one of the company&#8217;s few designs to separate the main compartment from the laptop pouch (which can also hold a hydration bladder). They&#8217;ve also included two outside pockets, which are a good size for water bottles or other accessories.</p>
<p>The let-down of the Rip Ruck is in all its fasteners. The comment we heard most from testers was &#8220;too many zippers.&#8221; We think it&#8217;s important for a laptop bag to have easily accessible pockets so you don&#8217;t need to dump out your backpack just to find a charging cable or wireless mouse, but the dual-zip-plus-buckle design makes these pockets almost less convenient than an inside pouch.</p>
<p>The dual zippers on the outside pouch pockets help keep a water bottle or travel mug more secure than we expected, but a side-mount elastic water bottle pouch would have been far better.</p>

<h3>Who is this bag for?</h3>
<p>If you need a bag for hiking, Mystery Ranch has some <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F144968%2Fmystery-ranch-scree-32-pack-mens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-suspension designs like the Scree</a> that help you keep your load stable and comfortable while still allowing quick and easy access with the three-way zip. The Rip Ruck is close to that kind of utility, but the straps aren&#8217;t part of an adjustable suspension system. <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F146676%2Fmystery-ranch-urban-assault-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Urban Assault</a> is a much better daypack for hiking, but there&#8217;s an extra zipper and a giant flap between you and easy access to your laptop.</p>
<p>If you want a quality, rugged daypack that also has a laptop pocket, this isn&#8217;t even the best of both worlds. It&#8217;s a compromise, and it leans heavily on using buckles for fashion&#8217;s sake to justify itself. There&#8217;s nothing you can&#8217;t do with this backpack compared to the others we tested, but we expected better organization features.</p>
<p><strong>So, if you want a bag like a classic alpine rucksacks with updated materials, comfy shoulder straps and room for a thick 15-inch laptop, this is a pretty great backpack.</strong> The Rip Ruck is much easier to use than one with a traditional design and leather cinch-straps.</p>
<p>The rest of the materials and construction quality make this a good value if you like the look and attitude. This is one of those buy-it-for-life bags that you can use for decades without seeing any obvious signs of wear.</p>

<p>Dakine is a company with established credibility in the surf-and-skate scene, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SV9PRBO/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dakine &#8211; Campus 33 liter</a> is their entry-level backpack. As the name implies, this is a student-targeted bag, but it has some features that could make it a good value for anyone toting around a laptop.</p>
<p>Dakine uses good materials in this bag, and it&#8217;s offered in a wide array of patterns. For build quality, Dakine uses the good stuff, like real YKK-branded coil zips. They&#8217;re not the smoothest zippers we tested, so the low price is a reflection of cheaper materials.</p>
<p>Waterproofing on this bag is almost non-existent. Your stuff won&#8217;t get soaked in a brief shower, but this bag let in the most water of all we tested.</p>
<p>Note that Dakine makes the Campus line in a variety of fabrics, so if you love the style but want more waterproofing you can get this bag in the &#8220;squall&#8221; color with waterproof Cordura fabric. The big zips are still going to be the primary source of leaks, though.</p>
<p>The waxed nylon bottom panel used for the &#8220;tamarindo&#8221; colorway we tested is a nice touch, with just the right amount of creasing and patina from daily use.</p>
<p>When it comes right down to it, this is a basic backpack with a giant laptop pouch. It&#8217;s definitely the least comfortable backpack if you intend to fill the big main compartment with books or anything else heavy.</p>
<p>If simple and low-cost are what you want, browse the colorways on offer and see if there&#8217;s a style you like. <strong>Our testers were most dissatisfied with the minimal laptop support provided by the gigantic pouch.</strong> It&#8217;s suspended and padded, but smaller laptops just flop around. The most interesting thing about the bag is probably the smallest outside pocket, which is insulated for carrying a small lunch.</p>

<p>SwissGear laptop backpacks are some of the best-selling laptop and school bags of all time, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ESKY9FU/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SwissGear &#8211; ScanSmart 1900</a> is one of the most reviewed laptop bags on Amazon. It&#8217;s a giant backpack with some travel-oriented features that might make it good carry-on luggage.</p>
<p>The association between SwissGear and Swiss Army knives is hard-earned, and the brand represents affordable utilitarian bags. The 1900 is really missing a clear purpose behind its design features, though; like a pocket knife with a corkscrew, we&#8217;re not really sure what this is best used for.</p>
<p>The biggest failing of the SwissGear is the laptop compartment. It&#8217;s TSA-approved checkpoint friendly, which means you can unzip the laptop compartment from the rest of the bag and fold it onto the x-ray machine belt without waiting for someone to restock the trays you would need to put your laptop into otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>The Scansmart feature works, but after using these features a few times, our testers agree that it&#8217;s almost quicker to pull the laptop out of a well-designed bag.</strong></p>
<p>The real drawback of Scansmart is that your laptop is mostly bumping around in its giant pouch with only foam padding around the edges to protect it. If your laptop is smaller than a 13-inch model, you&#8217;d probably wind up putting it in an inside compartment.</p>
<p>The SwissGear laptop bag does have a lot of pockets, though. If you&#8217;re diligent about always putting your stuff in the same place so you don&#8217;t lose it, this is a bag that can organize your laptop-toting life.</p>
<p>For the rest of us, the sheer number of pockets is just a liability: This bag will help you lose your keys, your wallet, your passport and your boarding pass on the same layover.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After surveying our friends and coworkers, we came to the conclusion that a laptop backpack doesn&#8217;t have to be overly complicated, but it should help keep your laptop secure and your accessories organized.</p>
<p>In testing, the bag that accomplished that task best for laptops up to 15 inches was <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-north-face-mainframe-laptop-backpack-dark-gray-heather-zinc-gray/5968000.p?skuId=5968000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The North Face &#8211; Mainframe</a>. This bag strikes a balance between elegant and nerdy and offers just enough room to keep track of the stuff most of us need. It&#8217;s not a cheap laptop backpack, but The North Face uses top-grade materials for durability, waterproofing and comfort.</p>
<p>If you only want a slim and affordable bag to carry a small laptop, <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F118789%2Frei-co-op-ruckpack-18-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REI&#8217;s house-brand Ruckpack</a> gets you some of the same great functionality for about 35-percent less money.</p>
<p>If you need to carry a 17-inch behemoth, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H7WPYJ/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Targus &#8211; Work + Play Fitness</a> backpack impressed our testers with sensible organization features that help you carry things most backpacks are just not good at carrying, like shoes.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After weeks writing with the most popular pens on the market, we've determined that the Pilot - G2 is the best. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e tested 15 pens, ranging in price from just under $1 to just over $25, and found that the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058NN4C0/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Pilot &#8211; G2</a> is overall one of the best pens on the market. The G2 is America’s top-selling gel pen. Our testers loved this pen for its smooth ink flow, professional look and quick-dry ink. As runners-up, we think the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IE87/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">uni-ball &#8211; Onyx</a> is the best rollerball and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004U9TEEA/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paper Mate &#8211; InkJoy</a> is the best ballpoint.</p>

<h2 id="how">How we selected pens to test</h2>
<p>If you’ve searched online for pens, you know that there are hundreds and hundreds from which to choose. So, we narrowed down our prospects by focusing only on gel, ballpoint and rollerball pens. These are the pens most commonly used in people’s everyday lives, rather than fountain or calligraphy pens.</p>
<p>We only tested pens that were rated well among online retailers, and for the most part, we selected pens that cost well under $5. (The one exception is the Cross rollerball pen, which was mentioned frequently enough in forums that we had to give it a test.)</p>
<p>We consulted forums like /r/pens/ to find out what inexpensive pens the aficionados were recommending. We browsed through the <a href="https://www.penaddict.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pen Addict’s</a> blog for inspiration and consulted The Wirecutter’s pen review, too.</p>
<p>Finally, we chose to focus primarily on .7 mm pens, which create medium-sized lines and are a good writing choice for a lot of people. However, we also tested some smaller and larger pens for those who want range.</p>
<p>It should be noted that while some of our testers used the pens to freehand draw or doodle, we did not test pens that were created explicitly for drawing purposes. (That’s another review for another time!)</p>

<h3>Ballpoint pens</h3>

<p>Ballpoint pens are arguably the most popular for everyday use, and for good reason. Their ink writes smoothly and dries quickly. Their refills also last longer than other types of ink. However, the oil-based ballpoint ink can occasionally get messy and blobby at the tip, making it less-than-ideal for longform writing and journaling. Conventional ballpoint pens come in three sizes: fine (making lines .8 mm wide and thinner), medium (1.0 mm to 1.2 mm) and bold (1.4 mm and wider).</p>
<h3>Gel pens</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11086" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9841.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9841.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9841-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9841-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9841-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9841-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9841-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9841-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9841-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9841-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9841-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9841-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Many of us remember the thick-lined, metallic and opaque pens of our childhood, often with whimsical product names like “moonlight” and “stardust.” These type of pens get a bad rap from adults, who can see them as impractical. One of our designer-testers even specified that they’ll test “anything but gel pens, please!”</p>
<p>But while there <i>are </i>a number of youthful-looking gel pens on the market (like the Gelly Roll we tested), there are also plenty of quality, businesslike pens that you may not know use gel ink. Gel ink is simply pigment in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_pen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">water-based gel</a>. If you’re looking for strong colors and sharp, featherless lines, then a gel pen is probably a great choice for you.</p>
<p>That being said, if you’re left-handed, you should <a href="https://www.penchalet.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-pen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stay away from gel</a>. It doesn’t dry as quickly as its ballpoint and rollerball counterparts.</p>

<p>Rollerball pens use a dark, saturated, fast-flowing liquid ink. They create finer lines than a conventional ballpoint pen, and unlike gel pens, the ink dries quickly enough for left-handers. Because of the free-flowing ink, rollerball pens require less pressure, making them more comfortable to write with.</p>
<p>However, a rollerball’s intense ink can sometimes bleed through paper if you’re not careful, and the pen can leak if it’s left uncapped or taken to high altitudes. Conventional rollerball pens come in three sizes: micro (.5 mm), fine (.7 mm) and bold (.8 mm and wider).</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>A pen can seem like a deceptively simple product, but there’s a lot that goes into making one great. Ask any pen aficionado and they can wax poetic about nibs and ink flow for hours. However, for the purposes of the everyday pen user, there are only a few things you need to keep in mind:</p>
<p><b>Ink flow:</b> You want a pen that creates a clean, consistent line. It shouldn’t skip, bleed through the paper, or feather out into more tiny lines. Similarly, the ink should come out easily, requiring you to put very little pressure on the pen.</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SiegePenGIF.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p><b>Comfort and aesthetics:</b> The pen should look nice sitting out on your desk, but more importantly it should be designed to hold comfortably. Look for lighter pens. They will be easier on your hand than heavy ones. And don’t be fooled by pens with soft grips included on them; they’re not necessarily any more comfortable.</p>
<p>You can make your pen even more comfortable to hold by using it correctly. This may seem like an elementary skill, but many of us are doing it wrong (or have forgotten proper form in the age of the keyboard). Remember to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press down only as much as you need to get a smooth line</li>
<li>Use good posture to prevent writing fatigue</li>
<li>Write from your arms and shoulders, rather than your fingertips</li>
<li>Use quality paper; we tested our pens on classic Moleskine notebooks</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Line width:</b> Most pens are marketed with a millimeter measurement somewhere on the package. This measurement refers to the width of the line your pen will create. Many people enjoy writing with a .7 mm pen, which is a medium width. If you like to write with smaller letters, you can get pens in .5 mm, and some brands make them even finer than that.</p>
<p>If you like to make big, bold strokes, you can pick something with a 1.0 mm width or greater. Some consumers find that they like a certain brand and model of pen, but only in a certain size. So if you think a pen is a good fit for you, but you don’t quite love how it writes, try sizing up or down.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We started by rounding up a group of designers at our <a href="https://www.siegemedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content marketing agency</a> in San Diego, and gave them each a few pens and a Moleskine notebook to call their own. In the weeks leading up to our formal focus group testing, they were encouraged to use the pens daily, whether it be for journaling, making grocery lists, signing cards or sketching out plans for the next photoshoot.</p>
<p>Then, we asked them to join us in a focus group, where they wrote assigned sentences (using every letter of the alphabet). Then, they had “free time” to use the pen however they pleased. After this process was complete, they filled out a survey about the experience using each pen.</p>
<p>The survey asked questions including (but not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>How much pressure did you have to exert on the pen to write?</li>
<li>Was it comfortable to use this pen? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Does the pen ink smear if you touch it soon after writing?</li>
<li>What has been your overall experience using this pen?</li>
</ul>
<p>After the focus group, we tested our worst offender and best pens on cheaper notebook and scratch paper, to see how they’d act. We found the results to be just about what we expected; lesser-quality pens wrote even more poorly on cheap paper, and good quality pens wrote about the same, save for a slightly less-smooth flow.</p>
<h2 id="top-pick">The best overall: Pilot &#8211; G2</h2>

<p>Like a popular celebrity, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058NN4C0/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pilot- G2</a> inspires polarized opinions. People seem to either <i>love</i> or <i>hate</i> the G2 — and we have our suspicions that some hate it just because it’s so well-loved!</p>
<p>When we started our testing, we didn’t know which side of the fence we stood on for the great G2 debate. (Though we always lean toward skepticism.) After testing, though, it was clear that the G2 was the best pen overall, and by default the best gel pen. Our testers loved the writing experience with this one: a smooth flow of ink with no skipping, no feathering and no bleeding. The ink dried quickly as they wrote, meaning it’s a good pen for left handers. They also noted that the G2 had a pleasing haptic feedback when you clicked it, and that it looks professional enough to use in a meeting.</p>

Its smooth gel ink flow makes your writing look more clean and elegant. Plus, the ink dries quickly.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058NN4C0/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The G2 is retractable, meaning you can carry it around in your pocket without being jabbed. It’s also refillable, but according to Pilot, you won’t have to refill it often. They say that their pen is “proven to last longer than the average of competitive gel ink brands.”</p>
<p>It’s available in four sizes (.38 mm, .5 mm, .7 mm and 1.0 mm) and comes with a comfort grip. (Though, many pen enthusiasts will tell you that these included rubber grips don’t necessarily add to the comfort.)</p>
<p>One thing to beware of with the G2 in finer sizes: its thin point allows you to create beautifully thin and close-together characters, but won’t mask any shakiness in your hands. So if you don’t have a steady grip (or tend to go hard on the caffeine), you may want to choose a different pen — or opt for a bolder point. If you do choose the G2 in a fine point, it should set you back less than a $1.50 per pen.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a pen of the rollerball variety, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IE87/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">uni-ball &#8211; Onyx</a>. Sleek, black and professional looking, our testers gave the Onyx high marks for its lightweight and fine tip. It doesn’t bleed or feather or skip when you’re writing with it, and it creates a nice uniform line.</p>
<p>The Onyx does require slightly more pressure to write with (and has a lighter-pigmented ink) than our top pick, but for the more heavy-handed writers, this may be a welcome feature.</p>

<p>What prevented the Onyx from being our No. 1 pick? It can smudge if you touch it too quickly after writing, which makes it non-ideal for left-handed writers. One tester also remarked that “this pen was [their] favorite … but [they] could tell it was an overall cheaper model.” We don’t consider this a fatal flaw though; at less than 50 cents a pen, it <i>is</i> a cheaper model.</p>
<p>Those who aim to be more eco-friendly will like that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IE87/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Onyx</a> is made from 80 percent post-consumer recycled electronics — a fact uni-ball is proud of, as evidenced by the “eco” logo on each pen. uni-ball says that their Onyx ink also protects against “water, fading and fraud.” However, we didn’t test for this.</p>

<p>Ballpoint is the most popular type of pen, so it’s surprising that our top pick is a somewhat less popular brand. Sure, Paper Mate products are ubiquitous in the office supply world, but their pens have notably fewer reviews on Amazon — and are hardly discussed by pen enthusiasts. In the interest of diversity, we tested a few Paper Mate’s anyway, and we’re glad we did. Our testers loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004U9TEEA/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InkJoy Ballpoint</a>.</p>

<p>They found that the pen didn’t bleed or feather, and it didn’t smudge either. They thought the pen’s grip was solid and comfortable, which led to nice, uniform lines. The one minor discrepancy with the Paper Mate was that each new pen requires a bit of “warming up” the first time around before it stops skipping and starts writing smoothly. At most retailers, the InkJoy will cost you well under a dollar per pen.</p>

<p><b>Pentel &#8211; Energel-X (gel): </b>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005EE4UG2/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pentel &#8211; Energel</a> is another pen that most people either love or hate. We fell somewhere on the <i>like</i> end of that spectrum. On the plus side, it has a nice grip, requires little pressure to write with and doesn’t bleed. It creates a uniform lines and the ink flows smoothly. However, the Pentel does have a tendency to feather, and it can smear if you touch it right after writing. For these reasons, one tester claimed that it made them “write messier than [they] already do.” So, buy this one at your own risk — if you have nice handwriting and prefer a dark, saturated ink, it may still be a great pen for you. The Energel-X will likely cost you over $2, making it a little bit more of an investment than your typical office supply pen.</p>
<p><b>Zebra &#8211; F-701 (ballpoint): </b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002L6RB80/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zebra</a> is an esteemed name in the world of writing utensils, and after testing their F-701, we can see why. Aesthetically, it stands out from the other pens with its sleek, all-metal body. Our testers said it felt sturdy, and they liked the textured grip. It met all the basic requirements of a good pen: no skipping, bleeding or feathering and a smooth and uniform ink flow. It also doesn’t smudge when you touch it. Our testers’ primary complaint is that the ink is relatively light in color — something you may not expect from a pen that costs over $5. <b> </b></p>
<p><b>uni-ball &#8211; Jetstream Premier (ballpoint): </b>A crowd favorite, uni-ball makes a slew of good quality pens, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001PV13JK/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jetstream Premier</a> (about $7) is one of them. Testers especially appreciated some design features of this pen, namely the softened click action and large grip. The only flaws we found were that its ink doesn’t dry very quickly, and it requires a moderate amount of pressure to write.</p>
<p><b>Uni &#8211; Jetstream (ballpoint): </b>We also liked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001BYNGGO/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Uni &#8211; Jetstream</a>: a pen with a bit of cult following. Different in design from the Premier with its thick gel grip, testers were a fan of its smudge free ink and comfortable hold. One tester noted that though it writes well, they wish the “grip was a little less squishy.” They felt like they “lost a little control with how thick it is.” One of the most expensive pens on our list, the Uni will cost you over $10 at most retailers.</p>
<p><b>Pilot &#8211; Precise V5 (ballpoint): </b>Pilot, the makers of our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058NN4C0/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">best pen overall,</a> also did a good job with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00347A8C6/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">V5</a>. Our testers loved the way this pen writes, and appreciated its uniform and even ink flow. It didn’t bleed or feather, and it required only a small amount of pressure to write. Our only gripe with the V5? It doesn’t have much of a grip, which can make it hard to hold.</p>

<p><b>Sakura &#8211; Gelly Roll Classic (gel): </b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075VLPL1F/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sakura</a> makes many of the fun, glittery gel pens that added color to our childhood, so we were hoping we’d like their office-appropriate black gel pen. However, we found it very uncomfortable to write with. It also skipped more than the other pens we tested.</p>
<p><b>Cross &#8211; Beverly (gel): </b>Cross is known for making higher-end pens that can cost as much as $10,000 (like their discontinued AT0086-107G). We tested one that costs significantly less than that; their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012ENWGI4/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Beverley</a> pen rings in at about $30. <b> </b>Even though the Beverley is on the (very) low end of the cost spectrum for Cross, it’s still significantly more expensive than the other pens we tested. So, we expected excellent results. To our dismay, the Beverly was uncomfortable to write with, tended to feather, bleed and smudge and had a confusing design that made the cap seem like it was on backwards.</p>
<p><b>uni-ball &#8211; 207 Retractable (gel): </b>uni-ball may be popular among writers everywhere, but they missed the mark on their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FDR47E/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">207 gel pen</a>. Our testers found that uni-ball’s gel formula feathered and didn’t create very uniform lines.</p>
<p><b>Paper Mate &#8211; InkJoy (gel): </b>Though Paper Mate’s ballpoint version of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B019QBOG4Y/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InkJoy</a> was the best in our tests, we weren’t as impressed by the gel version. We found that it feathered, bled and tended to smudge.</p>
<p><b>Bic &#8211; Round Stic Xtra Life (ballpoint): </b>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00347A8NK/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bic</a> felt like a standard, uninspired office pen. It was uncomfortable to hold, required a decent amount of pressure to write with, and the ink often felt dry and uneven.</p>
<p><b>uni-ball &#8211; Vision &amp;</b> <b>Vision Elite (rollerball): </b>Both uni-ball’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IE8J/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vision</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002S5383G/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vision Elite</a> feathered, bled and smudged. The Vision also failed to deliver a smooth flow or a uniform line.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>A good pen can make the everyday tasks, from taking notes in a meeting to making a grocery list, a little bit more pleasant. And the good news is, they don’t have to cost you a fortune. All of our top pens cost under $5, and some of them cost under $1. If you’re looking for the perfect all around pen, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058NN4C0/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pilot &#8211; G2 gel pen</a>. If you need a rollerball pen, choose the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IE87/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">uni-ball Onyx</a> for clean-writing lines, and if you prefer the more utilitarian ballpoint style, opt for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004U9TEEA/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paper Mate InkJoy</a>.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>To find the best mechanical pencil, we scoured forums like r/mechanicalpencil and blogs like <a href="https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2008/12/15/review-uni-ball-kuru-toga-mechanical-pencil.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pen Addict</a> (Brad and his friends also love pencils) and <a href="https://bleistift.blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bleistift</a> to get an idea of the pencils the obsessives like best. We also consulted Wirecutter’s and <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/08/pencils/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wired’s</a> reviews of mechanical pencils. Then, we took to Amazon to find the most popular and highly-rated pencils loved by consumers.</p>
<p>We mostly chose pencils sized 0.5 mm to 0.7 mm, but we also tested some larger sizes for those who like range. We know that different people are looking for different levels of quality (and “keepability”) in a mechanical pencil, so we also tested a range of price points, from around 15 cents to 25 dollars per pencil. We tested brands known for their mechanical pencils (like Pentel) and the big two technical drawing brands, as well as some traditionally cheaper brands like Paper Mate.</p>

<h2 id="why-use">Why use them?</h2>
<p>A good mechanical pencil can create smooth, consistent lines (without the need for sharpening). It’s convenient for travel, and is guaranteed not to stain your pocket with ink. There are plenty of studies that show that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handwriting engages your brain</a> better than typing, and some would argue that the more tactile experience of graphite on paper connects you even more to your writing.</p>
<p>A mechanical pencil is refillable and looks more professional than a traditional pencil. Best (and most obvious) of all, its lead is erasable. So you can leave the correction fluid in the drawer. Tradition dictates that pencils should be used for rough sketches, arithmetic, and any other time that you might need to erase or change the marks you&#8217;ve made.</p>
<p>A high-quality mechanical pencil will almost always cost you less than a high-quality pen. And lest style be a concern, rest assured that there are plenty of attractive (and even pen-like) mechanical pencils on the market these days.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Lead size and grade: </b>Most people will like a 0.5mm or 0.7mm width pencil (the width refers to the size of the lead and the line it creates), but there are smaller and larger widths available if you prefer. Lead can also vary in hardness, which changes the shade and the strength of the tip. If you’re a heavy-handed writer or don&#8217;t want smudging, you may want to go with a lighter and harder lead; mechanical pencils often use different grades than regular pencils so they can make the leads stronger so interpreting the grades is tricky.</p>
<p><b>Cost: </b>Mechanical pencil costs can vary dramatically. But just like we learned testing pens, the most expensive isn’t always the best. You should be able to find a mechanical pencil you love for just a few dollars or less.</p>
<p><b>Grip: </b>A pencil grip won’t necessarily make your pencil more comfortable to use, and some people actually find them cumbersome. But if you want a pencil with a big, squishy grip, we know the perfect one for you. Surprisingly, our testers found the grips on some of the higher-end mechanical pencils more uncomfortable — perhaps because they’re designed to keep your grasp firmly in place, but not cushion your hand.</p>
<p><b>Lead advancement: </b>The classic mechanical pencil model requires you to click the top to advance the lead. Some newer models have a side-click mechanism instead. Others still have a twist advance. What’s best for you comes down to preference, though the idea behind a side advance pencil is that it’s quicker and disrupts your writing flow less.</p>

    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Siengepencils.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p><b>Retractable vs. capped: </b>Standard mechanical pencils are retractable, but if you want to look more polished in the boardroom, Pentel makes a capped version.</p>
<p><b>Lead cushioning: </b>Some mechanical pencils use a lead cushion or guard that reinforces the lead against rougher writing styles. If you’re aggressive with your writing utensils, you may want to consider it.</p>
<p><b>Materials and aesthetics: </b>Just like other writing utensils, there are an array of colors and styles of mechanical pencils available. You can get ones that resemble a pen or a conventional woodcase pencil, or you can get something bright and colorful. As a general rule, don’t assume that the quality of the pencil’s “look” is equal to how well it writes.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We recruited the same group of illustrators, hand lettering artists, bullet journalers and designers that we used for our best pen testing to test mechanical pencils. We gave them several weeks to use the pencils throughout their everyday lives, jotting down work notes, writing grocery lists and sketching designs. For quick notes and sketches like this, our testers found that almost all of the mechanical pencils were acceptable. The one exception? The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008LXM47K/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pilot &#8211; Eno</a> pencils, which came with lead that broke immediately upon use.</p>
<p>Then, we conducted a focus group in which our testers used each pencil to write assigned sentences (that used every letter of the alphabet) and doodle their own whimsical creations. After that, each tester gave detailed feedback on the experience of using each pencil. From there, we did a qualitative analysis to determine which mechanical pencil was the best.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, our testers had much stronger opinions about each pencil after being forced to write for minutes on end with each one. Also unsurprising, most feedback had to do with comfort rather than how the pencil actually wrote.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">The best overall: Pentel &#8211; Quicker Clicker</h2>

<p>By a narrow margin, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017DBEIG/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pentel &#8211; Quicker Clicker</a> (0.5mm) took first place in our tests for best mechanical pencil for writing. We liked its slick design and its smooth feel, and at just a few dollars, it’s high quality for a low price. Refilling it was easy, and so was advancing the lead.</p>
<p>Pentel is a Japanese-held company that has been innovating in the stationery industry since the mid-forties. They’ve come up with a lot of “firsts,” including the Quicker Clicker mechanism — Pentel says it’s the “original side-advance mechanical pencil.” It comes standard with Pentel lead and eraser, a strong metal clip and a transparent barrel so you can see the status of your lead. You can purchase it in a myriad of colors, and we especially like the classy look of the sky blue.</p>
<p>There are many a loyal Quicker Clicker devotee out there. Unfortunately, many who have been using it for years don’t like the new and “improved” model with the rubber grip. Our testers weren’t bothered by the grip, but some didn’t like the side advance as much as a “traditional” mechanical pencil that requires you to click the top.</p>

With smooth lead and a slick aesthetic, the Pentel - Quicker Clicker is both a joy to write with and attractive enough to leave out on your desk.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017DBEIG/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p><b>Though the </b><b>Quicker Clicker</b><b> has fine lead, it didn’t break when we were writing — even when used by a heavy-handed writer.</b> It also required very little pressure to write with, which will save you from hand cramps if you’ll be writing for a while. The Quicker Clicker, which our testers described as “smooth and reliable,” comes in three line widths: 0.5mm, 0.7mm and 0.9mm. You can get its lead in the traditional graphite (No. 2 grade), or in shades of violet and blue.</p>
<p>The eraser on the Quicker Clicker is high quality, as far as attached mechanical pencil erasers go. In our testing and regular use, we didn’t notice a lot of residue or “smearing” left from erasing mistakes. One thing to be aware of: Some Amazon users complain that the eraser refills for the Quicker Clicker are hard to find in brick-and-mortar stores. That being said, they’re readily available online.</p>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0026ICM1E/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Uni-ball Kuru Toga</a> (0.5mm) was a standout in our tests. Uni-ball is one of the most highly regarded brands in the stationery world, and the Kuru Toga is one of the most frequently discussed (and recommended) mechanical pencils by the aficionados. We can see why. The lead is high-quality and doesn’t break when you write with it. It’s got a hardy plastic body and clear grip, and feels balanced in your hand.</p>

Only narrowly missing the first place mark due to its hard-to-refill lead, the Uni-ball Kuru Toga impressed us with its high quality and virtually break-proof lead.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0026ICM1E/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>Uni-ball was founded in Tokyo, so it’s no wonder that its name is Japanese. The Kuru Toga was <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/kuru-toga-a-comprehensive-guide/pt/706" target="_blank" rel="noopener">named</a> with a Japanese portmanteau of “rotating” and “to become sharp.” This aptly describes the pencil’s rotating lead mechanism which keeps lead, you guessed it, consistently sharp.<b> For this reason, we think it’s one of the best mechanical pencils for writing longform.</b></p>
<p>Like with a traditional mechanical pencil, you click the top of the Kuru Toga to advance the lead, and from there it flows nice and smoothly. So why isn’t the Kuru Toga our first-choice pick? Changing the lead is a little more difficult than usual, due to the very small opening the pencil provides to insert the lead.</p>
<p>Even so, the Kuru Toga beats every other pick in terms of quality and smoothness of writing. And in those respects, it’s also right on par with the Quicker Clicker.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for something that feels good to write with, but doesn’t cause a panic if you lose it, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001T6QCJC/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paper Mate &#8211; 34666PP Clearpoint</a>. At less than $1.50 per pencil, it delivers quality and value all wrapped up in an erasable package.</p>

<p>Our testers found this pencil comfortable and easy to use. <b>One tester even went so far as to say that it was his favorite to write with — even more so than the expensive pencils. </b>The only concern with the Paper Mate? The eraser doesn’t erase very well. But with the ubiquitous and cheap auxiliary erasers available on Amazon, we don’t consider this too big a problem. In fact, you could purchase one of these mechanical pencils and a separate eraser for less than the cost of some of the other pencils on our list.</p>
<p>Like our top pick, the Paper Mate requires you to click the side of the pencil to advance it. It’s got a clear barrel so you can see the status of your lead, and it has a textured grip that some users will like. It’s worth noting that this one also comes in a colored pencil version with an array of rainbow leads available.</p>

<p><b>Zebra &#8211; M701:</b> Zebra is a big name in writing utensils, and we’re generally impressed with their products. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003G4SSLK/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M701</a> is not an exception. It’s got the weighted, smooth feel of a high-quality pencil and it encourages neat handwriting. Plus, while the grip isn’t smooth, it also doesn’t dig into your hand. The Zebra lost points because it felt especially heavy, which can tire your hand out over time. Still, some writers may prefer a weightier pencil. At over five dollars, it’s more expensive than most of our pencil picks, but we also think it’s one of the best quality mechanical pencils out there.</p>
<p><b>Pentel &#8211; Sharp Kerry: </b>There’s no doubt that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017DBEIG/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Quicker Clicker</a> is the best Pentel mechanical pencil, but the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006SW6YO/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Sharp Kerry</a> is probably the classiest. It looks exactly like a capped pen until you remove the cap and see its point. Some testers found it a bit slippery and hard to hold on to. Nonetheless, it can’t be beat for its sophisticated look, and when all is said and done, it writes well.</p>
<p><b>rOtring &#8211; 600 Series: </b>This is a classic design that has an avid following among designers; we’ll call the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001A1POWC/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">rOtring</a> a luxury mechanical pencil. At more than 25 dollars, it’s certainly an investment. As we would hope, it performed well on almost all accounts: smooth, break-free lead and controlled writing included. If you want a pencil that doesn&#8217;t get in the way when you&#8217;re using a stencil or ruler, this is a great pick. The only thing we didn’t like was the tiny hole you’re forced to fit the lead through when you refill it. It’s a minor complaint, but for a pencil this expensive, we expect near perfection. The rOtring comes pretty close.</p>
<p><b>Uni &#8211; Kuru Toga Roulette: </b>Similar to our runner up, but with an upgraded metal body and knurled grip. Our testers found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004OHNTVC/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Uni &#8211; Kuru Toga Roulette</a> to be “light and efficient” and an overall joy to use. There’s not much to pick on with this pencil — we love its performance. This is a good thing, since one will cost you about ten dollars. If we had to pick something to dislike, we’d say the eraser on this pencil is a little small.</p>
<p><b>Pentel &#8211; GraphGear 1000 Automatic Drafting: </b>Our testers found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GAU2RU/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GraphGear 1000</a> to be delightfully “futuristic,” and they also liked that the top clicks into place like a pen when you advance the lead. It’s nicely weighted (not too heavy or too light) and writes well and smoothly. The only downsides? Some testers found the lead filling process a little cumbersome and the lead itself a little weak.</p>
<p><b>Staedtler &#8211; Silver Series: </b>A pencil with the name “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002BNHMC8/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silver Series</a>” (and a price point of over ten dollars) invites some big expectations, and for the most part the Staetdler didn’t disappoint. It&#8217;s available with an extra-sharp 0.3mm size and writes precisely and smoothly. Like the rOtring, this is a technical pencil well-known among architects, planners, and designers. Our testers’ biggest complaint with this pencil was the grip; most found it somewhat uncomfortable. If you’re not writing longform content though, this pencil might still be for you.</p>
<p><strong>Paper Mate &#8211; 1.3mm Mechanical Pencils</strong> Paper Mate markets these as an alternative to the traditional woodcase pencils, and they do look like a fat and colorful version of the original. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CRGP8B6/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1.3mm</a> are targeted toward young children who are just learning to write — the larger width of these utensils makes them easier for little hands to control. However, there were plenty of user comments from full-grown adults who love these pencils and the thick lines they create. Are they right for you? It comes down to taste. Most of our testers found them very comfortable to write with.</p>

<p><b>BIC &#8211; Xtra Sparkle: </b>With a name like “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007L1VLO/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xtra Sparkle</a>,” we didn’t expect this BIC to deliver high-octane pencil performance. Still, with nearly 2,000 Amazon reviews, we had to give it a go. Unsurprisingly, it was sub-par in almost every way. When asked to describe it in two words, one tester said “meh” and “whatever.” For quality, we give this one a 50 percent. For jazzing up your kid’s pencil box? A solid 100.</p>
<p><b>Pilot &#8211; Color Eno: </b>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008LXM47K/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Color Eno</a> are the only “colored pencils” we tested, again due to their high number of reviews. Their primary tester, a designer, actually loved their hues. However, he found that the lead broke easily and that the pencils were overall “not super reliable.”</p>
<p><b>Pentel &#8211; Sharp Automatic:</b> The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000SBSAYE/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sharp Automatic</a> is another pencil that probably lands somewhere in the “meh” and “whatever” zone. It doesn’t stand out for much except its uncomfortable grip and the distinctive way it makes you feel not-in-control of your own writing.</p>
<p><b>Pentel &#8211; Twist Erase: </b>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00822DZLY/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Twist Erase</a> has a cool name, but the lead is too light, thick and dull. Our testers found that you have to press harder than is comfortable to use it. Another complaint: It doesn’t allow for very good control of your writing.</p>
<p><b>Pentel &#8211; GraphGear 500: </b>We loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GAU2RU/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GraphGear 1000</a>, but its little brother didn&#8217;t make the same impression. We found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006HXQXA/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">500</a> to be dull and fragile, with lead that breaks too easily and a lead changing process that’s too time-consuming. This one isn’t worth paying over five dollars for.</p>
<p><b>Alvin &#8211; Draft-Matic: </b>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VTP62U/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alvin,</a> another “luxury” pencil at over ten dollars for one, disappointed us. It’s sleek and cool looking, but it’s uncomfortable to hold, it’s too hard to change the lead and it made our writing uneven and scratchy.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>We tend to treat mechanical pencils like they’re disposable, but really, a good one should last you a long time. For one you’ll want to keep around, we recommend the all-around impressive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017DBEIG/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pentel &#8211; Quicker Clicker</a>. If for some reason you can’t get your hands on that one, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0026ICM1E/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Uni-ball &#8211; Kuru Toga</a> is also a good bet. And if you do want one you can treat like a disposable, then choose the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001T6QCJC/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paper Mate &#8211; 34666PP Clearpoint</a>. It’s great quality for a very low price.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After having highly organized marketing professionals test and rate 8 different options, we were able to make our final picks for best planner. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent hours researching, testing and conducting a focus group, and this time we found that the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B164VJS/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Erin Condren &#8211; 2018 Hardbound LifePlanner</a> is one of the best planners for 2018. The Erin Condren&#8217;s quality construction makes it stand out from other cutesy planners on the market. The<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HM2BHYV/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Me and My Big Ideas &#8211; Happy Planner</a> was a close runner-up, with large note-taking sections, a beautiful design and helpful prompts for setting goals.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we tested the planners</h2>
<p>We had a group of professionals at <a href="http://www.siegemedia.com">our content marketing agency</a> (that also runs Your Best Digs) pick a new weekly planner for the coming year.</p>
<p>Each tester used a planner individually for at least as week. Then, we held a focus group so participants could look at all of the planners and rank them. The group ranked the planners in order of best to worst, with 1 being best, and 11 being worst. We averaged the scores to create an average ranking. The lower the score, the better the planner rated. The results of that testing, and all the notes, data and etc, are available in a handy Google doc for your reference, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fTZ2Ji1cwTtyfubgBn6HewL7Pp4_gmU6feL8vFEIY5A/edit">here</a>.</p>
<p>The team was firmly aware that there can’t be a true “best planner” universally &#8212; because in many ways, a planner is an extension of personal preference and style. However, with enough opinions, we definitely feel we can help push you towards a planner you’ll enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>For the 2018 planner testing, we followed a similar process. This time, we added a qualitative element to our focus group and individual testing. We gave each tester surveys with open-ended questions like &#8220;what do you like about this planner?&#8221; and &#8220;what is this planner <em>not</em> good for?&#8221; The result was a more in-depth understanding of what makes the best planners the best, and you&#8217;ll see that reflected in the analysis of this year&#8217;s winners.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075843X8R/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Erin Condren &#8211; 2018 Hardbound LifePlanner</a> was created by a stay-at-home mom (<a href="https://www.erincondren.com/our-story">Erin Condren</a>) who had a passion for design. Her designs, and ultimately her LifePlanner, gained a cult following, and landed her big breaks on Rachel Ray and the Ellen Show. Today, the Erin Condren planner is one of the most blogged-about agendas out there, and it’s loved for more than just its pretty cover art.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B164VJS/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Check out the 2019 edition of this planner here</a>.</p>
<p>Our selective testers were impressed by the amount of writing space it provided. In fact, all but one tester agreed that it has enough room to write down everything they want. It also scored well in overall size, with the majority of respondents noting that it was not too big and heavy, nor too small and light. Everyone who used it said that its fonts were easy to read, and “high quality” was one of the most commonly-used descriptors for this planner.</p>

It's packed with encouraging quotes that may be the pick-me-up you need during a busy workweek. With large note sections and high-quality construction, the Erin Condren planner is the visually pleasing solution to organization.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B164VJS/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The primary tester who used this agenda found the paper and cover to be good quality, and said that it was easy to write in with pens like the ones we tested in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-pens">pen review</a>. They also loved the monthly overview, and were a big fan of the motivational quotes at the end of each week. On the other hand, they caution against using this planner if you’re an avid traveler; it’s a little too big to throw in a carry on.</p>
<p>The Erin Condren comes with a “color-coordinated” place-holder ribbon and finished pages with a splash of color, which means it’ll always look good sitting out on your desk or tabletop. We also like that it comes with a few dot grid pages for those who dabble in bullet journaling.</p>
<p>Other things our testers liked about this planner: it lies almost entirely flat like a book when you open it, which makes writing in it easy. One tester also noted that “the space for each day is just enough” to write their multitude of daily tasks in. If we had to pick something we didn’t like about the Erin Condren, we would say that there isn’t a ton of room for making lists. Some testers also wanted to see more interactive prompts about goals and objectives.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WV9JW2S/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Happy Planner</a> from <a href="http://www.meandmybigideas.com/about/">Me &amp; My Big Ideas</a> is the brainchild of a Mother-Daughter duo who started their business together creating stickers for scrapbooking. This background is evident in their highly-customizable Me &amp; My Big Ideas &#8211; Happy Planner, which is replete with personalizable accessories, and yes, stickers. That being said, it still has all of the features required of a serious (and seriously helpful) planner. In fact, it was a close contender for first place in our tests.</p>

Its large size translates to large and spacious writing areas. Extra features like a section for important dates will make this planner your new go-to, especially those who are goal-oriented.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HM2BHYV/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Our testers all thought that it had attractive, easy to read fonts and a great layout. The majority of our our picky team of testers said that they would definitely commit to using this as their yearly planner. All but one person also said that there’s plenty of room to write in it. Testers loved the fun colors and colorfully-illustrated quotes sprinkled throughout the Happy Planner. They also loved that there was a dedicated birthdays section, enough room to take notes and tabbed sections that make accessing each month easier. Notably, this one is also an 18-month planner, making it perfect for long term and/or academic use, and planning long term project initiatives.</p>
<p>Of course, there are factors that stopped the Happy Planner from being number one, and they almost exclusively have to do with the planner’s construction. The majority of our testers found this planner too heavy for everyday use, and found that the large binding rings made it difficult to write near the center of the planner. This planner is also designed to have removable pages that you tear towards you to remove. So long as you tear them in the right direction, you can also put them back in the binding. However, it’s easy to accidentally tear them out from the side, which makes them impossible to put back in the binding.</p>

<h4>Last year&#8217;s best overall planner</h4>
<p>In 2017 the <a href="http://www.gettoworkbook.com/product/2017-get-to-work-book-classic-chipboard-cover">Get to Work Book</a> was our pick for best planner overall. Our group liked the Get to Work Book’s big, clean areas to write and overall inspirational design. It features large note taking areas, as well as helpful tabs that make flipping through or getting to the right page a breeze. It also includes great monthly reflection sections, as well as a “action items this week” area that makes prioritizing your most important tasks a breeze.</p>
<p>On the negative side, some people had concerns with the Get to Work Book’s size: it’s pretty bulky and will take up significant room on your desk. It’s also slightly masculine looking, which likely accounted for its slightly lower scores from the women in the group. The group also didn&#8217;t rate for price: the Get to Work Book is the most expensive planner we tested, <a href="http://www.gettoworkbook.com/product/2017-get-to-work-book-classic-chipboard-cover">at $50+</a>. Notably, it was also the top-rated planner by men.</p>
<p><strong>Long term testing notes:  </strong>After using this planner for a year, our long-term tester found that it was simply too bulky for his every day use. Despite that, he thought the layout was &#8220;amazing&#8221; and could be an invaluable resource if you don&#8217;t mind lugging it around, or plan to have it stay on your desk.</p>
<div>
<h4>Another planner highly rated by men</h4>
</div>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077119XCB/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Passion Planner</a> was another hit with guys, a second-place pick from three of our male testers. As with the Get to Work it didn’t fare quite as well with women, however, and was number 9 out of 11 in overall ranking once the scores were averaged.</p>
<p>The team liked its monthly reflection areas, built in bookmark and significant note taking sections. The Passion Planner was also unique in having hourly breakdowns by day, which was a bit polarizing: some loved it, some hated it. If this makes sense for your planning style, the Passion Planner could be a great pick. However, if it doesn’t, the hourly breakdowns might feel like detail for the sake of it, and actually get in the way of your daily planning. Overall, the Passion Planner is a solid choice if it fits your scheduling style. The 2019 version is available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B077119XCB/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<h4>The top pick by women</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CZ37KWB/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rifle Paper 17 month agenda</a> received the highest ranking from women, with an average rank of 2. It didn’t fare as well with the men, at a 6.5 average score, but that’s to be expected given its feminine aesthetic. The ban.do wasn&#8217;t too far behind, but on average, it far outpaced the field. The planner was lauded for more than its design inside and out: it also includes motivational quotes on each weekly page, tabs for quick reference, and is nicely sized for toting around or not taking up much space on your desk. Some reviewers noted they didn’t love the thinnish pages and felt like they could rip them out, but that was the only real negative for this planner. The 2018/1019 version is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CZ37KWB/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">available here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Long term testing notes: </strong></p>
<p>Our long term tester for this planner noted that she thought the size of this planner was ideal, with enough room to write everything she wanted to. She liked the weekly and monthly views, and the functional tabs and pockets and durable cover.</p>
<p>Over the course of the year, she found that she didn&#8217;t like the way the monthly sections were separated from the monthly calendar, and she also disliked the daily sections being split into columns. Overall though, she plans to use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D33M71Z/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rifle paper agenda again in</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072P12K7J/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2018</a>.</p>
<h4>Another planner highly rated by women</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bando.com/products/ban-do-17-month-large-agenda-marble-blonde">ban.do marble blonde planner</a> is also a great choice for those who want a feminine look. It’s bursting with personality, and has a huge amount of note taking space. It also comes with two sheets of stickers, making this by far the most “fun” of any the planners we looked at. Overall, the ban.do ranked 3.75 on average with the women, and only slightly lower with the men, at 4 overall. On the negative side, the ban.do is a heavy, bulky planner compared to the rest of the models we tested, and that was a turnoff for some people. However, if you have a big desk and don’t plan on lugging it around, <a href="https://www.bando.com/products/ban-do-17-month-large-agenda-marble-blonde">the ban.do</a> can excel at the job asked of it.</p>
<p><strong>Long term testing notes: </strong></p>
<p>Our long term tester for this planner noted that she liked using the fun stickers over the course of the year, and she appreciated the way monthly and weekly calendars were right next to each other. She also liked all the fun and quirky holidays pre-printed on the calendar pages.</p>
<p>She disliked the planner&#8217;s overall bulkiness, and found it could be improved with a note section in the weekly calendars and a bookmark. The 2019 version is available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CPZ8NS1/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<h4>The rest:</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/9935480321/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Action Day planner</a> is a no frills, no personality planner that confused most of our group. It has 16 pages at the beginning telling you how to use it, which people either loved or hated, and it has no real note taking section besides in the very back of the planner.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.hadronepoch.com/search?type=product&amp;q=*wtf*">WTF planner</a> is another fun option, but it feels more like a book than a planner, with pages that are hard to hold open. This makes it functionally difficult to use and was the main deterrent keeping it from a higher ranking than the 6 average it got from our group.</p>
<p>The team liked the horizontal, <a href="https://www.hadronepoch.com/collections/planners/products/spiral-weekly-planner-gray">undated weekly planner</a>, but came to the conclusion that it&#8217;s more of a supportive device than a standalone. For people who like the quick, constant visual reference, it can be a great desk add-on: but it&#8217;s not something with enough flexibility to be your primary planner.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sugarpaper.com/collections/calendars">Sugar Paper planner </a>was the highest rated option in our &#8220;other&#8221; group. The team liked its big note taking areas, intuitive layouts, and nice design end-to-end. Some didn&#8217;t love the legibility of its gold font or that the weekly views are condensed into one page, when they could have been two.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JSTORY-Medium-Personal-Monthly-Planner/dp/B01CCFU0G4/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Medium Monthly Planner</a> is as minimalist as it comes: essentially paper in a brown shell. That was a turnoff for most looking for better functionality than a simple looking planner like this can offer.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KEU5GOA/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Simple Elephant</a> was well loved by our testers, with a high quality, professional design. Importantly, this was the only planner in which our testers unanimously agreed that there was enough room to write everything. It&#8217;s packed with inspiring prompts for goal setting and objective tracking, and it doubles as a gratitude journal too.</p>
<p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075KQ9NX7/?tag=ybdplan-20'">Freedom Mastery &#8211; Deluxe Law of Attraction Planner</a> was another highly-rated agenda in our tests. It comes chock-full of stickers, prompts and inspiration, acting as part agenda and part vision board. If you like all of the inspiration, the Freedom Mastery may be perfect for you. However, testers looking for something simple wanted to steer clear of this one.</p>
<p>If you <em>are</em> looking for something simple, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B076TCRWV3/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tools4Wisdom </a>planner may be the best choice for you. This one had an academic feel to it, and our testers liked that it had plenty of room in which to write. It&#8217;s got all of the basic facets, like daily, weekly and monthly views. At the end of the day, it&#8217;s just generic, which may be exactly what some people want.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Long story short, if a planner works for you, it&#8217;s the best planner. But some planners are better than others, and a really great planner does more than work: it inspires you to use it and be more organized.</p>
<p>For 2018, we found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075843X8R/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Erin Condren &#8211; 2018 Hardbound LifePlanner</a> is the best planner for achieving that goal. It&#8217;s efficient, attractive and inspiring, all inside a well-constructed binding that&#8217;ll easily last you through the year. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B164VJS/?tag=ybdplan-20">Check out the 2019 edition of this planner here</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WV9JW2S/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Me and My Big Ideas &#8211; Happy Planner</a> is another great option, with removable and re-insertable pages and tabbed months that make staying organized a breeze.
