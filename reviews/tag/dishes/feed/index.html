				<description><![CDATA[With 60 hours of researching and testing, we pitted 14 soaps against each other to find that Dr. Bronner's - Sal Suds was the best dish soap for doing dishes by hand.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent nearly 60 hours between research and testing in search of the best dishwashing soap. We whittled down the list to 14 finalists and pitted them against each other to find that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00016QTYO/?tag=ybddish-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dr. Bronner’s &#8211; Sal Suds</a> is the best dish soap available. We found that it cut grease and baked-on foods with ease. The higher price tag is offset by the smaller amount needed to clean and its multiple household uses. For a more cost-efficient approach that’s still eco-friendly, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HAPEXLK/?tag=ybddish-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Puracy &#8211; Natural Dish Soap</a> is effective and scent-free.</p>

<h2 class="collapse" id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>Dishwashing soaps come in all varieties. So, in order to determine the best regular soap and the best eco-friendly soap, we first compiled a list of all of the most commonly-purchased dish soaps by looking at ratings and reviews on Amazon, Target and Walmart. By reading a lot of reviews, we found out what people liked or disliked, such as whether it was economical or sudsy enough or efficient or how it smells. We also read the reviews on the EWG site. More on that later.</p>
<p>Next, we researched and learned a bit about how dishwashing soap works so that we would understand and know what to test. Fortunately, there are a variety of online articles and blog posts about how to hand-wash dishes. <a href="http://cleanmyspace.com/10-handy-dish-washing-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Did you know you should wash your glassware first?</a></p>
<p>Through all of this research, we were able to reduce a large group of dishwashing soaps down to a manageable 14. Finally, we donned our rubber gloves and went to work individually testing each one. We looked at how effective and efficient the different brands are, along with their price and appeal.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="the-fourteen-best">Compare the best dish soaps</h2>
[table id=56 /]
<h2 class="collapse" id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Cleaning ability:</strong> Any detergent is going to cut oil and grease to a degree, but we wanted to make the test more difficult by looking at how well they cut both liquid and solid oils, as well as baked on food. In warm water (110 °F) with a teaspoon of liquid, we expect that oil and grease should dissolve and leave the dish squeaky clean. The soap should also remove dried on food without a lot of scrubbing effort.</p>
<p><strong>Environmentally and health friendly:</strong> As awareness grows, more consumers are looking for ways to reduce their personal impact on the environment. Detergents, like dishwashing soap, may have chemicals such as 1,4 dioxane and phosphates that are harmful to our water sources as well as our health. Consumers have also found that certain chemicals used in cleaning products are disruptive to their health, potentially causing asthma, skin reactions, reproductive issues and even cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals to the senses:</strong> Let’s face it — washing dishes is a chore. We might as well look for ways to make it more enjoyable. We looked at both smell and feel to provide a helpful guide. Personal taste determines whether these traits are pleasing, as some prefer a clear soap with no fragrance and others prefer something more stimulating to the senses.</p>
<p><strong>Cost per use:</strong> Lastly, all things being relatively equal, it comes down to price. These days, we all want to pinch a few pennies, so why pay more if you don’t have to? We calculated the cost per use as an additional testing metric.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="how-soap-works">How dishwashing soap works</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bubble-gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>It’s fairly well known that oil (which attracts dirt) and water don’t mix. So, manufacturers use what is known as surfactants to break up non-solubles, like oil and grease. Generally, that means either sodium lauryl ethyl sulfate (SLES) or sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). These work by solubilizing oils so that they can be rinsed away. More specifically, surfactants like SLES and SLE break up the oil into smaller drops that become water soluble.</p>
<p>A single soap molecule is hydrophobic on one end and hydrophilic on the other. The hydrophobic end repels water and attaches to the oil. The hydrophilic end attracts water. When soap is mixed with the oil in the water, it binds with the dirt and oil, separating it into small drops that are easily rinsed away.</p>
<p>We wanted to make sure we were washing dishes correctly, so we turned to howtocleanstuff.net for advice. When washing dishes, you should fill a sink with water as warm as you can tolerate, but not any hotter. Don’t add all the items to be washed as it will soil the water and could be dangerous if there are sharp items. With the dishes stacked to the side, you should wash the items that have touched your mouth first, starting with glasses.</p>
<p>But, don’t put your hand inside the glass as it could break. Wash in order of least soiled and rinse each item separately with hot water. If the water gets too dirty, don’t be afraid to change it. The most sanitary way to hand-wash dishes is to use the hottest water you can stand coupled with a clean, soapy sponge and then let them air dry.</p>
<h2 class="collapse">Hard vs. soft water</h2>
<p>Approximately 85% of households in the United States have what is known as “hard water.” Hard water is identified by the number of minerals in the water, specifically calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn). Having hard water can make it difficult to create soap suds and keep dish soap from doing its job. The minerals actually chemically interact with the surfactants in the soap, making it less effective.</p>
<p>If you aren’t sure whether you have hard or soft water, you can easily test it yourself using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DIJ0W30/?tag=ybddish-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">water test strips</a>. Be sure to test both the hot and the cold water since hot water heaters can produce minerals that lead to harder water. The water strip tests for hardness from 0 to 1,000 ppm (parts per million). The American Society of Agricultural Engineers and the Water Quality Association has a <a href="https://www.wqa.org/Learn-About-Water/Perceptible-Issues/Scale-Deposits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">degree of hardness standard</a> that will help you determine if and how you should treat your water.</p>
<h2 class="collapse">Washing dishes by hand may reduce allergens</h2>
<p>A study published in the Journal of Pediatrics suggests that families who wash dishes by hand are less susceptible to allergies than those who use dishwashers. There is increasing evidence that a little more exposure to germs can stimulate and benefit the immune system. This is called the “hygiene hypothesis” which speculates that the rise in childhood allergies may be the result of too little exposure to bacteria early in life.</p>
<p>A Swedish research team surveyed over 1,000 families in Sweden with children ages seven to eight. They found that only 23% of children whose parents used hand dishwashing had a history of asthma and eczema, compared to 38% of families who used dishwashers. Yet another good reason to continue washing dishes by hand.</p>

<p>Even with the invention of the dishwasher, people continue to wash many of their dishes by hand. Some may not own a dishwasher and others actually enjoy hand-washing. But there are actually some very sound reasons for washing dishes by hand.</p>
<p>According to Good Housekeeping, there are 13 kitchen items that shouldn’t ever be put in the dishwasher. The dishwasher can cause damage, not clean the item thoroughly or could harm the dishwasher itself.</p>
<h2 class="collapse">The EWG grade</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6805" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ewg-ratings.png" alt="chart of EWG ratings" width="1801" height="1012" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ewg-ratings.png 1801w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ewg-ratings-610x343.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ewg-ratings-1500x843.png 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ewg-ratings-768x432.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ewg-ratings-885x497.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ewg-ratings-300x169.png 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ewg-ratings-295x166.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ewg-ratings-1000x562.png 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ewg-ratings-360x202.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ewg-ratings-375x211.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ewg-ratings-414x233.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ewg-ratings-320x180.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The EWG (<a href="http://www.ewg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Environmental Working Group)</a> is a non-profit, non-partisan organization working to help people live healthier lives in a healthier environment. Among other things, they research consumer products and rate them on their impact to human health and the environment.</p>
<p>They grade commonly used consumer products from A-F. They look at the ingredients to determine any chemicals known to cause skin irritations, asthma, cancer, developmental and reproductive toxicity and harm to the environment. We have included these grades in our scoring.</p>

<p>We gathered up our equipment for the testing. This included white ceramic plates, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IR3044/?tag=ybddish-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scotch-Brite sponges</a> (although we would have enjoyed the top pick in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-kitchen-cleaning-sponge/">kitchen sponge review</a>) a thermometer for testing the water and all of the bottles of dishwashing soap. Right away, we noticed that the “feel” or consistency across all of the dish soaps was nearly the same. We originally made the hypothesis that there would be some that were thinner than others. This proved not to be true. So, we removed that from our scoring.</p>
<h3>The senses test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6784 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/senses-test.jpg" alt="mini glass cups of soap for senses test" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/senses-test.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/senses-test-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/senses-test-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/senses-test-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/senses-test-300x200.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/senses-test-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/senses-test-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/senses-test-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/senses-test-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/senses-test-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We documented the color and fragrance of each dish soap. Adding color and fragrance generally means adding more chemicals. All dish soaps we tested were clear aside from Ajax (yellow), Palmolive (green) and Dawn Ultra (blue). We noticed Ajax uses what they refer to as a natural lemon fragrance, but we still aren’t sure about any added chemicals in that process as they aren’t listed.</p>
<p>Every consumer has their own preferences. Some prefer a soapy clean smell; others prefer a lighter touch or no scent or color at all. Therefore, we did not score these features, but instead, noted them during our testing as additional information.</p>
<h3>Suds Test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6785 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/suds-test.jpg" alt="hand holding soap bubbles for suds test" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/suds-test.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/suds-test-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/suds-test-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/suds-test-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/suds-test-300x200.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/suds-test-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/suds-test-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/suds-test-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/suds-test-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/suds-test-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We then filled a sink with two gallons of water at 110 °F. Next, we added a teaspoon of soap liquid and stirred it up with our hand to create bubbles. We noted the amount of foam created. Surprisingly, there was quite a difference between the different soap varieties. While this may turn out to be a personal preference, we did assign a score to each one. A score of one meant no suds, a score of three meant full sink coverage, but suds only a couple of inches deep. Meanwhile, a score of five meant dense, high suds, four inches high or more.</p>
<p>Dishwashing can take some time so we checked the lifespan of the suds to ensure they all lasted at least 20 minutes. Dishwashing soap suds will break down faster depending on the amount of food and grease introduced. However, no particular brand’s suds seemed to break down faster or slower than another.</p>
<h3>Olive oil test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6786" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/oil-test.jpg" alt="oily dishes for oil test" width="900" height="583" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/oil-test.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/oil-test-610x395.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/oil-test-768x497.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/oil-test-300x194.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/oil-test-295x191.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/oil-test-885x573.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/oil-test-360x233.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/oil-test-375x243.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/oil-test-414x268.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/oil-test-320x207.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>For our third test, we spread a tablespoon of olive oil onto a white plate and submerged it in the soapy water. We let it sit for three minutes without being scrubbed. Then we pulled it out, noting how effective (or ineffective) each soap brand was at removing the oil. Our test theory was that dishwashing soaps should bind with the oil and remove it without any need for scrubbing.</p>
<p>Olive oil is a fairly light oil that stays liquid at any temperature above 21 °F.  So it was a bit of a surprise that any dishwashing soap would struggle to remove the olive oil. However, we found that the worst dish soaps did nothing to dissolve it, leaving it on the plate nearly the same as when it went into the water. With the best dishwashing soaps, the oil slid off as we pulled the dish out of the water and the plates came out nearly squeaky clean.</p>
<h3>Burned-on food test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6787" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/burned-food-test.jpg" alt="plate with burned beans for burned food test" width="900" height="598" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/burned-food-test.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/burned-food-test-610x405.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/burned-food-test-768x510.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/burned-food-test-360x239.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/burned-food-test-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/burned-food-test-295x196.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/burned-food-test-885x588.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/burned-food-test-375x249.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/burned-food-test-414x275.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/burned-food-test-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>For the final test, we smeared a plate with a tablespoon of baked beans and baked it in the oven at 350 °F for 20 minutes, nearly burning the food onto the plate. Our test theory suggested that the burned-on food would require some scrubbing effort, requiring us to measure the amount of effort needed to thoroughly clean the plate.</p>
<p>We actually thought this would be quite the challenge, but most detergents handled it surprisingly well. After soaking for five minutes, most of the larger pieces of food came off on their own. After soaking for 10 minutes, it was quite easy to wipe the rest away. As we suspected, there were a few detergents that required a little more scrubbing with our Scotch-Brite sponge to get the plate clean. These are accounted for in the scores.</p>
<h3>Cost per ounce</h3>

<p>We went through each dishwashing soap and calculated the cost per ounce for the best price found at either Amazon, Target or Walmart. We found the range to be anywhere from $.05 to $.61 per ounce, so it really depends on the value of the features to the user. Be mindful that prices vary constantly and that this is just a general guide.</p>
<p>We found that some of these Amazon soaps require purchase through Pantry or require minimum purchases for them to even sell it to you, whereas you can get away with paying a shipping fee at Target or Walmart and buy smaller quantities at sometimes better prices.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Dr. Bronner&#8217;s &#8211; Sal Suds</h2>

<p>The EWG loves <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00016QTYO/?tag=ybddish-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dr. Bronner’s &#8211; Biodegradable Sal Suds</a> and we do too. The EWG gave it the highest rating of an A grade, with no impact to human health or the environment except for minor concerns about skin irritation and asthma. It does contain sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), coco-betaine and picea glauca leaf oil which are the only ingredients with a C grade. It contains Siberian fir oil which gives it its nice fragrance and only a B grade. The other five ingredients are all A grades. Overall, it looks like a saint when compared to C grade products, which are often combinations of ingredients with even worse grades.</p>
<p>Frankly, given it’s referred to as a biodegradable soap, we had our doubts about its potency. But Dr. Bronner’s delivered in nearly every category. It handled both oil and food stains like a champ. It has a fresh pine scent, likely due to the Siberian fir needle oil and spruce leaf oil. It didn’t foam as high as some of the other dish soaps but had enough foam to convince us it could do the job.</p>

<p>Cleaning dirty dishes is where it really shined. In the three-minute olive oil test, the oil slid right off the plate as we pulled it out of the sink. The plate hardly needed rinsing. And, in the baked-on food test, the food completely dissolved, falling off the plate as it was pulled from the water. The only unfortunate thing we could find is that your dishes will be done before you can read all the great and entertaining information on the label.</p>
<p>Apparently, washing dishes is not the only thing Dr. Bronner’s &#8211; Sal Suds is good for. It can also be used as laundry soap, an all-purpose spray cleaner, window washing spray and a vegetable wash. Because it is biodegradable, it is also the best multi-purpose soap to take camping or backpacking. Check out Lisa Bronner&#8217;s &#8220;Sal Suds Dilutions Cheat Sheet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although Dr. Bronner’s Sal Suds wins for best natural dishwashing soap, we wanted to award an honorable mention to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00016QTYO/?tag=ybddish-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Puracy&#8217;s natural dish soap</a>. Like Dr. Bronner’s, Puracy also scores an A grade from the Environmental Working Group (EWG). We really liked its light and natural-smelling fragrance and there are no colors added, meaning one less thing to harm the environment or trigger sensitivities.</p>

<p>It was an excellent degreaser, cutting the olive oil easily. It was moderate against stuck-on food, requiring just a slight bit of scrubbing.</p>
<p>Puracy Natural is a good choice for those with skin or lung sensitivities. It received a great score from the EWG in those areas. It’s also one of the least harmful to the environment, scoring well in its potential for aquatic toxicity. The satisfaction you get for its human safety and its low impact on the environment is well worth the extra cost.</p>

<p>We were able to find it for $.05 per ounce. Our average cost per ounce for all the dishwashing soaps we tested was $.21 and the highest price range was Dr. Bronner’s Sal Suds at $.61 per ounce.</p>
<p>Low cost was about the only honor we could give it, however. While it foams up nicely, it still required a bit more scrubbing to get the dishes clean, but eventually got the job done. It does have a nice yellow color and lemon scent that are quite pleasing. The scent comes from natural lemon extract, so it’s nice to know the great smell we liked is real. Reviewers on Amazon give it a 4.1 rating out of 5, so it shows many Ajax users are quite happy.</p>

<h3>Dawn &#8211; Platinum Power Clean</h3>
<p>We really liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UXT3HA8/?tag=ybddish-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dawn &#8211; Platinum Power Clean</a>. True to its reputation, it was a terrific grease cutter. In case you didn’t know, Dawn dishwashing soap is what they use to clean the oil from animals impacted by oil spills. It cuts the grease without harming the skin. Since it’s that tough on crude oil, we knew it would have no trouble with food — and we were right.</p>
<h3>J. R. Watkins</h3>
<p>Like Dawn, we also really liked <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MDR4NIE/?tag=ybddish-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">J. R. Watkins</a> for its ability to cut through grease. Though it doesn’t make a lot of suds, it sent grease sliding off the plate and cut stuck-on food with ease. It had a pleasant fragrance and is quite cost-effective. However, it only scored a C grade with EWG as it is said to contain chemicals that may impact those with skin or respiratory allergies, as well as ingredients known to be toxic to aquatic animals.</p>
<h3>Ecover</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00016QTYO/?tag=ybddish-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ecover &#8211; Naturally Derived Liquid Dish Soap</a> scored a B grade by EWG. It scored well with us too, likely because of the high EWG grade and its cleaning efficiency. Like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00016QTYO/?tag=ybddish-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Puracy</a>, it was a terrific degreaser and did fine on stuck-on food. There are no colors added but they did add a fragrance. It is supposed to smell like pink geranium. We weren’t sure what that was but we were certain it shouldn’t smell like rubbing alcohol, which it did. We must be onto something since EWG gave it a D grade for fragrance, saying it contains a certain chemical that are known allergens.</p>
<h3>Better Life</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00016QTYO/?tag=ybddish-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Better Life</a> is another reportedly eco-friendly dish washing soap. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find our version in the EWG database, so we gave it the points from a C grade. Other versions of Better Life however received A grades. Regardless, it still scored high with us. Like both Dawn and J. R. Watkins, it tested great for cutting grease and removing stuck-on food. True to its claim to be unscented, we could not detect a hint of fragrance.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Washing dishes by hand is not going to be completely replaced by the machine anytime soon. So, consumers should educate themselves to make sure they find the right balance of performance, pleasure, price and impact.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Scrub Daddy has sold millions of units since being featured on Shark Tank. Our in-house testing indicates that it is worthy of the hype.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>ack in 2012, Aaron Krause “entered the tank” on ABC’s hit television show Shark Tank and gave one of the most successful pitches the show has seen to date. Lori Grenier, the shark known for holding more than 100 patents, her expertise and star presence on QVC, said she instantly knew the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J420JEC/?tag=ybdscrub-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Scrub Daddy</a> was a “hero.” Based on our own research and testing, we agree it’s the best sponge  on the market.</p>

<li><a href="#the-bottom-line">The bottom line</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Since being broadcast on Shark Tank, sales of Scrub Daddy have exploded. They are now available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J420JEC/?tag=ybdscrub-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>, as well as retail locations including Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Walmart. In addition to the original and iconic yellow smiling Scrub Daddy, the brand now includes several other product lines as well.</p>
<p>As of early 2016, sales of the Scrub Daddy had already exceeded 10 million units and $50 million in sales, and show no indication of slowing down.</p>
<p>With all the attention the Scrub Daddy received thanks to its appearance on Shark Tank, we wanted to find out whether or not the hype associated with the Scrub Daddy was really earned.</p>
<h2 id="what-sets-scrub-daddy-apart">What sets the Scrub Daddy apart from other sponges</h2>
<p>When selecting the products we wanted to test for our comprehensive <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-kitchen-cleaning-sponge/">best kitchen cleaning sponge</a> review, the Scrub Daddy started off at the top of our prospective list, alongside longstanding brand names like Lysol and Scotch-Brite. This is noteworthy in and of itself, since Scrub Daddy has existed as a brand for only a few years.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, the Scrub Daddy stands out for its friendly aesthetic. If you’re walking through the sponge aisle in a retail store, the Scrub Daddy will stand out for its bright and attention-grabbing packaging.</p>
<p>Beyond the packaging, the design and performance of the Scrub Daddy is what really makes this product stand out.</p>
<p>The Scrub Daddy is the only sponge among our finalists that is able to be both hard enough to clean a BBQ grill and soft enough to be a scratch-free cleaning solution for delicate pots, pans, and plates.</p>
<p>The Scrub Daddy is made from a synthetic (and proprietary) material which turns hard in cold water and soft in warm water. This functionality is what makes it possible for the Scrub Daddy to be both a hard scrubber and a soft sponge.</p>
<p>The design of the Scrub Daddy is unique as well. There are few consumer products on the market that are able to take something as simple as a smiling sponge and utilize each of those facial features (eyes, mouth, hair) into specific and useful features.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21018" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02.jpg" alt="cleaning a spatula with scrub daddy" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h2 id="how-scrub-daddy-performs">How the Scrub Daddy performs</h2>
<p>In our test of the best kitchen cleaning sponges, we tested the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J420JEC/?tag=ybdscrub-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scrub Daddy</a> alongside seven other sponges using a series of tests. Here’s how the Scrub Daddy performed across each of those tests:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3163" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data.png" alt="Sponge Data" width="880" height="586" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-610x406.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-360x240.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-375x250.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-414x276.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-295x196.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-180x120.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-320x213.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-360x240@2x.png 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Rinsability</h3>
<p>One of the main selling points of the Scrub Daddy is its ability to rinse clean. In our own testing, we found this claim to be very accurate. Running the Scrub Daddy under warm water leaves the sponge soft enough to squeeze out any flakes or material, while the temperature of the water and texture of the sponge itself helped facilitate the removal of excess waste.</p>
<h3>Scratch test</h3>
<p>While the Scrub Daddy is capable of scraping surfaces as tough as a recently used BBQ grill, it is still capable of cleaning more delicate surfaces – such as the nonstick coating of a pan – without causing scratches.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that all but one of the sponges we tested were able to clean a variety of surfaces without producing any scratches. However, the Scrub Daddy does stand out a bit thanks to its ability to alternate between a heavy scrubber and a scratch-free sponge.</p>
<h3>Ergonomics</h3>
<p>Ergonomics is another area where the Scrub Daddy really stands out from the competition. That’s because the smiling face of the Scrub Daddy is more than just an aesthetic decision.</p>
<p>The shape of the Scrub Daddy makes it perfect for most hands, and fingers can be put through the eyeholes to further improve the grip. The Scrub Daddy’s mouth is also great for cleaning silverware and even some cooking utensils.</p>
<p>The “hair” on the top of the Scrub Daddy also make cleaning glasses easier as well.</p>
<h3>Drying time</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3153" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time.png" alt="Sponge Drying Time" width="880" height="579" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-610x401.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-360x237.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-375x247.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-414x272.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-295x194.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-180x118.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-320x211.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Bacteria and other pathogens love wet environments. That’s why a sponge that stays wet for extended periods of time can breed dangerous levels of bacteria.</p>
<p>The Scrub Daddy was the fastest of our finalists to dry, but still required 7.9 hours to completely dry. While that might seem like a long time, the Natural Sea Sponge, TVTimedirect Microfiber Sponge, and Superior Performance Ultra Sponge took more than 26 hours to fully dry.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-didnt-like">What we didn’t like about the Scrub Daddy</h2>
<p>Overall, the Scrub Daddy is an excellent sponge, and easily the best kitchen sponge we tested. That being said, there were a couple of things we didn’t love about it.</p>
<h3>Absorbency</h3>
<p>The most significant thing we noticed was that the Scrub Daddy, while versatile, is not particularly great for cleaning up spills. The Scrub Daddy tied for last place in our absorbency test, and was only able to hold about three tablespoons of water.</p>
<p>To compare, the Natural Sea Sponge held 15 tablespoons of water, and the Lysol Multi-Purpose Scrub Sponge held 5 tablespoons.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3152" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency.png" alt="Sponge absorbency" width="880" height="579" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-610x401.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-360x237.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-375x247.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-414x272.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-295x194.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-180x118.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-320x211.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Of course, Aaron and Lori (owner and primary investor of the Scrub Daddy brand) have come up with a solution to the absorbency issue, with the development of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RZT81HI/?tag=ybdscrub-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sponge Daddy</a>.</p>
<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>The other thing we noticed was that the Scrub Daddy is a bit more expensive to use than other sponges. That, in conjunction with the fact that the Scrub Daddy does tend to start breaking down after a month or two of heavy use means you’ll be paying a slight premium to use the Scrub Daddy.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a high-quality, versatile, hygienic sponge, the Scrub Daddy should top your list. While the Scrub Daddy does tend to be a little more expensive than other sponges on the market, for most people the cost is more than worth it to use a sponge as powerful as the Scrub Daddy.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-found">How we found the best sponge</h2>
<p>During our research phase, we read through blogs and articles to determine the qualities people look for in a sponge in order to narrow the list down to our eight finalists. We looked at subreddits, like /r/advice/, and watched YouTube reviews to gather consumer input. We did some fact-finding legwork on what to look for in a sponge, and more importantly, how to keep it clean in an environment laden with food and moisture (the kitchen sink).</p>
<p>Once we narrowed down the field, we put our eight finalists through a series of household tests to find out how much water they would hold, how fast they dried and whether or not they would scratch a frying pan with nonstick coating.</p>
<p>In addition to our specific tests, we put each of the sponges through two months of daily use to see how well they would hold up in the kitchen, bathroom and during other cleaning projects around the house.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-look">What to look for in a sponge</h2>
<p>The main purpose of a sponge is scrubbing to remove food and debris. Most often, sponges are used to remove caked-on food from dishes, pans and utensils, but in determining the best sponge, we found that it needs to be useful in a wide variety of functions. For instance, sponges are also used to scrub stovetops, BBQs, remove soap and scum from bathroom fixtures and tiles and even to wash cars.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind the number of ways you can use a sponge and the many different types of cleaning sponges that exist, there is a lot of information to consider when deciding which sponge will make your cleaning task easiest. One option is to dedicate precious shelf space to stock a whole arsenal of sponges.</p>
<p>However, your best space-saving bet is to find one or two sponges that will accomplish a wide range of cleaning goals. Obviously, this makes versatility an extremely important factor when choosing a sponge.</p>
<p>A second important component of sponges is absorbency, because sponges are often used to soak up excess liquid from spills prior to cleaning with a solvent. You also want them to be able to hold soapy water and assist in removing debris.</p>
<p>However, a sponge that holds a large amount of water is also a sponge that stays wet on your counter after you’re done using it. A wet sponge can become a breeding ground for bacteria, so you’ll want to balance absorbency with a fast drying time.</p>
<p>Last but not least, comfort is a valuable consideration. A sponge is a daily cleaning tool, so if it fits awkwardly in your hand or requires a great amount of effort to scrub off food particles, you’re not going to be inclined to use it. The less strain on your hand and wrists, the better.</p>
<p>We found that the key metrics to use when determining the value and efficiency of a sponge include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scrubbing ability</li>
<li>Longevity</li>
<li>Ergonomics/comfort in your hand</li>
<li>Absorbency</li>
<li>Versatility</li>
<li>How easy is it to rinse out?</li>
<li>Does it scratch surfaces? What types of surfaces?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="types-of-sponges">Types of sponges</h2>
<p>Different types of sponges are needed for different types of jobs. Knowing the type of sponge that works best for your particular cleaning project will save you time and energy. Here is the low-down, including pros and cons, of the different types of sponges.</p>
<h3>Cellulose</h3>
<p>These are the most common types of cleaning sponge; they&#8217;re inexpensive and absorbent. Made from wood pulp and highly porous, cellulose sponges hold water and soap for easy cleaning. However, they have a tendency to trap food particles that can be difficult to fully rinse clean and break down the life of the sponge as well as harbor bacteria.</p>
<h3>Cellulose with abrasive material attached</h3>
<p>These two-sided sponges combine the benefits of cellulose and scrubber for tough jobs like cleaning an oven or BBQ grill. The abrasive side comes in different levels of toughness and some can damage finishes.</p>
<p>Different brands use different colors to indicate abrasiveness level, so check the package to find the level of softness that works for your cleaning job. For everyday usage, a non-scratch low abrasive scrub side works best.</p>
<h3>Microfiber sponges</h3>
<p>With their soft texture, microfiber sponges can be used on any surface, which is why they&#8217;re highly recommended for washing cars and windows. The only downside is that they don’t have the grittiness to effectively remove caked-on debris, but they work well for removing oil and dirt.</p>
<h3>Natural sponges</h3>
<p>Natural sea sponges grow on the ocean’s floors and are 100-percent natural and earth-friendly. These sponges are recommended for projects like washing windows and cars, because they are soft and highly absorbent. They may be too soft to effectively remove caked-on food in the kitchen.</p>
<h3>Dry sponges</h3>
<p>These sponges are usually made from rubber and are great on surfaces that can’t tolerate water such as lampshades and fabric window coverings. They are also commonly used to clean soot after a fire. Once the dry sponge is covered with dirt or dust, you slice that part of the sponge off for a fresh sponge to clean with.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3163 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data.png" alt="Sponge data" width="880" height="586" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-610x406.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-360x240.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-375x250.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-414x276.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-295x196.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-180x120.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-320x213.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-360x240@2x.png 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Test #1: Rinsability</h3>
<p>A sponge dotted with flecks of food sitting out on the sink is unsightly and unhygienic. Bacteria thrive on the food particles and residue left behind on a sponge. Additionally, these particles break down a cellulose sponge and can create odors, so you’ll have to toss it. A sponge that rinses clean lasts longer.</p>
<p>To test rinsability, we used the sponges to remove the ultimate sticky culprits, eggs and cheese. Each sponge was used to scrub a baked egg-and-cheese dish and then rinsed thoroughly under running water.</p>
<p>The Scrub Daddy and O-Cedar Scrunge Scrub Sponge were clear winners in this category, rinsing fully clean with no need to pick little flecks off. The Lysol Multi-Purpose Scrubber, Natural Sea Sponge and TVTimedirect Microfiber Magic Sponge performed well in this test, too.</p>
<p>The other sponges we tested all had residue or food particles left behind, even after being rinsed for several minutes at full force.</p>
<h3>Test #2: Scratch test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3150" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrungeScrub-Pan02.jpg" alt="Sponge cleaning nonstick frying pan" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrungeScrub-Pan02.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrungeScrub-Pan02-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrungeScrub-Pan02-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrungeScrub-Pan02-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrungeScrub-Pan02-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrungeScrub-Pan02-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrungeScrub-Pan02-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrungeScrub-Pan02-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrungeScrub-Pan02-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrungeScrub-Pan02-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>During our research, we found that consumers are concerned about sponge abrasiveness. We wanted to make sure that our sponge finalists wouldn’t dull the surface while removing debris. When deciding which sponges made the cut, it was important for us to consider which surfaces, if any, can be scratched. Some of the surfaces we studied were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wood</li>
<li>Plastic</li>
<li>Copper</li>
<li>Cast iron</li>
<li>Fiberglass</li>
<li>Stainless steel</li>
<li>Vinyl</li>
<li>Car exterior paint</li>
<li>Nonstick coatings</li>
<li>Glass</li>
</ul>
<p>Teflon-coated or other nonstick cookware is easy to damage with an abrasive sponge, and it’s not a good idea to eat food cooked in a nonstick pan that has been scratched. We tested each of the sponges on a frying pan with a nonstick coating.</p>
<p>When you think of the types of foods that you cook in a nonstick pan, including egg and cheese, you know that you need a scrubber that is delicate and won’t scratch while still able to remove baked-on debris.</p>
<p>In order to test this, we gave each sponge a workout on a frying pan with nonstick coating. First, we whipped up a meal of scrambled eggs and cheese, undoubtedly a messy affair.</p>
<p>Then we scoured the pan with one of the sponges to remove all the dried-on bits of egg and cheese to see if it would scratch the nonstick coating in the process. We repeated the process with each of our eight finalists.</p>
<p>All of the sponges passed our scratch test. We felt most confident using the O-Cedar Scrunge Scrubber Sponge, considering that its patented non-scratch scrubbing surface is created by Teflon and endorsed by DuPont, but we were pleased to note that every sponge we tested was able to clean the frying pan in its entirety without damaging the delicate nonstick coating.</p>
<h3>Test #3: Ergonomic comfort</h3>
<p>For this test, we tackled both a load of dirty dishes and a tough bathroom job that required scrubbing a tub in circular motions. We found that in addition to the size and shape of a sponge, firmness and scrubbing power played a role in how comfortable the sponge is to use.</p>
<p>After all, the more pressure and length of time it takes to get something clean, the harder it is on your hand, wrist and arm.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PHH3HVK/?tag=ybdspon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scrub Daddy</a> was the clear winner here, because it fits perfectly in the palm of your hand and can be gripped in two different ways, easing the burden on your hand and wrist since you can change positions.</p>
<p>It’s extremely helpful to be able to change textures as you go along. You can adjust it for either more scrubbing power or softness in your hand and allow you to move along quickly.</p>
<p>We appreciated how little effort it took to get through a load of dishes with the dual scrubbing sides and ability to clean utensils. In the bathroom, we scrubbed with cold water, letting the firm texture take off the soap scum easily.</p>
<p>In the end, the least amount of effort and ability to complete the job quickly made the Scrub Daddy our pick for most ergonomic.</p>
<p>In the same vein, the scrubbing power and relatively thin shape of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0043OWF2A/?tag=ybdspon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scotch-Brite Heavy Duty Scrub Sponge</a> earned it an honorable mention in the ergonomic comfort test.</p>
<h3>Test #4: Absorbency</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3152" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency.png" alt="Sponge absorbency graph" width="880" height="579" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-610x401.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-360x237.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-375x247.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-414x272.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-295x194.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-180x118.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-320x211.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>When you’re cleaning up liquid messes, absorbency becomes a critical factor of a useful sponge. Absorbency is also important in holding soapy water for more cleaning power without scrubbing. In this test, we added one tablespoon of water at a time to each sponge until it reached its capacity.</p>
<p>The Natural Sea Sponge was superior to the other sponges in this test. While most of the sponges held a number of tablespoons, the Natural Sea Sponge held a full cup of liquid. The next most-absorbent sponge, Lysol Multi-Purpose Scrubber, held almost half a cup.</p>
<h3>Test #5: Drying time</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3153" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time.png" alt="Sponge drying time graph" width="880" height="579" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-610x401.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-360x237.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-375x247.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-414x272.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-295x194.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-180x118.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-320x211.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Drying time is important, because a sponge that stays damp for hours can breed bacteria, especially if there are food particles trapped inside. In a test of drying time, we completely soaked and wrung out a sponge and left it out on the sink to dry.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the most absorbent sponges took the longest to dry and the least absorbent was fastest, even when they were completely wrung out.</p>
<p>The Scrub Daddy, holding three tablespoons of water, dried in eight hours. The Dobie Cleaning Pad, which held the same amount of liquid, was a close second at approximately nine hours.</p>
<p>This means that you could sanitize these sponges at the end of a day, and they would dry overnight. On the other end of the spectrum, the sea sponge and microfiber sponges took a little more than 24 hours to completely dry.</p>

<p>While sponges are a highly effective cleaning tool, the downside is that they can be an ideal breeding ground for dangerous bacteria. Organisms can become lodged in between the sponge, and in this moist environment with plenty of food, new bacteria can grow at the rate of once every 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Not something you want to think about it when you’re using that same sponge on a later load of dishes.</p>
<p>In order to lower the risk of cross-contamination, we recommend that you clean your sponges daily.</p>
<p>There are a few different cleaning techniques. The best bet is to completely submerge the sponge in a bleach-and-water mixture. Make a disinfecting solution with one part bleach to nine parts water (about 14 ounces of bleach to about 14 cups of water) and soak the sponge for 30 seconds or longer. Store the excess solution in an empty plastic milk jug under the sink so you always have it on hand, since you’ll want a fresh bowl of bleach solution for each session.</p>
<p>Microwaving your sponge is another means of disinfection. The sponge should be submerged in a bowl of water and then placed in the microwave. This can be more difficult as the water must be heated to a boil in order to kill bacteria.</p>
<p>After sanitizing with either method, wring the sponge out, and allow it to dry to prevent any new bacteria from growing. Cleaning your sponge on a regular basis will help reduce the risk of growing and spreading bacteria, but you should also replace it frequently. This is especially important with kitchen sponges. Odor indicates the presence of bacteria, so if it starts to have a smell, make sure to toss it out immediately.</p>
<p>In addition to cleaning your sponge and replacing it regularly, there are a few “don’ts” to keep in mind. Remember that sponges can’t do everything. Avoid wiping up meat juices from ground beef or poultry in order to prevent cross-contamination and food poisoning. In general, avoid cleaning countertops with sponges. Your best bet in these cases is paper towels or disinfectant wipes.</p>
<h2 id="top-pick">Top pick: Scrub Daddy</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3156 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-animated.gif" alt="scrub daddy gif" width="900" height="600" /><br />
If you watch Shark Tank, you may be aware that the Scrub Daddy Original “boasts the most revenue of any business to appear on Shark Tank since the show first aired in 2009”. Priced between three to four dollars each, this sponge has received a lot of attention. We found that it lives up to the hype.</p>
<p>One of the most fascinating things about the Scrub Daddy is its ability to change texture. In warm water, it’s softer and more pliable. In cool water, it’s rigid with more scrubbing power. It only takes a matter of seconds to change textures. You can move from job to job and different types of surfaces without needing to switch sponges.</p>

<p>There are not many sponges that are both scratch-free and can be used to clean a BBQ grill. The Scrub Daddy’s silicone surface glided along the pan without any noise or snags. It removed the food and oil quickly, too, so you weren’t putting extra pressure on the pan as you cleaned.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, it fits into small spaces and has thorough coverage. It tackles both big jobs, like baked-on cheese, and delicate jobs like wine glasses. Another cool feature to the Scrub Daddy is you can use it dry to make light work of removing older, set-in stains. The upside to its relative lack of absorbency is that it dries much faster, and food particles do not stick to the surface.</p>
<p>Since bacteria thrive on a moist environment and a food supply of trapped particles, the Scrub Daddy is less likely to harbor nasty bacteria. It can also be thrown in the washing machine or dishwasher. In fact, one of the ways you can tell that this sponge is more hygienic than other sponges is its refreshing lack of odor.</p>
<p>The Scrub Daddy smile is more than just a pretty face — it’s actually part of the design. The ergonomic shape is designed to clean both sides of kitchen utensils at once, and the eye holes give you a good grip, similar to a bowling ball. The smile part of the sponge accommodates the curve of dishes and is especially convenient for cleaning spoons.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the &#8220;hair&#8221; on top of the sponge, which we found to be more effective than a bottle brush at getting into awkward corners like drinking glasses and coffee mugs.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3155 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02.png" alt="scrub daddy with spatula" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02.png 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-425x283.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-885x590.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-1-360x240.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-375x250.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-414x276.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-295x197.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-180x120.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponges-ScrubDaddy-Spoon02-320x213.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Each sponge should last at least two months before becoming less effective. Some reviews suggest that the Scrub Daddy fell apart quickly, but we did not find this to be true in our testing. It may not look as fresh as one right out the box, but it was still effective and fairly sturdy after a week’s use on a variety of surfaces. At the end of two months, we found that it had held up to everyday use and fit even better into small spaces.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the bright yellow color and smiley face make this sponge fun to use (especially for kids). It’s also a little more aesthetically appealing to leave at your sink than a traditional sponge. You can thread the smile right onto your faucet handle, which keeps it off your kitchen counter.</p>
<p>We tested the drying time on the faucet handle to see if the Scrub Daddy dried faster than leaving it on a flat surface, but we found that it didn’t speed up the drying time.</p>
<p>Gravity caused the top half to dry quickly, but water pooled in the bottom half and took the same amount of time to dry as when we left it on a flat surface. We still appreciated this feature, since storing your sponge in a dry location is one of the best ways to keep your sponge clean.</p>
<p>It also has some very creative uses that you wouldn’t expect with a traditional sponge; for instance, you can use it as a loofah in the shower or remove paint from your fingernails and hands.</p>
<p>Scrub Daddy fits perfectly in the kitchen-sink drain, so you can prevent carrot peels or hard-boiled egg shells from going down the drain. Chrome fixtures shine like new when you clean them with an almost dry product. You can even use a Scrub Daddy sponge in a potted plant for an aerating effect and good drainage.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B017Y4E1RM/?tag=ybdspon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">O-Cedar &#8211; Multi-Use Scrunge Scrub Sponge</a> is a dense cellulose sponge with an abrasive side in the form of a three-dimensional scrubber. Thanks to a unique rippled surface that breaks up and lifts away dirt, it takes one-tenth the amount of elbow grease to remove debris than other sponges.</p>
<p>The O-Cedar sponge stands up to the tough jobs like boiler pans and stovetops while gliding along a nonstick frying pan. In fact, this sponge is the only product endorsed by DuPont for use on Teflon nonstick coatings.</p>

<p>What really impressed us about this sponge is how well it rinses clean. The scrubber part doesn’t trap food particles, even pesky egg and cheese residue don’t stick to this sponge. It’s no fun to switch back and forth between different types of sponges when you’re trying to clean a kitchen.</p>
<p>With the Scrunge, you can go from one task to the next, because it rinses thoroughly clean no matter what kind of job it has just tackled. This means that it can stand up to a lot of use.</p>
<p>The sponges are reported to be up to 20 percent more durable, and they are odor resistant up to two months, so there are no foul smells. The thickness of the cellulose sponge makes it more absorbent than some of the other brands, yet it still fits comfortably in the palm of your hand. At two dollars a sponge, the Scrunge Scrub Sponge gives you a lot of bang for your buck.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Scrunge Scrub Sponge is the only sponge recommended by Dupont® for use on their Teflon® coated cookware.</li>
<li>The Scrunge Scrub Sponge rated high in our rinsability test, thoroughly removing the egg, cheese and other food particles.</li>

<p>Sometimes you need a scrub sponge that will go above and beyond the call of duty. When you need to clean pots that you left overnight or scrape off baked-on food from oven racks, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0043OWF2A/?tag=ybdspon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scotch-Brite &#8211; Heavy Duty Scrub Sponge</a> is the one to use.</p>
<p>The Scotch-Brite sponge is softer than steel wool but equally effective on deep cleaning projects. Do make sure to test this sponge in a hidden area because it is tough enough to damage some finishes and you won’t want to use it on stainless steel appliances.</p>

<p>We found it especially useful in the bathroom, where we used it with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004PWPE6O/?tag=ybdspon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bon Ami Polishing Cleanser</a> to attack soap scum on tile and the tub. At three-fourths of an inch thick, this sponge is thinner than the other dual-sided cellulose sponges we tested and comfortable to hold. They stayed intact (the abrasive side didn’t separate from the cellulose sponge) even with some heavy duty cleaning.</p>
<p>At less than a dollar per sponge, these are handy to keep around for all of your tough cleaning jobs and cheap enough to toss out after really nasty cleaning projects, or if they begin to harbor any odors.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>

<p>Unlike synthetic sponges (often made from polyurethane foam) or even cellulose sponges (which can have a polyester filling and/or nylon scrubbing pads), The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000I1RUXG/?tag=ybdspon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Natural Sea Sponge</a> is 100-percent biodegradable, free from toxins and hypo-allergenic.</p>
<p>They’ve also been used for more than 2,000 years, for a variety of purposes, so you know you aren’t falling for the latest fad. The Natural Sea Sponge is a quickly renewable natural resource that is native to the waters surrounding Florida.</p>

<p>While the size and soft texture of this sponge made it a little unwieldy for doing dishes, we were impressed with its versatility. If it’s a little too large for your job, you can cut it in half without damaging the sponge.</p>
<p>The softness, incredible absorbency and pliability make it a great choice for washing floors, upholstery, windows and cars. This sponge is especially popular for cars, because it won’t scratch the metal. It held a cup of water in our test and made a fine lather with liquid soap.</p>
<p>These sponges are often used when painting to create a textured look and are great for clean up, because they rinse out well and stand the test of time. They can even be used in the shower as a personal care product.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s nice to know that you’re not harming the planet when you purchase a sustainably harvested natural sponge.</li>
<li>This sponge holds a full cup of water and is incredibly soft, making light work of your Saturday afternoon car washing chore.</li>

<h3>Scotch-Brite &#8211; Dobie Cleaning Pad</h3>
<p>This sponge is an old faithful that you probably saw in your mom’s kitchen. It’s been around for years. When a sponge has been around since 1958, you know that countless numbers of consumers have tried, approved and continue to buy this classic product.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001E6KF5Y/?tag=ybdspon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dobie Cleaning Pad</a> is like two sponges in one: a soap-holding sponge wrapped in nylon netting. It has exceptional scouring power without being as abrasive as steel wool. We found it to be quite versatile and was equally effective at removing lasagne residue from pans and insects from a car window. It lasted two months with regular cleaning, and you can toss it in the dishwasher.</p>
<p>Compared to other sponges, the Dobie Cleaning Pad is thin and easy to hold. Even while completely dry, it can easily be manipulated and fits into the palm of your hand. This may not be the sponge you want to use to soak up a large liquid mess, but we appreciated how quickly it dries out, making it a less hospitable environment for bacteria.</p>
<p>Food particles can get caught in the netting, so it does need to be rinsed thoroughly after cleaning dishes. You’ll also need to be careful when cleaning knives, as it can cut the netting. It has a special coating that glides over surfaces, giving it a slippery feeling, especially when used with <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-dish-soap/" rel="noopener">dish soap</a>.</p>
<p>In our testing, the Dobie Cleaning Pad did not scratch Teflon nonstick, stainless steel, glass, plastic or tile surfaces. However, you still should be careful and always test first in an inconspicuous area. It should not be used to clean glass aquariums or painted surfaces.</p>
<p>It will remove paint, and while that makes it less valuable in the scratch-free metric, it also makes the sponge versatile when you need to remove paint from surfaces and is yet gentle enough to remove paint from your skin.</p>
<h3>TVTimedirect &#8211; Microfiber Magic Sponge</h3>
<p>There’s a lot to be said about a microfiber sponge that can absorb dirt and oil but is soft enough that it won’t scratch or damage surfaces. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VSB7YE/?tag=ybdspon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TVTimedirect Microfiber Magic Sponge</a> is a greener option than other sponges, because it can be washed in the washing machine and requires little or no detergent.</p>
<p>One side is microfiber and when used dry, works like a microfiber cloth and naturally attracts dust. When used wet, it soaks up a spill and doesn’t leave any liquid on your counter or floor. On the other side with dark- and light-blue lines, the surface has a dual-action surface that scrubs and absorbs.</p>
<p>We found the scrubber side was able to able to remove cheese and egg without any detergent. It did take extra pressure to remove the cheese, which was more tiring on the arm, but because it’s so soft, it didn’t cause any damage to the frying pan. It also rinses clean, so you don’t have to worry about food particles going in the washing machine.</p>
<p>These cost about two dollars each when purchased in a value pack and are able to be washed and reused, so it’s an economic and environmentally friendly choice.</p>
<h3>Lysol &#8211; Multi-Purpose Scrub Sponge</h3>
<p>Found in multipacks for around a dollar a sponge, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005HGRL2M/?tag=ybdspon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lysol Multi-Purpose Scrub Sponge</a> is great for everyday use, because it’s durable, rinses clean and contains an antimicrobial agent built into the fibers that inhibits the growth of odor-causing bacteria.</p>
<p>We appreciated the dense, super-absorbent sponge that feels nice in the hand and allows you to create a soapy lather on your dishes. Since it soaks up almost half a cup of liquid, this is the sponge to grab if you spill a glass of water.</p>
<p>The scrubber is non-scratch and passed our nonstick coating test, but you’ll want to test the scrub part on your surface in a hidden area as some dulling of finish can happen.</p>
<h3>Superior Performance &#8211; Ultra Micro Fiber Sponge</h3>
<p>This is another reusable sponge that functions more like a dishrag than a sponge, as it can be thrown in both the washer and dryer when it needs cleaning. You can also rest easy knowing this sponge is fume and chemical free.</p>
<p>These absorbent sponges are ideal for wiping up spills, and they hold soap well, but we found them to be on the soft side for cleaning jobs that need a little more oomph, and food particles did stick to the fabric.</p>
<p>Unlike with cellulose sponges, food residue isn’t an issue in terms of longevity, because the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J4QUJQQ/?tag=ybdspon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superior Performance &#8211; Ultra Micro Fiber Miracle Sponge</a> is washable and reusable. They are on the thicker side and we found them to be a little too large to hold comfortably for long periods of time. It was also harder to clean smaller items like the insides of glasses.</p>
<p>Overall, we found this sponge to be a good go-to for general purpose use and safely cleaning nonstick cookware.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>We found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PHH3HVK/?tag=ybdspon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scrub Daddy</a> was the most versatile, able to wash dishes, remove soap scum from a bathtub and scour the insects off of a tire wheel and car exterior without scratching the paint.</p>
<p>Out of our five tests — Rinsability, Scratch Test, Ergonomic Comfort, Drying Time and Absorbency — the Scrub Daddy surpassed the other sponges four out of five times. Scrub Daddy dried the fastest of all eight finalists. Thus, despite its lesser rating for absorbency, the Scrub Daddy has high value, being extraordinarily versatile and ultra hygienic.</p>
