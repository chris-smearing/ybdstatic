								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>riginally used by therapists as a tool to soothe patients, weighted blankets have gone mainstream, used at home by the masses to calm anxiety and help insomnia. We bought four highly acclaimed weighted blankets to test, sleeping under each of them for multiple nights to judge their levels of comfort, breathability and soothing effect.</p>
<p>The best weighted blanket overall is the chemical-free <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N442PLC/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baloo &#8211; Weighted Blanket</a>, a luxurious, durable weighted duvet that felt cocoon-like yet breathable. With its cucumber-cool bamboo viscose outer shell, we felt cozy and comfortably cool all night under the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C193MKM/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YnM &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket</a>, making it our choice for the best cooling weighted blanket.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs a weighted blanket?</h2>
<p>One <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7b52/514a1b040f0b631168d98cfa9730cfc5a9dd.pdf" target="_blank" rel="&quot;noopener">study</a> that tracked the effects of weighted blankets on 30 participants aged 20 to 66 with chronic insomnia reported that the additional pressure from weighted blankets had a calming effect on the subjects. This, along with the secure “cocooned” feeling of being wrapped in a weighted blanket, decreased their muscle movement during sleep, resulting in better overall sleep quality.</p>
<p>Other <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20662681" target="_blank" rel="&quot;noopener">research</a> shows that weighted blankets shortens the time it takes for kids with ADHD to fall asleep, and also reduce middle-of-the-night wakeful periods. Weighted blankets have also been recommended for those on the autism spectrum and to help cope with anxiety, depression, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, sleepwalking and restless sleep in general.</p>
<p>The elderly and those with claustrophobia, breathing or circulation problems should consult with a health professional before using a weighted blanket. They are also not recommended for children under eight years old.</p>
<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>We first conducted an extensive online search to find which blankets had received high praise from trusted review sites, bloggers, YouTube reviewers and Reddit commenters. Since a weighted blanket can be a hefty investment, we wanted those in our testing lineup to be priced under $175 with good return policies, and also highly rated on Amazon.</p>
<p>Even though our review includes a separate category for the best cooling weighted blanket, we encountered so much online discussion about breathability that we decided to make it a key metric for all the blankets we tested. We also took note of other features that seemed to be especially important to buyers: whether the blanket is machine washable, comes with a duvet cover, etc.</p>
<p>Although the most well-known weighted blanket is arguably the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BNBFY52/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gravity Blanket</a> — the first weighted blanket brought to the mass market, via a 2017 Kickstarter campaign — we chose not to include it in our trials due to its weighty $249 price tag. (Affordability was a recurring theme in discussions online; we even came across Reddit threads discussing DIY weighted blanket projects.)</p>
<p>Instead, we selected the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N442PLC/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baloo &#8211; Weighted Blanket</a> — more reasonably priced (relatively) at about $149 — as a contender for the best weighted blanket overall. Known for its luxurious, long-lasting quality, breathability and excellent customer service, the Baloo brand promised to be worth the investment. For this category we also picked the Quility &#8211; Premium Adult Weighted Blanket, an Amazon customer favorite with a 4.8-star rating and nearly 9,000 reviews that comes with a fleece duvet.</p>
<p>For the best cooling weighted blanket category, the Zonli &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C193MKM/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YnM &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket</a> stood out as worthy contestants. Both made of breathable bamboo viscose, the blankets  received rave reviews from hot sleepers who were initially wary of feeling stifled under weighted blankets.</p>

[table id=309 /]
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Weight</h3>
<p>For adults, manufacturers generally recommend choosing a weighted blanket that’s about 10 percent of your body weight, give or take a few pounds. For children and those with mobility issues, the 10 percent rule still applies, but err on the side of a lighter blanket rather than a heavier one.</p>
<h3>Size</h3>
<p>Normally, the size of a blanket should match the size of your bed (i.e. a twin blanket for a twin bed, king for king, etc.). But because weighted blankets are heavy, if any excess material falls over the end or sides of the bed, it will either weigh too heavy on the sleeper, or drag the rest of the blanket onto the floor.</p>
<p>Weighted blankets are usually sized to keep this from happening; for example, if you buy a queen-size blanket, it should only reach the edges of a queen bed’s surface without any overhang. However, it’s a good idea to check the actual measurements of the blanket before ordering one.</p>
<h3>Glass beads vs. plastic pellets</h3>
<p>The weights inside a weighted blanket will come in one of two forms: glass microbeads or small plastic pellets. The only real difference between the two is that the glass beads are tiny and sand-like, whereas plastic pellets are a bit larger and less weighty. This means a glass-bead blanket will be thinner than a plastic-pellet one.</p>
<h3>Washability</h3>
<p>There will come a point when your weighted blanket will need a wash. Although many weighted blankets are advertised as machine washable,  the manufacturer will often recommend spot cleaning instead. In light of this (and because weighted blankets are so cumbersome), we urge you to buy a duvet cover for your blanket, which will allow you to wash the blanket itself as little as possible.</p>
<h2 id="how-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Our testers slept under each of the weighted blankets in our lineup for three nights, then rated them using the following metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>How well did you sleep under this blanket?</li>
<li>How comfortable and soothed did you feel?</li>
<li>Did you feel uncomfortably warm during the night?</li>
<li>How would you rate the feeling of the blanket’s exterior shell?</li>
<li>How well is the weight distributed throughout the blanket?</li>
<li>How would you rate the quality of the blanket’s construction?</li>
<li>How would you rate the aesthetic look of the blanket?</li>
<li>How easy is this blanket to wash/dry/care for?</li>
<li>Does the blanket come with a duvet cover?</li>
<li>Is this blanket worth the price?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Baloo</h2>

<p>Our top pick for best weighted blanket overall is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N442PLC/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baloo &#8211; Weighted Blanket</a>. Made with premium, chemical-free cotton and lead-free glass microbeads dispersed amongst polyester fill, the Baloo was luxurious and cozy to sleep under. It was also quite breathable; we didn’t feel too warm once throughout the testing period.</p>
<p>Right down to the ribbon-tied welcome note inside its blanket box, Baloo is all about the details, even offering three free downloadable tracks of soothing meditative music to fall asleep to. While the fill weights in many weighted blankets are contained by a grid of squares alone, the Baloo blanket features unique double-quilted stitching, creating channels of piping that run between the squares as well. This means more support for the heavy glass beads inside, as well as more evenly distributed weight throughout the blanket.</p>
<p>Baloo is a green company, meaning their blankets contain zero harmful chemicals and are certified vegan. The blankets also machine washable in cold water on the gentle cycle, and can be dried in the dryer on low heat. As far as return policies go, Baloo’s is one of the more lenient that we came across, encouraging customers to take some time to get used to the weight of the blanket. You have 30 days to initiate a return, as long as the blanket is sent back in its original condition.</p>

<p>Out of the four blankets we tested, the Baloo offers the least sizing and weight options; only two sizes (twin and queen) and three weights (12, 15 and 20 pounds) are available. The blanket also only comes in one color — Pebble White — and doesn’t include a duvet cover, though the company does sell them separately. Although the blanket itself is well-designed and has the look of a high-end duvet, we recommend protecting it with a cover so you won’t have to go to the trouble of washing it often.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Baloo &#8211; Weighted Blanket feels luxe and cocoon-like, without sacrificing breathability.</li>
<li>The blanket is certified vegan and contains no harmful chemicals.</li>
<li>With double-quilted stitching, the Baloo is well-constructed to distribute weight evenly and prevent seam breaks.</li>
<li>This blanket only comes in twin and queen sizes, offers 12, 15 and 20-pound options and doesn’t include a duvet cover.</li>
</ul>

<p>With a 300-thread-count bamboo viscose shell that’s cool to the touch, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C193MKM/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YnM &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket</a> gets our vote for the best cooling weighted blanket. Though certainly not light and airy, the blanket didn’t feel too dense, and we remained well-ventilated throughout the night. However, if you’re a hot sleeper, keep in mind that this is the only blanket you’ll need on your bed.</p>
<p>We were impressed with the YnM blanket’s construction, which is designed to prevent seam breaks and tearing. Underneath the bamboo outer layer, there’s an extra layer of cotton fabric to better contain the thin, breathable layer of polyfill and lead-free glass beads inside. The stitching is also clearly strong and high quality. Although the blanket is technically machine washable (on the delicate cycle), YnM recommends spot cleaning the blanket instead.</p>
<p>What really sold us on the YnM blanket was its three-year free mending guarantee. If any unexpected damage should come to your blanket within three years of purchase, YnM will repair it for you (though you will need to pay for shipping). They also offer a 30-day return policy on their blankets, as long as they are sent back with the original packaging.</p>

<p>The blanket itself does not come with a duvet cover, but YnM sells a variety of reasonably priced covers in three fabrics — cotton, bamboo and “minky” fleece — which come in tasteful solid colors and surprisingly chic patterns. If you need more warmth when the seasons change, the fleece duvet would be a great addition to take the cooling blanket from summer to winter use.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The YnM &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket’s high-thread-count bamboo viscose outer layer is silky soft and cool to the touch.</li>
<li>The blanket features high-quality stitching and construction that will stand the test of time.</li>
<li>YnM offers an unbeatable three-year mending guarantee on their weighted blanket (though customers must pay shipping).</li>
<li>No duvet cover is included.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="others">Other weighted blankets we tested</h2>
<p>Although the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DLHD2RX/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Quility &#8211; Premium Adult Weighted Blanket</a> was cozy to sleep under with well-distributed weight, we grew uncomfortably warm during the night under its minky duvet cover, which seems to only be usable in cold climates during the winter. Without the cover, the blanket’s cotton outer layer felt a bit rough against our skin, and was quite plain compared to its <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N442PLC/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baloo</a> competitor.</p>
<p>Like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C193MKM/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YnM</a> blanket, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075W9VSW7/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zonli &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket</a> remained comfortably cool during the night, but the company’s return policy concerned us — Zonli offers no refunds on used blankets, only those that are returned unopened in their original packaging. Since high prices showed up as a top concern for weighted blanket buyers online, this bumped the Zonli down to second place in our cooling weighted blanket category.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>With weighted blankets now being marketed to the masses to help improve sleep and soothe anxiety and depression, they’re worth a try — as long as they include a good return policy.</p>
<p>Made of breathable, chemical-free cotton and featuring strong double-quilted stitching and a generous 30-day return policy, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N442PLC/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baloo &#8211; Weighted Blanket</a> is a great choice for anyone in the market for a high-quality, luxurious weighted blanket.</p>
<p>For those who sleep hot, we recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C193MKM/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YnM &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket</a>, made with silky, cooling 300-thread-count bamboo viscose and featuring durable construction and a three-year mending guarantee.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ver the past several weeks, we researched, snoozed and snored our way through seven finalists to determine that the best pillow for neck pain is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0S6LBD/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coop Home Goods &#8211; Eden</a>. This gel-infused shredded memory foam pillow offers down-like comfort and had our testers waking up the next morning refreshed and pain-free.

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We began by reading up on causes of neck pain and the importance of sleep in general. Next, we explored pillow recommendations from a variety of blogs and articles written by sleep experts. We took into account our previous experience with pillows in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-pillow-for-side-sleepers/">review of the best pillow for side sleepers</a>. We also investigated pillow ratings and user reviews from major retailers like Amazon, Bed Bath and Beyond, Target and Walmart.</p>
<p>While keeping in mind that choosing the right pillow involves a certain amount of personal preference, we ultimately selected seven pillows noted for their ability to provide strong cervical spine support and therefore prevent and/or resolve neck pain. (The cervical spine refers to the seven vertebrae that form the neck.) Our selections are primarily designed for side and back sleepers —  side and back are usually the best sleeping positions for reducing neck pain — and represent a range of materials and price points.</p>

<h2 id="causes">What causes neck pain?</h2>
<p>Neck pain can be the result of <a href="https://www.spine-health.com/conditions/neck-pain/neck-pain-causes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a variety of causes</a>, but the most common one is injury. Neck strains and sprains can be caused by sports, repetitive motions, poor posture (particularly from time spent at the computer or looking down at a phone), whiplash or sleeping in the wrong position.</p>
<p>Age is another factor that can contribute to neck pain as joints become worn out over time. Certain diseases that we are more prone to in our elder years, like arthritis or cancer, can also be contributing factors.</p>
<p>Other causes include stress and anxiety, being overweight or obese and, unfortunately, lack of sleep.</p>
<p>Your favored sleep position also plays an important role. Of the three common sleep positions — back, side and stomach — back or side sleeping are most recommended to avoid neck pain.</p>
<p>Stomach sleeping is not advised because this position requires the head and neck to twist to the side, which places pressure on delicate nerves. Changing your sleep position to either your back or side, while challenging for habitual stomach sleepers, may help resolve chronic neck pain issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spine-health.com/wellness/sleep/pillows-neck-pain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spine Health</a> advises that sleeping with the right type of pillow for your sleeping position can help your neck pain. Sleep experts recommend choosing one that contours to the shape of your head and neck. Pillows that are malleable and/or adjustable can be helpful to achieve the desired contour. <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/say-good-night-to-neck-pain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard Health</a> advises that you avoid pillows which are too high or too stiff.</p>
<p>Back sleepers are usually better off with thinner pillows and side sleepers with something thicker — but the right pillow thickness also depends on the width of your shoulders, size of your head and firmness of your mattress.</p>
<p>Pillows are made from a wide variety of materials, including feathers, down, down alternatives, memory foam, latex, gel fibers and polyester. Pillows that maintain their loft and don’t collapse under the weight of your head are recommended to help alleviate neck pain.</p>
<p>Be sure to contact your doctor if neck pain is severe, lasts for several days without relief, spreads down arms or legs, or is accompanied by headache, numbness, weakness or tingling.</p>
<h2 id="health">How sleep affects your health</h2>
<p>Sleep, of course, impacts your overall health. Lack of sleep can negatively affect your physical health by causing weakened immunity, increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, weight gain and — we now know — neck pain. Cognitively, poor sleep can result in problems with concentration and memory. Emotionally, not getting enough sleep often leads to irritability, anxiety and even depression.</p>
<p>Tips for better sleep:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adults should aim for at least seven hours each night.</li>
<li>Always go to bed and get up around the same time.</li>
<li>Exercise regularly.</li>
<li>Avoid caffeine, alcohol, sugar, extra water and large meals before bed.</li>
<li>Manage stress.</li>
<li>Be wary of daylight-tinted blue light, especially from electronic screens. Read more about light and sleep in our review of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-night-light/">the best night lights</a>.</li>
<li>Keep your bedroom cool.</li>

<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Support</b> When it comes to addressing neck pain, your pillow’s primary job is to place your neck into a neutral position and hold it there while you sleep. Whether this support comes from contoured memory foam or a customizable water base, be sure that your pillow properly aligns your head, neck, shoulders and spine — in whatever your preferred sleeping position may be.</p>
<p><b>Adjustable loft</b> It is becoming increasingly common for pillow manufacturers to offer customization options that allow the user to add or remove filling at home. In some cases, pillow customization requires sending it back to the manufacturer. Water based pillows use varying amounts of water to adjust the pillow’s overall firmness and height.</p>
<p><b>Firmness/softness:</b> We recommend you choose a pillow that is firm enough to provide enough neck support, but soft enough that you enjoy the feeling of laying down to sleep. After all, you will (hopefully!) spend at least seven hours a night with your pillow. See “Materials” section below for more info.</p>
<p><b>Size:</b> Common sizes are standard, queen and king, which correspond to the size of the similarly named mattresses. Sheet sets often include pillowcases for corresponding pillows. Your preference will likely be affected by your own size, the size of your bed and how much you move around at night.</p>
<h3>Materials:</h3>
<p><b>Filling: </b>Some common pillow fills are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feathers and down &#8211; This fill is, warm, malleable, and breathable— but provides little neck support.</li>
<li>Memory foam &#8211; This man-made material will mold and contour around the head and neck. It offers good support and is durable. Memory foam retains heat and can have an unpleasant scent.</li>
<li>Shredded memory foam &#8211; Like standard memory foam pillows, these pillows are supportive and durable. They are also more moldable to contour around the head and neck.</li>
<li>Polyester gel fibers &#8211; A gel pillow is not actually filled with any liquid-like substance. Instead, the gel is infused into solid polyester fibers. The resulting fibers feel similar to down, but offer more support. This material is often used for its cooling properties.</li>
<li>Microfiber &#8211; This used to be the primary filling for pillows, but memory foam and latex pillows are now more popular since they tend to offer better support. Polyester is one common type of microfiber.</li>
<li>Latex &#8211; This material is breathable, soft to the touch and springs back quickly. It does not hold its loft as well as memory foam products do.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Covers: </b>A range of both natural and synthetic materials are used to cover pillows, including cotton, polyester and blends. Products derived from bamboo are popular recently and offer a soft, silky feel.</p>
<p>Consider whether the pillow cover is removable and machine-washable.</p>
<p><b>Allergies: </b>Many of the products we tested were hypoallergenic. Pillows containing materials like feathers or latex may cause issues for some sensitive individuals. People who are prone to dust allergies might also want to consider removable covers or machine-washable pillows for ease of laundering when making their decision.</p>
<p><b>Trial period: </b>Many pillow manufacturers offer trial periods. Some of these periods are advertised for as long as a year, but be sure to read the fine print. In some cases, the manufacturer only honors the trial period if you buy directly from them. Amazon typically offers a 30-day return policy.</p>
<h2 id="how-tested">How we tested</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pillow-testing.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Before testing, we unpacked our seven finalists and followed individual product instructions to prepare each pillow. Several came vacuum-compressed and needed time in the dryer to fluff up. The two water pillows required adding a measured amount of water via funnel and removing remaining air pockets. Others were ready to use right out of the box.</p>
<p>Next, we recruited three product testers to sleep with each of the pillows over a three week period On a scale of one to 10, they rated overall comfort levels each morning, and ranked pillow preferences based on how well they supported the neck region. All of our pillow testers identified as alternating between side and back sleeping positions and have experienced intermittent neck pain.</p>
<p>Finally, we closely inspected each pillow to assess its loft, overall support, lumpiness, thickness, softness, contour shape and any other features that caught our attention. We also explored customization options and overall ease of care.</p>

<p>All of our pillow testers agree that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0S6LBD/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coop Home Goods &#8211; Eden</a> is the best pillow for neck pain. This cross-cut, gel-infused memory foam and microfiber pillow is luxuriously comfortable, customizable and — most importantly — cradles your head and neck perfectly so that you remain pain-free and get a good night’s sleep. (Not surprisingly, Coop Home Goods was also picked as <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-pillow-for-side-sleepers/">the best pillow for side sleeping</a>!)</p>
<p>The opulent experience begins when the Eden arrives on your doorstep. It comes beautifully packaged in a custom box, with a slogan announcing “A pillow as unique as you are.&#8221; As instructed, we prepared our pillow by placing it in the dryer on low for 10 minutes. Although there was a very slight off-gassing odor from the foam when we first received the product, this dissipated quickly.</p>
<p>The pillow comes complete with an extra bag of filling, which was a nice touch for anyone desiring additional support. Coop Home Goods suggests that side sleepers try the pillow as-is before adding foam. Back sleepers are encouraged to remove about a quarter of the foam from their pillow, and stomach sleepers to remove a third of the foam. Free customization assistance is also offered via a phone support line. Our testers felt that the Eden came with the right amount of filling right out of the box.</p>
<p>The filling is made from a combination of 80-percent visco-elastic foam (memory foam) with infused gel beads and 20-percent polyester fiber, which sounds sort of goopy, but in actuality feels very soft and down-like. The combination of foam and fibers is designed to prevent clumping and promote airflow, which keeps you both cool and comfortable. This particular foam is cross cut into very small pieces, which also helped avoid lumps.</p>

This pillow provides excellent support for sore necks.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0S6LBD/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The soft outer cover has gusseted edges, which help distribute the filling evenly regardless of your sleeping position. You can opt to sleep directly on this cover or use a traditional pillow case on top. It is made from polyester and viscose (derived from bamboo) and is nicely breathable and soft to the touch. The pillow has a zippered polyester inner cover which holds the filling when washing the outer cover.</p>
<p>The pillow feels heavy and firmer than a traditional poly-fill or down pillow, but it is still soft enough to welcome you to bed. We liked that the Eden was more fluffy than runners-up from Nature’s Guest or Perform Pillow without compromising neck support.</p>
<p>The best thing about the Eden was how well it held its loft under the pressure of one’s head and neck. We were pleasantly surprised by how such a cuddly, cloudlike pillow could also provide such strong support to keep our heads, necks and spines in alignment throughout the night.</p>
<p>To maintain the pillow, instructions state to place it in the dryer on low for 10 minutes every six months. Both the pillow and cover are machine-washable, but the agitation isn&#8217;t good for the foam.</p>
<p>This product is made in the USA. The manufacturer offers a 100-night trial, satisfaction guarantee and a 5-year warranty.</p>

<p>Like the Coop Home Goods &#8211; Eden, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075312Y9Y/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Perform Pillow &#8211; CSP-03 Memory Foam</a> Neck Pillow managed to be both soft and welcoming while also supporting the neck in all the right places. While not technically customizable, this contoured memory foam pillow can be used in one of four positions to adjust to different sized individuals and/or a variety of sleeping positions.</p>
<p>This pillow offers a very different sleeping experience than Coop Home Goods. Unlike our shredded memory foam winner, Perform Pillow’s single piece of foam can’t be manipulated and shaped around your bumps and curves; instead, you need to rely on its pre-formed shape. We tried the medium profile option though it also comes in thick or thin variations. While we found the contours worked well for us, some people may find that it takes a little getting used to.</p>
<p>The product states that it can take up to 2 weeks for your neck to fully adjust. Our testers were pleased to enjoy comfortable, sound sleep from the first use.</p>

<p>Made from Certi-PUR certified polyurethane foam, Perform Pillow comes ready-to-use right out of the box. Unlike some of the other foam pillows tested, it didn’t put off any unpleasant odor. Both long sides of the pillow have a different shaped contour, so you can choose which way you place it for the best fit. Alternatively, you can turn the pillow upside down and use either edge for two more positioning options. Two of our testers preferred using the contoured side up, with the higher shaped contoured edge supporting the neck; the other preferred the lower contour shape.</p>
<p>Perform’s soft and removable zippered cover is made from Kool-Flow, a bamboo-and-polyester fabric with a &#8220;micro-vented&#8221; texture. The cover is machine-washable in cold water and can be dried with low heat. If you choose to use the pillow in the inverted position, we recommend replacing the outer cover with a standard pillow case, since the zipper runs along the middle of the back side and would be uncomfortable to sleep on.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Perform Pillow &#8211; CSP-03 Memory Foam Neck Pillow provides contoured support to prevent and alleviate neck pain.</li>
<li>The pre-molded foam design can be placed in a variety of positions for personal comfort.</li>
<li>Its’ bamboo-derived cover is soft, eco-friendly and washable.</li>
<li>Perform sells medium, thick or thin variations.</li>

<p>Like the Perform Pillow, this contoured, microfiber-filled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IWM6056/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nature&#8217;s Guest &#8211; Support Pillow</a> takes some getting used to, but is well worth any adjustment period for the excellent cervical support it offers. Unlike the Perform or Eden, the unique shape allows for a specific sweet spot in the middle of the pillow that gives Nature’s Guest a particularly high-level of support.</p>
<p>This unusually shaped pillow — which boasts a patent-pending doctor-recommended design — provides the perfect resting place for your weary neck and helps maintain proper head, neck and spinal alignment while you sleep. Nature’s Guest is notably heavier and firmer than our other finalists and as a result, we weren’t expecting to find it particularly comfortable. We were wrong!</p>
<p>We found this pillow particularly beneficial for sleepers who move around a lot, such as when shifting from a side to back position. We liked that we could rest our head either in the center indented portion of the pillow, or along one of the higher, outer edges. This gave some flexibility through the night as sleeping positions shifted.</p>

<p>The pillow arrives vacuum-packed. You can opt to either fluff it by hand or place in the dryer for five minutes to inflate to normal size. The Nature’s Guest, which uses polyester fill, can then be customized by either removing some filling or putting extra inside. Like Coop Home Goods, Nature&#8217;s Guest ships their pillow with a bag of extra filling so there’s no need to send it back for customization.</p>
<p>The cotton cover is satin-trimmed with gusseted sides, which are particularly helpful for side sleeper support.  Zippered openings on both ends make customization simple.</p>
<p>Perhaps our biggest complaint is that this pillow requires hand washing. A customer satisfaction guarantee allows returns within 30 days for a full refund, no questions asked.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Nature’s Guest &#8211; Support Pillow has a uniquely shaped, contoured design that provides excellent cervical support.</li>
<li>Although heavy and firm, the well-designed shape allows for an extremely comfortable night’s rest.</li>

<h3>Chiroflow &#8211; Water Pillow</h3>
<p>We were excited to try out the concept of an adjustable water pillow with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AHDIHSC/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chiroflow</a>. The experience was somewhat different than anticipated. While we found the pillow reasonably supportive of the head and neck, we didn’t have any obvious sensation of sleeping on water — other than a nagging fear that the pillow would leak in the middle of the night and we’d wake up in a puddle. (Don’t worry, that didn’t actually happen!)</p>
<p>The water bladder was located beneath a comfortably soft, thick layer of polyester fill and provided adjustable firmness. The water lent a hefty weight to the pillow, which helped keep it in place through the night.</p>
<p>We did notice a vague shifting sensation of the water redistributing when we moved around, but because it was below the padded layer, this sensation didn’t resemble anything like sleeping on a waterbed. So if you are prone to seasickness, don’t worry, we don’t think using this pillow will be a problem.</p>
<p>Initially customizing Chiroflow was a challenge. The detailed instructions recommended adding varying amounts of water based on your preferred sleeping position. A small plastic funnel is provided to assist this process and pouring in the water was simple. You can add any amount you like — the more water added, the firmer the pillow. Exact measurement recommendations are provided.</p>
<p>The challenging part was removing the remaining air pocket, which involved squeezing air out of the water bladder while simultaneously capping the opening and (hopefully) not getting water everywhere. If you don’t successfully remove the entire air pocket, you can hear (and feel) the water sloshing around, which interferes with a good night’s rest. Preparing the pillow properly required an extra set of hands.</p>
<p>Chiroflow, along with Mediflow — the other water pillow manufacturer whose pillow we tested — were the only finalists that proved their designs in clinical testing. An independent clinical study by Johns Hopkins ranked Mediflow &#8220;best&#8221; for how quickly subjects fell asleep, how few times subjects woke up, their perception of sleep compared to normal, overall quality of sleep and reduction of neck pain.</p>
<p>While Chiroflow wasn’t our top choice pillow for neck pain, the combination of comfortable fill and a responsive, supportive, adjustable water base make it a good option for neck support. Also, the entire pillow can be machine-washed and dried and comes with a 30-day satisfaction guarantee.</p>
<h3>Mediflow &#8211; Waterbase Pillow</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003J372NS/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mediflow &#8211; Waterbase Pillow</a> is almost indistinguishable from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AHDIHSC/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chiroflow &#8211; Water Pillow</a>. The only difference involves the material of the outer cover. Mediflow’s is made from 100-percent cotton as opposed to Chiroflow’s 65-percent polyester and 35-percent cotton.</p>
<p>Overall, we ranked the Chiroflow slightly higher than the Mediflow for its noticeably softer cover. Both pillows are the exact same design, involve the same customization set up and provide equally effective neck support.</p>
<h3>Snuggle-Pedic &#8211; Kool-Flow</h3>
<p>We don’t recommend purchasing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PBFP0S6/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Snuggle-Pedic &#8211; Kool-Flow</a> to avoid or alleviate neck pain. This pillow was too tall and stiff for comfortable neck support in any sleeping position. Instead, it placed the neck at an uncomfortable angle that resulted in all three of our testers abandoning it in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>We tried the queen size, though there are also king and standard size options.</p>
<p>Snuggle-Pedic is made from shredded polyurethane foam. Although it held its loft well, there was simply too much of it to sleep on comfortably and there is no zippered access to remove the excess. Beyond that, it felt lumpy and had a strong, unpleasant, chemical-like smell. The smell did not entirely dissipate even after airing out for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>The micro-vented cover, made from bamboo viscose, polyester and lycra, was soft and breathable — but not removable. This is a plus for anyone who wants to avoid zippers, but a negative for anyone who wants the ability to wash the cover solo. You can opt to wash the entire pillow in cold water either by hand or via machine with minimum agitation, then squeeze out excess water and dry with high heat.</p>
<p>Although the product states you can gather and reshape the pillow to allow it to contour to your head and neck, we did not find this to be the case. No matter how we tried to reshape it, in the end it simply wasn’t comfortable.</p>
<p>While the company claims free customizations during an 120-day sleep trial (which may have helped by removing some of the excess foam), the fine print states this benefit will only apply if you purchase the product directly from Relief-Mart, Inc. The same goes for the offer of free return shipping and their 20-year warranty.</p>
<p>Even if you did purchase direct, who wants to deal with shipping their entire brand new pillow back to the manufacturer for customization? Not us.</p>
<h3>Brooklyn Bedding &#8211; Talalay Latex</h3>
<p>We were not fans of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WJ0AHRK/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brooklyn Bedding &#8211; Talalay Latex</a> for proper neck support, either. We tried the plush version, which does not hold its loft at all. It was similar to sleeping on a giant sponge that compresses under the weight of your head and then quickly springs back to its original shape when you get up. This didn’t do our necks any favors.</p>
<p>Brooklyn Bedding is molded from 100-percent latex rubber foam and has a soft, zippered, removable and breathable cover which is machine washable. The cover is very nice.</p>
<p>Perhaps this pillow might be a better option for stomach sleepers who are not concerned with neck pain. It also comes in a firm variety which may offer better cervical support than this one did.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Overall, we believe that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0S6LBD/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coop Home Goods &#8211; Eden</a> is the best pillow option on the market for anyone experiencing, or who wants to avoid, neck pain. The cross-cut, gel-infused memory foam and microfiber fill is comfortable, adjustable and — most importantly — provides the perfect cushion to cradle your neck. It is designed to align your head, neck and shoulders into a neutral position for a pain-free, restful night’s sleep.</p>
<p>We also slept well with our two runners-up: the Perform Pillow and the Nature&#8217;s Guest.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075312Y9Y/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Perform Pillow &#8211; Memory Foam</a> was soft and welcoming, while supporting the neck in all the right places. The contoured memory foam can be used in one of four positions to adjust to different sizes and preferences. Because the pillow can’t be manipulated like the shredded memory foam of our winner, it might take users some adjustment to get used to it.</p>
<p>The fiber-filled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IWM6056/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nature&#8217;s Guest</a> also performed well in our product testing. This adjustable, firm and heavy microfiber pillow offered good neck support with its unusual contoured shape. Due to this unique design, we found this pillow especially beneficial for sleepers who frequently change positions during the night.</p>

<h2 id="what-is">What is a flip chair?</h2>
<p>A flip chair is also known as a convertible or folding bed mattress. It’s composed of a repositionable metal frame, covered with a thin layer of polyurethane foam or polyester fiber and encased within a layer of foam that’s generally four inches thick. The frame and foam are fit into a polyester cover, similar to a cushioned patio lounger. The cover is usually removable for cleaning.</p>

<p>When laid out completely flat on the floor, the frame can be used as a temporary bed for overnight guests or for kids&#8217; sleepover. The frame is divided into three sections, which allow you to fold it up into a lounger with a head rest or a compact chair that can fit in a small living area or bedroom. Since the folded-up chair has no legs — usually just non-skid feet — it’s usually only about 8 inches up off the floor.</p>
<p>Flip chairs are popular with students who have small dorm rooms or people who live in studio apartments, where space is limited. They’re also great for kids’ sleepovers or for just hanging out and watching television or gaming.</p>
<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected flip chairs to test</h2>
<p>Despite flip chairs’ popularity with students and parents, there aren’t many manufacturers who make them. Some high-end furniture companies sell their version of a flip chair, but they’re more expensive than what you can find online.</p>
<p>Flip chairs are available in several sizes, but we focused our search on the standard size, which is 6-½ feet long when completely flat and 28 inches wide. That&#8217;s narrower than a twin-size bed, but similar to a camping bed. (Some Amazon reviewers of flip chairs actually do take them on camping trips, since they fit inside a tent and are more comfortable than sleeping on hard ground on a pad or sleeping bag.) The standard flip chair size is the one that’s most often purchased for dorm rooms and sleepovers, as it can be easily stored and unfolded when needed.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, flip chairs can be pricey. Although they’re not constructed of expensive materials, and sometimes the foam is not the highest quality, flip chairs can be priced at $200 or higher. We selected four flip chairs that are in the more reasonable $100 range.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L6YW0YI/?tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Your Zone Bed</a> flip chair is very similar to the other flip chairs we tested, but it’s a lot more comfortable. Its metal frame is sandwiched between two thick layers of foam, which cushion the bottom of the flip chair when it’s folded out flat. This extra foam gave an additional measure of comfort when we tested it as a bed. Also, the upper half of the foam is covered with a polyester-fiber mesh that softens the rough texture of the foam.</p>
<p>Much like other flip beds, Your Zone’s ultra-suede cover has two zippered sections: A long middle section and a headrest. None of the flip chairs’ covers have a zipper on the lower third. Consequently, the middle and upper sections can be machine washed, and the lower third can only be spot-cleaned. This section should be less prone to getting stained, but it&#8217;s something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Your Zone has five positions, which are adjusted by lifting the headrest until it locks into place. To unfold it, the headrest is pushed down to the middle section and released. When flat, Your Zone’s frame has a slight curvature that flattens when you lie down. This buckle gives the foam added flexibility, so it feels somewhat like a bed mattress.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L6YW0YI/?tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/yourzonebed-thumb-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/yourzonebed-thumb-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/yourzonebed-thumb-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/yourzonebed-thumb-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/yourzonebed-thumb-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/yourzonebed-thumb-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/yourzonebed-thumb-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/yourzonebed-thumb-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/yourzonebed-thumb.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Most Comfortable: Your Zone Bed</h3><p>A well-priced flip chair made with higher quality materials than other flip chairs, Your Zone Bed was also the most comfy for sleeping, gaming, watching TV or just lounging.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L6YW0YI/?tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>For the next position, the headrest needs to be folded over, creating a pillow (albeit, a hard one), which shortens the 6-½ foot bed by 14 inches. This second position was always the most uncomfortable with all of the flip beds we tested.</p>
<p>Third and fourth positions turn the flip chair into a lounger, which is ideal for watching television or gaming. Both give good back support, but the fourth position is a bit more elevated and more comfortable.</p>
<p>For the fifth position, the headrest is fully upright, and the bottom third folds up and onto the middle section, transforming it into a chair. It’s low to the ground, but Your Zone’s flexible foam has some give to it like sofa cushions, and we found it to be the most comfy for watching TV.</p>
<p>The Your Zone Bed flip chair is priced comparably with the other flip chairs we tested — a little over $100 — but we found it to be better constructed for comfort. If you’re looking for a versatile piece of furniture for a small space or a sleepover, this is the flip chair you should get.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Your Zone Bed flip chair is a versatile piece of furniture that can change from a comfy chair to a temporary fold-out bed anywhere and any time an extra bed is needed.</li>
<li>It’s priced about the same as other flip chairs, but it’s better constructed for comfort.</li>
<li>The Your Zone Bed flip chair is great for a dorm room or studio apartment where space is limited or for kids’ sleepovers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="others">Other flip chairs we tested</h2>
<h3>Best Choice Products &#8211; SKY1814</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VQYBXV4/?tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Best Choice Products</a> flip chair has a substantial frame that resembles a lawn or patio lounge chair. It has a pristine polyurethane foam that feels like memory foam and looks brand new. However, when the flip chair is laid flat into the bed position, the foam has an odd crunchy texture and crackles when it’s pressed down.</p>
<p>Although the Best Choice was comfortable as a bed and as an upright chair, there was no flexibility in its foam or frame, which made every other position uncomfortable. Its small non-skid feet needed to be screwed into the frame, which wasn’t difficult to do. However, the feet are screwed through the bottom of the chair’s cover, so should you ever need to wash it, the feet need to be unscrewed first; a design feature we found inconvenient.</p>
<h3>Giantex &#8211; HW52445GR</h3>
<p>In appearance, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IR61GL0/z/tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Giantex</a> is almost identical to the Your Zone Bed and Best Choice Products. It has five adjustable positions, a removable ultra-suede cover (erroneously advertised as cotton) and is approximately the same length, height and width. Three of its five positions, however, were hard and unyielding — even napping on it was unpleasant.</p>
<p>When we inspected underneath the cover, we discovered that its frame is a metal checkerboard shape, which may account for why it’s such an uncomfortable chair/bed. More disturbing was the condition of the foam: Dirty with debris and wood bits, as though it had been dragged along a factory floor. Clearly, Giantex doesn’t use high-quality foam for its overpriced product.</p>
<h3>Magshion &#8211; FCOF27</h3>
<p>Described as a folding bed mattress, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LS1OXEO/?tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Magshion</a> flip chair is actually just a foldable futon. Its polyurethane foam is divided into three equal sections and covered with a polyester-cotton cover that’s available in sixteen colors. It’s slightly shorter and narrower than other flip beds, and since it has no frame, the Magshion can’t be used as a chair unless you’re leaning up against a couch or wall.</p>
<p>It’s available in five sizes, and although the single size that we tested was $80, the other sizes are absurdly expensive for what’s little more than a lawn-furniture pad.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>A flip chair is a fun and convenient furniture option for a small room or apartment. Although their metal frames are sturdy, the foam will lose its density over time, so we wouldn’t recommend replacing a bed mattress with a flip chair. However, it’s great for short-term use or sleepovers, and we like how the flip chair can be transformed in seconds from a lounger to an upright chair.</p>
<p>The best flip chair that we tested is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L6YW0YI/?tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Your Zone Bed</a>. Its flexible frame sandwiched between thick foam proved to be comfortable in all of its five adjustable positions. Whether you want to nap, hang out with friends or just lounge around with your dog or cat, the versatile Your Zone Bed flip chair will suit your needs.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e tested the most popular sit-up pillows to find the one that gives you total back support while cushioning you in comfort. Hands down, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073DJFYB1/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Linenspa</a> is the best sit-up pillow for reading in bed, watching television, gaming or any other leisure activity.

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected sit-up pillows to test</h2>
<p>A sit-up pillow really has one purpose: give you back support while you’re reading or watching television in bed or on a couch. But after we read through Amazon consumer reviews, we learned that people also buy sit-up pillows to sit upright in bed after surgery or to help relieve chronic back pain.</p>
<p>The sit-up pillows we decided to test were recommended by reviewers for correcting posture while they were lounging to support back and neck muscles. But the pillows had to be comfortable, too; nobody enjoys sitting against a hard piece of foam.</p>
<p>We chose pillows that were stuffed with shredded memory foam, since it can be both firm and plush at the same time. People who buy a sit-up pillow for back pain often buy a bed wedge pillow, so we tested one of the most popular wedge pillows to see how it compared to traditional sit-up bed pillows</p>
<h2 id="compare">Compare the best sit-up pillows</h2>

<p>Many of the hundreds of models and styles of sit-up pillows look identical. During our testing we discovered that they’re not all alike. The following features of the best sit-up pillow will help you decide which one is right for you.</p>
<p><b>Size: </b>Most sit-up pillows have a similar shape: triangular with two armrests on each side. If you’re looking for a sit-up pillow that gives you both lower and upper back support, you’ll need one that is as tall as your entire back: The top of the pillow should reach your shoulders at the base of your neck. A shorter sit-up pillow will only support your lower back muscles, and you’ll feel the strain on your upper back muscles after a few minutes.</p>
<p>Two of the pillows we tested are available in several sizes. Before purchasing a sit-up pillow, we recommend measuring the length of your back and comparing it to the height of the pillow. We found that the extra-large size (24 inches) gives better back support to a tall person than the standard size (18 inches) does.</p>
<p><b>Long armrests: </b>Many sit-up pillows have short, stubby armrests that only reach as far as your elbows. Depending on the length of your arms, the short armrests may not even touch your elbows, which means you need to keep your arms elevated when you’re reading. Look for a sit-up pillow that has armrests that reach the base of your wrists. The extra length will support your elbows so you can hold a book and also cushion your arms when you’re watching television or just resting.</p>
<p><b>Materials: </b>All of the sit-up pillows we tested had a polyester cover, usually an ultra-suede or velour. Except for one of the pillows we tested, their covers can be removed and washed.</p>
<p>The best sit-up pillow is stuffed with shredded memory foam, which is often encased within its own separate cover. As we discussed in our reviews for the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-cooling-pillow/#important-features">best cooling pillow</a> and the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-pillow-for-side-sleepers/#features">best pillow for side sleepers</a>, the memory foam should be CertiPUR-certified. <a href="https://certipur.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CertiPUR</a> tests polyurethane foams used in bedding for hazardous contaminants. Look for a label on the sit-up pillow that it’s been CertiPUR certified; otherwise, you could be breathing in toxic gases emitted from the foam.</p>
<h2 id="prepping">Prepping a sit-up pillow</h2>
<p>Many Amazon consumers are surprised that their sit-up pillow isn’t ready for immediate use when it’s delivered. Manufacturers compress the sit-up pillow, roll it and vacuum-seal it in plastic before shipping. When the pillow arrives, it needs to be released from the plastic, laid out flat and, as suggested by instructions, allowed to expand 24 to 48 hours.</p>
<p>We found, however, that the pillows fully expanded overnight. Although it’s not stated, we suspect that the 24-to-48-hour time period is to allow for off-gassing. Memory foam is notorious for its pungent chemical odor, which eventually dissipates. Since the majority of sit-up pillows are stuffed with memory foam, it’s best practice to let the pillow air out — we aired the test pillows on an outdoor patio — for two or three days.</p>
<h2 id="best">Best Sit-Up Pillow: Linenspa</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073DJFYB1/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Linenspa</a> was, by far, the most comfortable sit-up pillow we tested. Stuffed with shredded CertiPUR-certified memory foam, the Linenspa feels supportive and plush at the same time. Imagine your most comfy chair or sofa, and you’ll get a sense of what it’s like to settle into the Linenspa.</p>
<p>We tested the generously stuffed extra-large size, which gave full-back support while we sat in bed. The Linenspa has long (15 inches) and extra-wide (10 inches) armrests — the widest of all the pillows we tested — and they accommodated our forearms all the way to the palms of our hands.</p>
<p>The Linenspa is well made with strong stitching and thick fabric that’s been dyed a richly hued deep blue. (It’s also available in stone gray.) Unlike the other pillows we tested, the Linenspa doesn’t have a zipper for removing the cover. After testing, however, we decided that being able to remove the cover isn’t important, because once it’s been washed, the cover will shrink somewhat and be difficult to stuff the pillow back inside, especially into the armrests.</p>
<p>The Linenspa has a strong handle so we could easily drag it from the bedroom to the living room. We tested it on the couch, and it was slightly less comfortable, because its size takes up half the space of the sofa cushion. But once we shifted our position and sat more upright — as we were supposed to do — we never wanted to leave.</p>

Stuffed with CertiPUR-certified memory foam, we detected almost no unpleasant odors while using it.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073DJFYB1/?tag=sitpil-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Finally, we tried the Linenspa while sitting on the floor. Although the pillow does stay upright on its own, you do need to lean up against something if you want to use it for support. We did this same test with the other pillows, and we simply didn’t find any of them comfortable on the floor.</p>
<p>There was almost no off-gassing from this pillow, and although some Amazon reviewers complain about a heavy dye odor, we detected no strong smells from it.</p>
<p>The Linenspa is priced at $50, which is about average for a quality sit-up pillow. For $10 less, It’s also available in a smaller size, which is about one-third the size of the extra-large. For children and teens that size makes sense. The extra-large is quite heavy to lug around, so the standard size might also be better for the elderly who are bed-ridden.</p>
<p>Unlike the other pillows we tested, the Linenspa feels exceptionally durable. It supports upper and lower back and corrects posture while cushioning you in comfort.</p>
<p><b>Key takeways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Linenspa provides full support to upper and lower back and is also the most comfortable of the pillows we tested.</li>
<li>Its filling is made of shredded CertiPUR-certified memory foam, so it’s safe from hazardous contaminants.</li>
<li>The Linenspa’s armrests are extra-long and extra-wide, so you can rest the entire length of your arm.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the standard size <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0733ZCSR9/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Milliard reading pillow</a> is too small for a tall person, it gives excellent support to middle- and lower-back muscles. It looks and feels like a floppy stuffed toy, so we were surprised at how firm the Milliard was when we propped it against the bed headboard and couch cushion. Although its dangling arms barely extended past our elbows, we gathered them to our sides and comfortably rested our arms on them.</p>
<p>The Milliard is stuffed with shredded CertiPUR-certified memory foam, and if you want a firmer pillow, Milliard will send additional filling upon request. It has a soft polyester velour cover, which can be removed for washing or spot-cleaning.</p>

<p>The Milliard is available in two additional sizes: petite (14-inches tall) for a child and extra large (24-inches tall) for a tall person. The Milliard runs about $10 more than the Linenspa for the extra-large size, but it&#8217;s also a quality sit-up pillow that we recommend.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Milliard may seem too soft and floppy, but it gives surprisingly good support to middle- and lower-back muscles.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s stuffed with CertiPUR-certified memory foam, so you can feel confident it won&#8217;t emit toxic gases.</li>
<li>The Milliard extra-large size is $10 more than the Linenspa, but it&#8217;s also an excellent option.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GJBW5ZM//tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">mittaGonG reading pillow</a> gave good support to the lower back muscles, but because it’s only 20-inches high (the only size available) and not generously stuffed near the top, it can’t reach the upper back or neck. We found the mittaGong comfortable for watching television in bed, because we could lean back against the headboard. However, because of its short armrests, it was tiring to keep our elbows propped up to hold a book up for more than 10 minutes.</p>
<p>The mittaGonG seemed well made with a nice velour case and strong stitching. It’s stuffed with shredded memory foam, but it’s not CertiPUR-certified. Without the CertiPUR certification, you can’t trust what gasses might be emitted from the mittaGonG’s memory foam.</p>
<h3>Hit Notion &#8211; Husband Pillow</h3>
<p>Most reading pillows are known as “husband pillows,” apparently because they provide security, comfort and support. (Recently they’ve been renamed “boyfriend pillows.”) Hit Notion’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WLBH2T/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Husband Pillow</a> is one of the most popular on Amazon and is available in a rainbow of colors. It’s about the same size as the mittaGonG pillow, so it gives good lower-back support. A detachable neck roll is included, and it bolsters the neck but not the upper back.</p>
<p>The Husband Pillow’s armrests were splayed too far apart, so we could only rest our elbows and no other part of our arms comfortably. It’s a well-constructed pillow, and style-wise, we liked the two large buttons that connect the head roll to the top of the pillow. The Husband Pillow is also stuffed with shredded memory foam, and like the mittaGonG pillow, it’s not CertiPUR certified.</p>
<h3>X-tra Comfort Bed Wedge</h3>
<p>The bed wedge is popular with people who suffer chronic back pain, since its wedge shape promotes a completely upright posture and spine alignment. However, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U6HMK78//tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">X-tra Comfort</a> bed wedge is a misnomer, since it was the most uncomfortable of the pillows we tested. The bed wedge is designed solely for the bed; on the couch it was like leaning against a wood plank.</p>
<p>The X-tra Comfort wedge is made of two extra-stiff pieces of memory foam (not shredded, not CertiPUR), covered in a cheap-feeling velour case. The large wedge is intended for back support; the purpose for the smaller wedge is a mystery. The company’s website shows photos of placing the wedges under the model’s knees. We tried it, but elevating legs and feet as illustrated put strain on the lower back.</p>
<p>It’s also suggested that the wedge can be used as a sleeping pillow. Perhaps, if you enjoy sleeping on a rock. There are a number of bed wedges on the market, so pass this one by.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you love reading in bed, binging on Netflix or just lounging around on a lazy Sunday morning, you might be bolstering yourself up with extra pillows, which can strain your back muscles and neck.</p>
<p>We selected the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073DJFYB1/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Linenspa</a> as the best sit-up pillow for providing full-back support and cushy comfort. Its extra-long and extra-wide armrests support your entire arm rather than just the elbow, and it’s the only pillow we tested that was so plush we never wanted to get up. The Linenspa is well made with quality fabric and strong stitching, and at $50 for the extra-large size you’re definitely getting your money’s worth.</p>
<p>We also liked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0733ZCSR9/?tag=ybdsitpil" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Milliard</a> reading pillow, which feels soft and floppy but gives excellent support to the middle- and lower-back muscles. The standard size is too small for a tall person, and though its extra-large size is $10 more than the Linenspa, it&#8217;s also a great option for providing full back support in bed or on the couch.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After months of snoozing on the top mattress toppers on the market, we've found that the HOFISH - Gel Infused Memory Foam can't be beat for comfort, cushioning and spinal support. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter hours of research and discussions with sleep experts — plus several months of hands-on testing — we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072FQKJFN/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HOFISH &#8211; Gel Infused Memory Foam</a> as the best mattress topper.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>To narrow down our list of contenders, we researched the different types of mattress toppers and delved into which features would be the most important to consider when choosing a mattress topper. Then we conferred with industry experts about how a mattress topper can aid sleep. Once we had a good understanding of the market and what to look for, we narrowed down our finalists to those that were highly praised by online reviewers.</p>
<p>We considered several types of mattress toppers: gel-infused memory foam, latex and feather fill (down alternative). We steered away from down feather and wool mattress toppers due to low consumer interest. Plus, while true feather allergies are rare, they do exist. This was another reason to skip testing down altogether.</p>
<p>We spoke with Bill Fish, co-founder of Tuck.com and a certified sleep science coach. An entrepreneur for over 15 years, Bill became fascinated with the health aspects of sleep in 2014. Bill has designed and constructed mattresses for sale online, and in doing so, he has gained an understanding of the needs of consumers from the viewpoint of both seller and buyer.</p>
<p>We also consulted with Brian Wilson, founder and president of <a href="http://catalystptandwellness.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Catalyst Physical Therapy and Wellness</a> to discuss proper sleep positioning as it relates to choosing a mattress topper. As he notes: “From an orthopedic standpoint, a person’s ideal sleeping posture should preserve the natural curvatures of the spine. Choosing a mattress must factor in the position they tend to sleep in and any underlying conditions that affect their spine.”</p>
<p>Brian holds a master’s degree in Physical Therapy from Rockhurst University and has 12 years of professional experience as a physical therapist. In addition to owning his own practice, Brian has taught at Point Loma Nazarene University in the Masters of Kinesiology program.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs a mattress topper?</h2>
<p>We asked our sleep specialist, Bill Fish, who would benefit from a mattress topper. He said that “if you want to revitalize a mattress that hasn’t reached its lifespan, you may be able to do so at a fraction of the cost by adding a mattress topper. Typically a mattress topper is utilized to soften the present mattress or to add a cooling feature.”</p>
<p>It’s important to note that if your mattress has become unsupportive, meaning that your spine is not in proper alignment while you sleep, you would be better off spending your money on a new mattress rather than trying to improve an old one with a mattress topper. The <a href="https://sleepfoundation.org/bedroom/touch.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Sleep Foundation</a> recommends replacing your mattress every seven to 10 years.</p>
<p>Another instance where a mattress topper can benefit you is in adjusting the comfort of a new mattress. <a href="https://www.rti.org/sites/default/files/resources/rr-0016-1108-hogan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research shows</a> that it is difficult to predict your optimal mattress from a “test drive” in a showroom. If you bought a mattress that is too firm, for instance, a mattress topper can cushion your joints and help you sleep better.</p>
<h3>The difference between a mattress topper and mattress pad</h3>
<p>While the terms mattress topper and mattress pad are sometimes used interchangeably by consumers and retailers, there are important differences between the two. Mattress pads keep contaminants such as dust mites and bacteria off your sleep surface. They protect your mattress rather than enhance your comfort level while sleeping. On the other hand, a mattress topper can provide additional support and improve the softness and comfort of a mattress. Toppers do little to inhibit contaminants or provide protection against stains.</p>
<h3>Mattress topper for back pain</h3>
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to choosing a mattress topper to alleviate back pain. However, most individuals benefit from maintaining a neutral spine (or as close to this as possible) during sleep.</p>
<p>An appropriate mattress topper makes sleeping in proper positions easier and more comfortable. Your sleeping surface and a correct posture should alleviate pressure at the hips, shoulders and other bony areas. This results in less stress on the back, less pain and a more restful night’s sleep.</p>
<p>Ashley Little from <a href="https://www.mattressadvisor.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mattress Advisor</a> summarizes, “Medium-firm to firm memory foam material toppers are the best for preventing back pain — specifically memory foam because of its ability to evenly distribute your body weight.” Latex also conforms closely to the sleeper’s body, which can strike the right balance between improved spinal alignment and pressure relief. The right mix of firm support and comfortable feel will be determined by your own personal preferences.</p>
<p>Wilson outlines some considerations for choosing a mattress topper based on the position in which you sleep:</p>
<p><b>Lying on your back (supine position): </b>This position is often recommended because your weight is distributed throughout the largest possible surface area. This prevents areas of increased pressure and helps maintain a neutral spine (with a few modifications). Too soft of a mattress can be detrimental in the supine sleeper as the pelvis may roll backward. This causes a flattening of the lumbar curve and forces more pressure across the anterior portion of the intervertebral discs. A firm to medium-firm mattress topper and a pillow placed under the knees helps maintain a neutral spine.</p>
<p><b>Lying on your stomach (prone position): </b>This position is generally considered to be hard on both the low back and the neck. Both may be overarched, while the neck is also rotated or twisted to one side. These issues can be minimized with effective positioning. A pillow placed under the hips helps alleviate stress on the low back while sleeping without a pillow at the head/neck reduces extension there.</p>
<p><b>Lying on your side: </b>Lying in this position can be great for many people, but often takes some adjustments in order to properly align the spine. A few extra pillows often solve this problem. A pillow between the legs allows one leg to rest on top of the other without tilting the hips, rotating the spine or causing discomfort as the knees rest on one another. A second pillow hugged at the chest prevents rolling forward. Together these adjustments help prevent spinal rotation and allow for a more neutral spine position with less stress throughout the back.</p>
<p>Leslie Fisher, founder of <a href="http://sustainableslumber.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sustainable Slumber</a>, adds: “If you sleep on your side, your shoulder and hip bone jut out. Those parts of your body should sink into the topper, keeping your spine aligned. Therefore, a side sleeper is going to need a very plush topper.”</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Firmness:</b> In the mattress industry, <a href="https://www.thesleepjudge.com/understanding-indentation-load-deflection-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firmness is measured</a> by Indentation Load Deflection (ILD). The ILD is measured by compressing a foam sample to 25 percent of its original height. The amount of force (in pounds) required to indent the foam is its 25-percent ILD measurement. The more force required, the firmer the foam. A mattress topper having an ILD of 12 would be very soft, while an ILD of 50 would be very firm.</p>
<p><b>Density:</b> The quality of density is a verifiable, scientific measurement. It is a measurement of the mass per unit volume. A soft latex has a density of two pounds, while a very firm latex would measure at six pounds.</p>
<p>Drew Kalinksi, E-commerce manager at <a href="http://www.ayercomfort.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ayer Comfort</a>, reports that: “Density in memory foam tells you how much you will sink into the foam and the quality of it. Memory foam gets more expensive depending on the density of the foam. Most memory foam mattress toppers will range from 2 to 6 pounds in density; 3 pounds is a common density due to the fact it is suitable for most people.”</p>
<p>A softer density can give you pressure relief and help ease joint stiffness, while a firmer density helps give stable support for the spine. Read on for a quick rundown of the main densities in memory foam, according to Kalinski, to help you make a better purchase decision.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3 pounds per cubic feet or less:</strong> Your body will sink into the topper a little more than it would with higher-density memory foam. This density is recommended for anyone under 200 pounds. It offers enough support and comfort for most people and is one of the most common densities.</li>
<li><strong>4 to 5 pounds per cubic feet:</strong> This density is a good balance between soft and supportive. It will mold to your body a little more slowly than lower densities. But, it’s perfect for people who are over 200 pounds, and it’s also great for couples.</li>
<li><strong>6 pounds per cubic feet or more:</strong> Most people won’t require this level of firmness unless they have medical needs. This is a rarer and more expensive foam, with a density so firm that it is often used as a base in mattresses.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Recovery time:</b> The most famous feature of memory foam, one that earned it its moniker, is its ability to mold to the shape of your body and then return to its original shape. Some foams bounce back more quickly than others. The pressure and weight applied by your body will leave an indentation in a memory foam mattress topper — how long it takes to bounce back varies from seconds to minutes.</p>
<p>When you move into a new position (the average person changes sleeping positions a dozen times per night), you don’t want to be left unsupported by a deep indentation. A thicker high-density topper will take longer to bounce back. In our testing, the memory foam toppers with a faster recovery were springier and more comfortable to sleep on.</p>
<p><b>Cooling: </b>Latex mattress toppers tend to run cooler than memory foam, although gel-infused mattresses have greater air flow and a cooling component<b>. </b>Down alternative toppers have a tendency to run hot.</p>
<p><b>Motion isolation:</b> Memory foam and latex tend to absorb motion and isolate it to certain areas of the mattress, which could be important if you have a partner that tosses and turns during the night. Conversely, feather fill mattress toppers do not offer this benefit to any noticeable degree.</p>
<p><b>Durability:</b> With some mattress toppers costing upwards of $100, it should be expected that your topper will have a long life span. Latex and memory foam toppers tend to be more durable, while down alternative toppers have a shorter lifespan.</p>
<p><b>Machine washable:</b> Mattress toppers are rarely machine washable, and spot cleaning may put unnecessary wear and tear on them. Toppers with machine washable covers can make your investment last longer, which is especially important if you’re purchasing an expensive topper.</p>
<p><b>Green certifications: </b>Assurance that your mattress topper is free from harmful chemicals can help you sleep better at night. The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) is the worldwide leading textile processing standard for organic fibers and you can be confident that any GOTS-certified products meet their rigorous standards.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Global Organic Latex Standard (GOLS) is highly regarded in the sleep industry. A product must contain more than 95-percent certified organic raw material to achieve GOLS certification.</p>
<p>You can limit your exposure to chemicals by finding one containing foam certified by CertiPUR-US, which independently tests and verifies which foams are made without harmful chemicals.</p>
<h2 id="different-types">Different types of mattress toppers</h2>
<p>E-commerce manager Drew Kalinski and sleep specialist Bill Tuck gave us insight into the pros and cons of the various types of mattress toppers we tested.</p>
<h3>Memory foam</h3>
<p>Memory foam is one of the most popular materials for both mattresses and mattress toppers these days. A high-end memory foam mattress can be very expensive, so a topper is a good way to get the benefits of memory foam without breaking the bank.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Memory foam conforms to your body, giving support and comfort.</li>
<li>It’s supportive if you have joint, muscular or back pain.</li>
<li>It reduces how much the noise and movement of a restless partner disturb your sleep.</li>
<li>It comes in a range of densities.</li>
<li>Durable memory foam can last for years (depending on the quality of the foam).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It can have a strong chemical smell, but this should dissipate after a few days.</li>
<li>It can hold heat, so make sure to find one that is open cell or has a cooling feature (such as gel-infused memory foam).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Latex</h3>
<p>Latex mattress toppers are generally the most expensive option but they provide excellent support and comfort. Latex is made from the rubber tree (hevea brasiliensis). The sap is collected and processed into latex, using one of two different processes: Dunlop or Talalay.</p>
<p><b>Dunlop latex:</b> The normal measurement for Dunlop latex is density and it is a firmer foam. Dunlop latex can be either natural or synthetic.</p>
<p><b>Talalay latex:</b> The normal unit for measuring Talalay latex is ILD and it is a softer foam. To achieve this, the latex is blended with synthetics and air is added. There is no such thing as 100-percent natural Talalay.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It provides comfort and pain relief by making your sleep surface firmer or softer.</li>
<li>Latex is springier, bouncier and firmer than memory foam.</li>
<li>It is antimicrobial and hypoallergenic unless you have a latex allergy.</li>
<li>Latex is very durable.</li>
<li>It is excellent at preventing motion transfer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Latex tends to be more expensive than other mattress toppers.</li>
<li>It is not recommended for anyone with a latex allergy; prolonged exposure to latex can lead to the development of a latex allergy. The amount of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-113/default.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latex exposure needed to produce sensitization</a> or an allergic reaction is unknown. Exposure to synthetic latex does not cause the symptoms of latex allergy.</li>
<li>It can get hot, especially in the summer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Down alternative</h3>
<p>A down alternative topper is a good option for those who put a strong emphasis on value, as it can improve the comfort of most sleep surfaces at a lower price point than most memory foam or latex mattress toppers. Down alternative toppers also have no or minimal odor, even when first unboxed, so they’re a great choice for those sensitive to smell.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Down alternative tends to be the most affordable option.</li>
<li>It is hypoallergenic and generally will not cause allergies to flare up.</li>
<li>It can provide decent to good support and pressure relief.</li>
<li>Down alternative toppers often weigh less than latex or memory foam toppers, so they are easier to move.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Below-average durability: it can become flat or misshapen after only a short time.</li>
<li>If you share a mattress, the poor motion isolation could be an issue.</li>
<li>Typically, down alternative toppers run hotter than latex or memory foam.</li>
<li>Down alternative toppers have limited thickness and are generally limited to two inches or less.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We put our finalists through a range of tests, both quantitative and qualitative, do determine the standout winners.</p>
<h3>TEST RESULTS</h3>
[table id=210 /]
<h3>Recovery time test</h3>
<p>We tested our memory foam toppers for recovery time to see how well they absorb compression forces and therefore aid with pressure relief. To determine how long each topper took to return to its original shape after being weighed down, we set a five-pound dumbbell in the middle of each mattress for an hour (similar to the amount of time between changing sleep positions). Then we removed the weight and used a stopwatch to determine the number of seconds or minutes it took to return to the original shape.</p>
<p>The HOFISH sprung back to shape in a matter of seconds, while the Linenspa took nearly a full minute. A difference of 35 seconds seems small, but the HOFISH was noticeably more comfortable to sleep on than the Linenspa and the numbers were in line with our overall opinion and ratings of these toppers.</p>
<h3>Overnight test</h3>
<p>Since a good night’s sleep is a ringing endorsement of a mattress topper, we slept on each mattress topper for several consecutive nights. We used two testers: one under 160 pounds (at which point firmer support is recommended) and one over 160 pounds. This variation was helpful to rate the perceived firmness of each topper, as well as to evaluate the toppers for motion isolation.</p>
<p>As the CEO and founder of Spine-health, Stephanie Burke, points out, “There is a difference between firm support and firm feel.” Looking at the density or ILD of a mattress topper can tell you how supportive it is, but not how firm it feels. Our two testers rated each topper on a scale of one to five, with five being the most firm. When evaluating, they considered whether the topper seemed to cushion joints or provide better spine support.</p>
<p>Despite weight differences, our testers agreed on the firmness and softness of our finalists. While we chose a medium-firm level for these two latex toppers, the Organic Textiles and Dreamfoam Bedding felt the most supportive of the toppers we tested. The HOFISH, Sleep On Latex and The Duck And Goose Co balance firmness and softness, although they may not have enough spine support for someone with back issues.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for more joint cushioning, the ViscoSoft &#8211; 4-Inch Memory Foam or Cheer Collection &#8211; Luxury Down Alternative were rated softest.</p>
<p>Our testers used a similar scale to rate each topper for temperature neutrality, judging whether each topper felt cool or retained heat. The Organic Textiles latex could heat up surprisingly quickly at night, so this is something to keep in mind if you tend to run hot or live in a warm climate. It was the most noticeably warm of the toppers we tested, alongside the Cheer Collection.</p>
<p>Memory foam by itself tends to retain heat, but the gel-infused HOFISH and ViscoSoft were our coolest mattress toppers. If staying cool helps you sleep better, you may also want to add a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-cooling-pillow/" rel="noopener">cooling pillow</a> to your <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-sleep-mask/">sleeping sanctuary</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, our testers evaluated each topper on how much you can feel movement when a partner moves and whether their tossing and turning would keep you up at night. Once again, our memory foam toppers were the top contenders here, especially the HOFISH and Linenspa. The pillow top cover of the ViscoSoft lowered its rating and for similar reasons, the down alternative toppers were low on our list.</p>
<h3>Aesthetics and usability</h3>
<p>Although perhaps less important than comfort and support, function and design are also important considerations when choosing a mattress topper. When testing our mattress toppers, we kept aesthetics and usability in mind as well. We evaluated our toppers for visual design, noting how they looked and fit after putting on a fitted sheet.</p>
<p>We checked to see how well each topper fit on the bed (since toppers are slightly smaller than mattresses) and sat on the edge of the bed to check for edge support around the perimeter. While each of the toppers provided support for the full surface of the mattress, some of the more plush toppers such as the Sleep On Latex and ViscoSoft tended to be wobbly near the edge.</p>
<p>We considered slippage, noting whether or not a topper slips from the mattress when tossing and turning. While a regular fitted sheet worked fine for the down alternative toppers, you may want to size up to a deep pocket fitted sheet for use with thicker memory foam or latex topper, especially the 4-inch ViscoSoft. The fitted sheet would ride up after a night’s sleep on each of our memory foam and latex toppers, despite seeming to fit well when not in use.</p>
<h3>Durability</h3>
<p>While we didn’t conduct a durability test per se, the process of moving, testing and storing the toppers when not in use put some strain on them. The latex and down alternative toppers held up well, but the memory foam toppers suffered some rips and tears. Of the memory foam toppers, the HOFISH was the most durable. The Linenspa, being thinner than its counterparts, tore all the way through in areas and was relatively flimsy.</p>
<p>Our experience is likely not indicative of normal wear and tear since our testing process stretched the toppers to their limits and typically people keep a mattress topper confined to one bed. However, we verified through consumer reviews that the Linenspa does, in fact, tear easily.</p>

<h3>Off-gassing test</h3>
<p>What is off-gassing and do you need to worry about it? <a href="https://www.amerisleep.com/memory-foam-mattress-off-gassing-temporary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Off-gassing</a> is a reaction caused when volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a memory foam topper break apart and commonly form gases. The majority of VOCs are released in the first hour (after opening the box) but can continue to release for an unknown period of time. Some people are sensitive to VOCs and can experience irritation of the eyes, nose or throat.</p>
<p>No studies show long-term effects of using memory foam, but this may be because tracking its long-term effects is virtually impossible. Heather Stapleton, an environmental chemist at Duke University, says there’s simply not enough data to determine whether low levels of these chemicals will eventually make people sick. If you’re concerned, organic latex may be a better option for you.</p>
<p>While some in the industry recommend unboxing a mattress or topper outside and letting it breathe for at least two days, we didn’t want to expose our toppers to the elements, so we kept them in a well-ventilated room next to a window.</p>
<p>Since off-gassing can be particularly unpleasant, we rated our toppers for odor straight out of the package. Immediately after unpackaging, we used a scale of one to five (five being the most unpleasant odor) to see which toppers may not be good for those sensitive to smell. We let each topper air out for 48 hours and then rated them a second time.</p>
<p>The good news is that any lingering smell dissipated within a week for all the memory foam toppers we tested, and the HOFISH and ViscoSoft were not overly pungent even fresh from the package.</p>

<p>We liked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072FQKJFN/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HOFISH &#8211; Gel Infused Memory Foam</a> for being a topper that is best for a couple since its medium-firm support and the right amount of cushion offers a comfortable middle ground for most people. The feature we liked most about the HOFISH was its springiness, which made it feel more like latex than memory foam. However, it is gel-infused so it doesn’t run hot the way latex and typical memory foam does.</p>
<p>It’s also excellent at motion isolation, meaning you won’t wake up every time your partner rolls over. It’s especially a good choice for couples because of its ability to absorb motion and because it strikes the right balance between soft and supportive.</p>
<p>That said, it may not work if either one of the pair has back pain or is a back/stomach sleeper. It is a low-density foam, meaning it is more soft than supportive. While we felt it had a good balance for most people, side sleepers may appreciate this topper more than others.</p>

<p>The topper arrives compressed in a box so it looks thin and uneven when you first remove the shrink wrap plastic. Don’t let the first impressions fool you: it was in its full shape after a few hours.</p>
<p>The topper is environmentally safe and CertiPUR-US certified, so there are no dangerous chemicals and fewer worries about off-gassing. This was notable when we first opened the package, as it had less odor than other memory foam finalists. The smell also seemed to dissipate more quickly.</p>
<p>At 15 pounds, it is a medium weight compared to our other memory foam toppers and easy for one person to position on the bed. The foam has a slightly sticky feeling so it didn’t shift on the bed, but did need a fitted sheet in order to feel comfortable.</p>

<p>It lined up well with our queen size bed and it was easy to fit with a sheet. However, the fitted sheet rolled off our mattress and fitted onto the topper itself after a night’s sleep. It isn’t an issue for sleep, but isn’t as aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>Both our testers commented on the coolness and motion isolation of this topper, which are its best features after the obvious benefit of adding softness to a current mattress. After several months of testing, it held up better than our other memory foam finalists, but it still had the drawback of small tears (mostly caused by transportation).</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The HOFISH &#8211; Gel Infused Memory Foam is great for side sleepers, as it responds to the shape of your body and takes the pressure off your hips and shoulders.</li>
<li>The memory foam is infused with gel and its open cell construction makes it more breathable, so it is great for hot sleepers or those in warm climates.</li>
<li>All the foam in the topper is CertiPUR-US certified, so you can worry less about emissions and more about getting a great night of sleep.</li>
<li>At less than$100 (upon publishing), it has great value and held up better to testing than our other memory foam finalists.</li>

It has firmer support than the majority of toppers we tested, and just enough cushion. The Organic Textiles is excellent for those with back pain, as it is firm enough to assist in achieving a neutral spine while providing enough cushion for the tailbone and shoulders.</p>
<p>The latex is made with the Dunlop process, so it is dense, durable and able to retain its elasticity. The Organic Textiles is Global Organic Latex Standard certified and is free from harmful chemicals and fillers. It has a higher-than-average price point, but it wasn’t the most expensive latex topper we tested. Due to the longevity of latex and the quality of the product, we felt it was worth the price.</p>
<p>In our months of testing, the Organic Textiles held up well to multiple nights of use and storage/transportation. This is partly thanks to the cover, which kept it clean and made it easier to move and position. At 34 pounds, the topper isn’t easy to move around but we were still able to unbox and position it without a second pair of hands.</p>

<p>Like our memory foam finalist, it arrived vacuum sealed in plastic within a box. The Organic Textiles took on its correct shape almost immediately. It was amazing to watch it fill out in a matter of minutes, without leaving behind any ripples or wrinkles. After we placed it on the bed, it lay flat against the mattress with no gaps.</p>
<p>The square edges met up perfectly with our queen size bed, so once we fitted it with a sheet, it had a uniform look. The sheet didn’t stay overnight, but rolled up under the topper, as it did with our other latex and memory foam finalists. The cover has an embossed flower pattern, and while it didn’t show through our fitted sheet, one tester mentioned that it feels almost quilted.</p>

It strikes the right balance between soft and supportive, with more spine support than other finalists.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003ZZPF8O/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>As a dense topper, it does tend to heat up while sleeping despite a porous surface designed for more air flow. If you run hot, this may not be the best choice for you. Our testers noted that on warm nights, it could get a bit sweaty in the middle of the night and the buttery smell of the latex is stronger.</p>
<p>The mattress topper we tested is medium-density, with an ILD of 26-28. You can also tailor your topper by choosing soft (22-24 ILD) or firm (38-40 ILD) when you order through the company’s website. When you purchase through Amazon, it comes with a removable organic cotton cover, which is machine washable in cold water. On the company website, the toppers cost an additional $99.00.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Dunlop latex makes the Organic Textiles &#8211; Organic Latex Topper a dense and firm topper, so it is excellent for those with back pain who need to maintain a neutral spine.</li>
<li>It provides just enough cushion for joints, but it may be too firm for a side sleeper.</li>
<li>It is GOLS-certified, so it is free from chemical additives and made from all-natural components.</li>
<li>As a dense and durable topper with a washable organic cotton cover, this topper should have enough longevity to justify the higher price point.</li>
</ul>

<p>While <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07547DNWG/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Duck And Goose Co &#8211; Down Alternative</a> (and fiber toppers in general) doesn’t offer as much support as foam or latex toppers, it also does not sink too deeply or conform too closely. This makes it ideal for sleepers of any position, and also for couples who may have different weights and needs. While it can accommodate back, stomach and side sleepers, it is better for adding softness to a too-firm mattress than adding additional support.</p>
<p>Of the down alternative toppers we tested, The Duck And Goose Co was the plushest, temperature-neutral and comfortable. It is filled with 1400 GSM (grams per square meter) microfiber. A higher GSM (above 600) means the filling is denser, making the topper thicker, fluffier and more comfortable.</p>
<p>It arrived in a plastic storage bag, similar to a comforter, and is lightweight and easy to position. Anchor bands help it stay in place and it didn’t move around on us during testing. Because it is lightweight and the bag is so convenient, we were able to remove it each morning and store it in the bag during the day. This kind of flexibility and ease of use was unique to The Duck and Goose Co topper.</p>

Since sleepers of any position will find this topper comfortable, it is a great option for couples with different sleeping positions.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07547DNWG/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>It has a baffle box construction, so the fill doesn’t shift and become lumpy during use or after it’s washed. Unlike its competitors that we tested, the boxes aren’t bulbous but rather filled uniformly. This gave it a thicker construction and more support overall than other down alternative toppers.</p>
<p>Due to the baffle box construction and round edges, it doesn’t look as uniform when fitted with a sheet; it looks like you have a pillow top on your mattress. On the other hand, the same reasons mean that our fitted sheet stayed in place after a night of sleep, unlike the memory foam and latex finalists.</p>
<p>As a down alternative topper, The Duck And Goose Co is hypoallergenic and acts as a barrier against dust and mites. While these toppers tend to sleep hot, the channel-weave construction of The Duck and Goose Co makes it breathable and therefore cooler than its counterparts.</p>
<p>While machine washing a down alternative topper can sometimes cause it to wear out early, The Duck And Goose Co is backed by a ten-year warranty — you can clean it to your heart’s content (which helps keep it hygienic).</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Duck And Goose Co &#8211; Down Alternative offers more softness than support, but can still be used by back and stomach sleepers as it doesn’t conform too closely.</li>
<li>With a heavyweight of fill, this topper is more dense, plush and comfortable than other down alternative toppers.</li>
<li>While similar toppers can heat up quickly, The Duck And Goose Co is breathable and temperature-neutral.</li>
<li>It is easy to care for and covered by a ten-year warranty, so you don’t have to worry about it breaking down in the washing machine.</li>

<p>We strongly considered naming the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075MQTB3W/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ViscoSoft &#8211; 4-Inch Memory Foam</a> as our luxury upgrade pick because it has so many nice features, but it offers very little in the way of support. The combination of low-density foam with a pillow top cover makes this topper sumptuously soft. If you’re a side sleeper and you’re looking to cushion your shoulders, hips and other joints, this would be a good option. Those who sleep on their backs or stomachs may want to steer away from the ViscoSoft.</p>
<p>If softness is your aim, then you will appreciate the 300-thread count sateen cotton cover, fluffy down alternative filling and gel-infused memory foam. With four inches total of padding added to your mattress, your joints have never been more cushioned. You can also sleep comfortably knowing the foam is CertiPUR-US and you don’t have to worry about off-gassing.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UYGA49M/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sleep On Latex &#8211; Pure Green Natural Latex</a> is another topper that is ideal for side sleepers since it cushions joints such as hips and shoulders that may otherwise feel too much pressure. It would likely not be a good choice for a back or stomach sleeper since you sink so deeply into the topper. They do offer medium and firm versions of the product, although we didn’t test these.</p>
<p>This is a very heavy topper, weighing in at 34 pounds, and the combination of holes and weight can make it difficult to maneuver. However, the holes added enough airflow to make this topper cooler at night than other latex toppers.</p>
<p>It is made with the Dunlop process, meaning it is dense while still springy. This particular topper was bouncier than our other Dunlop latex topper and did not do a great job at absorbing and isolating movement. Overall, it offered a cloud-like sleeping experience that side sleepers would appreciate.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EK0FJDY/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dreamfoam Bedding &#8211; Ultimate Dreams Talalay</a> is made with Talalay latex, which is distinguished by a lighter, more breathable and supple consistency. With a 28 ILD, it is softer and more cushiony than our top pick for latex, but still firm enough for back and stomach sleepers.</p>
<p>While the feel of the topper is soft, supportive and accommodating to any sleep position, it pulled upward and away from the mattress at the edges. It also slid off the mattress after a few consecutive nights of sleep. For this reason, we decided not to name it our top pick.</p>
<p>It comes with a machine washable cover, so while it is the most expensive topper we tested, your investment is protected against stains, wear and tear.</p>
<h3>Cheer Collection &#8211; Luxury Down Alternative</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ASB1DS8/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cheer Collection &#8211; Luxury Down Alternative</a> doesn’t offer much in the way of spine support, but it does provide softness without sinking too deeply. If you’re looking to cushion your joints and improve your bed without a large investment, the Cheer Collection is a good choice. If you have back pain and need a firm surface, you should probably look elsewhere.</p>
<p>This topper is heavy and thick, so it doesn’t shift during the night. It has a baffle box construction so the filling doesn’t shift either, but they are almost overfilled so that it has a textured look and feels like small pillows sewn together. Those with joint pain would be best served by this topper.</p>
<h3>Sertapedic &#8211; Superior Loft Down</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-19235 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sertapedic-Superior-sm.jpg" alt="Sertapedic mattress topper installed on bed" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sertapedic-Superior-sm-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sertapedic-Superior-sm-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sertapedic-Superior-sm-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sertapedic-Superior-sm-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sertapedic-Superior-sm-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sertapedic-Superior-sm-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sertapedic-Superior-sm-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sertapedic-Superior-sm-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sertapedic-Superior-sm-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sertapedic-Superior-sm-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sertapedic-Superior-sm-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sertapedic-Superior-sm-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sertapedic-Superior-sm-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sertapedic-Superior-sm-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sertapedic-Superior-sm-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sertapedic-Superior-sm-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sertapedic-Superior-sm-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sertapedic-Superior-sm-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Sertapedic-Superior-Loft-Down-Alternative-Mattress-Pad/22027240" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sertapedic &#8211; Superior Loft Down</a> is a simple and cost-effective solution to make your mattress more supportive and comfortable. It is technically a mattress pad so it offers more protection against contaminants and stains than our other finalists, but it has more thickness than a typical mattress pad and therefore the feel of a pillow top.</p>
<p>The Sertapedic is more cushiony than it is firm, so it would be better for a side sleeper. It doesn’t shift in the middle of the night and doesn’t run hot (which can be a problem for down alternative toppers), so if you’re looking for something basic and budget-friendly, the Sertapedic is a viable option.</p>
<h3>Linenspa &#8211; 2-Inch Gel Memory Foam</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-19232 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Linenspa-sm.jpg" alt="Linenspa mattress topper installed on bed" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Linenspa-sm-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Linenspa-sm-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Linenspa-sm-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Linenspa-sm-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Linenspa-sm-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Linenspa-sm-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Linenspa-sm-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Linenspa-sm-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Linenspa-sm-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Linenspa-sm-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Linenspa-sm-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Linenspa-sm-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Linenspa-sm-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Linenspa-sm-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Linenspa-sm-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Linenspa-sm-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Linenspa-sm-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Linenspa-sm-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MRL0H2B/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Linenspa &#8211; 2-Inch Gel Memory Foam</a> is a low-density foam, so it provides some support but is softer than would be preferable for a back or stomach sleeper. It had the longest recovery time of the memory foam mattresses we tested, meaning that it has very little bounce, but it was excellent at absorbing motion.</p>
<p>Most of the queen size mattress toppers we tested measured 60 x 80 inches, but the Linenspa is slightly smaller all around at 59 x 79 inches. This gives it a little less support at the edges and meant that it didn’t line up as well as the other finalists on our mattress.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that this topper had a stronger smell than our other finalists and suffered from large tears when moved, rolled and stored, we wouldn’t recommend it for most people. If your priorities are to purchase an inexpensive topper with more softness than support and you desire a gel-infused memory foam to keep you cool at night, the Linenspa would meet your needs.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Choosing the best mattress topper really depends on the position in which you sleep, whether you share a bed and if you want to add softness or support to your mattress. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072FQKJFN/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HOFISH &#8211; Gel Infused Memory Foam</a> is a good option for side sleepers who share a bed. It has an excellent price point, making it available to most consumers. The HOFISH is best if you’re looking to add a cooling feature to your present mattress or to make it softer. If you sleep on your back or stomach, this memory foam probably won’t provide enough support.</p>
<p>If you can afford a luxury upgrade or are a back/stomach sleeper looking for more support, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003ZZPF8O/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Organic Textiles &#8211; Organic Latex Topper</a>. It does run hot at night, however, and may be more than you’re willing to spend to fix your current mattress. We also wouldn’t recommend it for side sleepers, since it doesn’t cushion the joints as much as other toppers.</p>
<p>For those looking for a down alternative option, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07547DNWG/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Duck And Goose Co &#8211; Down Alternative</a> is a quality topper that provides both softness and support. It offers a good middle ground to those seeking a topper that is soft but not overly so, and we love that it’s machine washable. Since it does go through the washing machine, this topper may not last as long as our other top picks.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>attresses seem to get all the love, but pillows can make or break a good night&#8217;s sleep. After testing six low- to mid-priced pillows that had popular and authenticated market approval, we found that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K8WVD7M/ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nest Bedding &#8211; Easy Breather</a> is the best cooling pillow for its shape, quality, pliability and lack of offensive odors. Some of our testers equated it to “sleeping on a cloud.&#8221; Our budget cooling-pillow pick is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758H3V9D/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sleep Restoration &#8211; 1800 Series Gel Pillow</a>, which comes in packs of two and is a soft, moldable pillow that is versatile enough for any sleep position: side, back or stomach.</p>

<p>There are a lot of pillows on the market, and the descriptive terms given to many pillows can seem bewildering to a consumer. Adjectives like cooling, comforting, relaxing, breathable and “iso” do little to convey the actual performance or specific attributes of a pillow.</p>
<p>We dug through Reddit, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1/135-8935156-4169656?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=cooling+pillows" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> and consumer testing sites to cull a large list of available pillows on the market. We found that there are three pricing tiers for pillows that denote “cooling” benefits: These fall around $30-$40 at the lower range, $80-$100 at midrange and up to $150 at the very high range. Since very few of the pillows in the highest range had enough verifiable consumer reviews, we narrowed our focus on the low range, along with one pillow from the middle tier.</p>
<p>We further looked at which pillows were preferred for sleepers who identified themselves as back, stomach and side sleepers to ensure that we included the full range. For our four-person test group, we included sleepers who preferred at least one of these three positions for a significant portion of the night.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs-one">Who needs one?</h2>
<h3>Good pillows mean good sleep</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://sleepfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Sleep Foundation</a> maintains a database of sleep habits and preferences throughout the U.S. and is an excellent resource for learning about the fundamentals of getting a good night’s sleep. In a recent National Sleep Foundation poll, 93% of respondents rated the quality of their pillow and mattress as being important to sleeping well.</p>
<p>In his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1452037752/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Sleep for Success!</i></a>, Cornell University professor Dr. James Mass describes how sleep is an essential component for academic and physical performance. He notes that a lack of sleep correlates with many debilitating conditions, including depression, obesity, skin conditions, cancer and the lack of ability to think and perform well. So what’s the trick to a solid night’s sleep? A good <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-sleep-mask/" rel="noopener">sleep mask</a> or <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-white-noise-machine/" rel="noopener">white noise machine</a> can certainly help, but a more direct “head-on” approach is to find a comfortable pillow.</p>
<p>Few people take their preferred sleep position into account when purchasing a pillow. Relative to the expense of buying a new mattress, a pillow is a far less expensive alternative to rebooting a poor sleep experience. Signs that you may need to change your pillow include feeling overheated during the night and waking up feeling sore or stiff. Changing out your pillow is the first thing you should do to see if it helps you get uninterrupted sleep.</p>
<h3>Cool is better for sleeping</h3>
<p>Some of the tips on the National Sleep Foundation website are surprising. One that jumped out at us was that the ideal bedroom temperature for sleeping is between 60-70 °F, which seems quite a bit cooler than is customary. If staying cool is a major factor in getting good sleep, then having a pillow that keeps you cool seems like a sensible choice for most people.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pillow-squeeze-sm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<h3>Fill material</h3>
<p><b>Down:</b> Down is made from goose or duck feathers and is commonly found in high-end hotel pillows. It offers good neck support and durability. Two drawbacks for down are its relatively high cost and that many people are allergic to it.</p>
<p><b>Bamboo:</b> Bamboo is a natural plant fiber. It’s commonly found in pillows that are advertised as having cooling properties. Beware that many pillows that label themselves as bamboo actually use it only for the casing. Instead, they’re typically filled with shredded memory foam.</p>
<p><b>Memory foam:</b> Memory foam is a support material that is fairly economical and also hypoallergenic. It tends to retain heat and can be too stiff or too squishy for some people.</p>
<p><b>Latex:</b> Latex is a natural material that is good for neck pain and is easy to maintain. However, it is not moldable, has a short lifespan and tends to have an odor.</p>
<p><b>Down alternatives: </b>Down alternatives offer good head and neck support, are not derived from animals and are available at a lower price point than real down. However, synthetic down is less fluffy than regular down and requires more maintenance.</p>
<p><b>Buckwheat: </b>Buckwheat is a plant with grain-like seeds. This type of pillow allows air to circulate between the seeds. The seeds are actually the hulls (outer casings) of the seed pods. Because buckwheat pillows are filled with tiny individual seed hulls, the pillows can easily conform to the shape of an individual’s head and neck.</p>
<h3>Cooling gels</h3>
<p>Some pillows have gels running through the pillows in tubes or small pads. When you take the cover off a gel pillow, you can clearly see which face is the gel side. Other pillows incorporate gel into the fiber for the pillow filling itself.</p>
<h3>Cover material</h3>
<p>Most people use pillows with pillowcases, but some pillow covers are nice enough to use without a pillowcase as long as you wash them regularly. One thing to consider with cooling pillows is the way the pillow will be encased. A pillow will feel less cool if it is swaddled in a thick pillowcase or a decorative sham.</p>
<h3>Design based on sleep position</h3>
<p>Some pillows are designed for people who sleep in one particular position. Pillows with a deep indentation are designed for cervical support and are intended for people who experience chronic neck pain, as we discussed in our review of the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-pillow-for-neck-pain/">best pillow for neck pain</a>. Stomach sleepers will need a much shallower pillow than side sleepers since it is not desirable to have the spine pushed backward. If you sleep on your side, check out our review of the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-pillow-for-side-sleepers/">best pillow for side sleepers</a>.</p>
<h3>Allergies</h3>
<p><b>Allergic sensitivities: </b>Down and latex can trigger allergies for many people, while bamboo is generally a hypoallergenic material.</p>
<p><b>Hypoallergenic: </b>The word “hypoallergenic” is not a scientific term, but a marketing term. Pillows do not actually block allergens, but certain materials, as noted above, are less likely to trigger allergies. For example, there are pillow covers that have pores so small that they block dust mites and other allergens from seeping through.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> You can get a good pillow for anywhere between $30 and $150, and when good pillows go on sale, there are bargains to be had. Based on our testing group and a review of other consumer testing sites, there are many high-quality pillows to choose from in the $40 range.</p>
<h3>Certipur certification</h3>
<p><a href="https://certipur.us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Certipur</a> is a nonprofit organization that tests bedding for the presence of toxins, including ozone, flame retardants, heavy metals, formaldehyde, phthalates and VOCs (volatile organic compounds). The evaluation committee is composed of scientists, academics, environmentalists and consumer advocates. A Certipur certification, in the form of a tag attached to a pillow, is evidence that none of the tested toxins are present.</p>
<h3>Pillowcase</h3>
<p>Any pillow’s comfort and performance will be affected by the type of pillowcase you use. For cooling pillows, heavier pillowcases and shams can negate any cooling or circulation benefit that the pillow has. Most cooling pillow manufacturers recommend you use a waterproof, breathable pillowcase with their products.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pillow-washing-sm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The same technology and fabrics that are found in mattresses are also found in pillows. So in researching the best cooling pillows, it is necessary to cut through a lot of marketing hyperbole to determine what exactly goes into that thing you rest your head on every night.</p>
<p>Whether you are a side, back or stomach sleeper, a good pillow can mean the difference between a great night of sleep and a sweaty, restless struggle to get comfy. The market is flooded with pillows that promise a cool night’s sleep, and the price points vary a lot depending on materials and quality. Some pillows take it a step further and are tailored to sleep style: side (most common), stomach or back.</p>
<p>We focused on pillows that emphasized cooling properties. Actual cooling cannot be imparted by fabric, but the sensation of cooling can be experienced by promoting air circulation or from water. Water imparts a cooling sensation when it evaporates from the skin. Fabrics from companies like Techniche and its <a href="http://www.techniche-intl.com/products/technologies/hyperkewl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyperkewl</a> line are soaked in water, which is released gradually during exertion.</p>
<p>One of our tested pillows, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000ZK5UT6/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sleep Better &#8211; Iso-Cool</a>, uses microscopic beads made from Phase Change Material (PCM) that is purported to have both cooling and heating capabilities. Its manufacturer, Carpenter Co., claims that the material — branded “Outlast Adaptive Comfort” — can adjust to a body’s changing temperature throughout the night.</p>
<p>A panel of three adults and one 12-year-old participated in our qualitative sleep test. The panel consisted of one dedicated side sleeper, one sleeper who uses all three positions (side, back and stomach), one sleeper who primarily side sleeps, and one sleeper who primarily back sleeps.</p>
<h3>Primary test criteria</h3>
<p>To ensure a level playing field in terms of pillow covers, we used a thin, waterproof cover made by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B071P8Q3FD/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mastertex</a>. Our four testers were given all six pillows to use for two nights each, and they were asked to evaluate the pillows based on the following categories.</p>
<p><b>Texture:</b> Texture relates to the feel and tactile properties of the exterior of the pillow (whether it is rough, smooth or in-between), along with how easy it is to feel the filling through the pillow cover. In the world of cooling pillows, there are two prevalent fillings: shredded memory foam and gel-type fillings. For the latter, the pillow can use actual gel or gel fibers.</p>
<p><b>Ability to conform:</b> This is a big determinant of pillow comfort. Some people want a very firm pillow that supports the entire weight of their head, while others want a pillow that can only be described as “squishy” and conforms around their head. Many people also want to make slight adjustments to their pillow to support their neck or chin.</p>
<p><b>Coolness:</b> All of our testers spent several nights with each pillow. Then we asked them questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did the pillow feel cool when you first lay down on it?</li>
<li>If you woke up during the night, did you feel that the pillow was warm, cool or in-between?</li>
<li>Did you feel that the pillow helped you sleep through the night because of its cooling properties?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other test criteria</h3>
<p><b>Support:</b> Support relates to the overall sense of how the pillow props up the head and neck. We measured the resting and compressed height of each pillow, along with each pillow’s width and length. Our testing corroborated other tests in that side sleepers prefer a pillow with more depth than stomach or back sleepers.</p>
<p><b>Firmness:</b> We compressed our pillows under a 10-pound weight to see how firm they were. The more they flattened, the less firm the pillows were. We found that the firmest pillows were best for propping ourselves up and reading in bed. Check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-book-light/">review of the best book light</a> here.</p>
<p><b>Odor:</b> There is a variety of natural and synthetic fabrics that go into pillows, and some of them have quite a pronounced odor. We lived long enough with our test pillows to determine which ones, if any, retained their initial odors and caused off-gassing.</p>
<p><b>Compression</b>: For the compression test, we used a 10-pound barbell resting on a wooden board to apply even pressure on each pillow.</p>
<p>We then tallied the pre-compressed height of the pillow and the height after compression. This gave us a sense of how much each pillow would compress when a person sleeps on it.</p>
<p><b>Heat retention</b>: In order to get a sense of whether a pillow retained heat, we tested with a heating pad applied for three minutes. We took the temperature of the pillow before (baseline temperature) and after applying the heating pad. Then we recorded how long it took for the pillow to return to its original “resting” temperature.</p>
<p><b>Cleanability: </b>Finally, we evaluated how easy it was to clean the pillows and whether it was possible to wash both the cover and the pillow itself. Cleaning pillows thoroughly entail three steps: (1) airing them out in the sun, (2) putting them in the washing machine, and (3) drying them with towels to expedite the drying process. To maintain fluffiness, putting tennis balls in the dryer bin helps.</p>
<p>Manufacturers are quick to note that pillows are hypoallergenic and resistant to dust mites, but all still pillows need to be cleaned to ensure that they perform as advertised for their useful life.</p>
<p>A few of our test pillows, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012BO6S58/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Perfect Cloud &#8211; Double Airflow</a> as well as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072HFY7WZ/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Snuggle-Pedic &#8211; Ultra-Luxury</a> and its twin <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V909F1K/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xtreme Comforts &#8211; Kool-Flow Adjustable</a>, have a removable cover that can be washed separately from the pillow itself.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Nest Bedding &#8211; Easy Breather</h2>

<p>Our overall pick for the best cooling pillow is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K8WVD7M/ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nest Bedding &#8211; Easy Breather</a>. Chosen in part because using it was described like “sleeping on a cloud,” the Nest is light but firm to the touch. It provides a supportive but somewhat moldable form for side breathers and is compressible enough to appeal to back and stomach sleepers as well. Another nice thing about the Nest is that it did not come with any offensive off-gassing odors.</p>
<p>Our testing team’s consensus is that the Nest fills the sweet spot between support and comfort. Why? Well, for one thing, the Nest is unusual in that it is adjustable. The Tencel cover has a small zipper that can be opened to remove some of the pillow’s memory foam fill to create a custom height. We experimented with this and found that it worked perfectly. All it took was a bit of smoothing out to reduce the height of the Nest.</p>
<p>The pillow innards are made from shredded synthetic foam, and the cover is a combination of plant-derived lyocell and polyester. The Certipur-certified foam filling is made without ozone-depleting materials, flame retardants, mercury or lead, all of which can sometimes be found in other synthetic foam products.</p>

We found it remains comfortable through the night, especially for side sleepers.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K8WVD7M/ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Nest scored particularly well for its overall feeling of luxury. Unlike a few of our other pillows, the Nest had no discernible odor. Although it was among the tallest pillows we tested before and after our compression test, the Nest molded nicely to our testers’ heads.</p>
<p>Our testers also thought the Nest felt cool throughout the night, and it returned to its baseline temperature in the midrange of our test group standings. And while the Nest is more expensive than some of our other tested models, its cover feels quite durable, which likely extends its lifespan and justifies the additional cost.</p>
<p>The Nest offers a lifetime warranty that covers the fill, cover and zipper. If the fill sags by an inch or more, if the zipper fails or if there are physical flaws relating to the cover itself, Nest will repair or replace the pillow.</p>
<p>If we had to pick one thing that we did not like about the Nest, it’s that the cover unzips only a little bit to remove the filling for adjustment, and the only way to clean the cover is to remove the filling entirely. For a relatively expensive pillow, we think that the cover should be designed so that it can be cleaned separately without so much hassle.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Nest Bedding &#8211; Easy Breather scored high for feeling luxurious, moldable and not having any odor.</li>
<li>It tied for tallest pillow before and after our compression test.</li>
<li>It falls in the midrange for heat retention, returning to its baseline temperature in just under one-and-a-half minutes.</li>
<li>The pillow feels cool throughout the night and doesn’t sag or require adjustment.</li>
<li>For support and comfort, the Nest hits a sweet spot by offering a nice balance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Gel pillows incorporate liquid that creates an evaporative effect, which in turn promotes air circulation and a consequent cooling effect. The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758H3V9D/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20">Sleep Restoration &#8211; 1800 Series Gusseted Gel Pillow</a> is made with a filling composed of 100% gel fiber. The gel fiber delivered one of the lowest baseline temperatures of all the pillows we tested, coming in at 74 degrees.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758H3V9D/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sleep-restoration-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sleep-restoration-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sleep-restoration-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sleep-restoration-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sleep-restoration-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sleep-restoration-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sleep-restoration-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sleep-restoration-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sleep-restoration.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Budget Pick: Sleep Restoration - 1800 Series Gel</h3><p>For a comfortable, affordable pillow that can accommodate a range of sleep position preferences, we like the Sleep Restoration pillow. It felt plush from the moment our heads hit the pillow.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758H3V9D/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Gel fiber is made to feel like down and offers a plush material that feels luxurious when your head rests on it. Of all our pillows, the Sleep Restoration felt the most comfortable right away. The gel fiber makes for an extremely smooth feeling pillow. Our testers found the pillow to be the plushest in our test group, with one tester calling it “super plush.”</p>
<p>Although the pillow is noted by its manufacturer as being stain resistant, we observed that it picked up smudges pretty quickly. It is also noted as being chemical-free, but this seems like a dubious claim based on the fact that its gel fibers are a manufactured synthetic material.</p>
<p>While the pillow is sealed, it is also breathable and easy to wash by putting the entire pillow in the washing machine. We machine washed the pillow on our EcoWarm cycle and put it in the dryer for 30 minutes, followed by another hour in the sun. Cleaning was fairly hassle-free.</p>
<p>The Sleep Restoration seems like a simple pillow at first, but it provides excellent, comfortable support and is the best option for stomach and back sleepers who need less height from their pillow. The compressed depth for this pillow measured 3-3/8 inches, the lowest in our testing group.</p>
<p>One potential pitfall with the Sleep Restoration is that a number of Amazon reviewers noted that their pillows arrived with mold spots. While these represent a small minority of the nearly 5,000 product reviews, it is something to be aware of.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The gel fiber filling in the Sleep Restoration &#8211; 1800 Series Gusseted Gel Pillow feels luxurious and seems the closest to pillows found in nice hotels.</li>
<li>The pillow does not have a removable cover but can put in a washing machine.</li>
<li>The Sleep Restoration has a low height, which tends to be most comfortable for back and stomach sleepers.</li>
<li>On the downside, in our heat test the Sleep Restoration measured the warmest and took the second longest to return to its baseline temperature.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sleep Better &#8211; Iso-Cool Traditional</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000ZK5UT6/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sleep Better &#8211; Iso-Cool Traditional</a> was the Mercedes Benz of our test group; nice but perhaps a bit overbuilt. None of our testers thought that it was moldable, and some of them thought it was a bit undersized. It did seem to keep cool during the night, and it has a supportive shredded memory foam filling.</p>
<p>The Sleep Better touts its Phase Change Material (PCM) with the brand name “Outlast Adaptive Comfort” that senses changing body temperature. The material is comprised of microscopic beads that are alleged to absorb heat when it senses that the body is too warm, and to perform in the reverse when the body is too cool. The Sleep Better was the least tall of all our pillows, but our testers downgraded it for not feeling especially luxurious.</p>
<p>In appearance, the Sleep Better had the smallest overall dimensions. Its resting depth was five inches, and its compressed depth was three inches. As expected, it rated relatively high with our back and stomach sleepers. But one sleeper who is a part-time stomach sleeper noted that, despite its relatively small size, it was not moldable enough for her liking.</p>
<p>In terms of temperature, the Sleep Better was the poorest performer, taking over two minutes to return to its baseline temperature. Overall, the testers noted its temperature as average for the group.</p>
<h3>Perfect Cloud &#8211; Double Airflow</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012BO6S58/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Perfect Cloud &#8211; Double Airflow</a> is a nicely made pillow; it’s also one of our only finalists that has a fully removable cover that can be washed separately. This pillow is entirely synthetic with a 97% polyester cover and a filling made from 100% polyurethane foam. For at least one of our testers, this pillow struck a perfect balance between comfort and support.</p>
<p>The Perfect Cloud would have scored higher in our overall ratings if it was suitable for cleaning in the washing machine. The instructions recommend spot cleaning only, which seems odd considering the cover is easily removable. In overall design and sense of quality, the Perfect Cloud resembles our top-pick Nest pillow; and despite being almost an inch less in depth, it compressed to the same height when our 10-pound weight was applied.</p>

<h3>Snuggle-Pedic &#8211; Ultra-Luxury</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072HFY7WZ/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Snuggle-Pedic &#8211; Ultra-Luxury Pillow</a> has over 10,000 Amazon reviews that average 4.5/5. It is billed as an “ultra-luxury” pillow and is made with shredded memory foam filling combined with a bamboo cover. It was tied for being the tallest pillow at 6-1/2 inches. It did not perform all that well in our heat retention test, taking nearly a one-and-a-half minutes to return to its baseline temperature. Most of our review panel also agreed the Snuggle-Pedic was not very moldable.</p>
<p>The Snuggle-Pedic was one of our “double-identity” pillows — exactly the same as our Xtreme Comforts pillow. Both pillows had a sour odor that did not completely dissipate even after several days. On the upside, the Snuggle-Pedic cover can be taken off to wash separately.</p>
<h3>Xtreme Comforts &#8211; Kool-Flow Adjustable</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V909F1K/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xtreme Comforts &#8211; Kool-Flow Adjustable Thickness Pillow</a> is identical to the Snuggle-Pedic except for the labeling. Although the bamboo cover and memory foam materials of the pillow are exactly the same, the two pillows appear to be more fraternal than identical twins: The Xtreme comforts pillow was not quite as tall and performed a tad better in our heat retention test.</p>
<p>Our stomach and back sleepers noted that both of these pillows seemed too high and not suited to any position except side sleeping.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>For an overall outstanding pillow that exudes quality and combines a high level of finish, support and comfort, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K8WVD7M/ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nest Bedding &#8211; Easy Breather</a> is our pick for the best overall cooling pillow. Along with the Perfect Cloud, the Nest exuded quality, especially in its brocaded cover. One thing to note is that the cover unzips only part way and is not intended to be removed and washed.</p>
<p>After testing our pillows, we concurred with the saying that there is no “best pillow” but rather a “best pillow for you.” Within our test group, there was a lot of discrepancy among reviewers. For example, with the Perfect Cloud’s pillow, there was one reviewer who rated it as their favorite and another who rated it their least favorite.</p>
<p>We were surprised to find that two of our pillows were exactly the same but branded differently: the Snuggle-Pedic and Xtreme Comforts. When shopping, it’s prudent to look at the exact specifications, including the measurements and materials, to make sure that you know what you are getting.</p>
<p>For an outstanding budget pick, we like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758H3V9D/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sleep Restoration &#8211; 1800 Series Gusseted Gel</a> product. Two pillows come in each package, which is generally available for about $70. The Sleep Restoration pillows are similar to hotel pillows — smooth, plush and pleasantly cool throughout the night.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, a search for “sleep mask” yields a staggering number of results on Amazon. So, we started by filtering out masks with under four stars and less than several hundred reviews.</p>
<p>To further separate the wheat from the chaff, we took to forums like Mark’s Daily Apple (a health site) and Flyertalk (a frequent flyer blog). There, we heard from avid proponents of a good night’s sleep and frequent travelers who strive to get it. We used their suggestions for the best sleep mask to pare down our list of contenders.</p>
<p>We found that some of the most frequently-reviewed masks on Amazon were also the most recommended on the forums; so those ones made it to our list of finalists. We also added a memory foam mask from <a href="https://www.tempurpedic.com/other-products/sleep-mask" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tempurpedic</a>, which many consumers loved.</p>
<p>Finally we took to our burgeoning list of finalists with a fine tooth comb, weeding out masks that seemed too redundant in material, design or both.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs a sleep mask?</h2>
<p>Two vocal groups in our search for the perfect sleep mask were night-shift workers (especially doctors and nurses) and frequent flyers. Both needed a way to block light while sleeping during the day or on a plane. Many city-dwellers also professed their need for a sleep mask, blaming metropolitan lights for a bad night’s sleep. Others still needed a sleep mask because their bedmate needed the light on.</p>
<p>We spoke with Chris Brantner, Certified Sleep Science Coach at <a href="http://www.sleepzoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SleepZoo.com</a>, who told us that &#8220;darkness is essential for sleep. In fact, the dimming of light triggers the pineal gland to begin producing melatonin. Melatonin is crucial to make you feel sleepy. Not only is it necessary to fall asleep, but it also increases as you sleep to push you farther into the sleep cycle. On the flip side, when light hits your eyes, it inhibits melatonin production.&#8221;</p>
<p>So really, anyone who doesn’t have a totally dark sleep environment may want to wear a mask.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Fit:</strong> Always choose a mask with an adjustable strap, so you can fit it to your head. Masks that only cover the eyes (and not the bridge of the nose) are also preferable, because they’ll fit regardless of your facial features. All of our top picks cover only the eyes and have adjustable straps.</p>
<p><strong>Quality:</strong> Choose a mask that doesn’t seem too delicate; it will need to stand up to nightly use or at least being tossed around in your luggage. It should also stand up to a gentle hand-washing in water mixed with detergent.</p>
<p><strong>Material:</strong> Your mask should be made of a material that won’t feel heavy or make you sweat. (Our top pick was a polyester blend.) Silk is often touted as luxurious choice for a sleep mask, but our testers who tried the silk masks found that they slipped around too much on their faces.</p>
<p><strong>Shape:</strong> Many people prefer eye masks with molded eye cups, because they don’t interfere with blinking or damage eyelashes.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We rounded up eight sleepy testers and asked them to select masks from our list of 11. Then we sent them home to hit the hay, asking that they sleep with each mask every night for a week. At the end of each week, they completed a survey about their experience. We asked them to answer questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did your mask interfere with your ability to blink or flutter your eyelids?</li>
<li>Does this mask block light from every angle? If not, where does the light come in?</li>
<li>Does the strap fit and stay put comfortably? If not, why?</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we pulled hard on the straps and on the fabric of each mask, noting how well each stood up to the abuse. We found that each mask we tested stood up to aggression, and each mask’s straps snapped firmly back into place.</p>
<p>After that, we asked each tester to try on each mask in bright, fluorescent lighting, then document where light came through, if anywhere.</p>
<p>Finally, we hand-washed each mask to see how well it held up. Happily, each mask stood up well to a thorough scrubbing.</p>
<h2 id="best-sleep-mask">The top pick: Bucky &#8211; 40 Blinks</h2>

<p>We’re not the first people to find the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000WNX21Y/?tag=ybdmask-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bucky &#8211; 40 Blinks Eye Mask</a> awesome. In fact, it was the most frequently recommended eye mask in the travel and health forums we visited. Reminiscent of your favorite pair of swim goggles, it has molded cups that keep pressure off your eyelids and an adjustable velcro strap to keep it secure on your face.</p>
<p>Our testers found that it didn’t irritate their skin or interfere with their blinking. The mask let their skin breathe, and it blocked light from every angle. (This, one of our testers pointed out, is impressive. They said their small nose leads to light seeping in through the bridge of other masks.) The Bucky didn’t leave any marks on faces in our testing, and our testers found the strap comfortable and high quality.</p>

It blocks light from every angle without putting pressure on your eyelids. Plus, its strap doesn't tug at or tangle your hair. </p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000WNX21Y/?tag=ybdmask-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>In our fluorescent lighting test, the Bucky still passed with flying colors. Each tester who tried it on said it blocked the harsh light from every angle. And though it’s not the cheapest mask on our list, it’s still a bargain at about 10 dollars.</p>
<p>Bucky — a Seattle-based company — started out making naturally-filled neck pillows, and has since expanded to more comfort-oriented products, like their PVC-free eye mask. Though Bucky says some of their products are made in the USA, they don’t specify if the eye masks are one of their domestic products.</p>
<p>Regardless of where this eye mask originates, we almost guarantee it’ll give you a good night’s sleep. We love that this mask is hypoallergenic, hand-washable and weighs less than an ounce. And with molded convex eye cups, it shouldn’t mess with your REM sleep or your eyelash extensions.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing we don’t like about the Bucky mask, it’s that its strap will not adjust to fit a child’s head.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Bucky &#8211; 40 Blinks is hypoallergenic and hand-washable, with molded eye cups.</li>
<li>It blocks light from every angle, even in a bright, fluorescent-lit room.</li>
<li>At less than an ounce, this mask doesn’t feel weighty or leave your face sweaty.</li>
</ul>

<p>Very similar in design to the Bucky, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005L811OK/?tag=ybdmask-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mack’s Dreamweaver</a> sleep mask rings in at just a few dollars cheaper. And while still a good mask, the few dollars may make a difference when it comes to blocking light. Some of our testers complained that the Mack’s had a tendency to let in light underneath the eyes if it’s not positioned on your face properly.</p>
<p>That being said, they liked its convex design and two straps, which help it stay positioned on your head more securely. This means it also stays put on kids, which the Bucky, according to their website, will not.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005L811OK/?tag=ybdmask-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/macks-dreamweaver-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/macks-dreamweaver-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/macks-dreamweaver-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/macks-dreamweaver-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/macks-dreamweaver-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/macks-dreamweaver-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/macks-dreamweaver-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/macks-dreamweaver-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/macks-dreamweaver.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Budget Pick: Mack's - Dreamweaver</h3><p>If you want an inexpensive mask to keep in your carry on bag, choose the Mack’s.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005L811OK/?tag=ybdmask-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Mack’s also came with an included set of earplugs, which we were ambivalent about, but might be helpful if you pick this mask up before a flight.</p>
<p>Overall, we recommend the Mack’s if you plan to use it just a few times per year for travel. If you want a mask to sleep with every night, go with the Bucky.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Mack’s Dreamweaver is our budget pick; at around seven dollars, it also comes with earplugs.</li>
<li>It has convex eye cups and two straps, ensuring it stays in place on your head.</li>
<li>If not positioned properly, the Mack’s can let in some light under your eyes.</li>

<p>When we first heard of the <a href="https://www.tempurpedic.com/other-products/sleep-mask/v/797/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tempur-Pedic</a> — a sleep mask made of memory foam — we thought it was over-indulgent. With a price tag of almost $30, it felt like an unnecessary splurge. However, rave reviews on many-a-forum led us to give it a shot.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, our testers loved it. So much so that the first person to wear it insisted on getting it back after testing. They found that despite its plushness, it didn’t feel heavy, interfere with their blinking or irritate or feel heavy on their skin. Furthermore, they found that its strap, combined with all of the extra cushioning, helped it stay securely in place.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.tempurpedic.com/other-products/sleep-mask" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tempur-pedic-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tempur-pedic-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tempur-pedic-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tempur-pedic-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tempur-pedic-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tempur-pedic-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tempur-pedic-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tempur-pedic-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tempur-pedic.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Luxury Pick: Tempur-Pedic</h3><p> If you’re looking to Indulge, choose the Tempur-Pedic.

<p>Our subsequent testers, who tried on the Tempur-Pedic in a bright room, found that it did a superb job of blocking out all light.</p>
<p>So is it worth the relatively high price point? It depends. We’d say it performs just as well (and not better) than our number one pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000WNX21Y/?tag=ybdmask-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bucky</a>, which costs about 20 dollars less. However, if you plan to use the Tempur-pedic in uncomfortable travel situations, like sleeping against the back of an airplane seat, we can see how the extra padding would give it a leg-up against the competition.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At around 30 dollars, the memory foam Tempur-pedic mask is our luxury pick.</li>
<li>It blocks light effectively and provides extra cushioning, without feeling heavy.</li>
<li>While no more effective than our top pick, the Tempur-pedic may be preferable for travelers forced to sleep in uncomfortable positions.</li>

<p><strong>Alaska Bear &#8211; Natural Silk Sleep Mask:</strong> As soft as the name implies, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GSO1D9O/?tag=ybdmask-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Alaska Bear</a> felt luxurious resting against our eyes — even though it only costs about ten dollars. Our testers loved the way it let their skin breathe, but did find that the silky material can slip around on rare occasion, causing light to seep through the bottom of the mask. Those who slept with the mask also liked that it was easy to breathe with it on. It didn&#8217;t put any pressure on their nose. And for those of us who wake up and head directly to work or class in the morning, it&#8217;s good to know that this one doesn&#8217;t leave any awkward red marks on our face.</p>

<p><strong>Drift to Sleep &#8211; Unisex Sleep Mask:</strong> A couple dollars more than our top pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PL9SSYA/?tag=ybdmask-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Drift to Sleep</a> performed almost as well. This one is definitely the most flashy of the eye masks we tested. Though rest assured that you can get it in plain patternless colors if you don&#8217;t like the purple design. It has molded eye cups that won’t interfere with blinking, and it comes with molded ear plugs. However, if you toss around a lot in your sleep, this mask may not be for you. One of our testers who is a restless sleeper found that it moved in their sleep.</p>

<p><strong>Dream Essentials &#8211; Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask:</strong> Unfortunately, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000CCI4YU/?tag=ybdmask-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dream Essentials</a> was one of a few masks in our tests that felt too “heavy” on our testers’ faces, leading to irritated and sweaty skin in the morning. Moreover, its material felt rough, and our focus group testers found that light seeped through the top and bottom of the mask in a well-lit room.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep Mask by Bedtime Bliss:</strong> Of all of the masks we tested, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FJQFJX8/?tag=ybdig" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bedtime Bliss</a> performed the worst. We found this interesting since it also had the most reviews of any of the masks we tested. Our testers found that it felt heavy and left their skin feeling sweaty and that the velcro strap continually caught in their hair. <strong>Moreover, one of our testers found that the mask had such a noxious artificial smell that they had to abandon wearing it after a couple nights.</strong> And, both they and our focus group testers found that light seeped into the mask under the eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Happy Wraps &#8211; Hot Cold Lavender Eye Pillow:</strong> While this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010E67KAW/?tag=ybdmask-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">lavender-scented pillow</a> is great for soothing headaches or helping you relax, its lack of strap renders it virtually useless as a sleep mask. Some users who reviewed it said it worked well because they exclusively sleep on their back, but unless that’s you, we don’t recommend it. The pillow does come with an inexpensive-looking conventional eye mask as a bonus. We tried it on but found that it felt like a cheap and flimsy afterthought.</p>
<p><strong>Sleeping Eye Mask by Simple Health:</strong> Almost every tester who tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B015NJZHS2/?tag=ybdmask-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Simple Health</a> hated it. They found that it was too tight, put pressure on their eyes and slipped around while they were sleeping. We like the idea of an eye mask with gel inserts, so it’s a shame that this one didn’t perform well.</p>
<p><strong>Jersey Slumber &#8211; 100% Silk Sleep Mask:</strong> While a silk mask seems like a good idea in theory, it may not be so great in practice. Our testers found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B014VYD7NW/?tag=ybdmask-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jersey Slumber</a> slipped around on their faces as they slept, while the straps simultaneously dug into their scalps.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep Master &#8211; Sleep Mask:</strong> The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0015NZ6FK/?tag=ybdmask-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sleep Master</a>, inarguably the most unique looking mask on our list, got mixed reviews when it came to blocking light. Some testers found that it blocked all light efficiently, while others found that light filtered in under the eyes and through the bridge of the nose. We think the effectiveness of this mask depends on the shape of your face. Some testers also reported an uncomfortable pressing feeling on their eyelids.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Few things are more important than a good night’s sleep. For a sleep mask that’ll make sure you get it, choose the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000WNX21Y/?tag=ybdmask-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bucky &#8211; 40 Blinks</a>. At just around 10 bucks, you may want to get one for your nightstand and another for your carry on bag.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something even cheaper to use just once in a while, grab the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005L811OK/?tag=ybdmask-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mack’s Dreamweaver</a>. And if you’re feeling indulgent, the <a href="https://www.tempurpedic.com/other-products/sleep-mask" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tempur-Pedic</a> is a luxury pick that won’t disappoint.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Before we began choosing white noise machines, we did a crash course in the science of white noise and its benefits. Articles at <a href="http://www.popsci.com/article/science/fyi-why-does-white-noise-help-people-sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Popular Science</a>, <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/question47.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Stuff Works</a> and <a href="https://psmag.com/news/the-art-and-science-of-white-noise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pacific Standard</a> gave us a good background on types of noise — white and otherwise — as well as why it works to assist sleep and mask sound.</p>
<p>Next, we looked at some blogs that specialize in improving sleep quality, and read their recommendations for white noise machines. The review <a href="http://www.sleeplikethedead.com/sound-machine-white-noise.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sleep Like the Dead</a> was especially informative. Finally, we headed over to Amazon to select our finalists from among the highest-rated and most-reviewed white noise machines.</p>
<p>Many of the experts cited in our initial research noted the important difference between white noise and soothing sounds, such as ocean waves or babbling brooks. <b>Although digitally sampled or simulated sounds like flowing water or wind chimes can be calming, they can also be distracting by causing the mind’s attention to jump from one aspect of the sound to another.</b> Plain, ordinary white noise — the more boring, the better — is the best choice for better sleep, noise masking and concentration. For this reason, we selected finalists that offered white noise and fan sounds, and chose not to review any additional “soothing sounds” that might be included on a given machine.</p>

<h2>What is white noise and how does it help?</h2>
<p>Research suggests that white noise can improve sleep quality, ensure your private conversations aren’t overheard and even enhance your ability to learn. Many parents also use white noise to help their babies sleep better and longer.</p>
<p>White noise is made up of all the frequencies a human ear can hear, sounded all at once. The term white noise is a comparison to white light, which is a combination of all the frequencies of light the human eye can see. At its purest, white noise sounds like a rather high-pitched radio static.</p>
<p><b>Frequency:</b> The height of the wave, or the pitch of a sound, measured in hertz (Hz). For example, middle C on a piano is around 261.6 Hz. A healthy human ear can hear from around 20 Hz to 20 kHz (20,000 Hz). You might feel, more than hear, a very low bass tone at 20 Hz. The human voice is generally between 1.6 and 4 kHz. Electrical devices can emit high-pitched whines above 16 kHz, toward the top range of human hearing. Dog whistles usually start around 23 kHz.</p>
<p><b>Amplitude:</b> The force of the wave, or the volume of a sound, measured in decibels (dB). The human ear can hear sounds beginning just above 0 dB, and can be irreparably damaged when exposed to sounds as high as 160 dB. A human whisper is around 20 dB and normal speaking volume is around 60 dB. Traffic noise is about 85 dB; exposure to prolonged noise louder than that for extended periods of time can cause hearing damage without <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-ear-plugs/" rel="noopener">ear protection</a>. Jack hammers and ambulances are around 120 dB.</p>
<p>Combining all audible frequencies at equal amplitude into one sound can have the effect of cancelling out or covering up ambient sounds. Other “shades” of white noise, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=brown+noise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brown noise</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=pink+noise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pink noise</a>, use a similar frequency-combining technique, but with certain frequencies played at higher amplitude in order to cover up more specific ranges of sound. A quick YouTube search yields samples of each different shade of white noise.</p>
<p>For purposes of simplicity in our testing, we’re using the term “white noise” to apply to any white noise or fan setting on one of our white noise machines, using descriptive language rather than other “colors” to describe differences in tone.</p>
<h3>Better sleep</h3>

<p>Sleeping difficulties can be caused by a number of factors, including street noise, stress, sleep partner noises and tinnitus. While white noise can’t cure all sleep problems, research suggests it can improve sleep in the average bedroom and especially in noisy or disruptive environments, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16139772" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including the ICU</a>.</p>
<p>There are many explanations for how white noise works. Some experts say that white noise blocks out sudden changes or inconsistencies in the sleep environment that could wake you up. Others suggest that the combination of so many frequencies limits the brain’s ability to pick out a single sound among the many, effectively masking any unwanted environmental sounds.</p>
<p>No matter <i>how </i>it works, many people use white noise to help improve sleep. People with tinnitus, or ringing in their ears, can find it helpful to play a low-volume white noise to distract from the sound in their head. White noise can cover up the snores of a roommate or the street noise coming in your bedroom window. And as <a href="https://www.the-guided-meditation-site.com/benefits-of-white-noise.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some meditation practitioners</a> advocate, low-level meaningless noise can help a person clear their mind of stresses and worries in order to relax.</p>
<h3>Fewer distractions and more privacy</h3>
<p>White noise is not sound cancellation — that is, white noise doesn’t work by minimizing or eliminating sound waves. Businesses with open-concept work environments sometimes use <a href="https://speechprivacysystems.com/sound-masking-vs-cancellation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sound cancellation systems</a> to minimize workers’ ability to overhear each other.</p>
<p>But personal white noise machines can be effective for covering distracting environmental sounds or private conversations. In the same way white noise can mask the sound of snores or street noise, it can cover voices from an adjacent conference room or doctor’s examination room.</p>
<h3>Better learning</h3>
<p>Using white noise can help improve learning. <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn_a_00537#.WJSLebYrKi5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Studies have shown</a> that white noise can help with memory and fact recall, and improve information processing. It’s also effective for improving memory difficulties related to aging.</p>
<h3>Why babies love white noise</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.happiestbaby.com/blogs/blog/white-noise-for-baby-sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White noise can mimic the sounds a baby hears in the womb</a> — the muffled jumble of voices, the <i>whoosh</i>ing of mom’s heartbeat, the vague rumble of environmental noises. Using white noise in a baby’s room can replicate this environment and the feelings of safety and comfort it triggers. The <i>shush</i> sound that people instinctively use to soothe a crying baby is a kind of white noise. Placing white noise in a baby’s sleep area can promote deeper and better quality sleep.</p>
<p>Experts caution parents not to place noise machines too close to the baby’s head, however. White noise should be around 50 dB, or about as loud as a bathroom shower, to prevent damage to baby’s ears.</p>

<p>Personal tastes vary a lot regarding sleep environment, but there are some common features to look out for when shopping for a white noise machine.</p>
<p><b>No audible break or patterns in sound loop:</b> White noise machines run for long periods of time, and any recognizable pattern or obvious break in the sound can be disruptive. Some digital white noise machines simply play back a recorded loop of noise that can have subtle patterns that become noticeable throughout the listening period. Noticing an obvious end and beginning in the loop or recognizing a pattern in the noise can be distracting enough to interfere with sleep or concentration.</p>
<p><b>Adjustable volume:</b> Most bedrooms or workspaces won’t have the same level of sound every single day. Being able to adjust the volume of white noise can help mask unwanted sounds no matter how the environment changes.</p>
<p><b>Variety of sounds:</b> It can be hard to know just what you’re looking for in a white noise machine until you try it out. A machine with a wide range of sound options can increase your chances of finding the perfect white noise for your needs.</p>
<p><b>Compact and portable:</b> Humans are creatures of habit. Once we find our ideal environment, we want to duplicate it as easily as possible when we’re away from home. A white noise machine that can be easily packed in a suitcase or overnight bag can make a hotel room or vacation rental much more restful.</p>
<p><b>Reasonably priced:</b>White noise machines can be viewed as investments in better living, but that doesn’t mean folks want to pay very much for one. The seven machines we tested range in price from around $20 to around $80.</p>
<p><b>Digital vs. analog: </b>Analog white noise machines use fan-produced sound with an adjustable outer casing for fine-tuning pitch and volume. Digital white noise machines offer a greater range of volumes and an infinite variety of sounds. Analog machines tend to be quieter, but some people prefer the more natural sound of a fan over digitally produced or sampled sounds. However, normal wear and tear can cause fans to develop patterns or tics over time.</p>
<p><b>Design:</b> Round, oval, heptagonal, tear-drop-shaped. Tall, low-profile, hangable. Push-buttons, dials. Display lights, no lights, adjustable lights. Portable, stay-put-heavy. Black, white, tan, chrome-accented. Some white noise machines are designed for utility, some have had obvious effort put into their appearance. In general, we made sure the design did not influence our ranking of the machine&#8217;s abilities.</p>

<p>Our group of seven white noise machine finalists included three analog machines and four digital machines. We tested only the “white noise” and “fan” functions of each machine, ignoring any other sound options like waterfalls and ocean waves.</p>
<h3>Pushing the buttons</h3>
<p>Each of the three analog machines we tested — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NAPB57J/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HemingWeigh</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GFSF402/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sleep Easy</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HD0ELFK/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dohm</a> — has a power switch and a single rocker switch to select low or high fan. (HemingWeigh has one additional button for the nightlight function.) In addition to buttons, the analog machines each feature an adjustable outer casing with slanted and circular vents in various sizes. Rotating the casing changes the airflow through the vents, affecting the quality and volume of sound produced.</p>
<p>The digital machines had more button options. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E6D6LQY/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">‘LectroFan</a> has three rocker switches to control power, volume, timer and sound options. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D50RZQI/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rohm</a> has four push buttons for power, volume and sound options. And <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002SMJQT4/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sound+Sleep</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A2JBMRE/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HoMedics</a> each have a single dial and seven push buttons for sound options, timer and other functions.</p>
<p>We spent a couple hours running through the range of white noise and fan sounds and their volumes on each machine. We made sure the timers were true and the buttons did what they were supposed to do.</p>
<p>Finally, we cranked each white noise and fan sound on each machine up to its highest possible volume and used a sound meter to measure the amplitude.</p>
<h3>Practical testing</h3>
<p>We conducted our practical testing in two parts. First, we measured how well each finalist masked sounds in an adjacent room. Then, we used each machine overnight for a week to see how it affected our testers’ sleep.</p>
<p><b>Masking household noise</b></p>

<p>Chances are, if you live with a spouse, roommate, child or pet, there are times they make noise when you’re trying to sleep. White noise machines can help to cover up the sounds in rooms adjacent to your bedroom and keep noise-related domestic disturbances to a minimum.</p>
<p>With our white noise machines set up in a quiet room, we used a stereo system to play recorded sounds in an adjacent room. We mimicked the experience of overhearing a variety of common household distractions, such as dogs barking and a TV sitcom playing, then used a sound meter to measure how well each machine covered up the sounds.</p>
<p>On the whole, none of the white noise machine finalists were overwhelmingly successful at masking noises in an adjacent room, but some were better than others. All of the digital machines, for example, were louder than any of the analog machines, and therefore much better at covering sound.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that white noise can be very grating and inhibit sleep at high volumes. Having a white noise machine that can mask noises at very high volume doesn’t necessarily make it the best. However, having the option to make it louder makes it a more versatile machine, which we think does generally make it better.</p>
<p><b>Overnight test</b></p>
<p>Each machine was placed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJk4MC2NC2I" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the same location</a> in the bedroom roughly two feet from the foot of the bed, display facing the bed and speaker facing the ceiling. Sleepers spent some time before bedtime running through the settings to find the right sound and turning the volume to the appropriate level.</p>
<p><b>In overnight tests, our testers overwhelmingly favored the digital machines. The analog machines were simply not loud enough to provide enough sound for a soothing effect.</b> Even when moved directly next to the head of the bed, the analog machines were not loud enough for our testers, although they did note a pleasant stirring of the air that was soothing.</p>
<p>Besides volume, other complaints included display lights that couldn’t be turned off and too-harsh white noise sounds. Testers also noted that some of the finalists’ power cables were quite short, which wasn’t a problem in our testing room, but certainly could be in a hotel room or other non-home situation.</p>
<p>For our testers, who were already used to sleeping with white noise, there was no marked improvement in sleep with any of the machines. However, there were more uneasy nights with some of the finalists, most notably the analog machines, which were too quiet to assist with sleep.</p>

<p>As the only rechargeable white noise machine we tested, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D50RZQI/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Marpac &#8211; Rohm</a> takes top honors for portability with its 12 hours of cordless operation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A2JBMRE/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HoMedics &#8211; Sound Spa</a> can run on an included power cable or four AA batteries, which makes it portable as well, although it is larger than Rohm. Every other machine we tested must be plugged in to work. Moving any of them from one location to another within the same house is no problem at all, and none of the units we tested will take up too much room in a suitcase. However, at two pounds, Sound+Sleep is the heaviest white noise machine we tested and the only one we would consider too heavy to call portable.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life</strong></p>
<p>Rohm and HoMedics are the only white noise machines we tested that have a battery option. Rohm has an internal lithium ion battery, rechargeable via an included USB cable. HoMedics can be powered either by its wall adapter or by four AA batteries.</p>
<p>When Rohm was fully charged, its battery life was between 10 and 12 hours. And at full volume, starting with new batteries, HoMedics gave around 100 hours of operation.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong><br />
As with most electronics, the simpler units are less expensive and the machines with more bells and whistles cost more. The least expensive white noise machine we tested, HoMedics (around $20), looks rather cheaply made, but doesn’t feel flimsy or poorly constructed and the audio is decent quality. Sound+Sleep (around $80) costs four times more than <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A2JBMRE/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HoMedics </a>and looks and feels substantial, well-designed and is jam-packed with sound options, although not much in the way of white noise.</p>
<p>The three analog machines we tested each cost around $30 (Dohm is a little more) and feel mostly interchangeable regarding materials, construction and performance. And our two top finalists, ‘LectroFan (around $45) and Rohm (around $35), each feel well-made but not over-engineered, with no extra buttons or features that could increase their prices.</p>

<p>With the highest scores in nearly all of our tests, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E6D6LQY/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adaptive Sound Technologies &#8211; ‘LectroFan</a> is our choice for the best white noise machine. It’s the only machine we tested that offers a selection of white noise <i>and</i> fan sounds, in addition to being the only finalist to ace our sound masking tests. ‘LectroFan’s simple design and straight-forward controls were great selling points for our testers, with no question about how to operate it or its purpose in the home.</p>
<p>The versatility of a white noise machine that offers a wide range of truly “meaningless” sounds is incredibly valuable. Most white noise machines offer only one or a few sounds to choose from, so you may need to purchase and return several machines before you find just the right one. ‘LectroFan offers 10 fan sounds, from box fan to industrial fan, and 10 white noise sounds, including “champagne” and “chestnut.” Our favorites? Vent fan for working, cinnamon noise for sleeping.</p>
<p>In our testing, ‘LectroFan’s loudest, most grating white noise and large fan sounds covered up all ambient noise and sound from an adjacent room, including the booming explosions of an action movie. As previously noted, you might not want to have this machine at full volume, but it does offer you the option to run it at high volumes in order to mask all kinds of environmental sounds.</p>

<p>In overnight tests, ‘LectroFan fit seamlessly in our testers’ nighttime routine. After finding the right white noise and the appropriate volume, our testers gladly used ‘LectroFan every night of its test week. With no display lights to brighten the sleeping area and a small footprint that didn’t take up much space on the tabletop, ‘LectroFan was a welcome addition to the bedroom.</p>
<p>Design-wise, ‘LectroFan is low-profile, geometrical and inconspicuous. It’s available in black or white. At around $45, it’s a little more expensive than most of the other finalists, but a few days of use prove its worth. The nearly 5-foot cable allows the unit to be powered via USB plug or the included A/C adaptor. The three rocker buttons are easy to manipulate even in the dark. The 60-minute timer can be pressed multiple times to add more hours. And to help you find your favorite white noise or fan sound as you’re scrolling through the options, a soft <i>whoop</i> sounds briefly at the beginning of the list. This is a smartly designed machine.</p>

<p>For travel, baby stroller or any other situation where you might not want (or be able) to plug in your white noise machine overnight, we recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D50RZQI/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Marpac &#8211; Rohm</a>. Two white noise settings with a good range of volume and a battery life of up to 12 hours make this white noise machine a winner.</p>
<p>At 3.5 inches in diameter and only 3.8 ounces, Rohm is the smallest white noise machine we tested. It charges via micro USB, so you won’t even need to pack an extra charging cable if you already have one for your phone — although one is provided with the unit. Rohm will operate while plugged in, as well as up to 12 hours (at middle volume in our testing) unplugged with a full charge of its lithium-ion battery. It can sit on a tabletop or other surface, or can be hung by the included lanyard.</p>

<p>Both the bright white noise and deep white noise settings are continuous; we could not detect a pattern of any kind during our overnight or practical tests. Our testers preferred the deep white noise for sleeping, but found the bright white noise similar enough to accidentally use it one night without noticing. Each setting has a volume range adjustable to over 70 dB, and in our testing was enough to cover dogs barking, TV conversation and city noise.</p>
<p>It’s important to note again that the volume should be kept quite low if using in baby’s crib, stroller or car seat. Experts recommend setting it to about the volume of a bathroom shower to prevent hearing damage. That said, this is a great machine for use with babies especially because its portability allows you to provide a consistent sonic environment no matter where you take your little one. Marpac also makes <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D50RYSC/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hushh</a>, which is marketed specifically for use with babies and is identical to Rohm except for a night light and a button lock.</p>
<p>We have one very minor gripe with Rohm. The unit comes with a micro USB cable, but no USB plug adapter. Chances are most people have a few of these around their homes, but at a price point over $30, we would expect such a convenience to be included.</p>
<p>Overall, though, we were pleasantly surprised by this tiny powerhouse. Rohm is a great choice for travelers, campers or anyone on the go who wants to take a little bit of home with them.</p>

<p>We were not blown away by the analog white noise machines. In a sleeping environment our testers wanted a much louder white noise sound than any of the analog machines provided. Overall, in fact, the three analog machines we tested felt more or less interchangeable. They had the same control buttons and the same vented, rotating outer casings. The few extra features on HemingWeigh (see below) didn’t even set it apart to a significant degree.</p>
<p>It came down to sound. Two of the analog machines had a metallic whine or motor noise along with the fan sound that was mildly unpleasant. The one analog machine without the motor noise, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GFSF402/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sleep Easy &#8211; Sound Conditioner</a>, is our choice for the best analog white noise machine.</p>

<p>Sleep Easy is a machine that will probably need to live on your bedside table, rather than on a dresser or another surface across the room. The fan sound is quite low; on the highest setting it’s only 62 dB, which is around the volume of conversational speech. But in a quiet room, the fan sound is especially soothing, and the faint stirring of the air that results from the fan itself is pleasant.</p>
<p>With a tan casing, circular side and top vents, and a black rocker on/off button, Sleep Easy looks a lot like the other two models we tested. However, at less than $30, it’s the least expensive model we tested, which may give it an additional edge on the competition.</p>
<p>This is definitely not a white noise machine for someone looking to mask environmental sounds in their bedroom. But in a quiet environment like a baby’s room or a typically quiet home, or for a sleeper with tinnitus, Sleep Easy is a good choice.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GFSF402/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sleep Easy</a> provides pleasant fan-created white noise without any motor sound.</li>
<li>Highest setting around the volume of normal conversation (i.e. rather quiet).</li>
<li>Best for use in a quiet setting or for sleepers with tinnitus.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002SMJQT4/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sound+Sleep</a> from Adaptive Sound Technologies offers a quality white noise sound, a wide range of volume options and a timer with four settings. Additionally, this machine includes an “adaptive mode,” which manufacturers say listens to your environment and adapts the sound machine to meet your specific needs.</p>
<p>Sound+Sleep is a rather large, sleek-looking tabletop white noise machine with black casing, chrome buttons and a large central chrome dial. At two pounds and nearly seven inches long, this teardrop-shaped machine is the heaviest and largest we tested. An A/C power adapter with a nearly 5-foot cable is included. Despite its relatively light weight, this finalist feels substantial enough not to be especially portable. It’s not really made for travel. And at around $80, it’s the most expensive model we tested.</p>
<p>In our overnight tests, Sound+Sleep got high scores for its deep static white noise sound. Testers liked its volume range and noise masking ability, as well as its non-looping digital white noise. A “display” button that turns all display lights on and off was testers’ favorite feature on Sound+Sleep. Overnight testers did note a kind of musical overtone to the white noise that was not unpleasant, but still noticeable.</p>
<p>In addition to Sound+Sleep’s white noise setting, there are nine soothing sounds (such as meadow and train) and a “richness” button that adds up to two levels of enrichment to each sound. As noted above, we did not test any soothing sounds in this review, focusing solely on the white noise options for each machine.</p>
<p>Adding richness to the white noise made it louder, harsher and higher-pitched. Interestingly, adding richness in our noise masking tests made the sound less effective at masking environmental noises, even though the sound was louder. Our testers overwhelmingly preferred the white noise sound with no richness added.</p>
<p>The other unique feature of Sound+Sleep is <a href="https://www.soundofsleep.com/soundsleep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its adaptive technology</a>, which uses a built-in microphone to detect environmental sounds and then changes the sound accordingly. In our testing, this feature was not impressive. Rather than keeping the settings as you’ve chosen and adapting the sound from that point, the adaptive mode raises and lowers the volume of white noise to match environmental sound. So in a quiet room with occasional bursts of noise such as talking or children playing, Sound+Sleep lowers the volume to nearly undetectable and raises it occasionally when it “hears” a loud enough sound. In our overnight testing, the microphone wasn’t sensitive enough to pick up street noise from the window, so it kept the volume of white noise too low to be effective for sleep.</p>
<p>Overall, we liked the single no-richness-added white noise option and the display on/off button on Sound+Sleep. If you’re looking for several soothing sound options, this might be worth the time and money. But if you’re mostly looking for white noise, look at less expensive models to meet your needs.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A2JBMRE/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sound Spa by HoMedics</a> was our least favorite of the digital white noise machines we tested. The lightweight, low-profile machine has one white noise function (among five other soothing sounds), a three-setting timer and a good volume range.</p>
<p>Weighing in at half a pound and not even two inches high, HoMedics is quite portable even with its 6.5-inch footprint. Made from very lightweight plastic, HoMedics feels rather cheaply made, but the buttons and volume dial are reassuringly responsive. The 6-foot A/C power adapter cable provides continuous power, or you can get about 100 hours of power at full volume from four AA batteries. At around $20, this was the least expensive white noise machine we tested.</p>
<p>The white noise option on HoMedics sounds harsh and thin compared to our top picks, a bit like a heavy rain with the warmer, deeper notes removed. Our overnight testers noted an unpleasant pulsing in the white noise sound, and were annoyed that the display light could not be shut off. Testers abandoned this machine only a few hours into each night of its tests.</p>
<p>Overall, HoMedics is an inexpensive, portable option for consumers who aren’t especially picky about discernible patterns in their white noise.</p>

<p>In almost every test, analog white noise machines <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HD0ELFK/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Marpac &#8211; Dohm</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NAPB57J/?tag=ybdwhit-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HemingWeigh</a> are indistinguishable. A couple features set HemingWeigh apart, but sound-wise, they are remarkably similar.</p>
<p>They’re both off-white and dome-shaped, with angled vents on the sides, circular vents on top and black rocker buttons on the front. Each creates its white noise sound with an internal fan, and both have a slight mechanical whirring that accompanies the fan sound. Additionally, they both have long power cables and top volumes of close to 60 dB in testing.</p>
<p>Their differences are few. HemingWeigh has a bright night light and two USB ports on its front, neither of which Dohm can boast. And price-wise, HemingWeigh is around $30 and Dohm is about $40.</p>

<p>All of that said, both HemingWeigh and Dohm provide innocuous fan-created white noise with no discernable patterns and an enjoyable light breeze that stirs the air immediately around the machine in a pleasant way. Neither was loud enough to pass any sound-masking tests or make it through an entire night for our overnight testers, but might be sufficient in a baby’s room or otherwise very quiet bedroom. Both are relatively lightweight and compact, so would likely travel well, especially HemingWeigh with its additional features.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter over 100 hours of testing seven top-rated indoor and outdoor products, we found that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017HM59HC/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lazery Sleep Air Mattress</a> was the best air mattress for durability, comfort and convenience. Lazery Sleep was the only air mattress we tested that consistently maintained air pressure, and  its automatic internal pump with seven settings allows you to increase or decrease firmness in seconds. A close runner-up is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B006OU4ERA/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Insta-Bed</a>, which withstood our testing with only minor loss of firmness.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-chose">How we selected products to test</h2>
<h3>For in-home</h3>
<p>We read hundreds of reviews posted by consumers on websites that sell air mattresses, such as Amazon, Target, Walmart, sporting goods stores, bed stores and air mattress manufacturers. A surprisingly large percentage of people who purchase air mattresses are unhappy with the product they bought. The majority of their complaints focused on the mattresses losing air pressure during the night, so they found themselves waking up on a nearly flat piece of vinyl in the morning.</p>
<p>The second-most cited complaint is that air mattresses simply don’t provide the same back support as a standard bed. Third, air mattresses seem to be notorious for emitting a strong odor that can’t be masked even with bedding.</p>
<p>After a week’s worth of research and calling manufacturers, we narrowed our choices to 17 twin-bed air mattresses. We then reduced the selections to the seven mattresses that consumers praised highly for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their ability to sustain air pressure during the night</li>
<li>No leaks or seam breaks after multiple inflations</li>
<li>An efficient air pump</li>
<li>Weight capacity (300 to 350 pounds)</li>
<li>Comfort</li>
<li>Convenience</li>
<li>Lack of vinyl (PVC) odor</li>
</ul>
<h3>For camping</h3>
<p>Almost all of the air mattresses on the market are intended for indoor use only. Few manufacturers recommend their product for both indoor and outdoor use, so we narrowed our choices down to air mattresses that are made specifically for the outdoors, provided comfort and warmth and when inflated, could fit in a tent.</p>
<p>A major factor that’s different for camping air mattresses is how much weight it will add to your backpack. Since an air pump is needed to inflate the mattress, its weight also had to be taken into account.</p>
<p>A few of the air mattresses we researched included electric air pumps. We decided that in most cases electricity wouldn’t be available at a campsite, and so we focused on air mattresses that used a battery-operated pump. We did include one exception to review, the AeroBed Classic, for instances when electricity might be accessible.</p>
<p>Another important consideration was if the air mattress was easy to inflate, deflate and roll up efficiently and quickly for backpacking.</p>

<h2 id="why-buy">Who needs an inflatable air mattress?</h2>
<p>Air mattresses were originally designed for camping and travel. They were initially made of rubber and stored on cruise ships for fast inflation in times of emergency and lightweight for easy packing and carrying in a backpack. Most air mattresses today are made of PVC (polyvinyl chloride), which makes them more durable — and somewhat heavier — than the first camping and lifeboat air mattresses.</p>
<p>Today’s air mattresses are greatly improved, offering better body support and comfort, and since many have internal electric pumps, they are also convenient and easy to use. Two of the seven air mattresses we tested &#8211; Lightspeed Outdoors and Coleman SupportRest &#8211; are specifically intended for camping. The AeroBed Classic is the only air mattress we tested that could be used indoors and outdoors.</p>
<p>There is no specific set time for how long you should keep an air mattress inflated. However, almost all air mattress companies strongly advise that as durable and heavy-weight their product is, it won’t hold up if it is used as a permanent bed. (As evident from a good number of Amazon reviewers, this advisory is often ignored.)</p>
<p>Few air mattress companies offer a warranty (usually it’s very limited and only for one year), which is a sore point for most people who purchase one, since they had hoped the air mattress would last longer than a year.</p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence suggests that an air mattress could last for up to four years. But again, the mattress’ longevity depends on how it is used, maintained and stored by the consumer.</p>
<p>So why would you need an air mattress for anything other than camping? Air mattresses are ideal for overnight guests and kids’ sleepovers or when you’ve moved into a new home or apartment, and you’re waiting for furniture to arrive. To increase comfort during colder months you could even pair it with an <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-electric-blanket/">electric blanket</a>. An air mattress would also be great when you’re traveling and you need an additional bed in a hotel room or even in the back of a car.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>

<p>Our research and testing determined a number of important features for you to consider when you’re purchasing an air mattress.</p>
<p><strong>Durability:</strong> Almost all of the air mattresses we tested were made of heavy gauge PVC, which prevents air leakage, seam splits and tears.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort:</strong> An air mattress should provide full-body support like a standard bed mattress.</p>
<p><strong>Height:</strong> Double-height air mattresses (17-to-24 inches tall) are preferred for ease of lowering onto and lifting your body from the bed.</p>
<p><strong>Maintains air pressure:</strong> The majority of air mattresses we tested had slight-to-moderate deflation over a test period. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006OU4ERA/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Insta-Bed Raised Airbed</a>, however, did not deflate, thanks to its patented “neverFLAT” dual-pump system.</p>
<p><strong>Adjustable firmness:</strong> Depending on your preference for a firm or plush mattress, you should be able to control the inflation and deflation. Several of the air mattresses we tested had this feature, and it afforded them superior comfort.</p>
<p><strong>Internal electric air pump:</strong> The best air mattress will have a powerful built-in electric pump that efficiently inflates and deflates. Whereas we didn’t find it was essential for the pump to rapidly inflate the mattress, we did appreciate a pump that deflates by vacuuming out the air, which made folding and storage easy.</p>
<p><strong>Weight support:</strong> We tested twin-size mattresses that supported 300-350 pounds, which is sufficient for a twin bed. Queen mattresses are intended for two people and should support 500-600 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Storage:</strong> Ideally an air mattress should be easy to fold and store in a small space. Most of the air mattresses we tested came with a sturdy storage bag that was large enough to hold the folded-up mattress.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of odor:</strong> PVC is sturdy, but it also has a prominent “shower-curtain” odor that doesn’t always dissipate with continued use. Two of the air mattresses we tested — Lazery Sleep and Sound Asleep Dream Series Bed — had almost no odor.</p>

<p>All of the electric air pumps included with the air mattresses, both internal and hand-held, were 120 volts, and they were generally efficient in quick inflation and deflation.</p>
<p>Our first test was timing the inflations and deflations 10 times for each mattress with and without 200 pounds of weight and recorded the time to determine whether or not there was a difference. We evenly distributed the 200-pound weight to approximate a person’s weight (heavier in the middle than at the head and foot of the bed). The majority of air mattresses inflated and deflated in two minutes and under. The Sound Asleep Dream Series and Fox Airbeds were slightly more than two minutes.</p>
<p>Almost all of the companies warn that an infant or young child could suffocate on an under-inflated or deflated mattress. However, we surmised that an older child or teenager might try inflating/deflating while they were on the bed, and so we decided to test it out. As expected, inflation time increased by several seconds, and deflation time decreased by several seconds.</p>
<p>Another factor we considered was how well the pump vacuumed the air out of the mattress and whether we needed to manually press down on the mattress to squeeze out remaining air. The Lazery Sleep, the Sound Asleep and the Insta-Bed were the most efficient; however Lazery Sleep and Insta-Bed’s automatic turn-off pump had the edge over Sound Asleep’s manual pump.</p>
<p>Powerful pumps are not quiet pumps, and although most reviewers claim that the pumps were about as loud as a hair dryer, we found the majority to be more on par with a vacuum cleaner. The only air pump that we would say was quiet is the hand-held, external pump for AeroBed Classic, which was actually quieter than a hair dryer.</p>
<h3>Durability</h3>
<p>Since air mattresses are generally used as temporary beds over a long period, we wanted to devise a test that simulated repeated use. Frequent complaints about the air mattresses we tested were leaks at the seams or air valve that are a result of the material stretching.</p>
<p>Three of the seven instruction manuals advised that it’s normal for the bed to lose air pressure after a few inflations due to the elasticity of the vinyl. We decided to test the air mattress stretching by inflating and deflating each mattress 10 times before applying weight.</p>
<p>After the tenth inflation, we brushed around the seams and valve with a soap-and-water solution and pressed down on the mattress to see if the solution bubbled, which would indicate a leak. None of the air mattresses showed signs of air leakage.</p>
<p>We then applied the 200-pound weight on the inflated mattress for 48 hours, deflated the mattress and then inflated again. We brushed the seams and air valves, and again, no leaks were detected.</p>
<p>All the air mattresses we tested, except for the Lightspeed Outdoors, have an internal 21-coil system, which is designed to provide support, prevent sagging and stabilize the mattress . Throughout our testing period, we did find that the coil system generally works well, but only for the center of the mattress. Although we could not find air leakage, the sides and corners of most of the air mattresses were “squishy,&#8221; which indicated some deflation.</p>
<h3>Comfort</h3>
<p>Regular standard twin bed mattresses are approximately 75-inches long and 38-inches wide, so a six-foot-tall person could lie on the mattress without his or her feet hanging over the edge of the bed. The majority of twin air mattresses we tested were slightly shorter at 72 inches, which means that a six-foot-tall person would need to sleep on the diagonal. Depending on your sleeping habits, this may or may not be comfortable.</p>
<p>The Lightspeed Outdoors mattress was longer at 78 inches and wider at 50 inches, which gave plenty of room for one person; however, at only 50 inches side-to-side, two people might feel cramped. The Fox Airbeds was 80 inches in length and 40 inches wide, which makes this mattress ideal for a tall person.</p>
<p>Standard twin-size fitted sheets fit all of the air mattresses we tested, however, it was a struggle with the Fox Airbeds and the Lightspeed Outdoors, which are both wider and longer than a twin bed. Full-size sheets could fit, but there would be substantial overhang.</p>
<p>All of the mattresses (except for the Lightspeed Outdoors) have a flocked, suede-like top to prevent sheet slippage. Some reviewers add a mattress pad or topper for additional protection and comfort, but we found neither was really necessary.</p>
<p>Since air mattresses are not intended for a bed frame, it takes some getting used to lowering oneself onto the mattress, even the double-height air mattresses, which measure approximately 18 inches in height. Almost all of the air mattresses we tested deflated somewhat, so rising up out of the bed wasn’t easy either as we had to push ourselves up from the center of the mattress.</p>
<p>The central internal coil system does provide good back support and for each of the air mattresses, the center section of the air mattress maintained pressure and stayed firm. Three of the air mattresses — Lazery Sleep, Insta-Bed and Sound Asleep — have controls to adjust firmness, which we found to be a real plus for comfort.</p>
<h3>Odor</h3>
<p>Almost all of the air mattresses we tested are made of vinyl. The exception, Lightspeed Outdoor, is made of PVC-free plastic. The process used to manufacture vinyl results in its having an unpleasant chemical odor.</p>
<p>Several of the air mattresses had overpowering PVC odor when we unwrapped them from their boxes. Before putting sheets on the mattresses, we allowed them to air out for several days to hopefully release the PVC gasses. In most cases, the odor did dissipate and was nearly undetectable when the beds were made up. However, when the mattresses were deflated by opening the air valve, the PVC odor emitting from the released air was still strong.</p>
<p>Our top choice, the Lazery Sleep, had virtually no odor from the get-go, while the Aerobed’s and Fox Airbeds&#8217; PVC odor didn’t dissipate even after being aired outdoors.</p>
<h3>Convenience</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mattress-inflation-animation.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Since air mattresses are intended as temporary beds, we wanted to find out if they were convenient to use. Out of the box, each air mattress was a compact square or rectangle. We measured the mattresses to determine whether it was possible to fold them back into its tight shipping state. In short, it wasn’t. However, once completely deflated and with a bit of practice, most of the air mattresses could be folded and rolled to fit their ample canvas storage bags that are included.</p>
<p>Deflating the air mattresses did present a couple of problems. Two of the electric internal pumps did an excellent job of vacuuming out every bit of air from the mattress, which made folding and rolling a snap. Insta-Bed’s pump needed assistance in our manually pressing out the air around the edges and corners.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the most inconvenient of the air mattresses were the camping beds. Lightspeed’s battery-operated pump worked fine for inflation, but it was less successful at deflating the mattress, and we spent considerable time pressing out the air. The Coleman air mattress was more difficult to completely deflate, and then folding and rolling it into the attached storage bag tested our patience.</p>
<h3>A good night’s sleep</h3>
<p>Scientific testing aside, the real test for any air mattress is whether it gives you a good night’s sleep. Due to loss of firmness throughout the night, several of the mattresses lost enough stability that we were afraid we might fall off the mattress in our sleep. For example, the Fox Airbeds lost enough air pressure to waken us every time we moved. By morning, we could virtually roll out of bed, since the sides of the mattress were so soft.</p>
<p>We experienced the same issues with the Sound Asleep mattress. It also deflated during the night, so consequently we rocked back and forth any time we shifted.</p>
<p>The Lazery and the Insta-Bed air mattresses were, by far, the most comfortable and stable. Their internal support systems kept the mattresses firm, so there was no movement when we turned on our sides, and they were easy to stand up from without extra assistance.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017HM59HC/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lazery Sleep</a> scored an almost perfect 10 on all of our tests. It is the only air mattress we tested with an internal pump that has seven settings for controlling firmness, ranging from “plush” (soft) to “extra firm.&#8221; Another feature we liked is the pump automatically shuts off when the mattress reaches the desired setting (in about one-and-a-half minutes) and when it is fully deflated (in under two minutes).</p>
<p>The pump’s settings allow you to select how firm or soft you want the mattress to be and make incremental adjustments to increase or decrease air pressure. In a nutshell, you can set the mattress to inflate to “extra firm” and if it’s too firm for your liking, you can gradually decrease the air pressure to a softer level.</p>

<p>The “extra firm” setting was certainly the firmest of any of the air mattresses we tested. The “plush” setting was a bit too soft for us and slightly destabilized the mattress so it rocked when we shifted from side to side.</p>

<p>The Lazery Sleep is well-made and durable, and even though it is vinyl, it didn’t have the characteristic PVC smell. The Lazery Sleep maintained air pressure and showed no deflation in our initial 48-hour testing period with 200 pounds applied. When fully inflated, it was almost as high as a regular bed mattress, incredibly comfortable and easy to get into and out of.</p>
<p>Since the efficient pump completely vacuums out the air, the mattress flattens perfectly for folding and rolling and fits easily into the included canvas bag for storage.</p>

<p>It was neck-and-neck between the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B006OU4ERA/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Insta-Bed</a> and the highly rated <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N9C3IVO/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sound Asleep Dream Series</a> for runner-up, but we decided that Insta-Bed’s automatic twin-pump system put Insta-Bed ahead of Sound Asleep.</p>
<p>Insta-Bed’s patented “neverFLAT” system has one main pump for rapid inflation and deflation (under two minutes) and a second internal pump that maintains air pressure during the night. The mattress’ sensor monitors the selected air pressure and automatically re-inflates if there is any deflation. Unlike the primary pump, the secondary pump is nearly silent &#8211; it’s a slight whir &#8211; so you won’t be disturbed from sleep.</p>

<p>We tested the mattress with and without the secondary pump engaged, and by morning there was only minor deflation along the sides and corners when the secondary pump wasn’t on. The pump has three firmness controls: “plush,” “medium” and “firm.”</p>
<p>We found “medium” and “plush” to be firmer than other air mattresses, while “firm” was actually too firm and somewhat uncomfortable. Insta-Bed was stable throughout the night and absorbed any movement when we were asleep.</p>
<p>Automatic deflation is a little uneven and benefits from manually pressing out any remaining air to flatten the mattress for folding. The secondary pump inhibits a neat fold-up, but the storage bag is large enough to hold the mattress.</p>
<p>The only real negative is that the mattress’ vinyl has a noticeable PVC odor, which eventually dissipated but only after repeated airings outdoors.</p>

<p>We tested three camping air mattresses: AeroBed Classic, Lightspeed Outdoors and Coleman SupportRest Double High Airbed. Of the three, we found that the reliable and backpack-friendly <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CWZE642/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lightspeed</a> was the best option.</p>
<p>Any of the the three air mattresses we tested for camping purposes could also be used indoors. They were designed, however, for outdoor use, which means they are lightweight yet durable and need a separate pump, preferably battery-operated. Electric pumps for camping are available, which you could use if electricity is accessible at your campsite, or if you purchase an adapter for your car’s cigarette lighter.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CWZE642/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/lightspeed-outdoors-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/lightspeed-outdoors-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/lightspeed-outdoors-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/lightspeed-outdoors-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/lightspeed-outdoors-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/lightspeed-outdoors-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/lightspeed-outdoors-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/lightspeed-outdoors-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/lightspeed-outdoors.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best for Camping: Lightspeed Outdoors</h3><p>This lightweight two-person air mattress couldn't be beat for durability and easy pack-up-and-go. Of the camping mattresses we tested, the Lightspeed's relatively quick inflation and deflation were the best.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CWZE642/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CWZE642/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lightspeed Outdoors</a> mattress is a slightly longer (78 inches) full-size mattress (54 inches in width). Weighing in at only six pounds, it was the lightest of the three camping air mattresses we tested. (The Aerobed is seven pounds, and the Coleman is ten pounds.) It’s only six inches high, so for colder weather, some sort of insulation underneath the mattress is necessary.</p>
<p>A battery-operated air pump (4 “D” batteries not included) is included with the mattress, and it works decently in inflating the mattress in about five minutes. We found it best to over-inflate the mattress since the air valve hisses out air once the pump nozzle is removed. The pump wasn’t as effective in deflating the mattress, so we found it easier and faster to manually press the air out of the mattress.</p>
<p>The mattress was comfortable, if perhaps a bit soft, and it rocked back and forth like a waterbed when only one person was on it. Since the mattress was designed for two people, the second person’s weight kept it more stable. The mattress lost a small amount of air pressure, but it kept us buoyed overnight.</p>
<p>Once we got the hang of rolling and squeezing the deflated mattress, it fit neatly in its storage bag that can also accommodate the pump and three nozzle attachments.</p>
<p>The Lightspeed Outdoors is the only mattress that we tested that is a PVC-free plastic, so it has no odor. Lightweight, durable and affordable, the Lightspeed Outdoors Two Person Air Mattress is an excellent choice for camping trips.</p>

<p>One of the most highly rated air mattresses on Amazon is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N9C3IVO/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sound Asleep Dream Series</a>, and it certainly has all of the features of our top pick. Its powerful internal pump inflates and deflates the mattress in a little over two minutes, and fully inflated, it provides solid back and body support. The internal 21-coil (for twin beds) system keeps the mattress stable and comfortable.</p>
<p>The air pump completely deflates the mattress so it’s easy to fold and store in its large canvas bag. The mattress is made of vinyl, but it has no PVC odor. Finally, it’s slightly less expensive than our favorite, the Lazery Sleep.</p>
<p>However, with all of these pluses, the Sound Asleep was brought down a notch for two reasons. First, the pump is not automatic, and so we had to listen for a high-pitched whine, which designated that the mattress was fully inflated or fully deflated.</p>
<p>Second, and more importantly, during our test period, the sides and corners lost air pressure and were squishy, which made it difficult to get up from the mattress. As the manufacturer advises, some deflation is to be expected as the material stretches. But our tests gave ample time for the material to stretch, which suggests that the mattress will further deflate with repeated use.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QQVBGE6/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fox Airbeds &#8211; Plush High-Rise</a> has a couple of nice features, but overall, we found this air mattress doesn’t maintain air pressure. At 80 inches in length, it is by far the most comfortable for a person six-feet and over. Inflation and deflation were good, a little longer than the other air mattresses we tested, but times were still speedy at two-minutes thirty-seconds.</p>
<p>On the negative side, the mattress showed signs of losing firmness after the sixth time we inflated it. We attempted to determine where it was leaking air, and when we pressed down on the foot of the bed, short puffs of air emitted from the mattress’ air valve. As long as we remained in the center of the bed, the mattress provided decent support. But once we shifted to either side, the mattress sagged considerably, making it difficult to get out of the bed.</p>
<p>The mattress’ vinyl isn’t as sturdy as the other air mattresses we tested, plus it was the heaviest at 20 pounds. Outdoor airing didn’t entirely eliminate the vinyl’s PVC odor, and with all of the factors combined with its higher price, we cannot recommend the Fox Airbeds Plush High Rise.</p>
<h3>Aerobed &#8211; Classic</h3>
<p>If you have access to electricity on a campsite, or if you have a car cigarette-lighter adapter, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006FTIY26/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AeroBed &#8211; Classic</a> air mattress is a viable option. An efficient exterior air pump is included, and it quietly inflates the mattress in 30 seconds. It also has a patented quick air release valve that deflates the mattress in a whoosh.</p>
<p>However, we did have considerable difficulty in opening and closing the air valve to insert the pump, and we had to continually add more air since it was leaking out of the tricky valve. We also noticed there was some deflation around the valve by simply pressing down on the mattress.</p>
<p>The Aerobed is nine-inches high, and even though it provided good support for sleeping, it wasn’t easy to get up from since it’s so low to the ground.</p>
<h3>Coleman &#8211; SupportRest Double High Airbed</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6117 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coleman-SupportRest.jpg" alt="Coleman SupportRest Double-High" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coleman-SupportRest.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coleman-SupportRest-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coleman-SupportRest-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coleman-SupportRest-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coleman-SupportRest-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coleman-SupportRest-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coleman-SupportRest-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coleman-SupportRest-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coleman-SupportRest-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coleman-SupportRest-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Coleman is a well-known company that manufactures camping equipment, most notably tents. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HN982C4/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SupportRest Double High Airbed</a> was the most inexpensive of the air mattresses we tested, but we found it to be quite inconvenient for camping.</p>
<p>The mattress has features similar to the other mattresses we tested, but its pull-out, push-in air valve was reminiscent of a pool toy. An air pump is not included (they can be purchased inexpensively online), and we found it awkward and time-consuming to hold a manual air pump in place so it doesn’t pop out of the valve.</p>
<p>During the night, the center of the Coleman remained firm, but by morning, the sides of the mattress had deflated substantially and were “mushy.&#8221; Despite the Coleman’s double height (17 inches), we had to push ourselves up from the center of the mattress.</p>
<p>Deflation was time-consuming. The air must be manually pressed out of the mattress and rolled in stages, while continually squeezing out air, and the process took nearly 15 minutes.</p>
<p>The Coleman doesn’t have a separate storage bag; instead, two pieces of canvas material are attached with heavy-duty cord. Once the mattress is rolled up, you tie it together into a bulky log-shaped package with a handle.</p>
<p>We concluded that we wouldn’t want to be caught in a sudden rainstorm with this air mattress since it takes so long to pack up.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The majority of the mattresses we tested were well-made and mostly survived our barrage of tests. The real challenge, however, proved to be whether they provided comfort and support for a good night’s rest.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017HM59HC/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lazery Sleep</a> rose to the top as the best of the lot with the Insta-Bed coming in at a close second. The Insta-Bed is slightly more expensive than the Lazery Sleep, but both air mattresses are an excellent value and high quality.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After having highly organized marketing professionals test and rate 8 different options, we were able to make our final picks for best planner. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent hours researching, testing and conducting a focus group, and this time we found that the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B164VJS/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Erin Condren &#8211; 2018 Hardbound LifePlanner</a> is one of the best planners for 2018. The Erin Condren&#8217;s quality construction makes it stand out from other cutesy planners on the market. The<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HM2BHYV/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Me and My Big Ideas &#8211; Happy Planner</a> was a close runner-up, with large note-taking sections, a beautiful design and helpful prompts for setting goals.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we tested the planners</h2>
<p>We had a group of professionals at <a href="http://www.siegemedia.com">our content marketing agency</a> (that also runs Your Best Digs) pick a new weekly planner for the coming year.</p>
<p>Each tester used a planner individually for at least as week. Then, we held a focus group so participants could look at all of the planners and rank them. The group ranked the planners in order of best to worst, with 1 being best, and 11 being worst. We averaged the scores to create an average ranking. The lower the score, the better the planner rated. The results of that testing, and all the notes, data and etc, are available in a handy Google doc for your reference, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fTZ2Ji1cwTtyfubgBn6HewL7Pp4_gmU6feL8vFEIY5A/edit">here</a>.</p>
<p>The team was firmly aware that there can’t be a true “best planner” universally &#8212; because in many ways, a planner is an extension of personal preference and style. However, with enough opinions, we definitely feel we can help push you towards a planner you’ll enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>For the 2018 planner testing, we followed a similar process. This time, we added a qualitative element to our focus group and individual testing. We gave each tester surveys with open-ended questions like &#8220;what do you like about this planner?&#8221; and &#8220;what is this planner <em>not</em> good for?&#8221; The result was a more in-depth understanding of what makes the best planners the best, and you&#8217;ll see that reflected in the analysis of this year&#8217;s winners.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075843X8R/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Erin Condren &#8211; 2018 Hardbound LifePlanner</a> was created by a stay-at-home mom (<a href="https://www.erincondren.com/our-story">Erin Condren</a>) who had a passion for design. Her designs, and ultimately her LifePlanner, gained a cult following, and landed her big breaks on Rachel Ray and the Ellen Show. Today, the Erin Condren planner is one of the most blogged-about agendas out there, and it’s loved for more than just its pretty cover art.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B164VJS/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Check out the 2019 edition of this planner here</a>.</p>
<p>Our selective testers were impressed by the amount of writing space it provided. In fact, all but one tester agreed that it has enough room to write down everything they want. It also scored well in overall size, with the majority of respondents noting that it was not too big and heavy, nor too small and light. Everyone who used it said that its fonts were easy to read, and “high quality” was one of the most commonly-used descriptors for this planner.</p>

It's packed with encouraging quotes that may be the pick-me-up you need during a busy workweek. With large note sections and high-quality construction, the Erin Condren planner is the visually pleasing solution to organization.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B164VJS/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The primary tester who used this agenda found the paper and cover to be good quality, and said that it was easy to write in with pens like the ones we tested in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-pens">pen review</a>. They also loved the monthly overview, and were a big fan of the motivational quotes at the end of each week. On the other hand, they caution against using this planner if you’re an avid traveler; it’s a little too big to throw in a carry on.</p>
<p>The Erin Condren comes with a “color-coordinated” place-holder ribbon and finished pages with a splash of color, which means it’ll always look good sitting out on your desk or tabletop. We also like that it comes with a few dot grid pages for those who dabble in bullet journaling.</p>
<p>Other things our testers liked about this planner: it lies almost entirely flat like a book when you open it, which makes writing in it easy. One tester also noted that “the space for each day is just enough” to write their multitude of daily tasks in. If we had to pick something we didn’t like about the Erin Condren, we would say that there isn’t a ton of room for making lists. Some testers also wanted to see more interactive prompts about goals and objectives.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WV9JW2S/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Happy Planner</a> from <a href="http://www.meandmybigideas.com/about/">Me &amp; My Big Ideas</a> is the brainchild of a Mother-Daughter duo who started their business together creating stickers for scrapbooking. This background is evident in their highly-customizable Me &amp; My Big Ideas &#8211; Happy Planner, which is replete with personalizable accessories, and yes, stickers. That being said, it still has all of the features required of a serious (and seriously helpful) planner. In fact, it was a close contender for first place in our tests.</p>

Its large size translates to large and spacious writing areas. Extra features like a section for important dates will make this planner your new go-to, especially those who are goal-oriented.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HM2BHYV/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Our testers all thought that it had attractive, easy to read fonts and a great layout. The majority of our our picky team of testers said that they would definitely commit to using this as their yearly planner. All but one person also said that there’s plenty of room to write in it. Testers loved the fun colors and colorfully-illustrated quotes sprinkled throughout the Happy Planner. They also loved that there was a dedicated birthdays section, enough room to take notes and tabbed sections that make accessing each month easier. Notably, this one is also an 18-month planner, making it perfect for long term and/or academic use, and planning long term project initiatives.</p>
<p>Of course, there are factors that stopped the Happy Planner from being number one, and they almost exclusively have to do with the planner’s construction. The majority of our testers found this planner too heavy for everyday use, and found that the large binding rings made it difficult to write near the center of the planner. This planner is also designed to have removable pages that you tear towards you to remove. So long as you tear them in the right direction, you can also put them back in the binding. However, it’s easy to accidentally tear them out from the side, which makes them impossible to put back in the binding.</p>

<h4>Last year&#8217;s best overall planner</h4>
<p>In 2017 the <a href="http://www.gettoworkbook.com/product/2017-get-to-work-book-classic-chipboard-cover">Get to Work Book</a> was our pick for best planner overall. Our group liked the Get to Work Book’s big, clean areas to write and overall inspirational design. It features large note taking areas, as well as helpful tabs that make flipping through or getting to the right page a breeze. It also includes great monthly reflection sections, as well as a “action items this week” area that makes prioritizing your most important tasks a breeze.</p>
<p>On the negative side, some people had concerns with the Get to Work Book’s size: it’s pretty bulky and will take up significant room on your desk. It’s also slightly masculine looking, which likely accounted for its slightly lower scores from the women in the group. The group also didn&#8217;t rate for price: the Get to Work Book is the most expensive planner we tested, <a href="http://www.gettoworkbook.com/product/2017-get-to-work-book-classic-chipboard-cover">at $50+</a>. Notably, it was also the top-rated planner by men.</p>
<p><strong>Long term testing notes:  </strong>After using this planner for a year, our long-term tester found that it was simply too bulky for his every day use. Despite that, he thought the layout was &#8220;amazing&#8221; and could be an invaluable resource if you don&#8217;t mind lugging it around, or plan to have it stay on your desk.</p>
<div>
<h4>Another planner highly rated by men</h4>
</div>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077119XCB/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Passion Planner</a> was another hit with guys, a second-place pick from three of our male testers. As with the Get to Work it didn’t fare quite as well with women, however, and was number 9 out of 11 in overall ranking once the scores were averaged.</p>
<p>The team liked its monthly reflection areas, built in bookmark and significant note taking sections. The Passion Planner was also unique in having hourly breakdowns by day, which was a bit polarizing: some loved it, some hated it. If this makes sense for your planning style, the Passion Planner could be a great pick. However, if it doesn’t, the hourly breakdowns might feel like detail for the sake of it, and actually get in the way of your daily planning. Overall, the Passion Planner is a solid choice if it fits your scheduling style. The 2019 version is available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B077119XCB/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<h4>The top pick by women</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CZ37KWB/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rifle Paper 17 month agenda</a> received the highest ranking from women, with an average rank of 2. It didn’t fare as well with the men, at a 6.5 average score, but that’s to be expected given its feminine aesthetic. The ban.do wasn&#8217;t too far behind, but on average, it far outpaced the field. The planner was lauded for more than its design inside and out: it also includes motivational quotes on each weekly page, tabs for quick reference, and is nicely sized for toting around or not taking up much space on your desk. Some reviewers noted they didn’t love the thinnish pages and felt like they could rip them out, but that was the only real negative for this planner. The 2018/1019 version is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CZ37KWB/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">available here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Long term testing notes: </strong></p>
<p>Our long term tester for this planner noted that she thought the size of this planner was ideal, with enough room to write everything she wanted to. She liked the weekly and monthly views, and the functional tabs and pockets and durable cover.</p>
<p>Over the course of the year, she found that she didn&#8217;t like the way the monthly sections were separated from the monthly calendar, and she also disliked the daily sections being split into columns. Overall though, she plans to use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D33M71Z/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rifle paper agenda again in</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072P12K7J/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2018</a>.</p>
<h4>Another planner highly rated by women</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bando.com/products/ban-do-17-month-large-agenda-marble-blonde">ban.do marble blonde planner</a> is also a great choice for those who want a feminine look. It’s bursting with personality, and has a huge amount of note taking space. It also comes with two sheets of stickers, making this by far the most “fun” of any the planners we looked at. Overall, the ban.do ranked 3.75 on average with the women, and only slightly lower with the men, at 4 overall. On the negative side, the ban.do is a heavy, bulky planner compared to the rest of the models we tested, and that was a turnoff for some people. However, if you have a big desk and don’t plan on lugging it around, <a href="https://www.bando.com/products/ban-do-17-month-large-agenda-marble-blonde">the ban.do</a> can excel at the job asked of it.</p>
<p><strong>Long term testing notes: </strong></p>
<p>Our long term tester for this planner noted that she liked using the fun stickers over the course of the year, and she appreciated the way monthly and weekly calendars were right next to each other. She also liked all the fun and quirky holidays pre-printed on the calendar pages.</p>
<p>She disliked the planner&#8217;s overall bulkiness, and found it could be improved with a note section in the weekly calendars and a bookmark. The 2019 version is available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CPZ8NS1/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<h4>The rest:</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/9935480321/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Action Day planner</a> is a no frills, no personality planner that confused most of our group. It has 16 pages at the beginning telling you how to use it, which people either loved or hated, and it has no real note taking section besides in the very back of the planner.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.hadronepoch.com/search?type=product&amp;q=*wtf*">WTF planner</a> is another fun option, but it feels more like a book than a planner, with pages that are hard to hold open. This makes it functionally difficult to use and was the main deterrent keeping it from a higher ranking than the 6 average it got from our group.</p>
<p>The team liked the horizontal, <a href="https://www.hadronepoch.com/collections/planners/products/spiral-weekly-planner-gray">undated weekly planner</a>, but came to the conclusion that it&#8217;s more of a supportive device than a standalone. For people who like the quick, constant visual reference, it can be a great desk add-on: but it&#8217;s not something with enough flexibility to be your primary planner.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sugarpaper.com/collections/calendars">Sugar Paper planner </a>was the highest rated option in our &#8220;other&#8221; group. The team liked its big note taking areas, intuitive layouts, and nice design end-to-end. Some didn&#8217;t love the legibility of its gold font or that the weekly views are condensed into one page, when they could have been two.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JSTORY-Medium-Personal-Monthly-Planner/dp/B01CCFU0G4/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Medium Monthly Planner</a> is as minimalist as it comes: essentially paper in a brown shell. That was a turnoff for most looking for better functionality than a simple looking planner like this can offer.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KEU5GOA/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Simple Elephant</a> was well loved by our testers, with a high quality, professional design. Importantly, this was the only planner in which our testers unanimously agreed that there was enough room to write everything. It&#8217;s packed with inspiring prompts for goal setting and objective tracking, and it doubles as a gratitude journal too.</p>
<p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075KQ9NX7/?tag=ybdplan-20'">Freedom Mastery &#8211; Deluxe Law of Attraction Planner</a> was another highly-rated agenda in our tests. It comes chock-full of stickers, prompts and inspiration, acting as part agenda and part vision board. If you like all of the inspiration, the Freedom Mastery may be perfect for you. However, testers looking for something simple wanted to steer clear of this one.</p>
<p>If you <em>are</em> looking for something simple, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B076TCRWV3/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tools4Wisdom </a>planner may be the best choice for you. This one had an academic feel to it, and our testers liked that it had plenty of room in which to write. It&#8217;s got all of the basic facets, like daily, weekly and monthly views. At the end of the day, it&#8217;s just generic, which may be exactly what some people want.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Long story short, if a planner works for you, it&#8217;s the best planner. But some planners are better than others, and a really great planner does more than work: it inspires you to use it and be more organized.</p>
<p>For 2018, we found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075843X8R/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Erin Condren &#8211; 2018 Hardbound LifePlanner</a> is the best planner for achieving that goal. It&#8217;s efficient, attractive and inspiring, all inside a well-constructed binding that&#8217;ll easily last you through the year. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B164VJS/?tag=ybdplan-20">Check out the 2019 edition of this planner here</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WV9JW2S/?tag=ybdplan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Me and My Big Ideas &#8211; Happy Planner</a> is another great option, with removable and re-insertable pages and tabbed months that make staying organized a breeze.
