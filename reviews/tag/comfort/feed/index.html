								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ver the past several weeks, we researched, snoozed and snored our way through seven finalists to determine that the best pillow for neck pain is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0S6LBD/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coop Home Goods &#8211; Eden</a>. This gel-infused shredded memory foam pillow offers down-like comfort and had our testers waking up the next morning refreshed and pain-free. We also liked our two runners-up: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IWM6056/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nature&#8217;s Guest</a> supportive microfiber pillow and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075312Y9Y/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Perform Pillow</a>’s contoured memory foam.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We began by reading up on causes of neck pain and the importance of sleep in general. Next, we explored pillow recommendations from a variety of blogs and articles written by sleep experts. We took into account our previous experience with pillows in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-pillow-for-side-sleepers/">review of the best pillow for side sleepers</a>. We also investigated pillow ratings and user reviews from major retailers like Amazon, Bed Bath and Beyond, Target and Walmart.</p>
<p>While keeping in mind that choosing the right pillow involves a certain amount of personal preference, we ultimately selected seven pillows noted for their ability to provide strong cervical spine support and therefore prevent and/or resolve neck pain. (The cervical spine refers to the seven vertebrae that form the neck.) Our selections are primarily designed for side and back sleepers —  side and back are usually the best sleeping positions for reducing neck pain — and represent a range of materials and price points.</p>

<h2 id="causes">What causes neck pain?</h2>
<p>Neck pain can be the result of <a href="https://www.spine-health.com/conditions/neck-pain/neck-pain-causes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a variety of causes</a>, but the most common one is injury. Neck strains and sprains can be caused by sports, repetitive motions, poor posture (particularly from time spent at the computer or looking down at a phone), whiplash or sleeping in the wrong position.</p>
<p>Age is another factor that can contribute to neck pain as joints become worn out over time. Certain diseases that we are more prone to in our elder years, like arthritis or cancer, can also be contributing factors.</p>
<p>Other causes include stress and anxiety, being overweight or obese and, unfortunately, lack of sleep.</p>
<p>Your favored sleep position also plays an important role. Of the three common sleep positions — back, side and stomach — back or side sleeping are most recommended to avoid neck pain.</p>
<p>Stomach sleeping is not advised because this position requires the head and neck to twist to the side, which places pressure on delicate nerves. Changing your sleep position to either your back or side, while challenging for habitual stomach sleepers, may help resolve chronic neck pain issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spine-health.com/wellness/sleep/pillows-neck-pain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spine Health</a> advises that sleeping with the right type of pillow for your sleeping position can help your neck pain. Sleep experts recommend choosing one that contours to the shape of your head and neck. Pillows that are malleable and/or adjustable can be helpful to achieve the desired contour. <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/say-good-night-to-neck-pain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard Health</a> advises that you avoid pillows which are too high or too stiff.</p>
<p>Back sleepers are usually better off with thinner pillows and side sleepers with something thicker — but the right pillow thickness also depends on the width of your shoulders, size of your head and firmness of your mattress.</p>
<p>Pillows are made from a wide variety of materials, including feathers, down, down alternatives, memory foam, latex, gel fibers and polyester. Pillows that maintain their loft and don’t collapse under the weight of your head are recommended to help alleviate neck pain.</p>
<p>Be sure to contact your doctor if neck pain is severe, lasts for several days without relief, spreads down arms or legs, or is accompanied by headache, numbness, weakness or tingling.</p>
<h2 id="health">How sleep affects your health</h2>
<p>Sleep, of course, impacts your overall health. Lack of sleep can negatively affect your physical health by causing weakened immunity, increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, weight gain and — we now know — neck pain. Cognitively, poor sleep can result in problems with concentration and memory. Emotionally, not getting enough sleep often leads to irritability, anxiety and even depression.</p>
<p>Tips for better sleep:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adults should aim for at least seven hours each night.</li>
<li>Always go to bed and get up around the same time.</li>
<li>Exercise regularly.</li>
<li>Avoid caffeine, alcohol, sugar, extra water and large meals before bed.</li>
<li>Manage stress.</li>
<li>Be wary of daylight-tinted blue light, especially from electronic screens. Read more about light and sleep in our review of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-night-light/">the best night lights</a>.</li>
<li>Keep your bedroom cool.</li>

<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Support</b> When it comes to addressing neck pain, your pillow’s primary job is to place your neck into a neutral position and hold it there while you sleep. Whether this support comes from contoured memory foam or a customizable water base, be sure that your pillow properly aligns your head, neck, shoulders and spine — in whatever your preferred sleeping position may be.</p>
<p><b>Adjustable loft</b> It is becoming increasingly common for pillow manufacturers to offer customization options that allow the user to add or remove filling at home. In some cases, pillow customization requires sending it back to the manufacturer. Water based pillows use varying amounts of water to adjust the pillow’s overall firmness and height.</p>
<p><b>Firmness/softness:</b> We recommend you choose a pillow that is firm enough to provide enough neck support, but soft enough that you enjoy the feeling of laying down to sleep. After all, you will (hopefully!) spend at least seven hours a night with your pillow. See “Materials” section below for more info.</p>
<p><b>Size:</b> Common sizes are standard, queen and king, which correspond to the size of the similarly named mattresses. Sheet sets often include pillowcases for corresponding pillows. Your preference will likely be affected by your own size, the size of your bed and how much you move around at night.</p>
<h3>Materials:</h3>
<p><b>Filling: </b>Some common pillow fills are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feathers and down &#8211; This fill is, warm, malleable, and breathable— but provides little neck support.</li>
<li>Memory foam &#8211; This man-made material will mold and contour around the head and neck. It offers good support and is durable. Memory foam retains heat and can have an unpleasant scent.</li>
<li>Shredded memory foam &#8211; Like standard memory foam pillows, these pillows are supportive and durable. They are also more moldable to contour around the head and neck.</li>
<li>Polyester gel fibers &#8211; A gel pillow is not actually filled with any liquid-like substance. Instead, the gel is infused into solid polyester fibers. The resulting fibers feel similar to down, but offer more support. This material is often used for its cooling properties.</li>
<li>Microfiber &#8211; This used to be the primary filling for pillows, but memory foam and latex pillows are now more popular since they tend to offer better support. Polyester is one common type of microfiber.</li>
<li>Latex &#8211; This material is breathable, soft to the touch and springs back quickly. It does not hold its loft as well as memory foam products do.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Covers: </b>A range of both natural and synthetic materials are used to cover pillows, including cotton, polyester and blends. Products derived from bamboo are popular recently and offer a soft, silky feel.</p>
<p>Consider whether the pillow cover is removable and machine-washable.</p>
<p><b>Allergies: </b>Many of the products we tested were hypoallergenic. Pillows containing materials like feathers or latex may cause issues for some sensitive individuals. People who are prone to dust allergies might also want to consider removable covers or machine-washable pillows for ease of laundering when making their decision.</p>
<p><b>Trial period: </b>Many pillow manufacturers offer trial periods. Some of these periods are advertised for as long as a year, but be sure to read the fine print. In some cases, the manufacturer only honors the trial period if you buy directly from them. Amazon typically offers a 30-day return policy.</p>
<h2 id="how-tested">How we tested</h2>

    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pillow-testing.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Before testing, we unpacked our seven finalists and followed individual product instructions to prepare each pillow. Several came vacuum-compressed and needed time in the dryer to fluff up. The two water pillows required adding a measured amount of water via funnel and removing remaining air pockets. Others were ready to use right out of the box.</p>
<p>Next, we recruited three product testers to sleep with each of the pillows over a three week period On a scale of one to 10, they rated overall comfort levels each morning, and ranked pillow preferences based on how well they supported the neck region. All of our pillow testers identified as alternating between side and back sleeping positions and have experienced intermittent neck pain.</p>
<p>Finally, we closely inspected each pillow to assess its loft, overall support, lumpiness, thickness, softness, contour shape and any other features that caught our attention. We also explored customization options and overall ease of care.</p>

<p>All of our pillow testers agree that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0S6LBD/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coop Home Goods &#8211; Eden</a> is the best pillow for neck pain. This cross-cut, gel-infused memory foam and microfiber pillow is luxuriously comfortable, customizable and — most importantly — cradles your head and neck perfectly so that you remain pain-free and get a good night’s sleep. (Not surprisingly, Coop Home Goods was also picked as <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-pillow-for-side-sleepers/">the best pillow for side sleeping</a>!)</p>
<p>The opulent experience begins when the Eden arrives on your doorstep. It comes beautifully packaged in a custom box, with a slogan announcing “A pillow as unique as you are.&#8221; As instructed, we prepared our pillow by placing it in the dryer on low for 10 minutes. Although there was a very slight off-gassing odor from the foam when we first received the product, this dissipated quickly.</p>
<p>The pillow comes complete with an extra bag of filling, which was a nice touch for anyone desiring additional support. Coop Home Goods suggests that side sleepers try the pillow as-is before adding foam. Back sleepers are encouraged to remove about a quarter of the foam from their pillow, and stomach sleepers to remove a third of the foam. Free customization assistance is also offered via a phone support line. Our testers felt that the Eden came with the right amount of filling right out of the box.</p>
<p>The filling is made from a combination of 80-percent visco-elastic foam (memory foam) with infused gel beads and 20-percent polyester fiber, which sounds sort of goopy, but in actuality feels very soft and down-like. The combination of foam and fibers is designed to prevent clumping and promote airflow, which keeps you both cool and comfortable. This particular foam is cross cut into very small pieces, which also helped avoid lumps.</p>

This pillow provides excellent support for sore necks.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0S6LBD/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The soft outer cover has gusseted edges, which help distribute the filling evenly regardless of your sleeping position. You can opt to sleep directly on this cover or use a traditional pillow case on top. It is made from polyester and viscose (derived from bamboo) and is nicely breathable and soft to the touch. The pillow has a zippered polyester inner cover which holds the filling when washing the outer cover.</p>
<p>The pillow feels heavy and firmer than a traditional poly-fill or down pillow, but it is still soft enough to welcome you to bed. We liked that the Eden was more fluffy than runners-up from Nature’s Guest or Perform Pillow without compromising neck support.</p>
<p>The best thing about the Eden was how well it held its loft under the pressure of one’s head and neck. We were pleasantly surprised by how such a cuddly, cloudlike pillow could also provide such strong support to keep our heads, necks and spines in alignment throughout the night.</p>
<p>To maintain the pillow, instructions state to place it in the dryer on low for 10 minutes every six months. Both the pillow and cover are machine-washable, but the agitation isn&#8217;t good for the foam.</p>
<p>This product is made in the USA. The manufacturer offers a 100-night trial, satisfaction guarantee and a 5-year warranty.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>

<p>Like the Coop Home Goods &#8211; Eden, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075312Y9Y/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Perform Pillow &#8211; CSP-03 Memory Foam</a> Neck Pillow managed to be both soft and welcoming while also supporting the neck in all the right places. While not technically customizable, this contoured memory foam pillow can be used in one of four positions to adjust to different sized individuals and/or a variety of sleeping positions.</p>
<p>This pillow offers a very different sleeping experience than Coop Home Goods. Unlike our shredded memory foam winner, Perform Pillow’s single piece of foam can’t be manipulated and shaped around your bumps and curves; instead, you need to rely on its pre-formed shape. We tried the medium profile option though it also comes in thick or thin variations. While we found the contours worked well for us, some people may find that it takes a little getting used to.</p>
<p>The product states that it can take up to 2 weeks for your neck to fully adjust. Our testers were pleased to enjoy comfortable, sound sleep from the first use.</p>

<p>Made from Certi-PUR certified polyurethane foam, Perform Pillow comes ready-to-use right out of the box. Unlike some of the other foam pillows tested, it didn’t put off any unpleasant odor. Both long sides of the pillow have a different shaped contour, so you can choose which way you place it for the best fit. Alternatively, you can turn the pillow upside down and use either edge for two more positioning options. Two of our testers preferred using the contoured side up, with the higher shaped contoured edge supporting the neck; the other preferred the lower contour shape.</p>
<p>Perform’s soft and removable zippered cover is made from Kool-Flow, a bamboo-and-polyester fabric with a &#8220;micro-vented&#8221; texture. The cover is machine-washable in cold water and can be dried with low heat. If you choose to use the pillow in the inverted position, we recommend replacing the outer cover with a standard pillow case, since the zipper runs along the middle of the back side and would be uncomfortable to sleep on.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>

<p>Like the Perform Pillow, this contoured, microfiber-filled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IWM6056/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nature&#8217;s Guest &#8211; Support Pillow</a> takes some getting used to, but is well worth any adjustment period for the excellent cervical support it offers. Unlike the Perform or Eden, the unique shape allows for a specific sweet spot in the middle of the pillow that gives Nature’s Guest a particularly high-level of support.</p>
<p>This unusually shaped pillow — which boasts a patent-pending doctor-recommended design — provides the perfect resting place for your weary neck and helps maintain proper head, neck and spinal alignment while you sleep. Nature’s Guest is notably heavier and firmer than our other finalists and as a result, we weren’t expecting to find it particularly comfortable. We were wrong!</p>
<p>We found this pillow particularly beneficial for sleepers who move around a lot, such as when shifting from a side to back position. We liked that we could rest our head either in the center indented portion of the pillow, or along one of the higher, outer edges. This gave some flexibility through the night as sleeping positions shifted.</p>

<p>The pillow arrives vacuum-packed. You can opt to either fluff it by hand or place in the dryer for five minutes to inflate to normal size. The Nature’s Guest, which uses polyester fill, can then be customized by either removing some filling or putting extra inside. Like Coop Home Goods, Nature&#8217;s Guest ships their pillow with a bag of extra filling so there’s no need to send it back for customization.</p>
<p>The cotton cover is satin-trimmed with gusseted sides, which are particularly helpful for side sleeper support.  Zippered openings on both ends make customization simple.</p>
<p>Perhaps our biggest complaint is that this pillow requires hand washing. A customer satisfaction guarantee allows returns within 30 days for a full refund, no questions asked.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Nature’s Guest &#8211; Support Pillow has a uniquely shaped, contoured design that provides excellent cervical support.</li>
<li>Although heavy and firm, the well-designed shape allows for an extremely comfortable night’s rest.</li>
<li>The pillow can be customized by adding or removing microfiber fill.</li>
<li>Unlike most of our other finalists, this product is not machine washable.</li>

<h3>Chiroflow &#8211; Water Pillow</h3>
<p>We were excited to try out the concept of an adjustable water pillow with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AHDIHSC/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chiroflow</a>. The experience was somewhat different than anticipated. While we found the pillow reasonably supportive of the head and neck, we didn’t have any obvious sensation of sleeping on water — other than a nagging fear that the pillow would leak in the middle of the night and we’d wake up in a puddle. (Don’t worry, that didn’t actually happen!)</p>
<p>The water bladder was located beneath a comfortably soft, thick layer of polyester fill and provided adjustable firmness. The water lent a hefty weight to the pillow, which helped keep it in place through the night.</p>
<p>We did notice a vague shifting sensation of the water redistributing when we moved around, but because it was below the padded layer, this sensation didn’t resemble anything like sleeping on a waterbed. So if you are prone to seasickness, don’t worry, we don’t think using this pillow will be a problem.</p>
<p>Initially customizing Chiroflow was a challenge. The detailed instructions recommended adding varying amounts of water based on your preferred sleeping position. A small plastic funnel is provided to assist this process and pouring in the water was simple. You can add any amount you like — the more water added, the firmer the pillow. Exact measurement recommendations are provided.</p>
<p>The challenging part was removing the remaining air pocket, which involved squeezing air out of the water bladder while simultaneously capping the opening and (hopefully) not getting water everywhere. If you don’t successfully remove the entire air pocket, you can hear (and feel) the water sloshing around, which interferes with a good night’s rest. Preparing the pillow properly required an extra set of hands.</p>
<p>Chiroflow, along with Mediflow — the other water pillow manufacturer whose pillow we tested — were the only finalists that proved their designs in clinical testing. An independent clinical study by Johns Hopkins ranked Mediflow &#8220;best&#8221; for how quickly subjects fell asleep, how few times subjects woke up, their perception of sleep compared to normal, overall quality of sleep and reduction of neck pain.</p>
<p>While Chiroflow wasn’t our top choice pillow for neck pain, the combination of comfortable fill and a responsive, supportive, adjustable water base make it a good option for neck support. Also, the entire pillow can be machine-washed and dried and comes with a 30-day satisfaction guarantee.</p>
<h3>Mediflow &#8211; Waterbase Pillow</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003J372NS/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mediflow &#8211; Waterbase Pillow</a> is almost indistinguishable from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AHDIHSC/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chiroflow &#8211; Water Pillow</a>. The only difference involves the material of the outer cover. Mediflow’s is made from 100-percent cotton as opposed to Chiroflow’s 65-percent polyester and 35-percent cotton.</p>
<p>Overall, we ranked the Chiroflow slightly higher than the Mediflow for its noticeably softer cover. Both pillows are the exact same design, involve the same customization set up and provide equally effective neck support.</p>
<h3>Snuggle-Pedic &#8211; Kool-Flow</h3>
<p>We don’t recommend purchasing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PBFP0S6/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Snuggle-Pedic &#8211; Kool-Flow</a> to avoid or alleviate neck pain. This pillow was too tall and stiff for comfortable neck support in any sleeping position. Instead, it placed the neck at an uncomfortable angle that resulted in all three of our testers abandoning it in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>We tried the queen size, though there are also king and standard size options.</p>
<p>Snuggle-Pedic is made from shredded polyurethane foam. Although it held its loft well, there was simply too much of it to sleep on comfortably and there is no zippered access to remove the excess. Beyond that, it felt lumpy and had a strong, unpleasant, chemical-like smell. The smell did not entirely dissipate even after airing out for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>The micro-vented cover, made from bamboo viscose, polyester and lycra, was soft and breathable — but not removable. This is a plus for anyone who wants to avoid zippers, but a negative for anyone who wants the ability to wash the cover solo. You can opt to wash the entire pillow in cold water either by hand or via machine with minimum agitation, then squeeze out excess water and dry with high heat.</p>
<p>Although the product states you can gather and reshape the pillow to allow it to contour to your head and neck, we did not find this to be the case. No matter how we tried to reshape it, in the end it simply wasn’t comfortable.</p>
<p>While the company claims free customizations during an 120-day sleep trial (which may have helped by removing some of the excess foam), the fine print states this benefit will only apply if you purchase the product directly from Relief-Mart, Inc. The same goes for the offer of free return shipping and their 20-year warranty.</p>
<p>Even if you did purchase direct, who wants to deal with shipping their entire brand new pillow back to the manufacturer for customization? Not us.</p>
<h3>Brooklyn Bedding &#8211; Talalay Latex</h3>
<p>We were not fans of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WJ0AHRK/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brooklyn Bedding &#8211; Talalay Latex</a> for proper neck support, either. We tried the plush version, which does not hold its loft at all. It was similar to sleeping on a giant sponge that compresses under the weight of your head and then quickly springs back to its original shape when you get up. This didn’t do our necks any favors.</p>
<p>Brooklyn Bedding is molded from 100-percent latex rubber foam and has a soft, zippered, removable and breathable cover which is machine washable. The cover is very nice.</p>
<p>Perhaps this pillow might be a better option for stomach sleepers who are not concerned with neck pain. It also comes in a firm variety which may offer better cervical support than this one did.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Overall, we believe that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0S6LBD/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coop Home Goods &#8211; Eden</a> is the best pillow option on the market for anyone experiencing, or who wants to avoid, neck pain. The cross-cut, gel-infused memory foam and microfiber fill is comfortable, adjustable and — most importantly — provides the perfect cushion to cradle your neck. It is designed to align your head, neck and shoulders into a neutral position for a pain-free, restful night’s sleep.</p>
<p>We also slept well with our two runners-up: the Perform Pillow and the Nature&#8217;s Guest.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075312Y9Y/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Perform Pillow &#8211; Memory Foam</a> was soft and welcoming, while supporting the neck in all the right places. The contoured memory foam can be used in one of four positions to adjust to different sizes and preferences. Because the pillow can’t be manipulated like the shredded memory foam of our winner, it might take users some adjustment to get used to it.</p>
<p>The fiber-filled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IWM6056/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nature&#8217;s Guest</a> also performed well in our product testing. This adjustable, firm and heavy microfiber pillow offered good neck support with its unusual contoured shape. Due to this unique design, we found this pillow especially beneficial for sleepers who frequently change positions during the night.</p>

<h2 id="what-is">What is a flip chair?</h2>
<p>A flip chair is also known as a convertible or folding bed mattress. It’s composed of a repositionable metal frame, covered with a thin layer of polyurethane foam or polyester fiber and encased within a layer of foam that’s generally four inches thick. The frame and foam are fit into a polyester cover, similar to a cushioned patio lounger. The cover is usually removable for cleaning.</p>

<p>When laid out completely flat on the floor, the frame can be used as a temporary bed for overnight guests or for kids&#8217; sleepover. The frame is divided into three sections, which allow you to fold it up into a lounger with a head rest or a compact chair that can fit in a small living area or bedroom. Since the folded-up chair has no legs — usually just non-skid feet — it’s usually only about 8 inches up off the floor.</p>
<p>Flip chairs are popular with students who have small dorm rooms or people who live in studio apartments, where space is limited. They’re also great for kids’ sleepovers or for just hanging out and watching television or gaming.</p>
<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected flip chairs to test</h2>
<p>Despite flip chairs’ popularity with students and parents, there aren’t many manufacturers who make them. Some high-end furniture companies sell their version of a flip chair, but they’re more expensive than what you can find online.</p>
<p>Flip chairs are available in several sizes, but we focused our search on the standard size, which is 6-½ feet long when completely flat and 28 inches wide. That&#8217;s narrower than a twin-size bed, but similar to a camping bed. (Some Amazon reviewers of flip chairs actually do take them on camping trips, since they fit inside a tent and are more comfortable than sleeping on hard ground on a pad or sleeping bag.) The standard flip chair size is the one that’s most often purchased for dorm rooms and sleepovers, as it can be easily stored and unfolded when needed.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, flip chairs can be pricey. Although they’re not constructed of expensive materials, and sometimes the foam is not the highest quality, flip chairs can be priced at $200 or higher. We selected four flip chairs that are in the more reasonable $100 range.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L6YW0YI/?tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Your Zone Bed</a> flip chair is very similar to the other flip chairs we tested, but it’s a lot more comfortable. Its metal frame is sandwiched between two thick layers of foam, which cushion the bottom of the flip chair when it’s folded out flat. This extra foam gave an additional measure of comfort when we tested it as a bed. Also, the upper half of the foam is covered with a polyester-fiber mesh that softens the rough texture of the foam.</p>
<p>Much like other flip beds, Your Zone’s ultra-suede cover has two zippered sections: A long middle section and a headrest. None of the flip chairs’ covers have a zipper on the lower third. Consequently, the middle and upper sections can be machine washed, and the lower third can only be spot-cleaned. This section should be less prone to getting stained, but it&#8217;s something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Your Zone has five positions, which are adjusted by lifting the headrest until it locks into place. To unfold it, the headrest is pushed down to the middle section and released. When flat, Your Zone’s frame has a slight curvature that flattens when you lie down. This buckle gives the foam added flexibility, so it feels somewhat like a bed mattress.</p>

<p>For the next position, the headrest needs to be folded over, creating a pillow (albeit, a hard one), which shortens the 6-½ foot bed by 14 inches. This second position was always the most uncomfortable with all of the flip beds we tested.</p>
<p>Third and fourth positions turn the flip chair into a lounger, which is ideal for watching television or gaming. Both give good back support, but the fourth position is a bit more elevated and more comfortable.</p>
<p>For the fifth position, the headrest is fully upright, and the bottom third folds up and onto the middle section, transforming it into a chair. It’s low to the ground, but Your Zone’s flexible foam has some give to it like sofa cushions, and we found it to be the most comfy for watching TV.</p>
<p>The Your Zone Bed flip chair is priced comparably with the other flip chairs we tested — a little over $100 — but we found it to be better constructed for comfort. If you’re looking for a versatile piece of furniture for a small space or a sleepover, this is the flip chair you should get.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Your Zone Bed flip chair is a versatile piece of furniture that can change from a comfy chair to a temporary fold-out bed anywhere and any time an extra bed is needed.</li>
<li>It’s priced about the same as other flip chairs, but it’s better constructed for comfort.</li>
<li>The Your Zone Bed flip chair is great for a dorm room or studio apartment where space is limited or for kids’ sleepovers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="others">Other flip chairs we tested</h2>
<h3>Best Choice Products &#8211; SKY1814</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VQYBXV4/?tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Best Choice Products</a> flip chair has a substantial frame that resembles a lawn or patio lounge chair. It has a pristine polyurethane foam that feels like memory foam and looks brand new. However, when the flip chair is laid flat into the bed position, the foam has an odd crunchy texture and crackles when it’s pressed down.</p>
<p>Although the Best Choice was comfortable as a bed and as an upright chair, there was no flexibility in its foam or frame, which made every other position uncomfortable. Its small non-skid feet needed to be screwed into the frame, which wasn’t difficult to do. However, the feet are screwed through the bottom of the chair’s cover, so should you ever need to wash it, the feet need to be unscrewed first; a design feature we found inconvenient.</p>
<h3>Giantex &#8211; HW52445GR</h3>
<p>In appearance, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IR61GL0/z/tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Giantex</a> is almost identical to the Your Zone Bed and Best Choice Products. It has five adjustable positions, a removable ultra-suede cover (erroneously advertised as cotton) and is approximately the same length, height and width. Three of its five positions, however, were hard and unyielding — even napping on it was unpleasant.</p>
<p>When we inspected underneath the cover, we discovered that its frame is a metal checkerboard shape, which may account for why it’s such an uncomfortable chair/bed. More disturbing was the condition of the foam: Dirty with debris and wood bits, as though it had been dragged along a factory floor. Clearly, Giantex doesn’t use high-quality foam for its overpriced product.</p>
<h3>Magshion &#8211; FCOF27</h3>
<p>Described as a folding bed mattress, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LS1OXEO/?tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Magshion</a> flip chair is actually just a foldable futon. Its polyurethane foam is divided into three equal sections and covered with a polyester-cotton cover that’s available in sixteen colors. It’s slightly shorter and narrower than other flip beds, and since it has no frame, the Magshion can’t be used as a chair unless you’re leaning up against a couch or wall.</p>
<p>It’s available in five sizes, and although the single size that we tested was $80, the other sizes are absurdly expensive for what’s little more than a lawn-furniture pad.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>A flip chair is a fun and convenient furniture option for a small room or apartment. Although their metal frames are sturdy, the foam will lose its density over time, so we wouldn’t recommend replacing a bed mattress with a flip chair. However, it’s great for short-term use or sleepovers, and we like how the flip chair can be transformed in seconds from a lounger to an upright chair.</p>
<p>The best flip chair that we tested is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L6YW0YI/?tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Your Zone Bed</a>. Its flexible frame sandwiched between thick foam proved to be comfortable in all of its five adjustable positions. Whether you want to nap, hang out with friends or just lounge around with your dog or cat, the versatile Your Zone Bed flip chair will suit your needs.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e tested the most popular sit-up pillows to find the one that gives you total back support while cushioning you in comfort. Hands down, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073DJFYB1/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Linenspa</a> is the best sit-up pillow for reading in bed, watching television, gaming or any other leisure activity. Stuffed with high-quality shredded memory foam, the Linenspa is both supportive and plush at the same time. Another great choice is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0733ZCSR9/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Milliard</a> reading pillow, which is soft and cuddly but supportive of back muscles as well.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected sit-up pillows to test</h2>
<p>A sit-up pillow really has one purpose: give you back support while you’re reading or watching television in bed or on a couch. But after we read through Amazon consumer reviews, we learned that people also buy sit-up pillows to sit upright in bed after surgery or to help relieve chronic back pain.</p>
<p>The sit-up pillows we decided to test were recommended by reviewers for correcting posture while they were lounging to support back and neck muscles. But the pillows had to be comfortable, too; nobody enjoys sitting against a hard piece of foam.</p>
<p>We chose pillows that were stuffed with shredded memory foam, since it can be both firm and plush at the same time. People who buy a sit-up pillow for back pain often buy a bed wedge pillow, so we tested one of the most popular wedge pillows to see how it compared to traditional sit-up bed pillows</p>

<p>Many of the hundreds of models and styles of sit-up pillows look identical. During our testing we discovered that they’re not all alike. The following features of the best sit-up pillow will help you decide which one is right for you.</p>
<p><b>Size: </b>Most sit-up pillows have a similar shape: triangular with two armrests on each side. If you’re looking for a sit-up pillow that gives you both lower and upper back support, you’ll need one that is as tall as your entire back: The top of the pillow should reach your shoulders at the base of your neck. A shorter sit-up pillow will only support your lower back muscles, and you’ll feel the strain on your upper back muscles after a few minutes.</p>
<p>Two of the pillows we tested are available in several sizes. Before purchasing a sit-up pillow, we recommend measuring the length of your back and comparing it to the height of the pillow. We found that the extra-large size (24 inches) gives better back support to a tall person than the standard size (18 inches) does.</p>
<p><b>Long armrests: </b>Many sit-up pillows have short, stubby armrests that only reach as far as your elbows. Depending on the length of your arms, the short armrests may not even touch your elbows, which means you need to keep your arms elevated when you’re reading. Look for a sit-up pillow that has armrests that reach the base of your wrists. The extra length will support your elbows so you can hold a book and also cushion your arms when you’re watching television or just resting.</p>
<p><b>Materials: </b>All of the sit-up pillows we tested had a polyester cover, usually an ultra-suede or velour. Except for one of the pillows we tested, their covers can be removed and washed.</p>
<p>The best sit-up pillow is stuffed with shredded memory foam, which is often encased within its own separate cover. As we discussed in our reviews for the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-cooling-pillow/#important-features">best cooling pillow</a> and the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-pillow-for-side-sleepers/#features">best pillow for side sleepers</a>, the memory foam should be CertiPUR-certified. <a href="https://certipur.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CertiPUR</a> tests polyurethane foams used in bedding for hazardous contaminants. Look for a label on the sit-up pillow that it’s been CertiPUR certified; otherwise, you could be breathing in toxic gases emitted from the foam.</p>
<h2 id="prepping">Prepping a sit-up pillow</h2>
<p>Many Amazon consumers are surprised that their sit-up pillow isn’t ready for immediate use when it’s delivered. Manufacturers compress the sit-up pillow, roll it and vacuum-seal it in plastic before shipping. When the pillow arrives, it needs to be released from the plastic, laid out flat and, as suggested by instructions, allowed to expand 24 to 48 hours.</p>
<p>We found, however, that the pillows fully expanded overnight. Although it’s not stated, we suspect that the 24-to-48-hour time period is to allow for off-gassing. Memory foam is notorious for its pungent chemical odor, which eventually dissipates. Since the majority of sit-up pillows are stuffed with memory foam, it’s best practice to let the pillow air out — we aired the test pillows on an outdoor patio — for two or three days.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073DJFYB1/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Linenspa</a> was, by far, the most comfortable sit-up pillow we tested. Stuffed with shredded CertiPUR-certified memory foam, the Linenspa feels supportive and plush at the same time. Imagine your most comfy chair or sofa, and you’ll get a sense of what it’s like to settle into the Linenspa.</p>
<p>We tested the generously stuffed extra-large size, which gave full-back support while we sat in bed. The Linenspa has long (15 inches) and extra-wide (10 inches) armrests — the widest of all the pillows we tested — and they accommodated our forearms all the way to the palms of our hands.</p>
<p>The Linenspa is well made with strong stitching and thick fabric that’s been dyed a richly hued deep blue. (It’s also available in stone gray.) Unlike the other pillows we tested, the Linenspa doesn’t have a zipper for removing the cover. After testing, however, we decided that being able to remove the cover isn’t important, because once it’s been washed, the cover will shrink somewhat and be difficult to stuff the pillow back inside, especially into the armrests.</p>
<p>The Linenspa has a strong handle so we could easily drag it from the bedroom to the living room. We tested it on the couch, and it was slightly less comfortable, because its size takes up half the space of the sofa cushion. But once we shifted our position and sat more upright — as we were supposed to do — we never wanted to leave.</p>

Stuffed with CertiPUR-certified memory foam, we detected almost no unpleasant odors while using it.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073DJFYB1/?tag=sitpil-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Finally, we tried the Linenspa while sitting on the floor. Although the pillow does stay upright on its own, you do need to lean up against something if you want to use it for support. We did this same test with the other pillows, and we simply didn’t find any of them comfortable on the floor.</p>
<p>There was almost no off-gassing from this pillow, and although some Amazon reviewers complain about a heavy dye odor, we detected no strong smells from it.</p>
<p>The Linenspa is priced at $50, which is about average for a quality sit-up pillow. For $10 less, It’s also available in a smaller size, which is about one-third the size of the extra-large. For children and teens that size makes sense. The extra-large is quite heavy to lug around, so the standard size might also be better for the elderly who are bed-ridden.</p>
<p>Unlike the other pillows we tested, the Linenspa feels exceptionally durable. It supports upper and lower back and corrects posture while cushioning you in comfort.</p>
<p><b>Key takeways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Linenspa provides full support to upper and lower back and is also the most comfortable of the pillows we tested.</li>
<li>Its filling is made of shredded CertiPUR-certified memory foam, so it’s safe from hazardous contaminants.</li>
<li>The Linenspa’s armrests are extra-long and extra-wide, so you can rest the entire length of your arm.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the standard size <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0733ZCSR9/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Milliard reading pillow</a> is too small for a tall person, it gives excellent support to middle- and lower-back muscles. It looks and feels like a floppy stuffed toy, so we were surprised at how firm the Milliard was when we propped it against the bed headboard and couch cushion. Although its dangling arms barely extended past our elbows, we gathered them to our sides and comfortably rested our arms on them.</p>
<p>The Milliard is stuffed with shredded CertiPUR-certified memory foam, and if you want a firmer pillow, Milliard will send additional filling upon request. It has a soft polyester velour cover, which can be removed for washing or spot-cleaning.</p>

The standard size is too small for a tall person, but the extra-large size is just right.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0733ZCSR9/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Milliard is available in two additional sizes: petite (14-inches tall) for a child and extra large (24-inches tall) for a tall person. The Milliard runs about $10 more than the Linenspa for the extra-large size, but it&#8217;s also a quality sit-up pillow that we recommend.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Milliard may seem too soft and floppy, but it gives surprisingly good support to middle- and lower-back muscles.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s stuffed with CertiPUR-certified memory foam, so you can feel confident it won&#8217;t emit toxic gases.</li>
<li>The Milliard extra-large size is $10 more than the Linenspa, but it&#8217;s also an excellent option.</li>

<h3>mittaGonG</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GJBW5ZM//tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">mittaGonG reading pillow</a> gave good support to the lower back muscles, but because it’s only 20-inches high (the only size available) and not generously stuffed near the top, it can’t reach the upper back or neck. We found the mittaGong comfortable for watching television in bed, because we could lean back against the headboard. However, because of its short armrests, it was tiring to keep our elbows propped up to hold a book up for more than 10 minutes.</p>
<p>The mittaGonG seemed well made with a nice velour case and strong stitching. It’s stuffed with shredded memory foam, but it’s not CertiPUR-certified. Without the CertiPUR certification, you can’t trust what gasses might be emitted from the mittaGonG’s memory foam.</p>
<h3>Hit Notion &#8211; Husband Pillow</h3>
<p>Most reading pillows are known as “husband pillows,” apparently because they provide security, comfort and support. (Recently they’ve been renamed “boyfriend pillows.”) Hit Notion’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WLBH2T/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Husband Pillow</a> is one of the most popular on Amazon and is available in a rainbow of colors. It’s about the same size as the mittaGonG pillow, so it gives good lower-back support. A detachable neck roll is included, and it bolsters the neck but not the upper back.</p>
<p>The Husband Pillow’s armrests were splayed too far apart, so we could only rest our elbows and no other part of our arms comfortably. It’s a well-constructed pillow, and style-wise, we liked the two large buttons that connect the head roll to the top of the pillow. The Husband Pillow is also stuffed with shredded memory foam, and like the mittaGonG pillow, it’s not CertiPUR certified.</p>
<h3>X-tra Comfort Bed Wedge</h3>
<p>The bed wedge is popular with people who suffer chronic back pain, since its wedge shape promotes a completely upright posture and spine alignment. However, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U6HMK78//tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">X-tra Comfort</a> bed wedge is a misnomer, since it was the most uncomfortable of the pillows we tested. The bed wedge is designed solely for the bed; on the couch it was like leaning against a wood plank.</p>
<p>The X-tra Comfort wedge is made of two extra-stiff pieces of memory foam (not shredded, not CertiPUR), covered in a cheap-feeling velour case. The large wedge is intended for back support; the purpose for the smaller wedge is a mystery. The company’s website shows photos of placing the wedges under the model’s knees. We tried it, but elevating legs and feet as illustrated put strain on the lower back.</p>
<p>It’s also suggested that the wedge can be used as a sleeping pillow. Perhaps, if you enjoy sleeping on a rock. There are a number of bed wedges on the market, so pass this one by.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you love reading in bed, binging on Netflix or just lounging around on a lazy Sunday morning, you might be bolstering yourself up with extra pillows, which can strain your back muscles and neck.</p>
<p>We selected the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073DJFYB1/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Linenspa</a> as the best sit-up pillow for providing full-back support and cushy comfort. Its extra-long and extra-wide armrests support your entire arm rather than just the elbow, and it’s the only pillow we tested that was so plush we never wanted to get up. The Linenspa is well made with quality fabric and strong stitching, and at $50 for the extra-large size you’re definitely getting your money’s worth.</p>
<p>We also liked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0733ZCSR9/?tag=ybdsitpil" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Milliard</a> reading pillow, which feels soft and floppy but gives excellent support to the middle- and lower-back muscles. The standard size is too small for a tall person, and though its extra-large size is $10 more than the Linenspa, it&#8217;s also a great option for providing full back support in bed or on the couch.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We tested the top kid and adult bean bag chairs for durability, comfort and style and found that the Lumaland was the coziest and sturdiest. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent four weeks rigorously chilling, cuddling and sleeping on eight of the top-selling bean bag chairs on the market. We tested durability, washed the covers and researched safety of filling materials and in the end, found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073VQSJ45/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lumaland &#8211; Luxury Bean Bag Chair</a> to be the best bean bag chair. Lumaland stood out because of its shredded foam filling and quality microsuede cover. All our testers loved this bag’s back support and how easy it was to change the cover making machine washing a breeze. For a kid-sized bean bag, we found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008AE0WV0/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Big Joe &#8211; Dorm Bean Bag Chair</a> stood out from the competition because of its comfort, easy-to-clean cover and lightweight design.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We began our research by consulting online reviews from respected retailers like Amazon, Target and Walmart. User reviews from these sites were used to find out which features are important to consumers, and to determine the leading bean bag chair brands. We also read subreddits such as /r/furniture/, where consumers discussed which bean bag chairs had proved to be good purchases.</p>
<p>After determining which bean bags received a high number of positive user reviews, we narrowed down our list by excluding luxury bean bags that were over $200. We excluded luxury bean bags because our research found similar enthusiasm from reviewers for luxury and midrange ($50-$150) versions, so we chose bean bags that would deliver the most value.</p>
<p>Next we researched technical components of bean bag filling materials. We found the two most popular filling materials were polystyrene beads or shredded foam. It was important that our list of finalists contain bean bags filled with both types of material, so that we could put the two most popular materials to the test.</p>

[table id=125 /]
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Filling material</b>: All of our bean bag finalists were filled with either a type of expandable polystyrene (EPS) bead or shredded foam. EPS is the same material used in disposable coffee cups and packaging peanuts. It is a good material for bean bag chairs because it is lightweight and can hold its form for several years.</p>
<p>EPS is not biodegradable, but EPS beads may be recycled. Bean bags that use recycled EPS beads have a shorter lifespan than those that use non-recycled EPS beads. Unfortunately, this means that consumers who want to “go green” and use recycled EPS beads may end up having to refill their bean bags sooner than those who opt for non-recycled EPS beads.</p>
<p>Only one of the bean bag chairs we tested specified whether its EPS beads were made from recycled or non-recycled material. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008AE0WV0/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Big Joe &#8211; Dorm</a> uses <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0055DXQS0/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Megahh Beads</a>, which is Big Joe’s proprietary formula. The company claims this material has no recycled components. Our other bean bag chairs did not specify whether their EPS beads were made with recycled or new material.</p>
<p>Shredded foam is also popular as bean bag chair filling because of its high density and comfort. This is a heavier material that often requires the consumer to break apart large foam pieces by massaging the foam within a cover. If the foam is not broken up enough, irregular-shaped foam chunks can be uncomfortable when sitting. However, when broken in correctly, this material provides a high degree of comfort.</p>
<p><b>Cover material:</b> Durability, comfort and style are all important considerations when choosing a bean bag cover. We tested bean bags with microsuede, cotton, vinyl and polyester coverings — all durable materials that minimize tearing and bleaching.</p>
<p>Half of the bean bags we tested had removable covers which could be washed or switched with ease. This removability is especially important for microsuede or cotton covers, which are best cleaned in the washing machine. Spot cleaning is often adequate for bean bag chairs with vinyl or polyester covers.</p>

<p>Removable bean bag covers use zippers, therefore zipper quality is very important to the overall removability of the cover. More secure bean bags use double zipper systems that ensure the bean bag cover does not gradually slide open.</p>
<p><b>Size: </b>How much floor space are you willing to devote to your bean bag chair? Bean bags are available in a wide variety of sizes. Typically, child-sized bean bag chairs are under three feet wide, while adult bean bags usually range from four to six feet.</p>
<p><b>Structure</b>: The traditional bean bag is a structureless bag of beads, but there are now more options for those who want a more structured seat. Structured components such as armrests and cup holders may be especially desirable for those planning to use their bean bag chair for long periods of time, such as gamers.</p>
<p><b>Weight</b>: Our testers lugged bean bags up and down stairs, so trust us, lightweight bean bags are a plus. While lightweight bean bags filled with EPS beads make life easier when rearranging furniture, heavier foam can provide more comfort to some users.</p>
<p><b>Aesthetics</b>: The wide range of bean bag covers available means that a bean bag can be a stylish component to a room. Brainstorm which colors and textures would work in your space before beginning your bean bag chair quest.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>

<p>Our bean bag finalists were cuddled, squished, bounced and kicked during four weeks of rigorous comfort testing by six different testers. Our testers incorporated all eight bean bags into their daily life. A comfort questionnaire was completed after the first and fourth week of use, so that any changes in the bean bag’s comfort would be noticed. In addition to comfort testing, we also took careful notes on the ease of each bean bag’s assembly and how easy it was to wash the cover.</p>
<h3>Assembly and sizing</h3>
<p>All of the shredded foam bean bags required an inner bag full of foam material to be broken apart and then put inside a cover. This assembly was simple, taking only about five to ten minutes. Foam bean bags take three to seven days for the foam to completely expand. During this period we sat, fluffed and flipped over bean bags multiple times to ensure foam was completely expanded before comfort testing.</p>
<p>The bean bag chairs filled with EPS beads did not require assembly. However, the majority of our testers noted that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F8FM7ZC/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ECR4Kids &#8211; Classic</a> felt like it needed more beads than it came with. If you find your bean bag chair a bit “deflated,” additional <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bean-Bag-Refill-Beans/dp/B00AZWPAJE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1526947541&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bean+bag+beads" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EPS beads</a> can be purchased online and added to your bean bags at home.</p>
<p>At the end of week one and week four, each bean bag’s widest and tallest dimensions were taken. We gathered this information to see if the bean bags would lose their structure or flatten out after intense use. Encouragingly, none of our bean bag finalists’ dimensions changed significantly. However, EPS beads usually lose their structure over the course of the first five years, so if you buy this type of bean bag you may need to purchase bead refills at a later point.</p>
<h3>Comfort</h3>
<p>During week one and week four of comfort testing, testers answered questions regarding neck and back comfort, how easy getting in and out of the chair was, presence of any off-gassing odor and overall quality of the bean bag. The testing revealed no significant changes to any of the bean bags’ comfort over the course of four weeks. The most significant difference noted by our testers was the dissipation of initial chemical odors from packaging.</p>
<p>During the course of our testing, we found that our testers were split on whether they preferred EPS beads or foam filling. If you are not able to test which filling material you prefer, we recommend considering whether you want a lightweight or stationary bean bag chair. Bean bags filled with EPS beads are much easier to move, while foam bean bags stay put like other classic furniture pieces.</p>
<p>Both musty and chemical odors were noted by our testers for multiple bean bags in our week one comfort testing. However, these off-gassing odors disappeared for most of our finalists by week four. The noted exception to this was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B015QJJJHY/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fugu &#8211; 4XL</a>, which maintained a very musty, “cardboardy” smell over the course of the four weeks. This odor was most likely due to the fact that the bean bag’s foam exploded from its package while it was being shipped. Further, we were unable to wash this bean bag’s cover because of a foam leak. The Fugu, like the other foam bean bags, came with its foam filling in a polyester inner lining that is then placed within an outer cover. This inner lining is not meant to be broken, however the Fugu’s sprung a leak.</p>

<p>Half of the bean bags we tested had removable covers that we washed in a washing machine. We found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073VQSJ45/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lumaland &#8211; Luxury</a>’s cover was exceptionally easy to remove and put back on because of the quality zipper design. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P21WAXM/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chill Sack &#8211; 2-Foot Round</a> and Cozy Sack were not far behind; both bean bag covers were easy to remove and put back on. As previously noted, we were unable to remove the Fugu’s cover because of a breakage in its inner lining.</p>
<p>The EPS bean bags did not have removable covers. Instead these brands recommended that the bags be spot cleaned as needed. We found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F8FM7ZC/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ECR4Kids &#8211; Classic</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008AE0WV0/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Big Joe &#8211; Dorm</a> models were exceptionally easy to spot clean because of their resilient vinyl and polyester covers.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073VQSJ45/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lumaland &#8211; Luxury Bean Bag Chair</a> ranked highest for comfort with all but one of our testers, plus it has an easy-to-remove cover and no odor. Our testers loved Lumaland’s shredded foam filling and microsuede cover. This bean bag’s price tag is under $200, meaning you can get a quality bean bag without breaking the bank.</p>
<p>The Lumaland is four feet wide, a size our testers found to be comfortable for one adult. It is also available in three foot and five foot diameters. Our testers ranked the Lumaland as one of the easiest bean bags to get out of due to its taller height at around 28 inches.</p>

Its comfortable foam filling and easy to clean microsuede cover push it a cut above the competition. Available in eight different colors, the Lumaland's large 4-foot diameter makes a perfect adult lounger.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073VQSJ45/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Straight out of the box, the Lumaland had no musty foam or packaging odor. Like other foam bean bag chairs, the Lumaland’s assembly requires foam contained in an inner polyester lining to be broken up and placed in its outer cover. While the foam had already puffed up slightly during shipping, breaking up the rest of the foam was quick and easy.</p>
<p>The Lumaland’s zipper quality made the cover easy to remove and replace, even when the inner foam was completely broken apart. This means cleaning the Lumaland is no problem for anyone with a washing machine.</p>
<p>The Lumaland’s foam filling makes it heavier than other EPS filled bean bags. This bean bag’s heaviness and quality means it is meant to be a more-or-less stationary furniture item.</p>
<p>Lumaland offers eight different color options for this bag’s microsuede covers. Half of these colors could be described as mature neutrals, meaning the Lumaland looks at home in an adult bedroom or living room.</p>
<p>This bean bag showed no signs of wearing or flattening after four weeks of intense use. This bean bag’s quality is apparent in its comfortable foam filling and outer microsuede cover. For under $200, the Lumaland is a great option for adults looking for a comfortable classic bean bag.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Lumaland &#8211; Luxury is filled with shredded foam that was rated most comfortable by our testers.</li>
<li>The microsuede cover is easy to remove and replace, making cleaning simple.</li>
<li>This bean bag had no musty foam odor and was easy to assemble.</li>
<li>Its tall height (28”x48”) makes it easier to get out of than other lower-hieght bean bags.</li>

<p>While the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008AE0WV0/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Big Joe &#8211; Dorm Bean Bag Chair</a> may be marketed for college students, it is also a top choice for children. It can comfortably fit a wide age range of children, yet is under three feet wide. The Big Joe’s versatility comes from its structure, which includes arm- and backrests.</p>
<p>The Big Joe had the firmest structure of all of our bean bags. Our testers appreciated this firmness and rated this bean bag chair as the most comfortable for kids. While the Big Joe is less cuddly than other unstructured bean bags, it offers more support.</p>
<p>The Big Joe’s structure is ideal for children and teens who play video games because of the increased back support. Also, the Big Joe comes equipped with a drink holder and side pocket that could be useful for gamers.</p>
<p>Big Joe is filled with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0055DXQS0/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Megahh Beads</a>, the company’s own proprietary polystyrene bead, which our testers found comfortable. Unlike with other kids’ bean bags, our testers did not want more or less beads inside. However, as noted earlier, polystyrene beads lose their structure over the course of years and need to be replaced. Additional Megahh Beads, which are fully recyclable, can be purchased for under $20.</p>

<p>The Big Joe has double zippers, which securely enclose inner beads. This is important as EPS beads can be choking hazards for small children. The Big Joe’s cover is not removable. The recommended cleaning method for the bean bag chair is to spot clean with a mix of water and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-laundry-detergent/">detergent</a>.</p>
<p>No assembly was required when we received the Big Joe, and it had a very low amount of off-gassing odor that dissipated in about a week. The Big Joe is a comfortable, extremely durable bean bag chair that comes for under $50.</p>

While the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P21XE32/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sofa Sack</a>’s quality microsuede cover ranked well with our testers, our testers cited disappointment in the chair’s foam filling. Our testers complained that the Sofa Sack’s foam was too hard to snuggle into. Multiple testers noted that the bean bag chair was comfortable for laying down flat, but did not offer any back support when sitting in an upright or slightly reclined position.</p>
<p>The Sofa Sack came with a slight off-gassing odor, which dissipated after the first week. Its cover was very easy to remove and replace, which made cleaning simple. Overall the Sofa Sack’s cover quality was good, with tough zippers and microsuede material.</p>
<p>Because of its five foot diameter and foam filling, this bean bag is very difficult to move. While its cover has the quality of a good piece of furniture, its inner foam is lacking in comfort. The price difference between the Sofa Sack and Lumaland &#8211; Luxury is under $50, so if possible we recommend springing for the more comfortable Lumaland.</p>

<p>Our testers complained that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F8FM7ZC/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ECR4Kids &#8211; Classic Bean Bag Chair</a> needed more of its EPS bead filling material. This bean bag chair also had a tendency to fill up with air, and then decompress when sat on. At 35” wide, this bean bag is best suited for kids 12 years old and under.</p>
<p>This bean bag chair’s best aspect was its tough vinyl cover, which was very easy to spot clean. This vinyl cover did not rank high for aesthetics with our testers, but definitely did the job for durability and stain resistance. This small bean bag is also very lightweight, meaning this bean bag could easily be moved for indoor and outdoor use.</p>
<p>Overall, we recommend this bean bag as a solid choice for those with kids 12 and under because of the bags light weight, tough cover and easy cleaning. However, you may want to buy extra EPS bead filling to give your kids extra comfort.</p>

<p>Our testers appreciated the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P21WAXM/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chill Sack &#8211; 2-Foot Round</a>’s quality foam filling material, but some were frustrated with the bags small size. The Chill Sack is only two feet wide, and is suitable only for children under five years old.</p>
<p>This bean bag is safe for small children because it does not use chokable EPS beads and has a secure inner bag of foam. The removable microsuede cover is easy to remove and replace to machine wash. Two of our testers noted a slight musty odor initially. However, this disappeared over a week. Overall, this bean bag chair is a good choice for those with very small children.</p>

<p>The Fugu &#8211; 4XL Bean Bag Chair was the largest bean bag chair we tested. We found that after 3-7 days of use this bean bag measured about 6” wider than the advertised four feet. This is because of a breakage of the inner polyester lining that held the foam.</p>
<p>This massive bean bag chair was rated as above average for comfort overall by our testers. However, this bean bag did not rate as comfortable as the Lumaland because of irregular chunks of unbroken foam inside. Though this was technically our fault, the foam inside this bean bag was very hard to break apart during assembly. Our testers detected foam chunks even after four weeks of intense use.</p>
<p>The Fugu also had the strongest odor of all of the finalists. The bean bag chair reeked of “cardboardy,” musty packaging material. To make matters worse, we were not able to wash the Fugu’s cover in the washing machine because of a leak of foam in the bag’s inner lining.</p>
<p>Because the Fugu’s foam had broken through its inner lining, we contacted the seller for a refund. We did not get a response, but a few days later we received a new bean bag. Fugu’s confusing return process and quality issues were a pain. Therefore, we recommend either opting for the similarly priced Sofa Sack &#8211; 5-Foot Round, or paying around $50 more for the superior Lumaland &#8211; Luxury Bean Bag Chair.</p>

<p>Multiple testers cited wishing there were more beads inside the Flash Furniture &#8211; Oversized Bean Bag Chair. The lack of filling contributed to its just below average ranking for comfort overall. This bean bag chair was our only adult bean bag that was filled with EPS beads.</p>
<p>At 40 inches wide, this bean bag comfortably fits one adult. It arrived already at its full size, and no assembly was required. It also had no off-gassing odor straight out of the box.</p>
<p>This bean bag had a good quality cotton cover with tough zippers that locked to ensure EPS beads stayed inside. Because this cover is non-removable, Flash Furniture recommends spot cleaning the chair as needed. This is a pain because of cotton’s tendency to stain and absorb smells. We do not recommend this bean bag because it is a pain to clean and needed more filling.</p>
<h3>American Furniture Alliance &#8211; Child’s Large</h3>

<p>The American Furniture Alliance &#8211; Child&#8217;s Large Bean Bag ranked lowest for comfort with our testers because of the cheap polyester outer material and the course EPS beads inside. While there was a good amount of beads inside the bag, our testers did not find these beads as comfortable as in other kid’s bean bags.</p>
<p>This bean bag had a slight chemically smell that dissipated over time. The outer cover is not removable and is hard to spot clean because the polyester material absorbs liquids and odors. At 32” wide this bean bag is a good size for kids 12 years old and younger, but does not deliver on quality and comfort.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The primary job of a bean bag is to be comfortable. Durability, style and low odor are big pluses as well. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073VQSJ45/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lumaland &#8211; Luxury Bean Bag Chair</a> delivered on all of these components. Its shredded foam filling was easy to break apart and ranked as the most comfortable by our testers. Testers also loved the softness of the bean bag’s outer microsuede cover. This cover is a breeze to machine wash because removing and replacing it on the bean bag is simple.</p>
<p>The Lumaland comes with no odor straight out of the package, and is large enough to comfortably fit one adult. The bean bag chair proves that a quality adult bean bag can be purchased for under $200.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008AE0WV0/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Big Joe &#8211; Dorm Bean Bag Chair</a> took our top spot for kids because it fits a wide variety of age ranges from small child to teen. This highly structured bean bag delivers on back support and is extremely lightweight. It is stain resistant and priced under $50, meaning parents can save more money for the college fund.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P21WAXM/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chill Sack &#8211; 2-Foot Round</a> is a quality option only for those with children under five years old. Its foam filling and microsuede cover ranked high for comfort, but the bean bag’s small size is limiting.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter over 100 hours of testing seven top-rated indoor and outdoor products, we found that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017HM59HC/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lazery Sleep Air Mattress</a> was the best air mattress for durability, comfort and convenience. Lazery Sleep was the only air mattress we tested that consistently maintained air pressure, and  its automatic internal pump with seven settings allows you to increase or decrease firmness in seconds. A close runner-up is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B006OU4ERA/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Insta-Bed</a>, which withstood our testing with only minor loss of firmness.</p>

<h3>For in-home</h3>
<p>We read hundreds of reviews posted by consumers on websites that sell air mattresses, such as Amazon, Target, Walmart, sporting goods stores, bed stores and air mattress manufacturers. A surprisingly large percentage of people who purchase air mattresses are unhappy with the product they bought. The majority of their complaints focused on the mattresses losing air pressure during the night, so they found themselves waking up on a nearly flat piece of vinyl in the morning.</p>
<p>The second-most cited complaint is that air mattresses simply don’t provide the same back support as a standard bed. Third, air mattresses seem to be notorious for emitting a strong odor that can’t be masked even with bedding.</p>
<p>After a week’s worth of research and calling manufacturers, we narrowed our choices to 17 twin-bed air mattresses. We then reduced the selections to the seven mattresses that consumers praised highly for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their ability to sustain air pressure during the night</li>
<li>No leaks or seam breaks after multiple inflations</li>
<li>An efficient air pump</li>
<li>Weight capacity (300 to 350 pounds)</li>
<li>Comfort</li>
<li>Convenience</li>
<li>Lack of vinyl (PVC) odor</li>
</ul>
<h3>For camping</h3>
<p>Almost all of the air mattresses on the market are intended for indoor use only. Few manufacturers recommend their product for both indoor and outdoor use, so we narrowed our choices down to air mattresses that are made specifically for the outdoors, provided comfort and warmth and when inflated, could fit in a tent.</p>
<p>A major factor that’s different for camping air mattresses is how much weight it will add to your backpack. Since an air pump is needed to inflate the mattress, its weight also had to be taken into account.</p>
<p>A few of the air mattresses we researched included electric air pumps. We decided that in most cases electricity wouldn’t be available at a campsite, and so we focused on air mattresses that used a battery-operated pump. We did include one exception to review, the AeroBed Classic, for instances when electricity might be accessible.</p>
<p>Another important consideration was if the air mattress was easy to inflate, deflate and roll up efficiently and quickly for backpacking.</p>

<h2 id="why-buy">Who needs an inflatable air mattress?</h2>
<p>Air mattresses were originally designed for camping and travel. They were initially made of rubber and stored on cruise ships for fast inflation in times of emergency and lightweight for easy packing and carrying in a backpack. Most air mattresses today are made of PVC (polyvinyl chloride), which makes them more durable — and somewhat heavier — than the first camping and lifeboat air mattresses.</p>
<p>Today’s air mattresses are greatly improved, offering better body support and comfort, and since many have internal electric pumps, they are also convenient and easy to use. Two of the seven air mattresses we tested &#8211; Lightspeed Outdoors and Coleman SupportRest &#8211; are specifically intended for camping. The AeroBed Classic is the only air mattress we tested that could be used indoors and outdoors.</p>
<p>There is no specific set time for how long you should keep an air mattress inflated. However, almost all air mattress companies strongly advise that as durable and heavy-weight their product is, it won’t hold up if it is used as a permanent bed. (As evident from a good number of Amazon reviewers, this advisory is often ignored.)</p>
<p>Few air mattress companies offer a warranty (usually it’s very limited and only for one year), which is a sore point for most people who purchase one, since they had hoped the air mattress would last longer than a year.</p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence suggests that an air mattress could last for up to four years. But again, the mattress’ longevity depends on how it is used, maintained and stored by the consumer.</p>
<p>So why would you need an air mattress for anything other than camping? Air mattresses are ideal for overnight guests and kids’ sleepovers or when you’ve moved into a new home or apartment, and you’re waiting for furniture to arrive. To increase comfort during colder months you could even pair it with an <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-electric-blanket/">electric blanket</a>. An air mattress would also be great when you’re traveling and you need an additional bed in a hotel room or even in the back of a car.</p>

<p>Our research and testing determined a number of important features for you to consider when you’re purchasing an air mattress.</p>
<p><strong>Durability:</strong> Almost all of the air mattresses we tested were made of heavy gauge PVC, which prevents air leakage, seam splits and tears.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort:</strong> An air mattress should provide full-body support like a standard bed mattress.</p>
<p><strong>Height:</strong> Double-height air mattresses (17-to-24 inches tall) are preferred for ease of lowering onto and lifting your body from the bed.</p>
<p><strong>Maintains air pressure:</strong> The majority of air mattresses we tested had slight-to-moderate deflation over a test period. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006OU4ERA/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Insta-Bed Raised Airbed</a>, however, did not deflate, thanks to its patented “neverFLAT” dual-pump system.</p>
<p><strong>Adjustable firmness:</strong> Depending on your preference for a firm or plush mattress, you should be able to control the inflation and deflation. Several of the air mattresses we tested had this feature, and it afforded them superior comfort.</p>
<p><strong>Internal electric air pump:</strong> The best air mattress will have a powerful built-in electric pump that efficiently inflates and deflates. Whereas we didn’t find it was essential for the pump to rapidly inflate the mattress, we did appreciate a pump that deflates by vacuuming out the air, which made folding and storage easy.</p>
<p><strong>Weight support:</strong> We tested twin-size mattresses that supported 300-350 pounds, which is sufficient for a twin bed. Queen mattresses are intended for two people and should support 500-600 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Storage:</strong> Ideally an air mattress should be easy to fold and store in a small space. Most of the air mattresses we tested came with a sturdy storage bag that was large enough to hold the folded-up mattress.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of odor:</strong> PVC is sturdy, but it also has a prominent “shower-curtain” odor that doesn’t always dissipate with continued use. Two of the air mattresses we tested — Lazery Sleep and Sound Asleep Dream Series Bed — had almost no odor.</p>

<p>All of the electric air pumps included with the air mattresses, both internal and hand-held, were 120 volts, and they were generally efficient in quick inflation and deflation.</p>
<p>Our first test was timing the inflations and deflations 10 times for each mattress with and without 200 pounds of weight and recorded the time to determine whether or not there was a difference. We evenly distributed the 200-pound weight to approximate a person’s weight (heavier in the middle than at the head and foot of the bed). The majority of air mattresses inflated and deflated in two minutes and under. The Sound Asleep Dream Series and Fox Airbeds were slightly more than two minutes.</p>
<p>Almost all of the companies warn that an infant or young child could suffocate on an under-inflated or deflated mattress. However, we surmised that an older child or teenager might try inflating/deflating while they were on the bed, and so we decided to test it out. As expected, inflation time increased by several seconds, and deflation time decreased by several seconds.</p>
<p>Another factor we considered was how well the pump vacuumed the air out of the mattress and whether we needed to manually press down on the mattress to squeeze out remaining air. The Lazery Sleep, the Sound Asleep and the Insta-Bed were the most efficient; however Lazery Sleep and Insta-Bed’s automatic turn-off pump had the edge over Sound Asleep’s manual pump.</p>
<p>Powerful pumps are not quiet pumps, and although most reviewers claim that the pumps were about as loud as a hair dryer, we found the majority to be more on par with a vacuum cleaner. The only air pump that we would say was quiet is the hand-held, external pump for AeroBed Classic, which was actually quieter than a hair dryer.</p>
<h3>Durability</h3>
<p>Since air mattresses are generally used as temporary beds over a long period, we wanted to devise a test that simulated repeated use. Frequent complaints about the air mattresses we tested were leaks at the seams or air valve that are a result of the material stretching.</p>
<p>Three of the seven instruction manuals advised that it’s normal for the bed to lose air pressure after a few inflations due to the elasticity of the vinyl. We decided to test the air mattress stretching by inflating and deflating each mattress 10 times before applying weight.</p>
<p>After the tenth inflation, we brushed around the seams and valve with a soap-and-water solution and pressed down on the mattress to see if the solution bubbled, which would indicate a leak. None of the air mattresses showed signs of air leakage.</p>
<p>We then applied the 200-pound weight on the inflated mattress for 48 hours, deflated the mattress and then inflated again. We brushed the seams and air valves, and again, no leaks were detected.</p>
<p>All the air mattresses we tested, except for the Lightspeed Outdoors, have an internal 21-coil system, which is designed to provide support, prevent sagging and stabilize the mattress . Throughout our testing period, we did find that the coil system generally works well, but only for the center of the mattress. Although we could not find air leakage, the sides and corners of most of the air mattresses were “squishy,&#8221; which indicated some deflation.</p>
<h3>Comfort</h3>
<p>Regular standard twin bed mattresses are approximately 75-inches long and 38-inches wide, so a six-foot-tall person could lie on the mattress without his or her feet hanging over the edge of the bed. The majority of twin air mattresses we tested were slightly shorter at 72 inches, which means that a six-foot-tall person would need to sleep on the diagonal. Depending on your sleeping habits, this may or may not be comfortable.</p>
<p>The Lightspeed Outdoors mattress was longer at 78 inches and wider at 50 inches, which gave plenty of room for one person; however, at only 50 inches side-to-side, two people might feel cramped. The Fox Airbeds was 80 inches in length and 40 inches wide, which makes this mattress ideal for a tall person.</p>
<p>Standard twin-size fitted sheets fit all of the air mattresses we tested, however, it was a struggle with the Fox Airbeds and the Lightspeed Outdoors, which are both wider and longer than a twin bed. Full-size sheets could fit, but there would be substantial overhang.</p>
<p>All of the mattresses (except for the Lightspeed Outdoors) have a flocked, suede-like top to prevent sheet slippage. Some reviewers add a mattress pad or topper for additional protection and comfort, but we found neither was really necessary.</p>
<p>Since air mattresses are not intended for a bed frame, it takes some getting used to lowering oneself onto the mattress, even the double-height air mattresses, which measure approximately 18 inches in height. Almost all of the air mattresses we tested deflated somewhat, so rising up out of the bed wasn’t easy either as we had to push ourselves up from the center of the mattress.</p>
<p>The central internal coil system does provide good back support and for each of the air mattresses, the center section of the air mattress maintained pressure and stayed firm. Three of the air mattresses — Lazery Sleep, Insta-Bed and Sound Asleep — have controls to adjust firmness, which we found to be a real plus for comfort.</p>
<h3>Odor</h3>
<p>Almost all of the air mattresses we tested are made of vinyl. The exception, Lightspeed Outdoor, is made of PVC-free plastic. The process used to manufacture vinyl results in its having an unpleasant chemical odor.</p>
<p>Several of the air mattresses had overpowering PVC odor when we unwrapped them from their boxes. Before putting sheets on the mattresses, we allowed them to air out for several days to hopefully release the PVC gasses. In most cases, the odor did dissipate and was nearly undetectable when the beds were made up. However, when the mattresses were deflated by opening the air valve, the PVC odor emitting from the released air was still strong.</p>
<p>Our top choice, the Lazery Sleep, had virtually no odor from the get-go, while the Aerobed’s and Fox Airbeds&#8217; PVC odor didn’t dissipate even after being aired outdoors.</p>
<h3>Convenience</h3>

    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mattress-inflation-animation.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Since air mattresses are intended as temporary beds, we wanted to find out if they were convenient to use. Out of the box, each air mattress was a compact square or rectangle. We measured the mattresses to determine whether it was possible to fold them back into its tight shipping state. In short, it wasn’t. However, once completely deflated and with a bit of practice, most of the air mattresses could be folded and rolled to fit their ample canvas storage bags that are included.</p>
<p>Deflating the air mattresses did present a couple of problems. Two of the electric internal pumps did an excellent job of vacuuming out every bit of air from the mattress, which made folding and rolling a snap. Insta-Bed’s pump needed assistance in our manually pressing out the air around the edges and corners.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the most inconvenient of the air mattresses were the camping beds. Lightspeed’s battery-operated pump worked fine for inflation, but it was less successful at deflating the mattress, and we spent considerable time pressing out the air. The Coleman air mattress was more difficult to completely deflate, and then folding and rolling it into the attached storage bag tested our patience.</p>
<h3>A good night’s sleep</h3>
<p>Scientific testing aside, the real test for any air mattress is whether it gives you a good night’s sleep. Due to loss of firmness throughout the night, several of the mattresses lost enough stability that we were afraid we might fall off the mattress in our sleep. For example, the Fox Airbeds lost enough air pressure to waken us every time we moved. By morning, we could virtually roll out of bed, since the sides of the mattress were so soft.</p>
<p>We experienced the same issues with the Sound Asleep mattress. It also deflated during the night, so consequently we rocked back and forth any time we shifted.</p>
<p>The Lazery and the Insta-Bed air mattresses were, by far, the most comfortable and stable. Their internal support systems kept the mattresses firm, so there was no movement when we turned on our sides, and they were easy to stand up from without extra assistance.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017HM59HC/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lazery Sleep</a> scored an almost perfect 10 on all of our tests. It is the only air mattress we tested with an internal pump that has seven settings for controlling firmness, ranging from “plush” (soft) to “extra firm.&#8221; Another feature we liked is the pump automatically shuts off when the mattress reaches the desired setting (in about one-and-a-half minutes) and when it is fully deflated (in under two minutes).</p>
<p>The pump’s settings allow you to select how firm or soft you want the mattress to be and make incremental adjustments to increase or decrease air pressure. In a nutshell, you can set the mattress to inflate to “extra firm” and if it’s too firm for your liking, you can gradually decrease the air pressure to a softer level.</p>

<p>The “extra firm” setting was certainly the firmest of any of the air mattresses we tested. The “plush” setting was a bit too soft for us and slightly destabilized the mattress so it rocked when we shifted from side to side.</p>

<p>The Lazery Sleep is well-made and durable, and even though it is vinyl, it didn’t have the characteristic PVC smell. The Lazery Sleep maintained air pressure and showed no deflation in our initial 48-hour testing period with 200 pounds applied. When fully inflated, it was almost as high as a regular bed mattress, incredibly comfortable and easy to get into and out of.</p>
<p>Since the efficient pump completely vacuums out the air, the mattress flattens perfectly for folding and rolling and fits easily into the included canvas bag for storage.</p>

<p>It was neck-and-neck between the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B006OU4ERA/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Insta-Bed</a> and the highly rated <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N9C3IVO/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sound Asleep Dream Series</a> for runner-up, but we decided that Insta-Bed’s automatic twin-pump system put Insta-Bed ahead of Sound Asleep.</p>
<p>Insta-Bed’s patented “neverFLAT” system has one main pump for rapid inflation and deflation (under two minutes) and a second internal pump that maintains air pressure during the night. The mattress’ sensor monitors the selected air pressure and automatically re-inflates if there is any deflation. Unlike the primary pump, the secondary pump is nearly silent &#8211; it’s a slight whir &#8211; so you won’t be disturbed from sleep.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title">T</div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B006OU4ERA/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/insta-bed-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/insta-bed-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/insta-bed-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/insta-bed-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/insta-bed-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/insta-bed-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/insta-bed-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/insta-bed-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/insta-bed.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Runner-up: Insta-Bed</h3><p>Insta-Bed's patented NeverFLAT pump is actually two built-in pumps:  one for inflation/deflation and the second for silently maintaining pressure during the night.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B006OU4ERA/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>We tested the mattress with and without the secondary pump engaged, and by morning there was only minor deflation along the sides and corners when the secondary pump wasn’t on. The pump has three firmness controls: “plush,” “medium” and “firm.”</p>
<p>We found “medium” and “plush” to be firmer than other air mattresses, while “firm” was actually too firm and somewhat uncomfortable. Insta-Bed was stable throughout the night and absorbed any movement when we were asleep.</p>
<p>Automatic deflation is a little uneven and benefits from manually pressing out any remaining air to flatten the mattress for folding. The secondary pump inhibits a neat fold-up, but the storage bag is large enough to hold the mattress.</p>
<p>The only real negative is that the mattress’ vinyl has a noticeable PVC odor, which eventually dissipated but only after repeated airings outdoors.</p>

<p>We tested three camping air mattresses: AeroBed Classic, Lightspeed Outdoors and Coleman SupportRest Double High Airbed. Of the three, we found that the reliable and backpack-friendly <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CWZE642/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lightspeed</a> was the best option.</p>
<p>Any of the the three air mattresses we tested for camping purposes could also be used indoors. They were designed, however, for outdoor use, which means they are lightweight yet durable and need a separate pump, preferably battery-operated. Electric pumps for camping are available, which you could use if electricity is accessible at your campsite, or if you purchase an adapter for your car’s cigarette lighter.</p>

Of the camping mattresses we tested, the Lightspeed's relatively quick inflation and deflation were the best.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CWZE642/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CWZE642/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lightspeed Outdoors</a> mattress is a slightly longer (78 inches) full-size mattress (54 inches in width). Weighing in at only six pounds, it was the lightest of the three camping air mattresses we tested. (The Aerobed is seven pounds, and the Coleman is ten pounds.) It’s only six inches high, so for colder weather, some sort of insulation underneath the mattress is necessary.</p>
<p>A battery-operated air pump (4 “D” batteries not included) is included with the mattress, and it works decently in inflating the mattress in about five minutes. We found it best to over-inflate the mattress since the air valve hisses out air once the pump nozzle is removed. The pump wasn’t as effective in deflating the mattress, so we found it easier and faster to manually press the air out of the mattress.</p>
<p>The mattress was comfortable, if perhaps a bit soft, and it rocked back and forth like a waterbed when only one person was on it. Since the mattress was designed for two people, the second person’s weight kept it more stable. The mattress lost a small amount of air pressure, but it kept us buoyed overnight.</p>
<p>Once we got the hang of rolling and squeezing the deflated mattress, it fit neatly in its storage bag that can also accommodate the pump and three nozzle attachments.</p>
<p>The Lightspeed Outdoors is the only mattress that we tested that is a PVC-free plastic, so it has no odor. Lightweight, durable and affordable, the Lightspeed Outdoors Two Person Air Mattress is an excellent choice for camping trips.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight at only six pounds and backpack-friendly, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CWZE642/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lightspeed Outdoors</a> is an excellent choice for camping.</li>
<li>Extra wide and long, the mattress is designed for two people.</li>
<li>The mattress is the only one we tested made of odor-free, PVC-free plastic.</li>

<h3>Sound Asleep &#8211; Dream Series</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6114 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Sound-Asleep.jpg" alt="Sound Asleep Dream Series" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Sound-Asleep.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Sound-Asleep-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Sound-Asleep-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Sound-Asleep-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Sound-Asleep-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Sound-Asleep-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Sound-Asleep-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Sound-Asleep-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Sound-Asleep-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Sound-Asleep-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>One of the most highly rated air mattresses on Amazon is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N9C3IVO/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sound Asleep Dream Series</a>, and it certainly has all of the features of our top pick. Its powerful internal pump inflates and deflates the mattress in a little over two minutes, and fully inflated, it provides solid back and body support. The internal 21-coil (for twin beds) system keeps the mattress stable and comfortable.</p>
<p>The air pump completely deflates the mattress so it’s easy to fold and store in its large canvas bag. The mattress is made of vinyl, but it has no PVC odor. Finally, it’s slightly less expensive than our favorite, the Lazery Sleep.</p>
<p>However, with all of these pluses, the Sound Asleep was brought down a notch for two reasons. First, the pump is not automatic, and so we had to listen for a high-pitched whine, which designated that the mattress was fully inflated or fully deflated.</p>
<p>Second, and more importantly, during our test period, the sides and corners lost air pressure and were squishy, which made it difficult to get up from the mattress. As the manufacturer advises, some deflation is to be expected as the material stretches. But our tests gave ample time for the material to stretch, which suggests that the mattress will further deflate with repeated use.</p>
<h3>Fox Airbeds &#8211; Plush High Rise</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6115 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Fox-Airbeds.jpg" alt="Fox Airbeds - Plush High Rise" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Fox-Airbeds.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Fox-Airbeds-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Fox-Airbeds-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Fox-Airbeds-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Fox-Airbeds-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Fox-Airbeds-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Fox-Airbeds-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Fox-Airbeds-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Fox-Airbeds-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Fox-Airbeds-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QQVBGE6/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fox Airbeds &#8211; Plush High-Rise</a> has a couple of nice features, but overall, we found this air mattress doesn’t maintain air pressure. At 80 inches in length, it is by far the most comfortable for a person six-feet and over. Inflation and deflation were good, a little longer than the other air mattresses we tested, but times were still speedy at two-minutes thirty-seconds.</p>
<p>On the negative side, the mattress showed signs of losing firmness after the sixth time we inflated it. We attempted to determine where it was leaking air, and when we pressed down on the foot of the bed, short puffs of air emitted from the mattress’ air valve. As long as we remained in the center of the bed, the mattress provided decent support. But once we shifted to either side, the mattress sagged considerably, making it difficult to get out of the bed.</p>
<p>The mattress’ vinyl isn’t as sturdy as the other air mattresses we tested, plus it was the heaviest at 20 pounds. Outdoor airing didn’t entirely eliminate the vinyl’s PVC odor, and with all of the factors combined with its higher price, we cannot recommend the Fox Airbeds Plush High Rise.</p>
<h3>Aerobed &#8211; Classic</h3>
<p>If you have access to electricity on a campsite, or if you have a car cigarette-lighter adapter, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006FTIY26/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AeroBed &#8211; Classic</a> air mattress is a viable option. An efficient exterior air pump is included, and it quietly inflates the mattress in 30 seconds. It also has a patented quick air release valve that deflates the mattress in a whoosh.</p>
<p>However, we did have considerable difficulty in opening and closing the air valve to insert the pump, and we had to continually add more air since it was leaking out of the tricky valve. We also noticed there was some deflation around the valve by simply pressing down on the mattress.</p>
<p>The Aerobed is nine-inches high, and even though it provided good support for sleeping, it wasn’t easy to get up from since it’s so low to the ground.</p>
<h3>Coleman &#8211; SupportRest Double High Airbed</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6117 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coleman-SupportRest.jpg" alt="Coleman SupportRest Double-High" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coleman-SupportRest.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coleman-SupportRest-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coleman-SupportRest-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coleman-SupportRest-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coleman-SupportRest-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coleman-SupportRest-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coleman-SupportRest-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coleman-SupportRest-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coleman-SupportRest-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coleman-SupportRest-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Coleman is a well-known company that manufactures camping equipment, most notably tents. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HN982C4/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SupportRest Double High Airbed</a> was the most inexpensive of the air mattresses we tested, but we found it to be quite inconvenient for camping.</p>
<p>The mattress has features similar to the other mattresses we tested, but its pull-out, push-in air valve was reminiscent of a pool toy. An air pump is not included (they can be purchased inexpensively online), and we found it awkward and time-consuming to hold a manual air pump in place so it doesn’t pop out of the valve.</p>
<p>During the night, the center of the Coleman remained firm, but by morning, the sides of the mattress had deflated substantially and were “mushy.&#8221; Despite the Coleman’s double height (17 inches), we had to push ourselves up from the center of the mattress.</p>
<p>Deflation was time-consuming. The air must be manually pressed out of the mattress and rolled in stages, while continually squeezing out air, and the process took nearly 15 minutes.</p>
<p>The Coleman doesn’t have a separate storage bag; instead, two pieces of canvas material are attached with heavy-duty cord. Once the mattress is rolled up, you tie it together into a bulky log-shaped package with a handle.</p>
<p>We concluded that we wouldn’t want to be caught in a sudden rainstorm with this air mattress since it takes so long to pack up.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The majority of the mattresses we tested were well-made and mostly survived our barrage of tests. The real challenge, however, proved to be whether they provided comfort and support for a good night’s rest.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017HM59HC/?tag=ybdairm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lazery Sleep</a> rose to the top as the best of the lot with the Insta-Bed coming in at a close second. The Insta-Bed is slightly more expensive than the Lazery Sleep, but both air mattresses are an excellent value and high quality.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-found">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We started out our testing process with market research, combing through articles and blogs on the topic of electric blankets. Our research phase involved finding out the features and benefits of using an electric blanket, the safety and care of electric blankets, and the principles of AC and DC power (two options when choosing an electric blanket).</p>
<p>Then we used sources such as subreddits like r/frugal and YouTube video reviews to gather input from consumers on which are the most popular choices for electric blankets, and which features are the most important to users when choosing an electric blanket. This allowed us to narrow the field down to our five finalists.</p>
<p>Finally, we busted out our ruler, scale, infrared thermometer and Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitor to dive into the nitty-gritty details of our electric-blanket finalists to see which would emerge as the best electric blanket.</p>

<h2 id="why-use-an">Why use an electric blanket</h2>
<p>When the temperature drops, you may find yourself reaching to adjust the thermostat. But is that really your best option? According to the <a href="http://www.energy.gov/public-services/homes/heating-cooling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Department of Energy</a>, heating and cooling are the largest expenses for most homes, accounting for more than half of the energy use in a typical household. In the winter months, this can cause your electric or fuel bills to skyrocket, especially if your home is more than 20-years old.</p>
<p>Making smarter and more informed decisions about how you heat your home can save you a significant amount of money.</p>
<p>At night, you spend an average of eight hours in a single room sleeping. If you can avoid heating the whole house during this time, or even lower your thermostat by a few degrees, you can appreciably lower your heating bill.</p>
<p>A space heater is one way to heat a small area like a bedroom, but an electric blanket is the best way to both conserve resources and save money. In a comparison between space heaters and electric blankets completed by the U.S. Department of Energy, the electric blanket was the most energy-efficient choice.</p>
<p>The cost to run a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-space-heater/">space heater</a> for eight hours a day, 50 days a year, is approximately $66 a year, while our tests estimate our top electric blanket finalists to cost three to seven dollars annually to use for the same period of time.</p>
<p>You can save as much as three-percent in energy for every degree you drop by lowering the thermostat at night. Think about it this way: With the money you save on your energy bill, an electric blanket will pay for itself in a matter of months.</p>
<p>If your energy bill costs $300, you can save $24 a month if you turn down your thermostat by eight degrees each night. With the savings, even the most expensive blanket we reviewed (the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0091BU68A/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Serta Luxe Plush</a>) will pay for itself within six months and less expensive blankets much sooner.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-look">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>After sorting through user reviews and expert opinions, we’ve come up a list of key metrics to use when determining the value of an electric blanket:</p>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> A heavier blanket will keep you warmer, with or without its electrical heating element turned on.</p>
<p><strong>Number of settings:</strong> The greater the number of settings, the more likely you are to strike that perfect balance between staying warm and using the least amount of wattage.</p>
<p><strong>Warranty:</strong> In the event that the cords, controller, or blanket malfunction, a warranty will replace the blanket or parts at no cost to you (usually up to five years). Keep in mind that it won’t cover accidents or damage.</p>
<p><strong>Thin wires:</strong> The thinner the wire, the easier it is to wrap the blanket around yourself and relax or sleep more comfortably. Thinner, more flexible wires add to your comfort and make the blanket easier to store in summer months (since it folds up smaller).</p>
<p><strong>General ease of use:</strong> Lighted dials for use at night, uncomplicated settings, and cords that actually reach to your sockets are important considerations when choosing an electric blanket.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort:</strong> Luxurious materials like soft micro-fleece and plush sherpa make today’s electric blankets more comfortable than ever.</p>
<p><strong>Auto-shutoff:</strong> Never worry about leaving your electric blanket on when you leave for work; auto-shutoff gives you peace of mind and makes for safer use.</p>
<p><strong>Preheat feature:</strong> Preheat settings mean that for the first 15 to 20 minutes, a blanket turns on at its highest temperature, then drops to the setting you select.</p>
<h2 id="AC-vs-conversion">AC vs conversion to DC power</h2>
<p>Two of the electric blankets we tested, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041RQXOK/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Soft Heat electric blanket</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0091BU68A/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Serta Luxe low voltage</a> use the the patented Safe and Warm low-voltage technology. This means it converts the AC power used by most electric blankets to a safer low-voltage DC power.</p>
<p>Both Serta and SoftHeat are made by Perfect Fit Industries, and its products are currently the only ones in the U.S. market that meet <a href="http://ulstandards.ul.com/standard/?id=964_12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Underwriters Laboratories standards</a> for “non-hazardous low voltage”. Although it takes longer to heat up, it is safer and offers a “soft warmth”. This means that while the blanket itself is not hot to the touch, the experience of using the blanket is warm and cozy.</p>
<p>You might be wondering what exactly is the difference between AC and DC power, so let’s talk about that. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology School of Engineering gives <a href="http://engineering.mit.edu/ask/what%E2%80%99s-difference-between-ac-and-dc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a thorough explanation</a>, which we’ll summarize here. Alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) are different types of voltage or current used for the conduction and transmission of electrical energy. AC is the dominant power source you’ll find in daily-use items like lamps, whereas a battery uses DC power.</p>
<p>The fundamental difference between AC and DC is the direction of flow. DC is constant and moves in one direction, while AC changes over time in a back and forth repetition. This oscillation is the reason AC power can be more dangerous; since the voltage alternates, it can cause current to enter and exit your body even without a closed loop, since your body can store an electrical charge. The higher the voltage, the greater the risk of electrical shock.</p>
<h2 id="are-electric-blankets">Are electric blankets safe?</h2>
<p>Safety concerns about malfunction, overheating, and electromagnetic frequency waves (EMFs) are among the top questions the <a href="http://www.electricblanketinstitute.com/safety-care.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Electric Blanket Institute</a> receives. Even though the U.S. government has spent $65 million on research and studied over 500 peer-reviewed papers to conclude that EMFs aren’t a problem, in 1992, Sunbeam started making blankets in 1992 with much weaker EMFs. Each of the blankets we looked at met the latest Underwriters Laboratories electric bedding standards.</p>
<p>There is also the newer option of buying electric blankets, such as the SoftHeat or Serta finalists, that convert AC power to DC power.</p>
<p>For very small children, pregnant women or anyone who is prone to heat insensitivity (such as those with diabetes) or incapable of operating the controls, the safest bet is to use an electric blanket to pre-warm your bed sheets and then turn it off prior to retiring for the night.</p>

<h3>Test #1: Cost efficiency</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4610 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/temp-measurement.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/temp-measurement.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/temp-measurement-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/temp-measurement-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/temp-measurement-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/temp-measurement-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/temp-measurement-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/temp-measurement-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/temp-measurement-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/temp-measurement-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Since one of the major reasons to purchase an electric blanket is to reduce energy use and save money, let’s take a look at the cost breakdown to use each of these electric blanket finalists annually. We tested the energy consumption of each finalist by first testing the wattage with the Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitor. It connects to household appliances to assess its energy use in voltage, watts, and kilowatt hours.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4689 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified.png" alt="electric blanket cost efficiency" width="855" height="768" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified.png 855w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-610x548.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-360x323.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-375x337.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-414x372.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-295x265.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-180x162.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-320x287.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>For this test, we looked at the costs of using each electric blanket on a medium setting for eight hours a night for a period of 50 days. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average national cost of electricity is about 12 cents per kilowatt hour for residential use, which is the number we used to tally our total costs.</p>
<p>We found that any electric blanket is the least expensive method of heating, with the most expensive blanket to operate (the Sunbeam Olive Sherpa Mink) costing only $7.82 per year. The other AC-powered ranges were also in the seven dollar range.</p>
<p>However, the SoftHeat and Serta blankets, which convert to DC power, cost less than four dollars a year to operate. When you think of the high energy and fuel costs to heat an entire home, and how much you could reduce your energy bill by using an electric blanket at night for part of the year, that’s a huge incentive.</p>
<h3>Test #2: Heating capabilities</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/infrared-thermometer-measurement.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>If you’re using an electric blanket to reduce your heating bill, you want to know that it will keep you warm at night while the thermostat is set at a lower temperature. Of course, how warm an electric blanket gets can be subjective when reviewed by consumers.</p>
<p>When the temperature is chilly outside (or inside), the blanket may not feel as hot as it would on a warmer day. This is especially true if the user has a lowered body temperature for any reason, or is prone to feeling cold.</p>
<p>To counteract this objectivity, we used our infrared thermometer as a diagnostic tool. Because it measures temperature within a two-percent plus or two-degree minus range, we felt confident our reading would accurately reflect a true comparison between electric blankets. We checked the exact temperature at high, medium, and low settings. For blankets with ten settings, we checked the temperature at settings one, five, and ten.</p>
<p>Many electric blanket consumers use the preheating feature when available, or manually preheat the blanket before retiring to bed. However, it’s nice to know that you can warm yourself up quickly when necessary. We looked at the number of minutes each finalist took to heat up, using a timer and the infrared thermometer. We tested at five, ten, and fifteen minutes to determine how long each blanket took to reach its maximum temperature.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4690 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-2.png" alt="electric blanket temperature time" width="880" height="748" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-2.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-2-610x519.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-2-360x306.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-2-375x319.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-2-414x352.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-2-295x251.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-2-180x153.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unspecified-2-320x272.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Each of our finalists averaged the same amount of time to heat up, taking five minutes to reach the temperature we measured at the lowest setting, and a total of fifteen minutes to reach its highest temperature.</p>
<p>The Biddeford Micro Mink &amp; Sherpa blanket reached the highest temperature of all the blankets, at 107.1 degrees Fahrenheit. It also had the widest range of temperatures, with a low setting of 81.7 degrees. Close behind in ranking for the highest temperature were the Serta and SoftHeat blankets, at 105.8 and 105.7 degrees respectively. The Sunbeam Olive Sherpa &amp; Mink blanket ran at the lowest temperature setting, with a high of 85.4 degrees.</p>
<h3>Test #3: Evenness</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4592 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wire-spacing.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wire-spacing.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wire-spacing-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wire-spacing-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wire-spacing-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wire-spacing-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wire-spacing-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wire-spacing-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wire-spacing-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wire-spacing-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>According to the many consumer reviews we read, a heating product with hot or cold spots is the bane of electric blanket users. In order to get the maximum benefit of an electric blanket, it’s important for the heat to be distributed evenly.</p>
<p>First, we measured the spacing of the wires. We looked at the distance between the wires, and how close the wires ran to the edges. The more evenly the heating element is distributed, the more likely it is that the blanket will give off a uniform heat.</p>
<p>We then checked all four corners and the center of each blanket, testing by hand to make sure there were no hot or cold spots. Then we double checked with the infrared thermometer, again testing all four corners and the center to make sure the heat was distributed evenly.</p>
<p>Each of our finalist blankets did a great job of heating evenly, with no discernable hot or cold spots. However, in terms of overall heat distribution, the SoftHeat and Serta blankets were both clear winners, with the most uniform feel of warmth when under the blanket.</p>
<p>While the “invisible” wires were undetectable, and we were therefore unable to take measurements, the manufacturer for each of these blankets states the width at three inches apart, much closer than traditional electric blankets.</p>
<p>Although the wires of the Sunbeam Microplush were centered towards the middle of the blanket, it had the closest distance between wires, at only one and a half inches apart.</p>
<h3>Test #4: Comfort</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4587 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/measuring-thickness.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/measuring-thickness.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/measuring-thickness-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/measuring-thickness-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/measuring-thickness-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/measuring-thickness-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/measuring-thickness-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/measuring-thickness-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/measuring-thickness-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/measuring-thickness-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>You may be influenced to purchase an electric blanket for the cost savings, but when it comes to picking out the brand and style, it all comes down to comfort. Is it soft and cozy? Is it easy to use? Will it be your go-to blanket for curling up in front of the television or getting into bed at night? After all, if an electric blanket doesn’t get used, it won’t benefit your energy bill.</p>
<p>We looked at four benchmarks for this test: plushness, weight, cord length, and wire thickness. First, we used a ruler to measure the thickness of each blanket to determine the plushness. The fleece-lined blankets (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0088AHJ8A?th=1/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sunbeam Royal Mink Sherpa</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DN6SM12/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Biddeford Micro Mink Sherpa</a>) were both noticeably more plush to the hand, as well as half a centimeter thicker than the other blankets.</p>
<p>Next, we weighed the blankets. After all, a heavier blanket is warmer in the winter, even before you reach for the controller. The Serta Luxe Plush was the heaviest blanket at 7.8 pounds, and the SoftHeat Ultra Micro-Plush was the next heaviest at 6.8 pounds. Of course, the throw blankets were both lighter due to size, with the Sunbeam Royal Mink Sherpa weighing 3.5 pounds and the Sunbeam Camelot Cuddler weighing just three pounds.</p>
<p>Because a longer cord allows for easier reach to electric sockets without pulling the blanket, we measured the length of each cord. The throw blankets both had a short reach of nine feet, which correlates to use on a couch or recliner. The Serta and SoftHeat had the longest cords, reaching 23 feet and comfortably stretching to any outlet in the room.</p>
<p>Finally, we looked at wire thickness. Being covered up by fabric, this was difficult to measure with a ruler, so we used a flat palm to run our hand across the surface of the fabric. With all but the Serta and SoftHeat blankets, which have “invisible wires”, we could easily detect the wires running through the blankets.</p>
<p>However, the Sunbeam Royal Sherpa Mink and Biddeford Micro Mink Sherpa blankets were lined with fleece, meaning that once we had the blanket covering our lap, the wires were undetectable from the side closest to our body.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: SoftHeat &#8211; Ultra Micro-Plush</h2>

<p>Safety is a major concern for most electric blanket users, so it’s no surprise that the low-voltage <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041RQXOK/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SoftHeat Ultra Micro-Plush Low-Voltage Electric Blanket</a> is one of the most-reviewed heated blankets on Amazon.com.</p>
<p>It uses low-voltage technology, with a small power supply box that changes 115 volt AC power into non-hazardous DC power for added protection and safety (even if the blanket becomes wet). It operates on less than 25 volts, about the same amount of current it takes to operate a light bulb.</p>
<p>Some users report that SoftHeat takes longer to heat up than a traditional heating blanket, due to its use of DC power, but we found that its unique preheat feature put it on par with the other blankets we tested. The indulgent and incredibly soft microplush fabric exudes a soft warmth.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering what soft heat feels like, we’d compare it to cuddling up with warm towels fresh from the dryer. It does not feel hot to the touch nor does it heat up surrounding fabric such as sheets (even though it registers on the infrared thermometer at 104.1 degrees on its highest setting), but you do experience warmth once you are wrapped up in its cozy softness.</p>

The Soft Heat Ultra Micro-Plush electric blanket tied with the Serta brand in all three categories, at a lower price.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041RQXOK/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If you’re using an electric product merely to warm up a bed and plan to turn it off before getting in, you may want to consider an AC-powered blanket that does heat up surrounding fabric.</p>
<p>One of the aspects we truly appreciated about SoftHeat were the “invisible wires.” Because each wire is wrapped in a layer of fiberfill that directs the heat downward towards you, you feel warm, but you definitely do not feel the wires. As flexible as they are undetectable, the ultra-thin wires allow you to bend, mold, or shape the blanket as you desire.</p>
<p>We loved how easily we could wrap it around ourselves and how it was less bulky on the bed. It also folds up as neat and small as a regular blanket, which allows for easier storage when the blanket isn’t in use.</p>
<p>The non-slip digital controller is easy to read and adjust, with a lighted dial and an extra long cord that was useful to reach outlets in any part of the room. While we tested a full size blanket, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041RQXOK/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">king size</a> is divided in two separate zones and comes with two controllers to adjust the temperature of each side of the bed, allowing for individual comfort and control.</p>
<p>We appreciated the fact that SoftHeat is both machine washable and dryable (be sure to read the manufacturer’s instructions for settings). Since you’re most likely to use an electric blanket during the winter, finding a place to hang-dry a full size or larger blanket could be a bit cumbersome. The other finalists we reviewed allowed for partial machine drying, but only SoftHeat and Serta were able to machine dry from start to finish.</p>
<p>With home heating costs on the rise and a move toward preserving natural resources, the low wattage of SoftHeat is an incredible boon to those looking to save money and energy. The Department of Energy estimates the average electric blanket to use 400 watts (although our five finalists used far less), and the low voltage SoftHeat blanket uses only 73 watts according to our test.</p>
<p>While priced slightly higher than other electric blankets of the same size, you can clearly see that it would quickly pay for itself. It’s also about $40 cheaper than the comparably featured Serta Luxe Plush when this review was initially published, making it our clear winner.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The low voltage technology of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041RQXOK/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SoftHeat</a> is similar to a battery and uses the same amount of voltage as a light bulb. You can rest assured that you’re using one of the safest electric blankets on the market.</li>
<li>Ultra thin and flexible wires wrapped in fiberfill make SoftHeat more like a traditional blanket than an electric blanket.</li>
<li>Costing less than $4 a year to use throughout the night during the cold months, SoftHeat will pay for itself in energy bill savings.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0091BU68A/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Serta &#8211; Luxe Plush Low-Voltage Electric Heated Micro-Fleece Blanket</a> has similar features to the Soft Heat blanket, at a higher price. Serta is a well-recognized name in the mattress and bedding world, so this electric blanket comes with the reassurance of a leading brand dedicated to quality and consumer satisfaction. There’s also the option to purchase coordinating Serta products, such as low-voltage micro-fleece throws.</p>
<p>The Serta Luxe Plush is made by Perfect Fit Industries, so it uses the same patented Safe &amp; Warm low voltage technology as the SoftHeat Ultra Micro-plush and has many of the same features, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Innovative, energy saving, and extremely safe low-voltage technology.</li>
<li>An additional inner layer of fiberfill and soft fabric that covers each thin wire, making it undetectable and distributing the heat evenly without the bulkiness of traditional electric blankets.</li>
<li>A pre-heat feature that allows you to warm your entire bed before getting in.</li>
<li>Independently zoned heating and dual controllers with the king and queen size blankets.</li>
<li>A completely machine washable and dryable blanket is convenient during winter.</li>
</ul>
<p>The areas where the Serta Luxe Plush excels are in weight and cost-efficiency. At 7.4 pounds, it is the heaviest blanket we reviewed. With super soft micro-fleece fabric, the Serta Luxe Plush is one of the most soft, flexible, and comfortable electric blankets on the market. Of the five finalists we tested, it’s also the least expensive product to operate. With a wattage of 68, it only costs $3.25 annually to use nightly in the winter months.</p>

<p>Users credit the Serta Luxe for its longevity, quality, and performance, and after thorough testing, we are inclined to agree.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The heaviest and softest electric blanket we reviewed, the Serta &#8211; Luxe Plush is the thickest and warmest option for those who are always cold.</li>
<li>Costing only $.06 for eight hours of use, this is the most cost-efficient electric blanket we reviewed (and on the market).</li>

<h2 id="the-best-throw">Best throw: Sunbeam &#8211; Sherpa-Mink</h2>

<p>With its snuggly soft texture and cozy fleece side, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0088AHJ8A?th=1/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sunbeam’s &#8211; Sherpa-Mink Throw Blanket</a> is perfect to curl up with even before you turn the heat on. In fact, the premium soft material and plush thickness of the sherpa means you don’t even feel the wires when the blanket is resting against your body.</p>
<p>It comes with Sunbeam’s proprietary Thermofine warming system, which senses both your body temperature and room temperature, and adjusts to deliver consistent warmth. We love this feature, because if your feet are cold, Sunbeam’s warming system automatically senses this change and directs additional heat to your feet. The system also employs patented carbon-based polymer Positive Temperature Coefficient sensing capability to provide more uniform heat.</p>
<p>We highly recommend this blanket when for cozying up on a couch or recliner. At 50&#215;60”, it’s perfectly sized for when you want to spend the evening hours in your living room reading or watching television. (Using an electric blanket in the evening as well as night allows you to lower your thermostat for even more hours of the day and adds up to a greater cost savings.)</p>

<p>The three-hour auto-shutoff convenient for evening use, because if you forget to turn it off before going to bed, you won’t have to worry. However, if you’re planning on using this blanket to keep you warm all night, the short time frame for the auto shutoff may mean you wake up with no heat source.</p>
<p>The cord has only three settings and is lighted for easy use in the dark. With a shorter power cord at six feet, this is again designed for use in a couch or reclining chair close to an outlet. In a bedroom, the shorter power cord may be slightly inconvenient. But for use in a living room, it’s hard to beat the luxurious feel of sherpa and royal mink.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Thermofine Warming System used by Sunbeam in the Olive Sherpa Mink Throw senses changes in body and room temperatures, and adjusts accordingly for better sleep.</li>
<li>Whether you prefer ultra soft RoyalMink fabric or snuggly sherpa against your skin, this reversible throw is the ultimate in cuddly softness on either side.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DN6SM12/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Biddeford Heated Micro mink &amp; Sherpa blanket</strong></a><br />
We couldn’t get enough of the high-quality Sherpa and Micro Mink fabric, which makes the Biddeford Heated Micro Mink &amp; Sherpa blanket an exceptionally cozy and snuggly soft blanket. It features ten heat settings, a ten hour auto shut off system, and an ultra thin wire that is undetectable through the sherpa side.</p>
<p>We tested the full size, but the queen and king sizes also have the additional feature of dual temp control. The dual temp control has two entirely separate heating mechanisms, with separate cords and separate controllers for total warmth independence. Users appreciate its luxurious feel, therapeutic warmth, and ability to stand the test of time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001VMFI3K/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Sunbeam Microplush Throw Camelot Cuddler Warming Blanket</strong></a><br />
The Sunbeam Camelot Cuddler wins praise for its ultra soft material, exclusive Thermofine warming system and heavier PrimeStyle controller. It’s another good option for those desiring a throw blanket to use during the evening hours. The Sunbeam Microplush heats hotter than the Sunbeam Sherpa Mink, ranging from 93.1 at its lowest setting to 104.1 at its highest. If a warmer blanket is important to you, this makes the Sunbeam Microplush a good choice.</p>
<p>For those that are budget-conscious, it’s also the least expensive blanket that we reviewed. Since it has many of the same options as the Sunbeam Sherpa Mink throw, such as an easy-to-use controller and three hour auto-shut off, it offers plenty of bang for your buck.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Tied neck and neck throughout the comparison process, both the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041RQXM2/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SoftHeat Ultra Micro-Plush</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0091BU68A/?tag=ybdblkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Serta Luxe Plush</a> ranked the highest in peace of mind due to their low-voltage technology and built-in over-temperature protection. They also were the most cost-efficient to operate, at $3.50 annually for the SoftHeat and $3.35 annually for the Serta.</p>
