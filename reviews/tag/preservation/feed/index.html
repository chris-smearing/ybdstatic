<p><em>Editors note: as of April 2019 our top pick, the Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S appears to be out of stock and has been replaced with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DC3VJG6/?tag=ybdslr-20">Crenova&#8217;s &#8211; VS100S</a> model. We&#8217;re currently looking into the differences. We have also found that the original winner looks identical to a rebrand by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DWVVX5F/?tag=ybdslr-20">TINVOO&#8217;s VS100S</a>, which we&#8217;ve replaced links throughout this article to reflect.</em></p>
<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>With plenty of vacuum sealers available on Amazon, it was no easy feat  narrowing down the list to six for testing. We started by talking to chef, Draper Donely, who’s spent the last three years with Submariner as Director of Franchise Operations. He helped us learn which qualities were essential for food safety in vacuum sealed foods. We also discussed with him the necessities of sous vide cooking.</p>
<p>While researching further in the subreddit /r/frugal, we learned there is a wide range of use for vacuum sealers that will place more importance on some features than other use cases. For example, game hunters that will be spending several hours vacuum sealing in one session need a machine that can stand up to repeated and heavy use, but aren’t too concerned about how big the machines are.</p>
<p>This led us to looking at some commercial-grade sealers such as the Weston Pro &#8211; 2300 and Cabela’s 12 inch commercial sealer. And while these are amazing devices that are well-loved by hunters and chefs, they do come at a hefty price. For your average kitchen, we looked at what consumers thought were important qualities from Amazon reviews, Reddit and YouTube. We looked at reliability reports and warranties and pitted that against companies with solid reputations. No vacuum sealer scored a perfect review, as each had their own minor grievances, but we were able to discern which vacuum sealers were worth considering.</p>

<h2>Who needs a vacuum sealer</h2>
<p>Food vacuum sealers are a great addition to the busy household looking to save time and money. They’re especially great for people with memberships to bulk retailers like Costco and Sam’s club. For anyone trying to save money and eliminate food waste, preservation is the key to success. Food sealers are great for extending shelf life, which will help keep foods preserved up to five times longer in both the refrigerator and the freezer, according to the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/downloads/food/guidanceregulation/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation/seafood/ucm521533.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FDA</a>.</p>
<p>Vacuum sealers not only save money and help eliminate waste, they also save you time. Busy families have tight schedules and being able to bulk shop, vacuum seal and freeze helps reduce shopping trips. Leftovers will also last longer which will help eliminate cooking a few meals, adding more to your time saved.</p>
<p>Food vacuum sealers are incredible machines that pull as much oxygen out of the storage bag as they can, before heat sealing the bag. Oxygen is the enemy of freshness and is what accelerates spoilage in food. These sealers are able to extend shelf life by eliminating most of the oxygen in the bag. That being said, it’s important to remember that food will eventually go bad over long enough period of time, even if it’s been vacuum sealed.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Width of sealer:</b> The size of the food you want to vacuum seal will determine what size bag you will need. Most food vacuum sealers are around 11 inches wide, which will accommodate most food items. Hunters will typically need a vacuum sealer at least 12 inches wide to vacuum seal larger portions of meat.</p>
<p><b>Speed/convenience/suction power:</b> All of the vacuum sealers work exactly the same way, but each one will have different combinations of features for speed and convenience. Larger units will often include a bag roll storage and cutter, a great convenience, but one that comes with the cost of a larger unit. Other units will sacrifice vacuum control for a more powerful pump that reduces the time to remove oxygen, which can lead to crushing softer foods.</p>
<p><b>Versatility:</b> If you also want to be able to seal jars and extra large bags, a hose attachment is great feature that will add versatility to your unit.</p>
<p><b>Noise:</b> No food vacuum sealer is going to have an absolutely silent motor, but some are built with noise reduction in mind.</p>
<p><b>Size / weight:</b> The importance of the size and weight will largely depend on the size of your kitchen. Assess your available counter space and your predicted frequency of use. Larger units will often have storage for bag rolls and come with a few other convenience features that offer a compelling reason to make permanent room on your counter. But if space is an issue, choose one of the lightweight vacuum sealers that’s easy to store.</p>
<p><b>Liquids / oily foods:</b> It’s important for the vacuum sealer to be able to detect liquids and oils entering the vacuum chamber quickly and shut off the motor before they enter the main housing. Lower quality machines can break down quickly if they fail to shut off in time. Packaging will reflect whether or not this feature is present.</p>
<p><strong>Warranty:</strong> With heavy use, even the best vacuum sealers may quit on you before you know it. Getting at least a one year warranty will help ease your mind, should you use your vacuum sealer often.</p>
<p><b>Performance over long sessions:</b> The average household won’t need to consider this often, but if you’re prepping for winter by sealing and storing in the freezer, it’s helpful to have a vacuum sealer that can maintain performance speed and quality over longer sessions. This is especially true for hunters that may need to seal large quantities of meat.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-does-your-food-last">How long does your vacuum sealed food last?</h2>
<p>Storage is everything when it comes to keeping your food fresh. Throughout more than 50 hours of testing vacuum sealers and discussing with food-safety experts, we also learned the length of time that popular food items last in the freezer, refrigerator and pantry. Learn more about how long your food will last if vacuum sealed and stored properly with our guideline below.</p>

<p>If you find yourself tossing expired food at the end of the week, investing in a vacuum sealer could save you money in the long run. Record how much food you’re throwing out without a vacuum sealer for a month — you might be surprised by how quickly it will pay for itself.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Convenience</h3>
<p>The first thing we wanted to know was how easy it was to get up and running with each of the vacuum sealers. Most of the units we tested were pretty straightforward: plug it into the wall, place food in provided bag, place open end in vacuum chamber, secure and press the vacuum button. The FoodSaver &#8211; V4840 was the only one that had an automated process, which took reading the directions beforehand to operate correctly. The directions are also on the machine itself and weren’t difficult to follow. The Geryon, NutriChef &#8211; Automatic Vacuum Air Sealer and Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S were the most intuitive and easiest to get started using.</p>
<p>The size and weight of the FoodSaver &#8211; V4840 made it the biggest vacuum sealer by far. It’s definitely meant to stay where you put it, so moving it around for storage will likely not be convenient. And while the Nesco &#8211; VS-02 was light in comparison, the dimensions were big enough to make it inconvenient to move around and store when not in use. The Greyon was by far the most portable food vacuum sealer.</p>
<h3>Suction power</h3>

<p>We looked at each vacuum sealer’s listed wattage and performed our own test to determine the suction power of each machine. We measured out six portions of six ounces of kidney beans, one portion for each sealer. We used the provided bags for each machine as they were all very similar in construction. We timed the process as well to further determine the convenience of each unit. To make the process as fair as possible, we eliminated as much air as possible by hand for each bag before beginning.</p>
<h3>Speed comparison</h3>

<p>For our visual assessment, we looked closely to see how much air had been removed. The bags with the most air removed sealed most tightly to the beans.  Vacuum sealing dry kidney beans is a pretty easy task for all six of our chosen vacuum sealers. The Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S had the quickest time and only the FoodSaver &#8211; FM2000 had a subpar vacuum seal with a time of almost ten seconds more than the best time recorded.</p>
<p>To further test our sealers on suction power and their ability to handle moisture-rich foods, we did another round of testing with pork chops and fish. The fish, being softer and more easily crushed to produce more moisture, was great for testing how good each unit was in shutting off before pulling too much moisture into the vacuum chamber.</p>
<p><b>A note on how to get the most air removed from bags containing moisture-rich foods:</b></p>
<p>Take a sheet or two of paper towels and fold them horizontally until they are three inches tall. Place the folded up paper towel(s) in the top of the bag (make sure you’ll still have plenty of room for the machine to seal without touching the towel(s)) and away from the food. The paper towel will soak up the moisture being pulled from the food, saving it from entering and damaging the vacuum sealer. It’s not recommended to use this method for sous vide cooking. The paper towel trick will collect residual moisture and remain in the top portion of the bag.</p>
<p>The FoodSaver &#8211; V4840 and the NutriChef &#8211; Automatic Vacuum Air Sealer are the only vacuum sealers to have specific dry and moist food modes. In the case of the FoodSaver &#8211; V4840, this slowed down the process. This allowed the machine to remove more air before having to shut off. The slow process prevented moisture from entering the vacuum chamber. The moist mode on the NutriChef &#8211; Automatic Vacuum Air Sealer had no discernible effect. We used it with the mode on and off with the same foods and had negligible difference in both time and results.</p>
<p>The moisture-rich fish helped further separate the quality of the suction achieved by each machine. The smaller units did very well. The Geryon &#8211; Vacuum Sealer Machine and Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S both shut off during appropriate times to ensure too much moisture didn’t enter the vacuum chamber. The Geryon barely edged out the FoodSave &#8211; FM2000 in our visual assessment of the pork chops, with a barely noticeable difference in the amount of air removed.</p>
<p><b>A note on vacuum sealing raw chicken:</b></p>
<p>When vacuum sealing raw chicken, make sure to thoroughly clean the vacuum chamber after each use. Salmonella is always a risk factor when working with raw chicken in the kitchen. It’s important to clean the vacuum chamber after any liquid or juices from raw meat enter it to ensure food safety.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>To test the performance of our six vacuum sealers we specifically wanted to look at longevity, strength of the seal and how well it does with soft foods.</p>
<h4>High volume testing</h4>
<p>For our high volume test, we measured out 30 portions of kidney beans weighing six ounces each. We then vacuum sealed each one to see how many each unit could vacuum seal at 100% efficacy, meaning we did repeated vacuum sealing until each unit could no longer remove air to the same degree as the first bag sealed. We also checked to see how much rest each unit needed after failure before being able to use it again at 100% efficacy.</p>

<p>The FoodSaver &#8211; V4840 was a real champion at sealing bags consecutively. It made it to 25 bags before getting too hot to get a 100% vacuum on the next bag. This is because the bags would start to seal from the heat, which would not allow the machine to pull out air to create the vacuum. The cool down time was also the longest, but we’ll forgive that due to the much higher bag count. We noticed that units that were made of mostly plastic had quicker recovery times. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IUAK39A/?tag=ybdslr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nesco</a> wasn’t able to last as long but it cooled down and was able to get back to work faster than all, but the Geryon.</p>
<h4>Strength of seal</h4>

<p>We tested the strength of the seal through a variety of means, both normal and extreme. Our normal involved using a sous vide cooking machine. Sous vide cooking utilizes vacuum sealed food to achieve a very thorough and even cooking that results in marvelously tasty meals. We used each unit to vacuum seal an eight oz. cut of beef chuck for our sous vide cooking.</p>
<p>Sous vide cooking takes an extremely long time compared to other methods, but is actually very easy and yields wonderful results. Our beef chuck was an excellent choice to use as it is a very inexpensive cut of beef that highlighted the benefits of using a sous vide cooker.</p>
<p>We sealed each portion with seasoning, thyme and rosemary before cooking. In this test, there was no clear winner as each performed admirably with equal results. Each portion was cooked perfectly throughout the entire portion.</p>
<p>For our first extreme test we sealed six slices of apple and took these to the desert and left them in the sun while we rock climbed. This helped us check for oxidation which helped us determine just how good the vacuum and the seal were. A pleasant surprise greeted us when we opened the bags; the apples were completely baked and tasted superb. The only bag to show signs up oxidation was the bag vacuum-sealed by the Nesco &#8211; VS-02, meaning it failed to achieve a high level vacuum seal.</p>
<p>Our second extreme test involved sealing paper towels and taking them freediving with us to a depth of 60 feet. While it’s unlikely anyone will need to take vacuum sealed food 60 feet underwater, we thought it would be a fun way to test how well the seal did under pressure. And not surprisingly, not a single bag leaked.</p>
<p>In the end, the only machine to underperform was the Nesco and only in terms of vacuum. Each unit performed admirably in regards to the strength of the seal.</p>
<h4>Soft foods</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10275" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test.jpg" alt="testing crushable soft foods" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-768x512@2x.jpg 1536w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/soft-foods-test-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>To check how well each food vacuum sealer dealt with vacuum sealing soft foods, we used the softest food we could think of: sliced bread. We placed two slices of bread into a bag, vacuum sealed it and compared our results.</p>
<p>This allowed us to test how quickly the stop function worked on all the vacuum sealers. If you let any of them go automatically, they will each crush the bread into almost nothing. Every unit we tested stopped immediately after pressing the stop button, but the Nesco would allow a little bit of air to return to the chamber before sealing.</p>
<p>The Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S has a wonderful feature that allows you to remove a little more air in small bursts through a pulse button. This came in handy throughout our time with the unit.</p>
<h4>Unique features</h4>
<p>As mentioned above, the Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S has a pulse button that allows for quick bursts of suction to remove as much air as possible. This was especially useful for soft foods, but came in handy during other uses as well.</p>
<p>The FoodSaver &#8211; V4840 4840 and Nesco &#8211; VS-02 both come with storage for a bag roll. This is a fantastic feature that makes it easy to keep track of everything and create custom-sized bags. Both also have a slicer integrated into the machine to make cutting effortless and precise.</p>
<p>The FoodSaver &#8211; V4840 4840 is the only one we tested that came with an included canister pump that is attached to the machine. While this feature is not as commonly used, it’s a nice addition.</p>
<h4>Cleaning</h4>
<p>Food vacuum sealers are going to get dirty. It’s a fact of life for almost every kitchen appliance. And keeping these machines clean, especially the rubber seal of the vacuum chamber, is crucial to keeping them functioning properly and lasting for years instead of months. In our testing, we found that all but the FoodSaver &#8211; V4840 4840 were very easy to clean. The FoodSaver &#8211; V4840 4840 sliding tray made it difficult to thoroughly clean the device if too much liquid was pulled during suction. While not an impossible task, it was nowhere near as easy as with the other units.</p>
<p>The Geryon &#8211; Vacuum Sealer Machine was perhaps the easiest to clean in these situations, being constructed almost entirely of heavy duty plastic and having a removable inner tray.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S</h2>

<p>Of the six vacuum sealers we tested, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DWVVX5F/?tag=ybdslr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S</a> sucked the most, which in this case is the best. When used to vacuum seal pork chops and fish, it performed admirably and was easy to put away after sealing anything. While it isn’t the smallest unit, it’s relatively close in size to the Geryon — the smallest unit — and is still easily storable. The Tinvoo was also the quickest machine and was only outperformed in longevity by the two FoodSavers. This made our consecutive sealing test easier to perform in comparison to the other models. The simplicity of its design also lent it a nice aesthetic while in use in our kitchen.</p>

<p>We also appreciated how easy it was to use in comparison to the larger FoodSaver &#8211; V4840 4840 while still having similar features. The vacuum chamber was large, making it easy to place the open end of the bag into the machine. Pushing down on the machine to lock it into place took the least amount of guesswork due to the design. The Tinvoo hinge for the lid is very close to the front of the machine, giving it enough weight towards the back to balance the machine while pressing down the lid to lock.</p>
<p>The Tinvoo also featured a pulse button, a welcome and unique feature to the unit. The pulse button allowed us to maximize our vacuum and remove as much air as possible past the point of the machine’s automatic pump. This was extremely helpful when sealing moisture-rich foods with our papel towel trick.</p>
<p>With 79% of its users on Amazon giving it five stars, we aren’t surprised it was our top pick as well. The negative reviews reported the unit quit after less than 20 uses. We put it through the paces and never had an issue. Many of the negative reviews did mention that the company replaced defective units promptly and with no hassle.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to save money and time with an excellent vacuum sealer that isn’t going to break the bank or eat up your counter space, then you’ll appreciate the simple and easy to use Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Our top vacuum sealer, the Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S, not only performed better than the other six food vacuum sealers, it featured a unique pulse button to get the best vacuum seal possible.</li>
<li>Small and lightweight, the Tinvoois easy to pack up and store or hang out on the counter without taking up too much space.</li>
<li>The manufacturer warranty is good and the company treats customers well.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DI342IW/?tag=ybdslr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FoodSaver &#8211; v4840</a> almost wins by default because as its name implies, it has a built-in handheld pump. This is a nice addition if you want to seal very large objects with compatible zipper bags. It also doubles as storage for your sealing bags roll and has a built-in slicer to cut custom-sized bags. This tried and true brand takes what’s good about the smaller FoodSaver &#8211; FM2000 and increases the power and improves the overall performance while adding plenty of additional features.</p>

<p>The size of the v4840 will pretty much assure it a permanent place on your kitchen counter. If you have the room, it’s definitely worth it. Having a bag roll storage and slicer built-into the unit makes it so that you won’t have to potentially hunt around your kitchen for bags.</p>
<p>The FoodSaver was also the only one on our picks to feature an automatic start. To begin suction, you feed the end of the bag into the bottom tray and the unit will begin the process once it detects the bag. The unit also has instructions and tips printed inside the storage container which are definitely helpful. The key to getting it to work quickly is to orient the bag so that the curve of the bag faces down.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The FoodSaver &#8211; v4840 is from a trusted and well-established brand that’s been making home use vacuum sealers for over 30 years.</li>
<li>The automatic start makes for a convenient operation and gives this vacuum sealer a little more ease of use, especially when vacuum sealing multiple items in one session.</li>
<li>It has great versatility, from years of design experience.</li>
<li>The large size accommodates bag roll storage making this ideal for those who have the counter space available and don’t mind having a permanent place for it.</li>
</ul>

<p>This little beauty, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSZVPJM/?tag=ybdslr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Geryon &#8211; E2800-C</a> was right up there with the winner. It had many of the same things going for it that we loved about our top pick. It was almost as fast, almost as powerful and was even smaller. We honestly enjoyed using it as much as the Tinvoo. It was extremely easy to clean and worked wonderfully.</p>
<p>It’s a great device for the home cook with little space in the kitchen as its small size makes it easy to move about and store. But it can also squeeze onto even the smallest amount of counter space. And its stainless steel look will complement plenty of other appliances.</p>
<p>Amazon users who purchased the product agreed, with 69% giving it a five-star rating. They also loved the ease of use and clean-up. Many said they appreciated how quiet the machine was during use.</p>

<p>Another entry from the most established brand in the market of food vacuum sealers, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D5TMBE0/?tag=ybdslr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Foodsaver &#8211; FM2000</a> unit worked well, offering a solid user experience while being much smaller than its bigger and more expensive older brother. Even though it was the loudest of the bunch we tested, it was still relatively quiet.</p>
<p>It doesn’t beat out our favorites, but it still performs admirably and has been well-received by daily users for years. It’s a fan favorite and is often found in the kitchens of those who love sous vide cooking.</p>
<p>The FM2000 finished second, after it’s bigger sibling, in how long it could be used continuously. So if you’re a hunter that will be needing longer sessions or someone who does winter storing in bulk, this is a great alternative to the very expensive commercial-grade vacuum sealers.</p>

<p>Another small and lightweight unit, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2HE2HD/?tag=ybdslr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NutriChef &#8211; PKVS18BK</a> put up very respectable numbers in all our tests. It had one of the most aesthetically pleasing designs of the bunch and would fit well in a modern-style kitchen.</p>
<p>The touchscreen-style buttons were a neat touch that made the device feel far more futuristic than the other units, giving it an air of sophistication. Its small size and performance make it a great all rounder as it had a very satisfying locking mechanism when we used it. This made multiple sessions easy and never left us double checking to ensure both sides were secure before sealing.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IUAK39A/?tag=ybdslr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nesco &#8211; VS-02</a> was the only other unit we tested to feature a built-in storage for bag rolls along with a slicer to help make precise cuts. Its larger size will be more at home as a permanent resident on your countertop, but it’s light enough to be portable as well should you want to keep it in the pantry.</p>
<p>For those that are new to vacuum sealing their food, this is a great start to see if you’re going to be spending the time to seal and store. It won’t break the bank and it will meet all the needs of the occasional sealer.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>When it comes to saving time and money in the kitchen, eliminating food waste is a crucial component to success. The best way to eliminate food waste is to extend shelf life, and a vacuum sealer is the best method for to so. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DWVVX5F/?tag=ybdslr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S</a> comes in as our top choice for its ability to quickly and powerfully vacuum seal food, allow for pulse adjustment and doing so while occupying very little counter space. While the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DI342IW/?tag=ybdslr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FoodSaver &#8211; V4840</a> was an excellent and versatile machine, the difference in price and the simple and easy to use and clean <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DWVVX5F/?tag=ybdslr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tinvoo &#8211; VS100S</a> made it the best choice.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter slicing a small harvest of apples, puréeing seven pints of strawberries and experimenting with a gamut of other dried treats, we’ve determined that the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B014IK804K/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> LEM Products &#8211; 1152</a> is the best food dehydrator for home users. It’s versatile, with a design and features that make it easier to operate than the competition. Plus, it dried very consistently in our tests. If you’re only looking for a dehydrator so you can make a bit of fruit leather and small batches of interesting things you find on your raw-food Pinterest board, the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012CG8N26/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Hamilton Beach &#8211; 32100A</a> is quite a bit louder than the LEM but takes up less counter space and comes at a fraction of the cost.</p>

<p>To put it mildly, our test team was unprepared for the range of opinions and demands that exists in the world of food dehydrating. Between raw diets, paleo diets, prepping, backpacking and people collecting garden herbs, there isn’t just one way to use a dehydrator.</p>
<p>In addition to our chats with raw food chef Jenny Ross and food safety expert <a href="https://fbns.ncsu.edu/faculty-directory/dana-j-hanson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Dana Hanson</a>, we looked at an abundance of consumer content. We studied reviews on Amazon, Reddit discussions, YouTube reviews and we even looked hard at life-hack dehydrator alternatives like microwaves and box fans. Both will work, but neither will replace the convenience and performance of a good dehydrator if you want to dry food on a regular basis.</p>
<p>We also looked at reviews of more expensive, high-capacity dehydrators, like Jenny Ross’s favorite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GUR325W/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tribest Sedona</a> and the Stainless-steel-bodied dehydrators from companies like LEM, STX, and Excalibur; they look like great products and may be worth investigating if you want to use a dehydrator commercially or if you’re making literally all of your food in one, but fundamentally those more expensive machines work the same way as the less expensive models we tested.</p>
<p>Warranty information and reliability reports were considered, and we chose manufacturers that had good reputations, but at the end of the day quality control is never a sure thing: every manufacturer had some reviews from customers who saw parts or assembly issues that gave them pause.</p>

<h2>Why use a dehydrator?</h2>
<p>Anyone with a productive zucchini plant or apple tree probably already knows: when gardening, a preservation plan is the difference between enjoying the fruit of your labor and tossing a good portion of it into the compost pile.</p>
<p>Preservation isn’t the only reason to use a dehydrator. Fruit that’s sliced or puréed and then dried makes for amazing snacks, like banana chips or strawberry leather. Almost all of the flavor of ripe fruit remains, but concentrated and without any sticky mess. (Backpackers love dehydrators, some even dry out cooked food — like chili or soup — so it’ll be easier to prepare on the trail.)</p>
<p>It’s not just about snacks, either. Those who eschew cooking to preserve the enzymes in raw or ‘living’ food can accomplish amazing things with a dehydrator. Believe it or not, our research turned up raw-food recipes for cracker-like dried breads, desserts, wraps, pizza&#8230; you can even make raw-vegan pancakes!</p>
<p>Dehydrators are machines dedicated to speeding up the drying process with forced air and electric heating elements. Handy trays, temperature control and built-in timers also help make the work easier.</p>
<p>Most literature on home preservation of food recommends that you try to eat all of your home-dried food within a year (spoilage can still happen with unexpected moisture and heat over time), but there’s really no limit on how long it could last in the right storage conditions. (Fruit cake has been known to keep for centuries.)</p>

<h3>Air flow direction</h3>
<p>The biggest difference in dehydrator designs is the way air passes among the trays: horizontally or vertically. Each design <em>will</em> successfully dry food, though consistency and ease of use may vary from one machine to another.</p>
<p>Horizontal flow (like our top pick) means a big box and a big fan blowing across trays that will slide in and out of the box (very much like a small convection oven, but with way more airflow and less heat). A horizontal airflow design means that there is fresh air coming off the fan hitting each tray directly. (You can also take some trays out to get more space for large items.)</p>
<p>Vertical flow (like our budget pick) means a fan at the bottom (or top, in the case of Nesco’s “Converge-a-Flow” system) with trays in a stack. Stacking designs capitalize on the way hot air naturally rises, so (theoretically) the fan doesn’t need to work as hard to do the same job. You can also buy extra trays and simply add them to the stack to increase the machine’s capacity.</p>
<p>There are downsides to each design. The horizontal-flow systems take up more counter space, while the stacking designs always have a vent hole in the middle of the tray that does require creativity when drying some items — sheets of cracker or fruit leather, for example, will have a circle cut out in the middle.</p>
<h3>Capacity</h3>

<p>How much you can dry in one go is the biggest variable when selecting a specific dehydrator model.</p>
<p>You can technically get more capacity for less money with a vertical stack, since additional trays cost less than an additional machine. Each of those trays is still going to be relatively small compared to the trays in a horizontal-flow machine, though, and any concerns about uneven drying will only get worse with more trays in a vertical stack.</p>

<p>If you need even more capacity, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HVJOBC6/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Excalibur</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B014IK804K/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LEM</a> sell machines with nine or ten trays compared to the five-tray designs we tested — of course, that makes the machines taller and more expensive. They come with larger fans and heating elements, so you’ll get similar drying performance to the five-tray models, unlike the just-add-trays philosophy of stacking machines.</p>
<h3>Controls</h3>
<p>There are a few control features that can add convenience to dehydrator operation. A thermostat is essential if you want any control at all over drying speed on different types and sizes of food items, while a timer doesn’t really change the way the machine works (it just means the machine won’t run forever if you forget about it.)</p>
<p>All the models we tested aside from one have a timer, and they all had some kind of thermostat (some digital, some analog.) Some can be purchased for less money if you don’t want a timer, or at rock-bottom prices if you only want one temperature (typically those are stuck wide-open at 160 °F, which is too hot for herbs or delicate veggies.)</p>
<h3>Accessories</h3>
<p>The machines we tested came with a wide gamut of accessory types, but the comparison isn’t always apples-to-apples.</p>
<p>The Excalibur and L’Equip dehydrators come with a removable mesh liner for each tray, which seems like a big bonus. The trays on most machines don’t actually need a mesh liner unless you’re drying seeds or small berries. The spacing of the grid is close enough that anything bigger than a grape won’t fall through.</p>
<p>In fact, in the tests we ran, the Excalibur was the only machine with trays that really needed a mesh “easy-clean” liner to keep food from falling through. If you’re drying fruit that’s super-sticky (candied fruit, for example) the liners might be easy to scrub, but you’ll need to wash off the trays themselves one way or the other.</p>
<p>Fruit leather trays from the manufacturer are a must-have if you want to make roll-ups in a stacking machine with a hole in the middle of each tray, but with broad square trays in the horizontal-flow machines, a sheet of greased parchment paper will do an even better job than purpose-built trays (since most people will use parchment paper to roll up fruit leather for storage anyhow.)</p>
<h2 id="raw-food-drying">A note for raw food drying</h2>
<p>Raw or “living” food diets typically call for preparation without heating past 118 °F, to preserve enzymes and other beneficial organisms or nutrients. For some guidance regarding the specialized needs of a raw-food diet, we reached out to a local raw-food restaurateur and cookbook author, <a href="http://href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Jenny-Ross/e/B004KUJKJS/?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ybddehy-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=c40fa8e34b67114ff79e15db6552ea3b&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jenny Ross</a>.</p>
<p>Jenny notes that while an accurate thermostat system is a crucial part of a dehydrator, drying temperature is a bit more complicated than the time/temperature you deal with when baking or roasting:</p>
<p><em>“What you have to understand is that the dehydrator is simply moving warm air over your food item. You are actually dealing with three temperatures: the temperature of that warm air [coming off the heating element], the internal temperature of the food product itself, and the ambient temperature of the air which is affected by the moisture release of the food product you are drying.”</em></p>
<p>All this means that drying will happen differently depending on the thickness of the food, texture of the food, and how much water it starts with.</p>
<p><em>“Wraps, for example, are very finicky. If your goal is a culinary masterpiece you want a dehydrator that holds its temperature accurately overall. Dehydrators with a solid construction are the number one thing I look for, number two is the drying technology: can it hold a solid temperature for the whole dehydrating process?”</em></p>

<p>We checked the weight of the top tray, bottom tray and the total net load that went into each machine before we started. We checked weights and temperatures for each machine after one, three, five and seven hours of drying. We checked both the air around the food and the internal temperatures of the items with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B018QHQSB8/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">beaded-wire K-type probe</a>. Once the food has dried it’s very difficult to get a probe inside, and the fruit leather is really too thin to begin with, so in those cases we switched to a surface reading with an infrared thermometer.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5923" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appletest_airtemptest-1.jpg" alt="apple air temp. testing" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appletest_airtemptest-1.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appletest_airtemptest-1-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appletest_airtemptest-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appletest_airtemptest-1-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appletest_airtemptest-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appletest_airtemptest-1-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appletest_airtemptest-1-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appletest_airtemptest-1-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appletest_airtemptest-1-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/appletest_airtemptest-1-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The results are as follows:</p>
<h3>Percentage dry</h3>
<p>This is the percentage of the water-mass removed from the total mass of the food we put in the machine after seven hours. (The <a href="http://nchfp.uga.edu/how/dry/pack_store.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Center for Home Preservation says to aim for an 80% reduction for fruit</a>, and seven hours is within the expected drying time — which will vary depending on ambient humidity.)</p>
<h3>Evenness</h3>
<p>This is a measure of how consistently the fruit dried on the trays in a machine (for stacking machines, this is the weight difference between top/bottom; for the horizontal flow machines we chose the second and fifth trays because the middle three trays are closest to the heating element).</p>
<p>Note that in the apple test there were a few machines that had between four and six slices that were notably wetter than the rest on the same tray after the seven hour mark (wet enough that we separated them from the rest of the batch to prevent spoilage when we bagged everything). We’ve deducted 5% from the consistency score for those machines.</p>
<h3>Temperature Accuracy</h3>
<p>This is an indicator of how close the machine stayed, on average, to the temperature we set on the thermostat. Readings are averaged between two trays, which were checked with a dry-bulb test (bare probe in the airstream) for three minutes each time we checked the machines. Most of the machines cycled up and down over the course of a few minutes.</p>
<p>We tried three different dehydrator recipes for our tests:</p>
<p><strong>Fruit leather</strong></p>

<p>For each machine we took a 1lb basket of strawberries, cleaned them and removed any brown spots, then puréed with a few apple slices and a lemon wedge thrown in. The purée was poured into greased trays if included with the dehydrator, or onto greased parchment paper if they weren’t. (Rolling the leather with parchment paper is the best way to store fruit leather anyway.)</p>

<p>For the fruit leather test, we divided the purée for the LEM and Excalibur machines into top/middle/bottom; there was definitely quicker drying near the heating element in the back-middle of the machine, but by the end of drying the top and bottom, the two were basically the same and consistency was very good overall in the horizontal-flow machines. For the other tests, we checked top and bottom and found that the consistency was quite good in all of the machines except the L’Equip.</p>
<p>In the L’Equip FIlter Pro the bottom tray was very brittle even before the top tray was finished drying. It took some soaking to get most of the baked-on fruit off that tray, even though we greased it before we poured the purée in. The Filter Pro can put out enough heat to dry fruit leather, but the fan doesn’t seem big enough to circulate that heat evenly.</p>
<p><strong>Apple slices</strong></p>

<p>We used almost 20 pounds of fairly large granny smith apples, cleaned and sliced about 1/4” thick with an electric slicer to maintain uniformity. The slices went straight from the slicer to the dehydrator rack. After drying for seven hours at 140 °F, the result was (in most cases) tart and chewy with just the right amount of sweetness!</p>
<p>Many recipes suggest adding cinnamon, honey, or pre-treating in ascorbic acid (vitamin C) to help prevent browning; our slices dried quickly enough that we didn’t see much browning and we liked the ‘raw’ taste. Apples are easy to dry and provide a broad canvas with which to experiment!</p>
<p><strong>Jerky</strong></p>

<p>We used the classic Worcestershire-and-soy-sauce jerky marinade overnight on some thinly-sliced top round beef. Before we dried it, we followed US Federal food-safety guidelines for jerky-making by heating the meat (we put the meat and marinade directly into a stockpot) to an internal temperature of 160 °F prior to drying. This method will reliably kill more than 99.9999% of any bacteria present.</p>
<p><strong>A note on jerky and food safety</strong></p>
<p>Although USDA food safety guidelines are usually mentioned in dehydrator instruction manuals, many recipes you’ll find among jerky enthusiasts skip the pre-cook, since cooked meat can make a jerky that’s more brittle or crumbly.</p>
<p>Jerky and other dried meat products have been around for nearly as long as humans have, so traditionalists might seem reasonable in insisting that un-cooked jerky won’t necessarily make you sick. There are cases of salmonella and e.coli contamination that have shown up even in commercially produced jerky when USDA guidelines aren’t rigorously followed, though: food safety policy is about evaluating risk.</p>
<p>To get a definitive answer about temperatures needed for reasonable safety in jerky-making, we reached out to <a href="https://fbns.ncsu.edu/faculty-directory/dana-j-hanson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Dana Hanson</a> of North Carolina State University’s Department of Food, Bioprocessing and Nutrition Sciences.</p>
<p>Dr. Hanson explained that simply salting the meat is not enough to eliminate pathogens that could be present in any meat. <em>“The pathogens that we worry about [salmonella and e. coli]&#8230; There&#8217;s just not a lot of definitive research out there that shows ‘if we just salt it and dry it&#8217;s going to achieve [enough] reductions.&#8217; So that&#8217;s why we cook jerky in the US.”</em></p>

<p><em>“I totally understand,” he said, “from a culinary standpoint&#8230; boiling is probably not what you want to do. I appreciate good jerky, but [pre-cooking jerky] can provide the safest system and still have pretty acceptable quality.”</em></p>
<p>We talked to Dr. Hanson about the temperature readings we got, with internal temperatures of 90-110 °F for the first hour of drying.</p>
<p><em>“If there&#8217;s danger in home jerky processing, that&#8217;s where it exists: those temperatures are near perfect incubation temperatures for some of the pathogens we&#8217;re talking about.“</em></p>
<p>And once the meat has dried, will a high-temperature dehydrator solve our problems then? Not really. Some moisture is required to kill pathogens like salmonella. As Dr. Hanson pointed out, <em>“There are some species that actually are more tolerant to heat at low humidities.”</em></p>
<p>So while any of these machines is able to effectively dry out meat that has been made safe by pre-cooking, we don’t recommend any of them as a risk-free means of turning raw meat directly into jerky — pretty much any dehydrator will fail that test.</p>

<p>We set up in our test kitchen late at night and measured both the sound level and the pitch of the fan noise produced by each dehydrator. (We’ve included samples from the kitchen’s microwave and fridge as well, for comparison; they were unplugged during the rest of the test.)</p>
<p>We measured noise level using the same sound-measuring methodology as workplace or environmental noise exposure standards. Sound level measurements are integrated over time with a formula that accounts for the non-linear way we respond to changing sound level, and with a “weighting” that simulates the way our ears respond more readily to high-frequency sound. (The result is a “Level Equivalent, A-weighted,” or LeqA). We used a 30-second measurement time since the noise from these machines is more steady than, say, traffic noise that’s measured over hours.</p>
<p>Our test equipment included a calibrated measurement microphone patched through the <a href="https://www.roomeqwizard.com/features.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REW audio measurement suite</a> on a PC. Frequency-response calibration of the mic was provided by Dayton Audio from the factory, and we verified the SPL calibration of the system against a Galaxy Audio CM-130.</p>

<p>We mounted the microphone on a stand at ear level in the middle of the test kitchen (about four feet from the countertop test position). Levels will be higher if you want to stand right beside the machine, of course, but these results are directly comparable with each other.</p>
<p>While on the whole a lower dB reading is desirable, low-frequency noise is also less annoying than high-frequency noise; frequencies above 500Hz (see the Presto and Hamilton Beach results) are significant because they overlaps with <a href="http://www.dpamicrophones.com/mic-university/facts-about-speech-intelligibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener">important parts of human speech</a>, and that makes it hard to have a conversation in the same room.</p>
<p>The L’Equip is a clear winner here (almost as quiet as the fridge), but when we compare its performance in the other categories&#8230; it’s pretty obvious that the machine is quiet because the fan is not moving much air.</p>
<p>Note that while it put out less noise energy overall than the Excalibur, the LEM sometimes made a resonant noise that might be more annoying to some. (Probably from two pieces of sheet inside vibrating against each other.) We waited a while to be sure it was making this noise while we recorded the audio test. This may be a flaw in the construction of the machine we received, or it may be consistent throughout the line; even with some buzzing the LEM is still far quieter than the Hamilton Beach or the Presto.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IUWH44Y/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LEM Products &#8211; 1152</a> checks all the boxes in our testing. The horizontal-flow design with large square trays is easy to work with and helped this machine dry very evenly and quickly.</p>
<p>The five roomy trays use a grid spacing perfect for most home dehydrating applications. If you decide that you want fine mesh to hold seeds or berries, or a solid sheet to make fruit leather, finding or cutting a square piece of material is much easier than trying to make something fit the round machines.</p>

<p>The elephant in the room when we were testing these machines is the forty-year reputation of Excalibur dehydrators as the best of the best; LEM started out making meat-processing equipment for hunters in 1991, and they’re definitely the underdog.</p>
<p>Vertical spacing between the trays really distinguished the LEM 1152 from the Excalibur 3500. In our apple-drying test, slices that started to bend or wrinkle while drying would rub against the bottom of the tray above in the Excalibur (falling off the trays when we pulled them out), and by the end of the test it was clear that there were spaces which weren’t getting as much airflow in that machine — no such problems in the LEM.</p>

<p>The LEM also has a removable drip-tray in the bottom of the machine, which is a feature that seems obvious and downright necessary once you’ve used it. The fold-down door was also far easier to work with than the fiddly lift-off cover on the Excalibur, and you can see through it.</p>
<p>The LEM isn’t a perfect machine for making jerky all by itself, but no dehydrator is. If you’re using meat that has already been heat-treated (in moist or wet conditions) to a temperature that will kill the pathogens that could make you sick, the LEM will dry jerky quickly and evenly.</p>

<p>While two of the other machines we tested were quieter overall than the LEM, and the machine we bought buzzed a bit from time to time, it was quiet enough to use indoors (and didn’t drive us crazy the way the Presto did.)</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IUWH44Y/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LEM Products &#8211; 1152’s</a> horizontal airflow and sliding-tray design is far easier to work with than stacking dehydrators.</li>
<li>Great drying efficiency, evenness, and thermostat accuracy.</li>
<li>The 1152 wasn’t the quietest machine we tested, but performance comes from airflow.</li>
<li>LEM provides amazing features for the price when compared with the competition.</li>
<li>A removable drip tray! Brilliant!</li>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002SHNIW0/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Excalibur &#8211; 3500</a> is the machine that the enthusiasts all seem to know about and talk about. Excalibur basically invented the horizontal-flow design, and they offer a wide range of dehydrators and accessories. (the 3500 comes with a very thorough 194-page “Complete guide to food dehydration.”)</p>

<p>The 3500 is a good machine by any standard, and if it were priced competitively it would be an easier recommendation; Excalibur is banking on their reputation, though, and they make you pay dearly for every feature and upgrade. If you want to match functionality with LEM, the 3526CD (no longer available) with added analog-dial timer and clear door will bump the list price from an already-dear $199.95 to $269.95. Adding full digital control bumps it up to $299.95. In our testing we didn’t find these features necessary, but they’re definitely nice to have and even the cheapest model we tested included them.</p>

<p>Cost aside, the fact that the trays are so close together in the Excalibur 3500 is really what took our recommendation away. You could take out two trays to get more room, but the LEM just has better-chosen spacing for the drying jobs we did (though it gives the Excalibur a slight edge in the fruit-leather test.) Add in a clunky door and lack of a timer, and the Excalibur just wasn’t as nice to use.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002SHNIW0/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Excalibur &#8211; 3500</a> is very popular among dehydrator-enthusiasts with a long track record of reliable consistency.</li>
<li>The Excalibur performed very well in all our tests, edging out even the LEM in speed and consistency when drying fruit leather.</li>
<li>The closer spacing was a downside with larger items like apple chips, which got caught up on the trays above when we pulled them out and dried less evenly than in the LEM.</li>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012CG8N26/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 32100A</a> is tiny for a dehydrator, but it packs decent efficiency into its small footprint. If you want a cheap dehydrator you can store in a small cupboard and bring out every now and then to make snacks, this is it.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach dries food quickly, though not as quickly or evenly as our top pick, and you’ll probably want to move the bottom trays to the top and stir things around halfway through the cycle if you’re filling it up.</p>

<p>The biggest problem we had with evenness in this machine (and in the L’Equip) is that the air can’t circulate evenly to the corners of the rectangular trays. This is especially apparent on the bottom tray, where there are spots that seem not to get much hot air at all. This will be a bigger problem for some tasks than others; in follow-up batches we found that if you can leave the bottom tray empty, it helps the evenness a lot.</p>
<p>With full digital control, five trays, and a set of tray liners, this machine takes the cake for value any way you slice it: watts-per-dollar, capacity-per-dollar, accessories-per-dollar… if you can live with the noise and a bit of babysitting cold spots, it would be cheaper to buy two of these than an equivalent Nesco machine.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Hamilton Beach &#8211; 32100A is a clear value winner for small batches.</li>
<li>Its compact size, front-panel controls and a see-through lid are very convenient for countertop use.</li>
<li>Not as consistent when you load it up; if you’re drying larger volumes of food you’ll definitely want our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IUWH44Y/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">top pick</a>.</li>
<li>This was the loudest machine we tested.</li>

<h3>The Presto Dehydro 06301</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/presto-stack.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We really liked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M2WIZCT/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Presto Dehydro</a>; it has a lot going for it.</p>
<p>From its efficiency and consistency, to its see-through lid and nesting trays (it takes up considerably less space in storage-mode than the Nesco), this is a good machine if you like the stacking design. There’s even a spool built into the base to wrap the cord around for storage.</p>
<p>That said, we wouldn’t choose it over the LEM for big jobs (like apple or zucchini harvest) and the more budget-friendly Hamilton Beach will do the same job if you just want to make a snack, while taking up even less of your cupboard.</p>
<p>The biggest downside to the Presto is really the noise it makes; it will drown out any conversation you try to have in the same part of your house.</p>

<p>Nesco American Harvest is, like Excalibur, a well-established player in this market.</p>
<p>The previous version of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JB0FB72/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FD77DT</a>, the “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0090WOCN0/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Snackmaster” FD75A</a>, is still the best-selling dehydrator on Amazon. The old model had an analog thermostat with no timer, the 77DT has full digital control; fan and heat output appear to be identical. Note that the analog model includes more trays and accessories for the same price as the bare-bones digital package.</p>
<p>Nesco has done well making the vertical-stack design work efficiently, but not quite as well as Presto has. Presto’s trays nest for storage, but Nesco mounts the fan on top and gives you a drip tray on bottom.</p>
<p>If we had to choose between only the two circle-shaped stacking dehydrators, it would really come down to a choice between quiet operation and drying efficiency; the LEM has much better capacity and drying efficiency than either.</p>
<h3>The L’Equip Filter Pro</h3>

<p>We really wanted to like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VWUM2I/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">L&#8217;Equip</a>. It’s understated in design, but with precisely-crafted details, like a retractable cord and smooth-turning and intuitive rotary controls for the digital timer and thermostat.</p>
<p>It comes with more accessories than you’ll probably know what to do with (though the two small fruit leather trays are a bit underwhelming given the size of the machine.) Even the shape seems like a good compromise between the flexibility of stacking and the usability of square trays, basically giving you two decent-sized square areas on either side of the vent hole.</p>
<p>The best thing about this machine is also the worst: the fan is very, very quiet, but gives the worst performance for drying efficiency and consistency out of any machine we tested. As far as we can tell, the fan is just underpowered for all the drying area it has to cover. After we turned most of the machines off at the seven-hour mark in the apple test, we shuffled the trays and ran the L’Equip for another three and a half hours to get the corner slices dry — and there were still damp spots after that.</p>
<p>We liked the details of this machine enough to keep trying to give it a chance to shine, but however much we might like the way it looks, feels or sounds, there’s no excusing the poor performance. (Especially when it’s in the same price range as our top performer.) Based on the build quality of the Filter Pro we looked at other models from L’Equip, like the high-tech radiant-heat <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0167XS0HI/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">IR D5 model</a>… but the price pretty much rules that one out too.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Dehydrating is a great way to store or prepare food, and these machines all give you complete control over the process: nothing will go into your granola or fruit leather or jerky that you didn’t add yourself, and you can decide just how much heat you want to use to speed up the drying process.</p>
<p>Any of these machines will get food dry eventually and with a bit of care, but the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B014IK804K/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LEM Products 1152</a> does it quicker and more efficiently, and you can load it up without worrying about shuffling trays. It’s a much better value than any other machine with the same features, too.</p>
<p>If you don’t have nine pounds of zucchini and 20 pounds of apples to store every fall, you may be happier with the size and value of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012CG8N26/?tag=ybddehy-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach 32100A</a>, which is loud and not quite as consistent, but does a good job with small batches.</p>
