<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected containers to test</h2>
<p>Whether you’re looking to reorganize your kitchen cabinets or pantry or want to prevent pests from burrowing into flour, sugar and other baking ingredients, dry food storage containers that are functional and airtight are essential.</p>
<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, Tupperware was the most recognized brand for food storage containers, and even today, it’s still used as a generic term for all plastic containers. Although Tupperware expanded globally, the company’s sales are primarily made by private parties, while its competitor, the less-expensive Rubbermaid, can be purchased virtually anywhere.</p>
<p>We previously <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-food-storage-container/">reviewed food storage containers</a> that are made for refrigerating, freezing and reheating food, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a>, was our top pick for plastic containers.</p>
<p>For this review of containers for storing dry goods, we added Brilliance&#8217;s line of containers and another well-reviewed Rubbermaid product to our list to see how they held up to other highly rated containers. Amazon reviewers give a lot of love to certain containers, so we selected those that had at least a 4.3-star rating.</p>
<p>Since not everyone wants to use plastic, we decided to test acrylic and glass containers as well to determine whether they were better than plastic for storage of dry goods. The majority of dry food storage containers are sold as sets of three or more different sizes, and even though many may be bought separately, it’s more cost-effective to purchase them as a set.</p>

<p>Every container we tested was heralded as airtight, which is especially important for storing flour, sugar and rice, since they are prone to infestation by Indian-meal moths, more commonly known as pantry moths.</p>
<p>To test whether a container was airtight, we sealed a piece of toilet tissue inside each container, locked its lid and then plunged it into two gallons of water. We held the container under water and revolved it several times. When we removed the container from the water and unsealed the lid, if the tissue paper was wet, the container wasn’t airtight. Only three of the seven storage containers we tested were 100 percent airtight.</p>
<p>Overall, dry food storage containers are either tall rectangles or cylinders. Some were slender modulars, no taller than 10 inches, designed to fit in most kitchen cabinets. Although they would look attractive on a countertop, these containers were too narrow to hold a five-pound bag of flour or to allow scooping flour out with a one-cup measuring cup.</p>
<p>Some people might only want containers for beans, rice and pasta, but we leaned heavily toward those that stored baking ingredients in a shape that allows easy access.</p>

<p>Not only were the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LWS0LK9/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Progressive &#8211; Prepworks ProKeeper</a> containers airtight, they’re truly unique from the others we tested — or any other containers we’ve seen. Although the ProKeepers could be used for storing any food item, each container in the six-container set is designed for storing a specific dry-goods product.</p>
<p>For example, the 15-cup flour container can hold an entire five-pound bag of flour, and it has a built-in leveler for leveling flour from a measuring cup, which easily fits into the container. The brown-sugar ProKeeper includes a terra-cotta disc that, when moistened, prevents brown sugar from hardening. The powdered-sugar ProKeeper has a sifting spoon, and the two mini containers each have a shaker for herbs, spices or cupcake sprinkles.</p>
<p>Progressive sells other containers for coffee, cereal, grains and pasta separately, and each has an individual feature, such as a coffee scoop or a wide-mouth pour spout for the cereal container. The herb ProKeeper is ingenious: washed herbs drain into a basket, and excess water drips into the lower part of the container, which can then be emptied through a built-in drain hole.</p>

<p>Each container is made from <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-food-storage-container/#health">BPA-free</a> crystal-clear plastic, and lids are latched shut and sealed with a silicone gasket that can be removed for cleaning.</p>
<p>The containers were perfectly airtight, <i>except</i> for the white sugar container, which we found frustrating, because of a small design flaw. The white sugar ProKeeper has a pour spout, and although all other ProKeepers have a ¼-inch-thick silicone gasket for sealing their lids, the sugar container’s is thinner and doesn’t secure the spout cover tightly enough.</p>
<p>The white sugar container is large enough to store four pounds of sugar, so it’s a shame the clever pour spout didn’t work better in keeping contents airtight. However, the sugar container could certainly be used for storing beans or pasta or other dry foods that aren’t plagued by pantry pests and another of the airtight ProKeepers used for storing white sugar instead.</p>
<p>The six-piece set is slightly more expensive than other sets, but the superb design features and bonuses, like the terra cotta disc, are worth the added cost.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Progressive &#8211; Prepworks ProKeeper six-piece set is the most unique and well-designed container system that we tested.</li>
<li>Each one has features for a specific ingredient, such as flour, brown sugar or cake toppings.</li>
<li>In testing, the ProKeepers were completely airtight, except for the sugar container, which has a pour spout that didn’t seal.</li>
<li>Other containers for coffee, grains, herbs and pasta are also available individually.</li>

<p>The thoughtful design of the Progressive &#8211; Prepworks containers gave them a slight edge over our runner-up, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076N6DLFJ/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> four-container set. In our review of food storage containers, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> won best plastic food storage container for refrigerating, freezing and reheating food, because of its durability, ease of opening/closing and its 100% airtight seal, thanks to a thick, built-in silicone gasket.</p>
<p>Other than size and shape, there’s no difference between the Brilliance all-purpose containers and the Brilliance dry food storage containers that we tested for this review. The dry food set is, however, better suited for pantry storage, taking advantage of vertical space with taller containers.</p>
<p>The eight-piece set — each lid counts as a piece — includes a 9.25-inch-tall, 16-cup container that holds a five-pound bag of flour, a 12-cup container for sugar, a 9.25-inch-tall and narrow 6.6-cup container for pasta (which is a half-inch too short for uncooked spaghetti) and a squat, rectangular 3.2-cup container.</p>

Modestly priced, this is a great starter set.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076N6DLFJ/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The small 3.2-cup container brought the Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance set down a notch in our rating, since it’s just a regular food-storage container and is too small for standard pantry items. However, additional sizes, including a container tall enough for spaghetti, are available to purchase either in sets or individually.</p>
<p>The eight-piece set is modestly priced, but it’s likely you’ll need to add to it for storing more than three dry food products in your kitchen or pantry. Still, the Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance containers are one of three containers we tested that you can completely rely on to keep pantry goods fresh and pest-free.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance containers are made of durable and crystal-clear Tritan plastic, easy to open and close and are 100 percent airtight.</li>
<li>The three larger containers are great for storing dry pantry goods, such as flour, sugar and rice.</li>
<li>The smaller container in the set is too small for pantry items, but it’s still excellent for refrigerated food storage.</li>
<li>The Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance set is well-priced, but you’ll probably need to buy other pieces individually to store more pantry goods.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bellemain &#8211; Acrylic Canister Set</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZXY51MA/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bellemain &#8211; Acrylic Canister Set</a> is the only other set we tested that was airtight. Honestly, we were surprised, because they’re very lightweight and their chrome latches are thin and wobbly. The containers look like glass Mason jars and would be an attractive addition to a kitchen counter. They’re supposedly unbreakable, but the lids and latches might not survive being accidentally knocked to the floor.</p>
<p>Because they’re airtight, the Bellemain will keep flour and sugar fresh, but they’re only large enough for scooping out a half-cup. If you wish to store dried food items, such as beans, lentils and short pasta, these glass containers would be a decent alternative to plastic containers.</p>
<h3>OXO Good Grips &#8211; POP Containers</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D78X2V6/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; POP Container</a> set includes two tall, narrow canisters, two small narrow canisters and a squat square. None are large enough to hold flour and sugar or wide enough for scooping with a measuring cup.</p>
<p>The POP lids are a great idea. They secure by pushing down on a large button in the center of the lid, which lowers the silicone seal into the lip of the container; pushing the button again releases the seal. Unfortunately, the seal isn’t airtight, and during our test, water seeped into the canister. If water can find its way in, so can bugs. The POP container set was the most expensive set we tested, and even though they look nice, they just don’t work.</p>
<h3>Brabantia &#8211; Glass Storage Containers</h3>
<p>There aren’t many glass containers available, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JFWP6EO/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brabantia</a> is highly rated on Amazon. They’re not made of heavy-duty glass, like a Mason jar, but have a similar weight to an all-purpose wine glass. They have pretty colored lids in neutral Martha-Stewart-ish tones that are interchangeable. They’re too small for holding more than a pound of flour or sugar, and because they’re not airtight, we could see them being used for storing cotton puffs or Q-tips.</p>
<h3>Chef’s Path &#8211; Food Storage Container Set</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L6MH96Z/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chef’s Path</a> seven-piece set includes containers of four different heights, one of which is designed specifically for spaghetti. However, because they’re all only four-inches wide, they’re useless for storing flour or sugar, unless you want to scoop it out with a tablespoon. Since this is a modular design, the lids fit all the containers. The Chef’s Path lids secure with a vertical latch that can be closed on either side of the lid. A very thin silicone band isn’t enough to seal the container, and during our tests, water flooded in. The Chef’s Path containers have a sleek, modern design, but they aren’t airtight.</p>
<h3>Rubbermaid &#8211; Modular Containers</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003BKGJ1A/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; 1776464 Modular Containers</a> are basic containers for a kitchen cabinet or pantry; they won’t be sitting pretty on your counter. The rectangular Modulars are wide and deep enough for scooping out flour and sugar, and the bright-red lids are interchangeable. Frequent criticism of the Rubbermaid Modulars is that the lids are ill-fitting and difficult to snap on. It does take a bit of effort, and we assumed the seal was secure. However, like most of the containers we tested, the Rubbermaid Modulars failed to be airtight.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Dry food storage containers need to be functional and airtight, but only two of the seven products we tested were both.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LWS0LK9/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Progressive &#8211; Prepworks ProKeepers</a> were each specifically designed for storing a particular ingredient. The flour container is wide enough for scooping and has a built-in leveler; the container for brown sugar includes a terra cotta disc that prevents brown sugar from drying out.</p>
<p>Only the white-sugar container had a design flaw that made it not completely airtight; all other containers in the six-canister set were 100% airtight. We also like that Progressive has matching containers for coffee, cereal, grains and herbs in its product line.</p>
<p>A close runner-up is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076N6DLFJ/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> four-container set. These durable and attractive Tritan plastic containers are perfectly airtight and wide enough for scooping and measuring. The set includes a small container that’s better suited for refrigerated food storage, but like Progressive, Rubbermaid also sells other Brilliance containers that are intended for particular food products.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e tested three of the most popular models of KitchenAid stand mixers and selected the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006WNOZ/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; Artisan</a> as the best for first-time bakers and bakers who want to bake more. It’s compact, has a powerful motor and is available in a cornucopia of colors that will match any kitchen’s design.

<h2 id="why-buy">Why buy a KitchenAid stand mixer?</h2>
<p>Simply put, it’s the best. We rigorously <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stand-mixer/">tested five highly rated stand mixers</a>, and the KitchenAid Artisan was the clear champion over the others. If you’re a daily baker or a holiday baker, any KitchenAid stand mixer is an essential appliance for your kitchen.</p>
<p>All KitchenAid stand mixers combine heavy-duty steel construction with a powerful motor. Depending on its size and wattage, a KitchenAid makes short work of any tedious baking task, such as blending thick cookie dough stuffed with mix-ins or kneading pizza dough.</p>
<p>Any KitchenAid stand mixer has been built to last a lifetime. We’ve worked with the KitchenAid Pro 600 for nearly 15 years, and it’s still churning out and humming along as well as the first day we flipped the on switch.</p>
<p>These are workhorses; and like the proverbial workhorse, they’re solid and heavy. The Artisan and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004SGFW/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Classic </a> — both are the compact, tilt-head style —  weigh in at 23 pounds. The Professional is a hefty 29 pounds. So you really need to have some kitchen-counter real estate where the KitchenAid can live, since it’s too heavy to hoist it up to a cabinet.</p>

<p>All KitchenAid stand mixers have a unique built-in that no other stand mixer has: a power hub. This portal on the mixer’s head allows you to plug in 15 attachments, ranging from a pasta roller to a spiralizer, <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-spiralizer/">like the spiralizers we reviewed</a>, to an ice cream maker, one that&#8217;s smaller and just as functional as those we reviewed in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-ice-cream-maker/">best ice cream maker</a> article.</p>
<p>Finally, you’re probably aware that a KitchenAid stand mixer is more expensive than other stand mixers. You’ll spend between $200 to $325 on a KitchenAid stand mixer, but with all of the available attachments that can do practically any cooking-prep job, you’ll push your culinary skills to new levels.</p>

<p>KitchenAid has been manufacturing stand mixers for 100 years, and during that century, they’ve given several facelifts to their models. There are three core models that KitchenAid occasionally updates: the Classic, the Pro 600 and the Artisan. (KitchenAid also makes a very large Commercial mixer, but these are really intended for bakeries or home-baking businesses.)</p>
[table id=265 /]
<h3>Classic</h3>
<p>The Classic Series has a tilt-head design, meaning the head of the mixer swivels back, which allows easy access to the mixing bowl. The Classic’s mixing bowl is 4.5 quarts and has no handle. The bowl is slightly tapered and locks into the bottom of the mixer’s stand. The Classic has 10 variable speeds controlled by a side lever.</p>
<p>The Classic has 275 watts and is a planetary-motion mixer, which means the attachments revolve while the bowl remains stationary. Although the Classic’s wattage is somewhat less than the Artisan and Pro 600, all KitchenAid stand mixers have been engineered to use wattage for creating exceptional torque — the force needed to rotate an object — which is particularly needed for kneading bread or pizza dough and mixing dense cookie dough.</p>
<p>The Classic has 59 touch points per rotation; every time the wire whisk, dough hook or flat beater (included with all KitchenAid mixers) revolves around the bowl, it will touch the bowl 59 times. The more touch points per rotation, the less you will need to scrape the sides of the bowl.</p>
<p>True to its name, the Classic is only available in two colors, white and silver.</p>
<h3>Artisan</h3>
<p>The Artisan has all of the same features of the Classic, but its power is boosted to 325 watts. The Artisan has a 5-quart tapered bowl with a handle that also locks into the stand. The same accessories are included, but the Artisan’s flat beater has a raised silicone edge, which virtually eliminates scraping the bowl. Like the Classic, the Artisan also has a 10-speed motor and 59 touch points per rotation.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to match your appliances with your kitchen, the Artisan comes in a veritable rainbow of 44 colors.</p>
<h3>Pro 600</h3>
<p>KitchenAid&#8217;s Pro 600 Series shares some core features with the Classic and Artisan models. It differs, however, in that it has a bowl-lift design. The 6-quart bowl latches onto two side arms and the back of the stand. A lever raises the bowl to the attachment; when mixing is complete, the bowl lowers back to the base.</p>
<p>The Pro 600 is also larger, heavier, and its wattage is amped up to 575. With 67 touch points per rotation, the wide whisk and flat beater (one-third larger than the Classic and Artisan) and the elongated dough hook miss nothing in the bowl.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Since we already tested the Artisan in our stand mixer review, we repeated the same tests with the Classic and Pro 600.</p>

<p><b>Egg whites:</b> For each mixer, we put two room-temperature egg whites into the bowl and started the mixer at its lowest setting. When the egg whites began to foam, we increased the speed to the highest level and timed how long it took for the egg whites to reach a meringue consistency.</p>

<p><b>Cream: </b>The Artisan easily whipped one cup of chilled heavy cream to fluffy peaks. We repeated the test with the Classic and Pro 600 by whipping the cream at its lowest setting and gradually increasing to the highest and timed how long it took for the mixer to whip the cream.</p>
<h3>Cake batter</h3>
<p>We used “The Great British Baking Show” judge <a href="https://www.bbc.com/food/recipes/mary_berrys_perfect_34317" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Berry’s recipe for genoise</a>, or sponge cake, which serves as the base for an assortment of iced and jelly-filled cakes. We made this recipe many times during our initial testing, and it’s especially good for showing how well (or poorly) the stand mixer whips the ingredients together to create a light and airy cake with a soft crumb.</p>
<h3>Cookie dough</h3>
<p>As we discovered from our prior tests, cookie dough can cause havoc with almost all stand mixers. Depending on the shape of the bowl and length of attachments, oftentimes mixins just aren’t mixed in enough. This failing was more than apparent with the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stand-mixer/">Cheftronic &#8211; SM986 and Cuisinart SM-50 </a>, both of which left mixins in the bottom of their deeply tapered bowls and short attachments.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/super-chunky-cookies-3362198" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recipe </a> we used is a dense dough jammed full with chocolate chips, peanuts and M&amp;Ms. This test really showcases the motor’s ability to create the torque needed to thoroughly blend these heavy ingredients into a cohesive dough.</p>
<h3>Pizza dough</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/kneading-dough.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>This is the most challenging test of all. It’s a <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/pizza-dough-recipe-1914764" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standard recipe for pizza dough</a> that we’ve made dozens of times. Earlier models of stand mixers had an extenuated dough hook that was curled like a pig’s tail. The latest models have dough hooks that are about one-third shorter and have a more traditional hook shape.</p>
<p>In our previous tests, only the Artisan blended and kneaded the dough effortlessly. The other mixers struggled to make a cohesive dough with the new dough hook, and the strain on their  motors caused the mixers to shake and rattle like the Northridge Earthquake.</p>

<p>The 5-quart, tilt-head <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006WNOZ/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KSM150PS Artisan</a> stand mixer won <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stand-mixer/#best">best overall in our review of stand mixers,</a> and it’s our top pick again. The Artisan is the most popular of KitchenAid’s stand mixers, and it’s easy to understand why. The Artisan is about 20 percent smaller than the Pro 600, and the tilt-head design makes the mixer more compact so it can fit underneath most kitchen cabinets.</p>
<p>At 375 watts, the Artisan has plenty of power to tackle bread, pizza and chunky cookie dough. The usual attachments are included: A wire whisk, flat paddle and dough hook. The flat paddle and dough hook are nylon-coated for easy cleaning.</p>
<p>We found the Artisan’s pouring shield especially useful when we added flour to the pizza dough. It fits over the mixing bowl and allows you to add dry or wet ingredients while the mixer is mixing. The pouring shield eliminated spills and concentrated the flour into a spout, which the dough hook efficiently turned into the vortex of the mixture.</p>

It’s fast, versatile and very user-friendly.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006WNOZ/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Artisan has a slightly tapered stainless steel bowl, and its attachments have been designed specifically to reduce the need for scraping ingredients down the sides of the bowl.</p>
<p>The Artisan performed perfectly in all of our tests. It whipped the egg whites and cream to firm peaks in one minute and smoothly blended the cake batter, which baked light, airy and delicate. The Artisan had no problems mixing together the cookie dough, although there were a few M&amp;M bits in the bottom of the bowl. The hook attachment is less curlicue than the Pro 600’s, but the Artisan nevertheless mixed and kneaded an elastic ball of pizza dough in five minutes.</p>
<p>The Artisan is so easy to use you’ll find yourself baking like a professional in no time. Like all three KitchenAid stand mixers, the Artisan is expensive. But if you’re new to baking or you’re someone who wants to bake more than cupcakes and Christmas cookies, the Artisan is an investment you should make.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The KitchenAid Artisan is a tilt-head-style stand mixer and compact enough to fit under most kitchen cabinets.</li>
<li>The Artisan has plenty of power to handle dense bread and cookie dough.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s available in 44 colors, which you can match with other appliances and your kitchen&#8217;s design.</li>
<li>The Artisan is fast, easy to use and will inspire you to bake more.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re an ardent baker and an all-day baking binge is a regular past time, then the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002Y5X9W/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; Pro 600 </a> is your best choice. It’s only about $50 more than the Artisan, but we feel the substantially increased power, rock-solid construction and excellent ease of use is worth that small difference in price.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, the Pro 600 is a big piece of machinery. It’s made entirely of metal, so it’s quite heavy — 29 pounds — and once you’ve unpacked the Pro 600, it’s not going anywhere. Look elsewhere if your kitchen counter space is limited.</p>
<p>Like all KitchenAid stand mixers, the Pro 600’s 575-watt motor has direct drive transmission, which means that its system of (all-steel) gears directly transfers power to whatever you’re mixing in the bowl. There’s less power consumption, and it mixes everything faster.</p>
<p>The proof, of course, is in the pudding &#8212; or the cake batter. The Pro 600 beat the other two KitchenAid stand mixers by 15 to 20 seconds in every challenge, due, in part, to its wire whisk and flat paddle being one-third larger. When the bowl is lifted into place, the attachments touch the bottom of the bowl and the sides. With its 67 touch points, every last ounce of ingredient is whisked or beaten.</p>

<p>The results? Egg whites were beaten to meringue consistency in 55 seconds, the cream was fluffed to peaks in a minute. The cake baked light and airy with a delicate and moist crumb, and the cookies had a cake-like texture, which made us want to eat the entire batch in one sitting. (We restrained from doing so, barely.)</p>

<p>The Pro 600’s dough hook recalls what Captain Hook wore at his wrist. Its elongated, curlicue shape reaches the bottom of the bowl, so when we started the mixer at its lowest setting, the hook gently mixed the ingredients with no splatter. We increased the speed to 2 (there are 10 levels) and watched in amazement how the hook gathered everything together into a dough ball. Not once did we need to scrape the sides of the bowl.</p>
<p>We increased the speed to 3 and allowed the mixer to do its work, kneading the pizza dough until it was smooth and elastic. It really doesn’t get easier. As we did in our prior tests — and you shouldn’t do this at home — we increased the speed to its highest level while the mixer was kneading the dough. The bowl vibrated, but the heavy-metal stand held its ground and stayed in place.</p>
<p>KitchenAid intuited that most people will not store the Pro 600 in a cabinet, and so they’ve designed them in 22 different shades to fit any kitchen’s color scheme. If you prefer a vintage look, a tempered-glass mixing bowl is available.</p>
<p>The Pro 600 is the most expensive of the three KitchenAid stand mixers. The Pro 600 won’t fit everyone’s budget, and if you don’t have spacious countertops, you should consider the Artisan instead.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The KitchenAid &#8211; Pro 600 is a sturdily constructed, high-power kitchen workhorse and makes short work of any baking mixing task.</li>
<li>Its 6-quart bowl allows you to make several loaves of bread or up to 13 dozen cookies in a single batch.</li>
<li>The Pro 600&#8217;s bowl and attachments are designed to virtually eliminate any hand-mixing or scraping of the bowl.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s the most expensive of the KitchenAid mixers we tested, but if you bake everyday, it&#8217;s a worthwhile investment. The Pro 600 is built to last for years.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004SGFW/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; K45SS Classic</a> is the least expensive stand mixer in the KitchenAid line.

Since it’s about $25 less than the Classic and on a par with the Artisan, if you’re looking for a budget-priced stand mixer, consider the Hamilton Beach.</p>
<p>The Classic has 275 watts and at 4.5-quarts, its bowl is slightly smaller than the Artisan. It has the same attachments, but it lacks a splatter shield. (We checked KitchenAid’s website, and a separately purchased splatter shield for the Classic is not available.) In many respects, the Classic is identical to the Artisan; however, we did notice some minor differences in its performance.</p>
<p>The Classic whipped the egg whites and cream about 15 seconds slower, which is hardly a deal breaker. However, at its highest speed, the motor fluctuated and seemed to slow down for a second. We tested this several times, and the slight fluctuation was consistent. Since we only tested one model of the Classic, this issue might pertain only to the model we tested.</p>
<p>The Classic’s flat beater doesn’t have the silicone edge that the Artisan has, so it couldn’t reach all of the ingredients. This was the only KitchenAid mixer that made us scrape the bowl. We mixed ingredients thoroughly, but the cake rose unevenly with divets on the surface. Minor discrepancies can always happen in baking, but the cake’s texture was noticeably less airy and light.</p>
<p>The cookies mixed together quickly (42 seconds), but we couldn’t increase the speed past level 3 without the ingredients splattering. When we removed the dough, about one-quarter cup of M&amp;Ms were left behind in the bottom of the bowl. The pizza hook was just as effective as it was in the other models, and the Classic produced an elastic dough in a few minutes.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>You really can’t go wrong buying a KitchenAid stand mixer. They’re solid, built to last and can perform heavy-duty mixing, blending, whipping and kneading in a few effortless minutes. For someone who enjoys baking on a weekly or even daily basis, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002Y5X9W/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KP26M1X Pro 600</a> is your best bet for handling high-volume baking.</p>
<p>If you’re a first-time baker or a seasoned professional, the smaller, less-expensive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006WNOZ/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KSM150PS Artisan</a> has plenty of power for both daily and occasional baking. The Artisan matches the Pro 600’s performance, but its tilt-head design makes it more compact so it can fit many kitchen-counter spaces.</p>

<h2 id="selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>If you Google “stand mixer,” you’ll find many websites and videos promoting the best one you should buy. However, when you take a closer look, you’ll see that an overwhelming majority don’t actually take the time to test the product, or if they do, test methods are vague.</p>
<p>We found two exceptions in our initial phase of research: The Wirecutter and America’s Test Kitchen’s video review. America’s Test Kitchen’s test methods are solid, but the review is five years old so the recommendations may no longer be valid. We then turned to Amazon, where KitchenAid stand mixers reign supreme, and read through many of the thousands of reviews (KitchenAid alone has over 9,000).</p>
<p>KitchenAid has many versions of stand mixers that are rated extremely high overall by consumers. Depending on the model (and color), they range between $200–$500. But who are KitchenAid’s competitors? There aren’t many.</p>
<p>We chose to focus on finding stand mixers with an affordable price, the convenient tilt-head design, a mixing bowl with a substantial 4.5 to 5-quart capacity and high customer esteem.  Once we had our list, we cross-referenced the stand mixers with the manufacturers’ websites to ensure we tested the most recent model.</p>

<h2 id="who">Who needs a stand mixer?</h2>
<p>If cupcakes, sugar cookies and cake mixes are the extent of your baking repertoire, then you probably just need a hand mixer and a sturdy mixing bowl. But if you’re a more frequent baker of yeast breads, sponge cakes, chunky cookies, fluffy meringues and pizzas, then a heavy-duty stand mixer has the power and size to substantially decrease your time and effort.</p>
<p>While a hand mixer is a light and portable appliance, most stand mixers require kitchen counter space. Some have evolved to become slightly more compact, but they’re still pretty tall (12 to 14 inches) and hefty (up to 26 pounds), which makes storing them in a kitchen cabinet difficult if not impossible.</p>
<p>Another consideration is price. You can buy a very good hand mixer for about $30, but a well-built stand mixer is much more expensive. There are certainly cheaper models to choose from (and we tested one — the Cheftronic &#8211; SM986), but many Amazon reviewers claim that the motors and attachments of the cheaper mixers don’t hold up. If you can afford $300 and are committed to baking on a frequent basis, then a quality stand mixer is well worth it.</p>
<h2 id="important">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Professional vs. commercial: </b>Almost all stand mixers intended for home kitchens are marketed as &#8220;professional&#8221; grade. A commercial stand mixer is too large for a home kitchen and is used exclusively in restaurants and bakeries. It can also cost three or four times more than a professional mixer.</p>
<p><b>Planetary motion: </b>There are two types of stand mixers: planetary motion and spiral. Planetary motion refers to how the mixer’s attachment revolves — like a planet’s orbit — inside the fixed mixing bowl. Planetary motion mixers are designed for both home and commercial use. A spiral mixer, used exclusively in commercial kitchens for preparing large batches of dough, revolves the mixing bowl and hook attachment together.</p>
<p><b>Tilt-head vs. bowl-lift:</b> Many newer models of stand mixers have a tilt head — a button or lever loosens the mixer’s head so it can be lifted backward to accommodate easy removal of attachments and the mixing bowl. Older models have a “bowl lift” head in which a lever raises and lowers the mixing bowl. While bowl-lift stand mixers are heavier and sturdier, tilt-head mixers are lighter and more compact. It’s easier to add ingredients into a bowl-lift mixer, but it’s easier to clean and store a tilt-head mixer.</p>
<p><b>Mixing bowl shape and depth:</b> During our testing, we found the shape and depth of the mixing bowl to be crucial to the mixer’s efficacy. All of the mixing bowls we tested had a 4.5- to 5-quart capacity. Half of them had rounded bottoms, and with these, the mixer struggled to reach ingredients (such as egg whites and whipping cream). The better mixing bowls had a slight taper, which kept the wet ingredients contained in a compact pool that the attachments could reach and lift up.</p>
<p><b>Attachment length: </b>All stand mixers come with three attachments: a wire whisk, a mixing paddle and a dough hook. The length of attachments is of primary importance, since they need to reach the sides and bottom of the mixing bowl. Half the mixers — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005UP2K/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BEM800XL-Scraper-5-Quart-Die-Cast/dp/B003QI9HPW/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000308BUI/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach</a> — had attachments that easily incorporated ingredients with minimal or no scraping needed. The other mixers had attachments that were too short and not broad enough to incorporate ingredients without our stopping, scraping and re-starting.</p>
<p><b>Splatter shield: </b>We prefer a c-shaped splatter shield over an enclosed-ring splatter shield. A c-shape splatter shield, which slides into place on top of the mixing bowl, can be easily attached and removed without lifting the tilt head. An enclosed-ring splatter shield, however, must be attached to the mixer head before affixing or releasing the attachment and then lowered together onto the bowl.</p>
<p><b>Power: </b>A stand mixer should have at least 325 watts of power. However, a mixer with more wattage does not necessarily mean that it’s more efficient. The mixer’s motor must be precisely engineered to harness wattage to create adequate torque (the force needed to rotate an object), which is essential for kneading dough.</p>
<p>For example, the KitchenAid mixer has only 325 watts, but its excellent torque can knead pizza dough into a compact ball. The Cheftronic mixer has double the wattage, but it shook violently and struggled to incorporate the ingredients and knead the dough during our testing.</p>
<p><b>Speed levels: </b>The mixers we tested had six to twelve speed levels. There was minute differentiation between the mixers that had 12 speeds. In actuality, you probably just need five speed levels: a true low for incorporating flour or wet ingredients without splatter; a medium-low, medium and medium-high for combining ingredients; and a true high for aerating egg whites and whipping cream.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>

<p>We devised tests that worked the most commonly used functions of a stand mixer: creaming butter and sugar, blending cake batter, whipping egg whites and cream, blending cookie dough with mix-ins and mixing pizza dough.<br />
[table id=212 /]
<h3>Small-batch whipping</h3>
<p><b>Egg whites: </b>We began with small-batch whipping to test whether the mixer’s attachments could reach the bottom of the mixing bowl. For each mixer, we put two room-temperature egg whites into the bowl and started the mixer at its slowest speed. Once the egg whites began to foam, we gradually increased the speed to the highest setting and timed how long it took for the whites to stiffen to a meringue consistency — in other words, a consistency that would not plop out when we held the mixing bowl upside down.</p>
<p>The KitchenAid, Breville and Hamilton Beach whipped the egg whites to a meringue consistency in one minute.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart and Cheftronic just foamed the two egg whites because their whisks could not reach the bottom of the mixing bowls. However, once a third egg white was added, the whisks could at least reach enough of the egg white to pull it upwards and whisk it to froth.</p>
<p><b>Cream: </b>We poured one cup of chilled heavy cream into the bowl and began at the slowest speed, waiting until the cream frothed and then gradually increased to the highest speed. Results were similar to those of the egg white test. The KitchenAid, Breville and Hamilton Beach whipped thick whipped cream in one minute.</p>
<p>Because of their short whisks, Cuisinart and Cheftronic failed to whip one cup of cream. We added a second cup and both achieved fully whipped cream in about two minutes.</p>
<h3>Cake batter</h3>
<p>We used “The Great British Baking Show” judge <a href="https://www.bbc.com/food/recipes/mary_berrys_perfect_34317" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Berry’s recipe for genoise</a>, or sponge cake, which serves as the base for many types of iced cakes.</p>
<p>The recipe differs from other sponge cakes in that the eggs are not cooked over a double-boiler before adding them to the other ingredients. Instead, everything is blended together all at once, and to achieve a light and airy cake, the stand mixer must be able to evenly mix the ingredients while also whipping the eggs and creaming the butter into a smooth batter. If the mixer fails to do so, or if excess scraping of the bowl is required, then the cake won’t rise when baked.</p>
<p>The Breville and the Cheftronic have a silicon scraper on their paddle attachments. This nice addition worked well in scraping the sides of the bowl during blending so we didn’t need to stop, scrape and restart.</p>
<h3>Cookie dough</h3>
<p>We wanted a thick cookie dough with lots of mix-ins to test each mixer’s power and torque. <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/super-chunky-cookies-3362198" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This delicious recipe for super chunky cookies</a> allows you to add whatever you like to the dough. Our mix-ins included peanuts, chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, raisins and M&amp;Ms, which proved to be a challenge for the Cuisinart and Cheftronic. Their squat paddles simply couldn’t reach down to the bottom of their too-deep mixing bowls, so the ingredients had to be mixed by hand.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, we also had a bit of trouble with the KitchenAid and Breville. Although their motors breezed easily through the thick dough — even at the highest speed — there were small amounts of mix-ins left untouched at the bottom of the bowl. Only the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000308BUI/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach</a> was able to thoroughly blend the cookie dough and mix-ins together.</p>
<h3>Pizza dough</h3>
<p>The most challenging test for the stand mixers was the pizza dough. The mixer’s hook attachment must first blend the ingredients together and then knead them into a compact yet elastic ball. We used <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/pizza-dough-recipe-1914764" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a standard recipe for the pizza dough</a>, but we cut the proportions in half, which better suited the 4.5- to 5-quart capacity bowls. Even with the half batch, the usual culprits — Cuisinart and Cheftronic — failed to combine the ingredients and shook violently when the mixer kneaded the dough.</p>
<p>As an additional test — and something you really shouldn’t do at home — we increased the speed to the highest level during the kneading to see whether the motor gave out. The KitchenAid and Breville vibrated slightly, but they clearly were able to handle the dough at high speed. The Hamilton Beach shook rather ominously, but it kept right on kneading and seemed to hold out.</p>

<p>It’s slightly smaller and a bit more compact than KitchenAid’s other stand mixers, but it still isn’t ideal for storing in a cabinet because it weighs in at 25 pounds. That heft, however, keeps the all-metal mixer secure on the countertop even at the highest speed. Its 325-watt motor has enough power to plow through cookie and pizza dough without showing signs of strain, and it performs every task in minutes. As stand mixers go, it’s also quiet.</p>
<p>The KitchenAid is very easy to use. Its tilt head is locked and released with a lever on one side, and it tilts far back enough for easy insertion of attachments. The five-quart stainless steel mixing bowl locks firmly into place by turning it slightly clockwise. Lower the tilt head and you’re ready to go.</p>

It’s less expensive than previous KitchenAid models, and with the separately bought attachments, it can also roll out pasta, grind meat and spiralize vegetables.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005UP2K/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The KitchenAid has 10 speed levels, marked as Stir, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. They’re controlled with a side lever that clicks into place. For the odd-numbered speeds, you need to hold the control lever and gently guide it to the speed you want. There isn’t much differentiation between the odd- and even-numbered speeds. The even-numbered speeds are so well differentiated, however, you don’t really need the other five.</p>
<p>The mixing bowl is slightly tapered, so when you lower the attachments (nylon-coated paddle and dough hook, stainless steel wire whisk) you’ll notice immediately that each touches the bottom and sides of the bowl. For each of our recipes, we needed to do very little — and sometimes no — scraping to incorporate the ingredients.</p>
<p>The KitchenAid was the top performer in all of our tests. It smoothly creamed the butter and aerated the eggs to create an evenly blended cake batter, which baked light and airy. It had no problems blending the large amount of mix-ins into the thick cookie dough and it kneaded a perfect ball of pizza dough in five minutes. Since the mixer’s attachments touch the bottom of the mixing bowl, the wire whisk whipped the egg whites and cream to fluffy heights in one minute.</p>
<p>The KitchenAid stand mixer can really do anything, except perhaps wash your clothes. Its extraordinary design includes a hub on the mixer head into which a variety of (separately purchased) attachments can be plugged, such as a pasta maker, meat grinder, cheese shredder and even a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-spiralizer/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spiralizer</span></a>.</p>
<p>So although all KitchenAid stand mixers are on the pricey side, you’re getting much more for your money, since your mixer can be swiftly transformed into another kitchen appliance. (For the record, we’ve tested the pasta maker and the meat grinder, and they are excellent.)</p>
<p>Although KitchenAid’s warranty is only for one year, the Artisan stand mixer is so well-constructed that, if properly cared for, it will last for many years. We believe there isn’t a stand mixer on the market that can beat the KitchenAid &#8211; Artisan Series in quality or performance.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The KitchenAid &#8211; KSM150PSWH is sturdily constructed and has plenty of power to plow through thick cookie dough and pizza dough in minutes.</li>
<li>Its mixing bowl and attachments have been designed to work together for optimal mixing and blending with minimal scraping.</li>
<li>The KitchenAid &#8211; Artisan Series is very user-friendly, and it will have you baking like a pro straight out of the box.</li>

<p>Hamilton Beach really scores with this beautifully made stand mixer from its line of Eclectrics kitchen appliances. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000308BUI/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 63232</a> has many similar features that our top pick has, including its all-metal construction and (at this writing) it’s $120 cheaper. We’ve reviewed many Hamilton Beach products, and most have, sadly, been disappointing. However, their Eclectrics series stand mixer is top notch and nearly equally as good as the KitchenAid &#8211; Artisan.</p>
<p>Like the Artisan, the Hamilton Beach has the tapered mixing bowl that we find is most effective for blending small-batch ingredients. Indeed, it whipped two egg whites in a minute and a half to meringue consistency and one cup of cream into fluffy perfection in one minute.</p>
<p>Again, the Hamilton Beach’s efficacy is due to the length and width of the attachments (nylon-coated paddle and dough hook and stainless wire whisk), which reach the bottom and sides of the mixing bowl.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach has 400 watts, slightly more than the KitchenAid &#8211; Artisan, and its torque is just as good. It incorporated all the ingredients for the cookie dough and pizza dough well enough, but not without some vibration, especially at higher speeds.</p>

It has a couple of design quirks, like an inconvenient tilt-head release, but overall it’s well-made and durable and will last for years with frequent use.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000308BUI/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Hamilton Beach blended the cake batter in two minutes, and when baked, it was moist and firm with a good crumb. It was absolutely the best of all the cakes we made with the mixers. Despite the vibration at the middle speed, the mix-ins were fully incorporated into the cookie dough, and when baked, the cookies came out of the oven exactly the same as those we made with the KitchenAid.</p>
<p>The Eclectrics had a bit of trouble with the pizza dough. The machine shook when it was kneading and the dough took various forms during the kneading process, running up and down the hook as a cylinder, then an oval before forming a compact ball. However, when the kneading was completed, the dough was beautifully shiny, smooth and elastic; again, the best of the pizza doughs we made.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach has a few negatives that are not deal-breakers. First, the button for releasing the tilt head is located inconveniently beneath the base of the head and we had trouble finding it when the head was tilted back. Second, like the KitchenAid, speed levels are even-numbered — 2 through 12 — and there is almost no differentiation between them and the odd-numbered levels (not marked on the blender). Finally, its splatter guard is an enclosed-ring type that we find inconvenient to attach and remove.</p>
<p>Hamilton Beach has really stepped up to the plate to compete with KitchenAid. At $120 less, the Eclectrics stand mixer is an impressive and, we believe, long-lasting alternative for budget-conscious consumers.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Hamilton Beach &#8211; 63232 stand mixer has a similar mixing bowl and attachments to the KitchenAid &#8211; Artisan, but it’s $120 less expensive and an excellent alternative.</li>
<li>It performed just as well as our top pick and even bested the KitchenAid in our cake and pizza dough tests.</li>
<li>Despite a few minor flaws, the Hamilton Beach stand mixer is solidly constructed, well-designed and will last for years with frequent use.</li>

<p>Like most Breville products, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BEM800XL-Scraper-5-Quart-Die-Cast/dp/B003QI9HPW/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BEM800XL</a> stand mixer is beautifully designed. It’s a sleek machine with curved lines and a futuristic speed-control LED panel that lights up as levels are increased.</p>
<p>The Breville has lift-assist handles to raise and lower the tilt head, and its slightly tapered bowl easily locks into place. It has twelve speeds, labeled with a particular baking task, like fold/knead, light mix and aerate/whip. We tested all speeds, and it was one of the few mixers we tested that had a gradual increase between each speed level.</p>
<p>For such an attractive machine, we were surprised that it didn’t perform better. We found its pour shield most vexing. It’s c-shaped, but quite narrow and tricky to balance on top of the bowl. The pour spout clicks into the shield, which can only be done when the tilt head is lowered. Each time we tried to scrape the bowl and lifted the tilt head back, the shield popped off and the pour spout plopped into the batter or dough.</p>
<p>The Breville’s silicon-edged scraper paddle manages to scrape the sides of the bowl, but it’s too short and can’t reach the bottom of the bowl. The same flaw afflicts the wire whisk, which left a small pool of cream not whipped. The Breville failed the two-egg test — it just foamed the whites — but when we added a third egg white, it aerated them to a sturdy meringue texture in one minute.</p>
<p>The lower speeds don’t seem to be as effective as the higher speeds. The Breville struggled to incorporate the mix-ins into the cookie dough. Although it blended the pizza dough well enough, it couldn’t quite knead it until we increased the speed to medium-high. In fact, even at the highest speed, the Breville only slightly vibrated and gave no indication that the motor would fail.</p>
<p>It’s a very good stand mixer, but it’s slightly more expensive than the KitchenAid, which we believe to be superior to the Breville.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8EJ81Q/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cheftronic &#8211; SM986</a> is one of several relatively inexpensive stand mixers, ranging in price from $90 to $150. While it may seem like a bargain compared to the KitchenAid, you definitely get what you pay for in this case. It’s cheaply constructed; its entire casing is plastic. The attachments are short and stout and can’t reach the sides or bottom of the rounded stainless steel mixing bowl.</p>
<p>The tilt head is released by pushing down a lever, which could use a shot of WD40 in our opinion: it was so creaky, and if you don’t keep your hand on top of the head, it snaps back. Its annoying enclosed-ring splatter shield can only be removed by taking off the attachment first. Since we had to frequently scrape the mixing bowl, we needed to do this several times.</p>
<p>At 650 watts, the Cheftronic has double the wattage of the Cuisinart, but it’s a perfect example of a poorly made and exceedingly noisy motor that can’t efficiently harness the high wattage. There is almost no differentiation between its first three lower speeds, then it suddenly zooms into high speed at levels four through six.</p>
<p>The Cheftronic struggled mightily to combine the pizza ingredients, and during kneading, the entire mixer rocked back and forth rhythmically as the dough ball formed. It couldn’t handle the small-batch tests, and after we increased the egg whites and cream, it whipped both in four minutes and two minutes, respectively — much longer than the other stand mixers we tested.</p>
<p>The Cheftronic’s silver plastic model is priced at $150, but for $30 more, you could buy the far better Hamilton Beach &#8211; Eclectrics stand mixer instead.</p>

<p>We’re usually impressed with Cuisinart’s product line, but we weren’t with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-SM-50BC-Stand-Brushed-Chrome/dp/B01K2FQ4DE/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; SM50BC</a> stand mixer. It copies a few of the KitchenAid’s features, like a durable metal casing, easy-release tilt head, secure locking bowl and c-shaped splatter guard with generous pour spout.</p>
<p>But that’s where the similarities end. The Cuisinart has twelve speeds, controlled by a flimsy plastic dial, the first six of which have almost no differentiation. The medium and higher speeds are better defined. We had almost the exact same issues with the Cuisinart as we had with Cheftronic because of poor design: a rounded mixing bowl that’s much too deep and stubby, narrow attachments.</p>
<p>The mixing paddle failed to blend the butter into the cake batter, leaving stray bits behind. Plus, it couldn’t reach the mix-ins for the cookie dough, which remained untouched in the bottom of the bowl. The dough hook simply swirled the dough ingredients and the whisk just foamed and splattered the egg whites and cream — until we increased the amount of each.</p>
<p>This stand mixer simply doesn’t live up to Cuisinart’s reputation. The motor is powerful enough, but it can’t compensate for the mixing bowl and attachments that are virtually useless.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you love to bake or bake large amounts on a frequent basis, then there’s no better kitchen appliance than a stand mixer. A great stand mixer needs to be multi-functional and have a durable, well-designed motor with sufficient power to last many years.</p>
<p>KitchenAid has long been a leader in manufacturing outstanding stand mixers, and its  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005UP2K/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KSM150PSWH</a> — one of the Artisan Series stand mixers — is no exception. It handily out-performed all of the stand mixers we tested. The KitchenAid plowed through thick cookie dough and kneaded sticky pizza dough with ease; smoothly mixed the batter for an airy sponge cake; and whipped egg whites and cream to frothy peaks in a minute.</p>
<p>This KitchenAid stand mixer is so easy to use and with all the amazing attachments you can purchase, it’s like having a Transformer in your kitchen.</p>
<p>A less expensive option is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000308BUI/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; Eclectrics</a> stand mixer. It’s also well-made, and though it takes slightly longer to perform the same tasks as the KitchenAid Artisan, the Hamilton Beach stood up to our tests and even bested the Artisan in a couple of them. At $120 less than the KitchenAid, the Hamilton Beach &#8211; Eclectrics is a very good and affordable alternative.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter 40 hours of baking cakes, kneading bread and mashing 20 pounds of potatoes, we determined that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BHM800SIL-Handy-Scraper-Silver/dp/B00XBOXUWC/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BHM800SIL</a> is the best hand mixer. Its smart ergonomic design and intuitive nine-speed controls surpassed the other six hand mixers we tested.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected hand mixers to test</h2>
<p>We began our research by reading hundreds of reviews of hand mixers posted on Amazon, focusing on those that had the highest ratings. From there we went to the manufacturers’ websites for the hand mixers we were interested in testing to compare features and accessories.</p>
<p>The majority of hand mixers run about $20 or less, and they’re very similar in appearance, wattage and accessories. But we also wanted to test higher-end models to determine if their additional features were worth the increased price.</p>
<p>Included in our research was reading reliable and authentic reviews of hand mixers posted by other review sites to learn what criteria each used to test and rate hand mixers.</p>
<p>We also read through several Reddit threads to learn how people use hand mixers and what’s important for them when they’re considering buying a new one. We compared user recommendations with those other online product reviews, then culled through the hand mixers that are the newest models, or currently available, to settle on the seven hand mixers we would test.</p>
<h2 id="the-seven-best">Compare the best hand mixers</h2>
[table id=167 /]
<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs a hand mixer?</h2>
<p>A hand mixer is primarily used for small baking tasks, such as mixing cake batter, creaming butter and sugar or whipping egg whites and heavy cream. Many online comments cite the hand mixer as the perfect appliance for whipping mashed potatoes into an ultra-smooth and fluffy consistency.</p>
<p>Larger baking or cooking tasks are better accomplished with a stand mixer, which allows you to perform several functions completely hands-free. A stand mixer, however, is very heavy and difficult to store anywhere except a countertop, and it lacks portability. Conversely, a hand mixer offers flexibility and can be used in almost any size mixing bowl.</p>
<h3>Hand mixer versus immersion blender</h3>
<p>An <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-immersion-blender/" rel="noopener">immersion blender</a> or stick blender is ideal for pureeing hot or cold soups, fresh-fruit drinks or smoothies and mayonnaise or other sauces. High-end models, such as the Breville &#8211; BSB510XL Control Grip and the KitchenAid &#8211; KHB2351, include a whisk attachment. We tested their whisk attachments to determine whether an immersion blender could perform the same whipping tasks as a hand mixer.</p>
<p>In both cases, it took substantially longer to whip cream, since any speed higher than low splattered the cream everywhere. We had more success with egg whites, which didn’t splatter at high speed.</p>
<p>We had two problems with the mashed potatoes: first, it took quite a bit of effort to push down on the potatoes, and second, the immersion blender’s blade pureed the potatoes into a thick and gummy consistency. Good for vichyssoise, perhaps, but terrible for mashed potatoes.</p>
<p>Consequently, we decided that a hand mixer is really a better appliance for these tasks.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Attachments</h3>
<p><b>Beaters: </b>All hand mixers come with two beaters used for most baking tasks. The beaters for newer and up-scale models are thin wires, not dissimilar from a wire whisk, and range from five-to-six inches in length with a diameter of about two inches. Wire beaters are open, as opposed to the thick beaters, which have four metal tines attached to a center post. Wire beaters are much easier to clean, and by driving ingredients downward rather than outward, they also reduce splatter.</p>
<p><b>Whisk: </b>Almost all hand mixers include a single wire whisk (the Vremi did not), which is used only for whipping cream and egg whites. The wire whisk should have a diameter of at least three inches to efficiently aerate the ingredient you’re whipping. We found the majority of the whisk attachments to be flimsy and not wide enough to effectively aerate.</p>
<p><b>The only hand mixer we tested to include two wire whisks is the</b> <b>Breville &#8211; BHM800SIL</b><b>,</b> which easily outperformed all single-whisk hand mixers. The Breville’s attachments are made of stainless steel rather than chrome or chrome-plated like other mixers.</p>

<p><b>Dough hooks</b>: Elongated, curly-cue-shaped dough hooks are used exclusively for blending and kneading yeast-based doughs. During our testing, the dough hooks were able to blend ingredients, but we found it a real challenge to knead the dough, which kept twirling around one hook or riding up the side of the bowl. Overall, we decided dough hooks are pretty useless for kneading, and you get better results by kneading dough by hand.</p>
<h3>Power</h3>
<p>The hand mixers we tested ranged between 150 watts (Vremi) and 290 watts (KitchenAid). The Vremi stalled a bit with the bread dough, but it had enough power for other tests. The Breville and Oster are both 240 watts, which is sufficient for any baking task.</p>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<p>We determined that speed levels were more important than the actual wattage, and more speed levels do not necessarily mean better mixing.</p>
<p>For example, the KitchenAid &#8211; KHM926WH has nine speeds, but there is little difference between each level, so it’s like having only three speeds, low, medium and high. Conversely, the Breville and the Cuisinart &#8211; HM-90S also have nine speeds, but there is a very clear differentiation between each one. Adding to this, the Breville suggests levels of speed for a particular task, such as creaming (4-6) and whipping (7-9), which we found helpful in our trial test runs.</p>
<p>You also want a hand mixer with a “true” slow speed, especially for adding flour or sugar to a batter or mix. The less expensive hand mixers we tested did not have a sufficiently slow speed, which resulted in spray and splatter. The higher-end models — the Breville, Cuisinart and KitchenAid — had very slow lower-speed levels and were the best for incorporating dry ingredients.</p>

<p>Overall, we decided that a true low, medium-low, medium, medium-high and high are really the only speeds you need for a hand mixer.</p>
<h3>Ergonomics</h3>
<p>Most of the hand mixers we tested weighed about two pounds (the Vremi was the lightest at only one pound), so they’re designed to be easy to maneuver in a mixing bowl. The Vremi was the easiest to zoom around the bowl, whereas the Oster felt a bit bulky.</p>

<p>Naturally, it’s a personal choice how the mixer fits into your hand, but we discovered that the location of the power/pause and speed level switches are important. When you’re adding ingredients, you want to be able to change speeds or pause the mixer at intervals to ensure thorough mixing. So the switches should be within your thumb’s reach and easy to press.</p>

<p>Hands-down, the Breville is the easiest to control with its unique scroll wheel that allows you to change speeds with a flick of your thumb. The Cuisinart and KitchenAid also have easy-to-reach speed controls, but we found the location of their power buttons to be a bit awkward. The other models have levers for speed control, and these proved to be stiff and inexact.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Our tests comprised the most common baking tasks for a hand blender:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whipping egg whites into a fluffy meringue.</li>
<li>Whipping heavy cream into stiff peaks.</li>
<li>Combining dry ingredients with wet ingredients without splatter.</li>
<li>Creaming butter and sugar evenly.</li>
<li>Blending cake batter to a smooth consistency.</li>
<li>Churning heavy doughs like cookie, bread or pizza.</li>
<li>Kneading bread or pizza dough.</li>
</ul>
<p>We chose <a href="http://www.kitchme.com/recipes/lemon-sponge-cake" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this recipe for a sponge cake</a> for testing whipping, combining and blending and this <a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/basic-homemade-bread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basic recipe for bread</a> for churning and kneading. We performed separate tests for whipping cream and creaming butter with sugar.</p>
<p>Our tests for whipping egg whites and cream also included timing how long it took the hand mixer’s whisk attachment to whip them into stiff peaks.</p>
<h3>Features Comparison</h3>
[table id=168 /]
<p>Many people comment online that they use their hand mixer for whipping mashed potatoes. For each hand mixer we tested, we boiled two pounds of russet potatoes until tender, mashed them and added two tablespoons of butter and half a cup of warmed milk. Using the beater attachment we timed how long it took to blend the potatoes to a smooth and fluffy consistency.</p>
<p>An equally important element in testing the hand mixers was their ergonomic design. We wanted a hand mixer that fits easily and comfortably in the hand and was light enough to maneuver effortlessly in a mixing bowl.</p>
<p>We also tested how easily or difficult it was to change speeds, power on and off, pause and eject attachments with a flick of the thumb. Finally, we hand-washed the attachments to determine how easy they were to clean.</p>

<p>Thoughtful design and superb engineering handily elevated the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BHM800SIL-Handy-Scraper-Silver/dp/B00XBOXUWC/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BHM800SIL</a> nine-speed hand mixer to the top. The Breville is the most expensive of the hand mixers we tested, but if you’re serious about baking, the Breville is a worthwhile investment.</p>
<p>The Breville has a number of unique features that set it apart. Physically it’s been designed to fit ergonomically in your hand. Its handle rests comfortably in your palm, and although it’s a bit heavier than other models, it glides around a mixing bowl almost by itself. You simply guide the mixer where you want it to go. An unusual feature is a trigger ring fitted for your forefinger. It’s actually the eject mechanism, but it also contributes to the mixer’s maneuverability in your hand.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the scroll wheel for adjusting speed levels is remarkably easy for increasing or decreasing speed. Above the wheel is an LED panel with a speed indicator and a timer that begins timing when the mixer is turned on and pauses timing whenever the pause button is pressed.</p>
<p>The Breville’s electrical cord has a plug with a finger-hole for rapid removal from a socket, and most impressively, the base of the cord in the mixer’s chassis swivels, so it can be used by both right- and left-handed people. As if these design elements weren’t enough, the Breville has a light located between the beaters that shines into your mixing bowl each time you power on.</p>

This mixer comes at a higher pricer point, but it delivers outstanding performance and ergonomics, including a swivel cord and trigger ring that improves your maneuverability in the bowl.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XBOXUWC/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Breville’s stainless-steel attachments include two silicone-coated beaters, which didn’t clatter against our mixing bowls and also virtually eliminated scraping down ingredients, two dough hooks and two wire whisks. No other hand mixer has two whisks, and the Breville’s easily doubled the volume of egg whites to fluffy heights in a minute.</p>
<p>An especially remarkable engineering feat is the mixer automatically adjusts the range of speed depending on which attachments you insert. For example, the dough hooks need less speed than the whisks or beaters. So when you insert the dough hooks, the mixer’s low speeds decrease so they’re low enough that flour doesn’t splatter when added.</p>
<p>The Breville’s performance matched its design in excellence. Our only complaint — and it’s the same for all of the blenders we tested — is the dough hooks do a good job of combining the ingredients into a blended dough, but kneading gave us trouble. Even at a low speed, we had to fight the dough from climbing up the sides of the bowl.</p>
<p>The Breville’s hefty price tag might discourage casual bakers or cooks, but we do believe this is an exceptional hand mixer for someone who really enjoys baking. The Breville whips through any baking task with little effort and could inspire you to bake more than the once-a-year birthday cake or Christmas cookies.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-HM-90S-Advantage-9-Speed-Handheld/dp/B0034A8C4O/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; HM-90S</a> is about one-third less expensive than the Breville, and although it doesn’t quite match Breville’s outstanding performance, it’s nonetheless a very good hand mixer for the price.</p>
<p>It has nine speeds, each one noticeably increasing at small increments, which gave us a real sense of control. The three slow speeds are indeed very slow and were great for incorporating flour and sugar without any splatter. We didn’t find much difference between the middle speeds and settled at speed 5 as the most effective, particularly for whipping potatoes.</p>
<p>Cuisinart’s instruction manual helpfully suggests speeds and attachments for certain foods, which we tested out. The suggestions proved to be mostly accurate, although we did find that increasing the suggested speed by one level gave us quicker results.</p>

You can count on thorough coverage in the bowl due to the Cuisinart's longer and wider beaters.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0034A8C4O/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The mixer fits comfortably into the grip of your hand, and although the power button might be slightly too high up to reach for some people’s thumbs, the speed control buttons are at thumb level. The mixer’s speed automatically reset at level 1 each time it’s turned off, and there’s a bit of a surge before it adjusts to the actual speed level. Once we got used to that, it didn’t present a problem; we simply waited for a second or two before lowering the beaters into the bowl.</p>
<p>Maneuverability is excellent, thanks to the mixer’s lightweight and a swivel base for the electric cord, so you can move around the mixing bowl without the cord getting in your way.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart has the usual attachments (including a nifty little bowl scraper), but the beaters are longer and wider than those of other mixers we tested, which gave us great coverage in the mixing bowl when blending the cake batter. As with most of the mixers, a snap-on storage case for the attachments is a welcome addition.</p>
<p><video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" muted="" width="100%" height="auto"><source src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cusinart-hand-mixer.1.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video></p>
<p>The Cuisinart performed well in all of the tests, and as was the case with the Breville, the dough hooks efficiently combined the dough ingredients but had trouble keeping the dough in the bowl during the kneading process, even at the slowest speed.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart is still a bit expensive for a hand mixer, but it’s very well made and is sure to last. It comes with a three-year warranty, which is remarkable for a kitchen appliance (most are one-year), and any replacement parts are readily available and not expensive. If you don’t want to shell out big bucks for the Breville, then we recommend the Cuisinart HM-90S as our second-place winner.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>

<p>The majority of hand mixers we tested run in the $15 to $20 range, and the best of them was definitely the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XCCULW/?tag-ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oster &#8211; 2500</a>. At 240-watts, the Oster is actually a bit more powerful than our runner-up, the Cuisinart HM-90S. It has five speeds, each of which is clearly differentiated, unlike most nine-speed models.</p>

Our testers appreciated its distinctive five speeds, which proved plenty effective to get the job done.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XCCULW/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Oster is a bit larger and heavier than the other hand mixers we tested, and in some ways, reminds of us of the hand mixer our mother (or even grandmother) might use. The beaters are made of chrome and are thicker, like the old-fashioned models, intended for creaming butter and mixing thick cookie or bread doughs. The beaters were a little more difficult to clean, but they gave us good volume with egg whites in one minute and smooth blending of pizza dough.</p>
<p>Of the competition, its slowest speed didn’t splatter dry ingredients, and at the fastest speed, it tore through the potatoes like a little motor boat.</p>
<p>The Oster is a little heavy in the hand, so it may not be ideal for people who have hand or wrist weakness. We also found the chrome lever for adjusting speeds and the eject button to be stiff.</p>
<p>These quibbles don’t stand in the way, however, of our recommending this hand mixer as a good product at a great price.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Oster &#8211; 2500 is more powerful than the other comparably priced mixers we tested.</li>
<li>Its large beaters gave excellent volume to egg whites and whipping cream.</li>
<li>Each of the Oster’s five speeds is precisely differentiated from lowest to highest.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C9OQ47S/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KHM926WH </a>is another 9-speed hand mixer and shares several features with the Breville. It fits nicely in the hand and has also been designed for easy operation and maneuverability.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to like about the KitchenAid. Its large wire whisk is efficient and added good volume to the egg whites and whipping cream. We also found it helpful that the chassis is marked with symbols for how the attachments should be inserted. Oddly, the KitchenAid’s eject button isn’t marked.</p>
<p>However, as we found with the other mixers, its nine speed levels aren’t differentiated much to matter, since each increment between speeds is minimal. Its lowest levels were lower than the other mixers, and its highest levels were too high, splattering anything we attempted to mix.</p>
<p>The KitchenAid &#8211; KHM926WH is comparable in price to the Cuisinart, which in our testing, we found to be superior.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N3L2AN8/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 62650A </a>has many of the same features as the other hand mixers we tested: beaters and whisk attachments, snap-on storage case and good wattage (250 watts). It’s got six speeds with not much difference between speeds three and four, but the lowest speed and the highest speed are much too high for incorporating dry ingredients or mixing anything without splatter.</p>
<p>Its lever for changing speeds is awkwardly placed, so you really need to stretch your thumb high up on the mixer to reach the upper speed levels. It doesn’t have a separate eject button, but instead eject is done by pushing on the speed lever, which can stick. The Hamilton Beach &#8211; 62650A is certainly reasonably priced, and we did like its unique bowl rest feature on the base of the mixer, but for a bargain-priced option, we’d recommend the Oster &#8211; 2500 instead.</p>

<p>We really wanted to love the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vremi-Electric-Mixer-Built-Storage/dp/B01I1RQ2GY/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vremi &#8211; VRM010008N</a>. First of all, it’s adorable. The Vremi is a tiny candy-apple red hand mixer with 150 watts. It’s compact, could fit in a drawer and designed so its beaters (the Vremi’s only accessories) fit right into the chassis of the mixer. The Vremi is very lightweight and can whizz around a mixing bowl with no effort.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, its low wattage does this little mixer in. The Vremi has the flaws of some of the other mixers we tested. Its speed button is difficult to move while you’re mixing something, and the low speed splatters dry ingredients everywhere. Even at its highest speed, the Vremi struggled to plump up the egg whites and whipping cream.</p>
<p>The Vremi is an inexpensive option for a tiny kitchen.  But its low wattage increases the time and effort in doing basic baking tasks.</p>

Although it has six speed settings, in actuality, it’s a three-speed mixer — the two lows, mediums and highs are virtually the same.</p>
<p>The Black+Decker did a nice job in whipping the egg whites, and it creamed the potatoes to a smooth consistency. We found there was a lot of splatter, however, even at its lowest speed. Oddly, the mixer doesn’t stand up easily on its end, so we had to balance it against the mixing bowl. The Black+Decker was, by far, the loudest of the mixers we tested.</p>
<p>It has a plastic storage case for the entire mixer, which no other mixer we tested had, and it’s reasonably priced. But since the Black+Decker’s lowest speed isn’t low enough to prevent splatter of dry ingredients, we believe you should buy our budget pick, the Oster &#8211; 2500, instead.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Whether you’re a frequent or occasional baker, you’ll want a hand mixer that is reliable, durable and performs all the necessary tasks for baking fluffy cakes and breads and whipping lighter-than-air cream with minimal effort.</p>
<p>We gave our test subjects a rigorous work-out and feel confident that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BHM800SIL-Handy-Scraper-Silver/dp/B00XBOXUWC/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BHM800SIL</a> is unquestionably the best hand mixer you could buy. Its smart design features — like a scrolling-wheel speed changer, mixer light, silicone-coated beaters, extra wire whisk — are worth the Breville’s higher price.</p>
<p>If you want a high-quality mixer that’s not as expensive, we recommend our runner-up, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-HM-90S-Advantage-9-Speed-Handheld/dp/B0034A8C4O/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; HM-90S</a>. It’s also a great performer, and you really can’t beat Cuisinart’s three-year warranty.</p>
<p>For under $20, our budget pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XCCULW/?tag-ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oster &#8211; 2500</a> is a sturdy mixer with five clearly differentiated speeds, giving you a true low for splatter-less mixing and blending.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We gathered a wealth of knowledge, science and technique into our 36 hours of research and testing six machines to determine a Zojirushi product was the best bread machine.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent 36 hours researching and testing to determine which bread machine bakes the best bread. After weeks of baking follies, foibles and triumphs, the tried and true <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0067MQM48/?tag=ybdbrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Zojirushi &#8211; BB-PAC20</a> earned our pick for best bread machine. While it is the most expensive machine in our lineup, this machine is solid, consistent and offers advanced features that take automatic bread-baking over the top. At a quarter of the cost of a Zojirushi, our runner-up <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003GXM0EM/?tag=ybdbrm-20">Oster &#8211; CKSTBRTW20</a> offers many of the same features packed into a smaller, lighter and friendlier package. Used by novices and experts alike, we learned how these handy appliances make breadmaking easy and enjoyable.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Every YBD article starts with extensive online research. That means we spend a lot of time on subreddits like /r/Breadit and reading blogs specializing in bread. We scanned websites like Amazon, Target and Walmart to find useful intel within casual user reviews. A little more digging took us deeper into niche communities like /r/Frugal, /r/homestead and /r/ketorecipes for recommendations off the beaten path.</p>
<p>Like the microwave and waffle machine, the bread machine has inspired many dedicated cookbooks. Our research includes a couple of titles that offer in-depth studies such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/155832156X/?tag=ybdbrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>The Bread Lover&#8217;s Bread Machine Cookbook</i></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1887624201/?tag=ybdbrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Easy Breadmaking for Special Diets</i></a>. Professionally-trained baker and author of the former, Beth Hensperger gives us an expert’s perspective in her writing. In her book, there’s an exhaustive chapter dedicated to describing the many features of bread machines, providing a decent starting point for home baking.</p>
<p>YouTube reviews provided a sometimes-entertaining source of bread machine reviews and tips, both professional and amateur. Seeing reactions and answers to common issues from home bakers helped us determine which features were important. We factored in these notes with the general list of available bread machines to narrow down the finalists.</p>
<p>What we ended up with was a diverse list of high-end, inexpensive and unique bread machines qualified by our multi-point vetting process.</p>

<h2 id="the-history">The history of bread machines</h2>
<p>While breadmaking dates back a staggering 30,000 years, the single-loaf home bread machine has only existed since 1986, the year it was invented in Japan. That makes for about 29,968 years of laborious bread making sans machine. Two years later, it hit American stores in 1988 with a retail cost hovering around $300 each! By 1996, annual sales of bread machines zoomed up to $400 million! These newly-minted home appliances have enjoyed a comfortable spot on wedding registry wishlists ever since.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-them">Why use bread machines?</h2>
<p>The basic process for bread making starts with mixing flour, salt and yeast, followed by laborious kneading, rising, more kneading, shaping, rising again and finally baking. In total, it is a long and arduous process that takes <i>at least</i> two to four hours depending on the type of bread. The length of time to use a bread machine is about the same, but the bread machine mechanizes the tiring work of kneading and timing.</p>
<p>We’ll come right out and say that bread machines may not be as foolproof as you expect. Depending on how carefully you read instructions, there’s a good chance you might nail it on the first try. But it’s important to remember that there is a craft and science to bread baking. That being said, bread machines undoubtedly increase your chances of success.</p>
<p>Bread making can be sensitive and reactive to your environment, so proportions of wet and dry ingredients can vary by the season. Fresh ingredients (especially yeast) and proper measuring are crucial to bread machine success. While it is a simple formula, it may take some tinkering and learning to achieve that perfect loaf.</p>
<p>Experienced bread makers have familiarized themselves with the proper look and texture of a successful dough; some able to bake without measuring, relying on feel alone! If you’re a little bit curious, adventurous and willing to learn, bread machine baking is a great way to learn about this ancient staple and the fascinating chemistry behind it.</p>
<h3>All the hard work</h3>
<p>What the bread machine does best is take over the labor of kneading. The machine also automatically brings itself to ideal proofing temperature, which makes consistent results easier. With or without a bread machine, home bakers must be cognizant of temperature and humidity, which can affect the consistency of the dough. With the bread machine however, you can pretty much let it go after ensuring the dough is the right consistency in the first 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Bread machines are an obvious choice for beginners and novices, but many experienced bakers also find them useful for doing everything up until the baking, at which point they remove the dough from the machine to shape and bake in their own oven. This affords one Reddit user “the benefit of not having to clean your counters before and after making bread every single time.”</p>
<h3>Not just for beginners</h3>
<p>Believe it or not, Washington State University’s famous Bread Lab uses bread machines extensively for recipe testing. Even more, The King Arthur Blog (which calls Bread Lab their home), champions bread machines for making brioche bread. The high content of butter and eggs makes for a very sticky and notoriously difficult dough to make by hand. They ran an experiment between a bread machine and a stand mixer and posted the superior results of their beloved Zojirushi.</p>
<h3>Specialized diets</h3>
<p>Bread machines are invaluable for making this staple food tolerable for the estimated 15 million Americans with food allergies. Most of our finalists even have specific settings for gluten-free recipes. <i>Easy Breadmaking for Special Diets</i> provides bread recipes for the following diets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gluten-free</li>
<li>Milk- and lactose-free</li>
<li>Egg-free</li>
<li>Sugar-free</li>
<li>Yeast-free</li>
<li>Low-sodium</li>
<li>Heart-healthy</li>
<li>High-fiber</li>
<li>Low-fiber</li>
<li>Diabetic</li>
<li>Low-carb</li>
<li>Low-calorie</li>
</ul>
<p>One gluten-intolerant commenter from the <a href="https://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/zojirushi-home-bakery-virtuoso-bread-machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">King Arthur Flour blog</a> says, “GF bread in the grocery store is pretty pitiful and… is always frozen.” She finds great success with her bread machine, declaring her homemade bread, “by far better than anything that I could buy in a store.”</p>
<h3>Cost-benefit of baking vs. buying?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/cost-of-bread-baking-vs-buying-bread-1446664" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Spruce</a> reports that the cost for materials to make a simple loaf of French bread is about $1.58. The cost of a store-bought loaf will run about $2.50 with more artisanal bread costing around $4.00-$5.00. With an inexpensive bread machine costing at least $50, you would recoup after at least 50 basic loaves or 17 artisanal.</p>
<p>For those really looking to pinch pennies, the /r/Frugal subreddit suggest finding used bread machines at the thrift store. You would, of course, runs the risk of bringing home a defective machine which would invariably complicate troubleshooting.</p>
<h3>For your health</h3>
<p>Other common motivators for home baking are health, satisfaction and joy. There were about 20 ingredients in the aforementioned store-bought loaves versus four to six in a homemade loaf. Don’t want “<i>sodium stearoyl lactylate</i>” inside that loaf of yours? How about the lowercase-challenged “<i>DATEM</i>”? They sound more like the ingredients to make an R2-D2 but nonetheless find themselves on the call sheet for Wonder bread — as in, “<i>I wonder what I’m eating?” </i></p>
<p>For hobbyists, savings is less of a reason than the very satisfying process of creating food from scratch. In an interview with <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/baking-for-others-psychology_us_58dd0b85e4b0e6ac7092aaf8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HuffPost</a>, associate professor of psychological and brain sciences at Boston University, Donna Pincus, says, “baking has the benefit of allowing people creative expression.” The same article also links baking to self-expression, communication, mindfulness, altruism and stress relief.</p>
<h3>The life-changing magic of freshly baked bread</h3>
<p>The bread machine can be a serious tool for seasoned bakers and beginners alike. The benefits of using a bread machine outweigh the stigma that comes with labor-saving devices. Aside from cost-benefit and health reasons, at the basest level, it’s truly hard to beat the intoxicating smell and taste of a fresh loaf.</p>
<p>Kick off those low-carb shoes and fall in love with bread again. Let’s start with what to look for.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Preprogram options: </b>Most bread machines come with preset programs for all of the main options like Basic, Wheat, Dough, Cake, etc. If you are shopping specifically for gluten-free baking, T-fal &#8211; PF311E ActiBread replaces the standard options in favor of an exclusively gluten-free menu.</p>
<p><b>Bread loaf size: </b>The average loaf size is a medium 1.5 lbs. For reference, the average sized store-bought loaf weighs 1 pound. Larger-capacity machines will bake up to 2.5-pound loaves.</p>
<p><b>Bread loaf shape:</b> A common complaint about bread machines is the unfamiliar tall loaf shape, which could make for awkwardly large sandwiches that don’t fit in small sandwich bags or toasters. A simple solution is to cut it in half, but if this is a dealbreaker for you, consider the only “traditional” loaf option: Zojirushi &#8211; BB-PAC20.</p>
<p><strong>Delay timer/keep warm:</strong> All of our finalists have this feature but vary in max time. This setting allows you to load up the machine the night prior and wake up to freshly baked bread. A word of warning: This feature should only be used with non-dairy recipes to avoid spoilage.</p>
<p><strong>Variable crust color settings:</strong> This feature allows you to choose the “brownness” of your crust.</p>
<p><strong>Size and weight:</strong> These machines can take up a lot of space. Alternatively, you can put your machine away after each use, but then you should consider its weight.</p>

<p><strong>Viewing window:</strong> Being able to see whether the loaf has fallen flat earlier on in baking or rising could save waiting time. Panasonic &#8211; SD-YD250 was the only machine without a window, leaving us biting nails until the very end of the cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Convection or conventional:</strong> Convection ovens use a fan to spread heat more efficiently. In the case of bread machines, this potentially means darker, crustier bread. Cuisinart &#8211; BMKR-400PC is the only convection option in our lineup, and indeed its results were more dark and crusty.</p>
<p><strong>Fast bake option:</strong> If you need to sacrifice taste for time, the fast bake cycle does just that. This option is available for all of our finalists. Be careful to use the correct type of yeast!</p>
<h2 id="how-they-work">How do bread machines work?</h2>
<h3>Basic function</h3>
<p>A breadmaker does all the mixing, kneading and baking in one self-contained unit. For all it does, the technology is quite basic. There is an axle and motor which spins a removable kneading paddle and a heating element, which in turn heats up the loaf tin. An electronic interface controls the different programs available for different types of bread.</p>
<p>By controlling temperature for rising and proofing dough, the bread machine acts like a proving drawer or proofing box, bringing your dough to ideal temperatures for yeast activity (between 70 and 120 °F). This is an especially useful feature for those who live in very cold places.</p>
<h3>Loaf tin</h3>
<p>The loaf tin is the heart of the bread machine, where the magic happens. It’s a removable non-stick pan where your ingredients mix and mature into a fully-baked loaf. They all vary slightly in design and quality but work the same way. Inside, your robot kneading hands (the paddle) attach to the bottom. After proofing and baking, you remove the tin and shake out the finished loaf.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12497" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison.jpg" alt="Three loaf tins compared side by side" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/loaf-tin-comparison-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Convection or conventional?</h3>
<p>The convection option for bread machines is not common. Out of our six finalists, only the Cuisinart &#8211; BMKR-400PC gives us the option. Essentially, convection ovens use a fan to spread heat more efficiently, resulting in quicker baking.</p>
<p>As the fan faces the side of the tin, Cuisinart’s machine doesn’t suffer from common convection-baking issues like drying out or undercooking the inside. However, it baked quicker and gave us a slightly darker and “crustier” crust. Some user reviews recommended using the <i>Light</i> crust color setting to achieve <i>Medium</i> results.</p>
<h3>Next-level bread machine usage</h3>
<p>By far, the most popular use of bread machines by hobbyists and advanced home bakers is the dough setting. Panasonic, Zojirushi and Cuisinart manuals show an impressive array of baked goods that are <i>not </i>in the shape of a bread machine tin. Cinnamon rolls, pizza, baguettes, dinner rolls, pretzels, bagels and braided masterpieces burst from bread baskets in full color! How do we go from our brown rectangles to these picturesque beauties?</p>
<p>The answer lies in the obscure “dough” setting. Once a home-baker starts Googling about bread recreationally, a world of possibilities opens up. /r/Breadit users share this tip like they are imparting sage wisdom unto a young padawan who only knows the first trick. Of course, mastery takes some practice.</p>
<p>We made pizza dough and all of a sudden, pre-made dough seemed laughable. Our bread-machine-dough pizza turned out just as great as any store-bought variety and was easier than going to the store. Pretty soon, recipes like dinner rolls just might become a weeknight staple: Simply interrupt the cycle to shape the prepared dough before returning it to the tin (or your own oven) for the final bake.</p>
<h3>All about yeast</h3>
<p>To understand more about baking, one must understand yeast. In 1868, the Fleischmann brothers developed the first commercial yeast made of grain, barley malt and brewer’s yeast. This dried yeast quickly replaced the more complicated use of natural starters and yeast which requires continuous maintenance and “feeding” like a live creature.</p>
<p>Today, the types and names of available yeast are confusing. We found some conflicting information, especially between “rapid”, “quick” and “instant” varieties. Ultimately though, there are three main types:</p>
<p><b>Active dry yeast:</b> This is the “tortoise” of yeasts, likely what previous generations of home bakers are accustomed to. It rises the slowest, but longest. ADY is made of larger granules than other types and should be activated by dissolving with warm water (about 110°F) before use. This proofing process sheds off dead cells from high heat drying process to reach the living yeast. In their testing, <a href="https://blog.kingarthurflour.com/2016/01/29/yeast-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">King Arthur Flour blog</a> reports that it has the most neutral taste while <a href="https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/6620-yeast-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cook’s Illustrated</a> found its flavor to be “less clean,” potentially due to the dead cells.</p>

<p><strong>Instant/highly active yeast (“Quick-rise” or “RapidRise&#8221;):</strong> The “hare” of yeasts reportedly work 50% faster than active dry yeast. The main difference is that it’s created using a much <a href="https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/6620-yeast-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gentler heating process</a> so that all of the granules remain active. Thus, it is more potent and requires fewer steps to use. It can be added directly to dry ingredients without “activating” with water. Its granules are smaller and contain enzymes and other additives to aid in quicker rise. <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-difference-between-active-dry-yeast-and-instant-yeast-54252" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Kitchn</a> reports you can also skip the first rise and go straight to shaping.</p>
<p>King Arthur Blog draws distinction between “Instant yeast” (SAF’s <i>Saf-Instant</i>) and “Highly active yeast” (Fleishmann’s <i>RapidRise Instant Yeast</i>, Red Star’s <i>Quick Rise Instant Dry Yeast</i>). The latter adds buzzy adjectives like, “quick” and “rapid,” <i>in addition to </i>“instant,” which is very confusing. The difference may be due to <a href="https://noshon.it/tips/active-dry-yeast-vs-instant-yeast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">different amounts of activators</a> added to help with faster rising. Their testing shows a difference in rising speed, but the finished results were neck and neck. KAF narrowly prefers what they consider “Instant yeast.”</p>
<p><b>Fresh, compressed or cake yeast:</b> This is closest to Fleischmann’s nineteenth-century formulation and contains a higher water content than active and instant yeast. It is 100% alive and thus highly perishable, requires refrigeration and has a sensitive expiration date. It produces the most carbon dioxide during fermentation and requires no proofing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/6620-yeast-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cook’s Illustrated</a> prefers instant yeast for its, “potency of fresh yeast with the convenience of active dry.” In our testing, we too opted for an instant in SAF’s <i>Saf-Instant</i> yeast. However, the different types can be used interchangeably with some adjustment.</p>
<h3>Our first lesson: Yeast shalt not touch salt</h3>
<p>In our haste and excitement, we followed instructions and still came out with 3-inch-high loaves of bread. In our first pair of machine manuals, we saw no warning to keep the yeast away from the salt. In went the ingredients and perhaps after the longest 3.5 hours of our bread baking lives, complete and utter failure: two dense and deceptively-delicious-smelling failure piles.</p>
<p>Furious internet exploration revealed our fatal mistake. Salt kills yeast! This time we perused all of the bread machine manuals and saw different ways of preventing contact between the two. Some gave no mention, only directing to add ingredients in a certain order. Some gave a warning. A little understanding could have prevented this altogether. Now we know.</p>

Each bread machine had its own character reflected in (or because of) design choices. Taking into consideration steps before, during and after engaging baking cycles, we graded each in the following criteria:</p>
<p><b>Countertop appeal:</b> Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but YBD staff thought there’s a margin of objectivity that is also influenced by function and branding. More simply, would we grow tired of seeing this every day in our kitchen?</p>
<p><b>Documentation:</b> Instruction manuals and starter recipes were key in overall user experience. Our ranking rewarded easy-to-read guides and docked points for confusion.</p>
<p><b>Warranty:</b> Buyer reviews often give firsthand accounts of warranty claim experiences. The responsiveness of each brand plays into their reputation for reliability and dependability. It is often clear if there are egregious issues within a product line and our warranty score represents an overall impression along with the duration of the warranty.</p>
<p><b>Stability:</b> Because we found multiple reports of some machines creeping across the counter during the kneading phase, we paid close attention to unit stability.</p>
<p><b>Loaf pan design:</b> Bread machine pans are generally very similar but vary in shape, size, weight and how they lock into the machine. Subtle differences or quirks may compound over time for better or for worse. Did the handle get in the way? Were there any sharp edges? Did weightiness make loaf removal more difficult?</p>
<p><b>Paddle design:</b> The second-most-handled element after the pan is the paddle. We graded these based on material, shape and how they interlocked with the loaf pans.</p>
<p><b>Overall construction quality:</b> Looking past the distraction of branding and packaging, we tried to get a sense of construction quality by examining materials, weight and the design of interlocking components. The last factor was especially important for the longevity of the machine.</p>
<h3>Performance and operation</h3>

<p>The performance ratings are the meat and potatoes of our reviewing process. Here, design and function meet. The proof, as they say, is in the <i>bread</i> pudding.</p>
<p><b>Programming and interface:</b> The programming of a bread machine is implemented by a digital interface. We look at everything from button type and placement to screen legibility and ease of comprehension.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12494" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup.jpg" alt="Close-up of programmable interface" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cuisinart-closeup-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><b>General ease of use:</b> This is a comprehensive score that addresses every aspect from the point of view of a novice user from the first measure of flour to finished loaf.</p>
<p><b>Versatility:</b> Bread machines are touted for their versatility, stretching the boundaries of what it means to be a “unitasker.” We count the number of preset programs and thumb through recommended recipes to arrive at this score.</p>
<p><b>Quietness:</b> At the end of the day, the noise level of your bread machine may make all the difference. When we had three running at a time, the grades for this category quickly became clear. Depending on your intention and the location of your kitchen, your bread machine has the potential to become either a nuisance or an alarm clock.</p>
<p><b>Pan removal:</b> Twist, pull or both? Removing a hot bread pan from the machine has a slight learning curve for each machine, varying in the process, ease and feel. Placement and swing of the handle make a difference as well.</p>
<p><b>Paddle removal and cleanup:</b> We noticed some loaves came out of the tin more easily than others and can attribute that to paddle removal. Cleaning the paddles is easily the most arduous task of bread machine baking, apart from sweeping up flour and breadcrumbs. While the paddles rarely got stuck inside our loaves, this nonetheless prolonged the overall cleanup process, adding the task of surgical paddle removal.</p>
<h3>The taste test</h3>

<p>Finally, what we have all been waiting 3.5 hours for: the taste test! We baked each loaf nearly simultaneously, so we were able to do a side-by-side testing of bread right out of the oven and after a few hours of rest.</p>
<p><b>Taste:</b> We used identical recipes in order to determine if the aforementioned criteria and price made any difference at all. Texture, crunch and balance of flavors round out the factors for this grade.</p>
<p><b>Look:</b> Visual appeal always plays into the taste and so it will in our taste test as well. The look of a loaf always indicates the success (or fail) of a bake. Size also plays a role in texture and crumb.</p>
<p><b>Crumb:</b> Otherwise known as “hole structure,” this is a useful visual indication of the process a loaf has undergone. Larger and varied holes mean that the dough was properly kneaded and aerated, and thus better puffed up for a delicate loaf.</p>

<p><strong>Crust:</strong> The color of crust can be adjusted on our finalists, allowing choice of <i>light, medium </i>or <i>dark. </i>We chose <i>medium</i> for the purposes of testing and examined each loaf for evenness of color and relative darkness.</p>

<p><b>Paddle impression in bread:</b> One of the main complaints of using bread machines is the unsightly impression left by the paddles of the bread machine. This compresses the bottom areas near the paddles as well, making it slightly denser than normal. We noticed that some machines made more of a mark while some consistently slid out cleanly.</p>

<p>It’s not a huge surprise that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0067MQM48/?tag=ybdbrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zojirushi &#8211; BB-PAC20</a>, affectionately referred to as “Zo” by its fans, wins out. It is also the most expensive machine and it’s obvious why. The bread pan feels like it could survive a few lifetimes. The most unique feature, however, is the bread shape: those yearning for “traditional” regular height sandwiches will want to splurge on this workhorse of a machine.</p>

Thoughtfully engineered with well-made parts, the Zo is built for heavy duty usage.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0067MQM48/?tag=ybdbr" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Because of superior construction quality and thoughtful design, the Zo comes out on top in our design ranking. Its bread pan was the sturdiest by far, an important win since it is the most handled element of a bread machine. It earns a full score in stability as its horizontal orientation and weight keep it squarely in place during operation while others wiggle considerably.</p>
<p>When it comes to taste, it tied for first with the Panasonic. Both machines came up with consistent results across repeated bakes. The unique loaf-pan shape requires dual blades, adding a little bit of inconvenience as you have to clean two, but the consistent mixing may be worth it.</p>
<p>Bread scientists at Bread Lab at Washington University shamelessly <a href="https://blog.kingarthurflour.com/2015/02/17/successful-loaves-from-your-bread-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorse</a> their Zo any time there is mention of bread machines. It has our vote of confidence as the bread machine most likely to outlast other machines.</p>
<p>The biggest drawback is that it wasn’t the quietest of the machines, producing substantial sound during kneading phases. Second is its larger footprint, size and weight which in a previous paragraph would describe its positive traits! There are trade-offs, so it depends on what your needs are. If you need a longstanding, well-engineered and well-made machine and have counter space to spare, Zojirushi &#8211; BB-PAC20 is the one.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Zojirushi &#8211; BB-PAC20 wins top scores in all three categories, but it comes at a cost. It is the most expensive bread machine but has the highest potential to outlast other finalists as it has the highest quality of construction.</li>
<li>It is the only machine that produces a familiar size and shape loaf instead of the awkwardly tall “bread machine” look.</li>
<li>This machine is most stable of the finalists, but it is also one of the heaviest and largest and will take up precious counter space.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the Zo won our minds, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003GXM0EM/?tag=ybdbrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oster &#8211; CKSTBRTW20</a> won our hearts. Although much lighter in weight and smaller in size, the Oster delivered consistent loaves and scored high in taste.</p>
<p>Encased in an off-white plastic case, this machine is friendlier and less industrial looking than the Zo. Its lighter weight affords easier mobility (if you need to move it into storage after use), but invariably allows visible shaking during kneading. The tradeoff is that it is much quieter than the more stable Zojirushi and Panasonic. Surprisingly, our test scores show that despite its visible wobble, the Oster stayed in place just as well as the competition.</p>

Its compact size easily stows away in a cabinet.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003GXM0EM/?tag=ybdbrm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The controls and buttons on the Oster were simple and easy to access. A blue on light is as obvious and indicative as the use of the machine is itself. The lid is removable and easy to clean in the case of the occasional over-risen loaf. The bread pan is nothing to write home about, but it works just fine.</p>
<p>In general, the loaves coming out of this machine were nice, with light and airy texture. Most importantly, its slightly more developed flavor separated it from the other budget option, the Hamilton Beach. Although it was the cheapest finalist, it held up well against machines more than double its cost.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Oster &#8211; CKSTBRTW20 was the quietest machine we tested.</li>
<li>As the least-expensive finalist, we were surprised to see it outperform the more expensive machines.</li>
<li>The small weight, footprint and price make the Oster a great candidate for beginners and people in smaller kitchens.</li>
<li>The small size and weight makes it ideal for storage or limited counter space.</li>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005QFL0/?tag=ybdbrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; SD-YD250</a>, with its high marks in taste, eluded us in the beginning. It looked as though the box came straight out of a time machine from the ‘90s. And it was loud. We can’t recommend this one for the noise-averse or light sleepers. It was so loud that we questioned whether or not it was fully working, but each time it answered with consistent top quality loaves.</p>
<p>We liked the look and feel of the paddle and loaf tin. As the third-most-costly machine, we expected it to have a high-quality build, and it does. The aesthetic design leaves a little to be desired; a tall, off-white rectangular box that says very little. The membrane-type buttons are resistant to flour and easy to wipe.</p>
<p>The instructions manuals are satisfactory, and the dedicated recipe book has a lot of nice pictures, but we can’t shake the blast-from-the-past feel we get from the overall branding. It’s an interesting contrast to see our freshly baked loaves living in the moment next to the vintage styling of the recipe book. It takes us out for a moment, but a bite into the bread takes us right back!</p>
<h3>Cuisinart &#8211; BMKR-400PC</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009VELTQ/?tag=ybdbrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; BMKR-400PC</a> struck us as the stunner in the group, covered in sleek brushed metal with black and chrome highlights. The convection feature also sets it apart from most other bread machines: convection ovens use a fan to more efficiently spread heat, and the Cuisinart did yield lovely browned crusts, even on the <i>medium</i> crust setting.</p>
<p>A few user reviews reported mix results, some saying they ended up with burnt bread. <a href="https://www.cooksillustrated.com/equipment_reviews/1586-bread-machines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cook’s Illustrated</a> reported that it overheated in their results so they left it out of testing. Our results were darker than the rest but were still delicious. The higher temperature resulted in a slightly thicker crust.</p>
<p>Costing almost $150 at the time of writing, this machine is the second most expensive. It certainly has a cool “industrial” look, but the construction quality left a bit to be desired. The metal casing is thinner than you would expect, certainly less robust than the Panasonic. The door and hinges just feel a little bit on the flimsy side, raising concern over how long this machine would last with heavy use.</p>
<p>If counter space is an issue, look elsewhere. Like the Zojirushi, the Cuisinart is a beast of a machine in dimensions, though not nearly as heavy as the former.</p>
<p>The nail in the coffin is its noise level, rated just above the broken-sounding Panasonic. Even with its good looks, we would be hard-pressed to justify shelling out the premium <i>dough</i> for this machine.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MVSRIDG/?tag=ybdbrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">T-fal &#8211; PF311E Actibread</a> puts all its money on being <i>the</i> bread machine for the gluten intolerant. This was a minor inconvenience as we failed a loaf trying to find an equivalent setting for “basic white” bread. Actibread gives us fifteen program settings and not a single one is “basic” of anything. We admire its radical commitment to this diet, although it proved slightly inconvenient for our testing purposes.</p>
<p>By flipping through the alternative recipe book, we found the closest thing to “basic white” was a setting for “gluten-free cake”. The results turned out pretty great, despite the experimental status.</p>

<p>The all-black-plastic look is rounded and “sporty.” Its long plastic gray buttons echo this style, and it operates just as expected. Its controls are simple, clear and easy to read. The digital readout is also easy to read and doesn’t aspire to be more than it is.</p>
<p>Other than its dedication to gluten-free bread, there is nothing all that different about this machine. We might recommend steering clear if you want to make conventional bread, if only to avoid the confusion of deciphering the correct setting. For the gluten intolerant and allergic, this would be a wonderful option.</p>

<p>In our repeated testing, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005EPRF1I/?tag=ybdbrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 29882</a> struggled to keep up with the rest. Its middling rank in design and performance gave out entirely after below-average taste test scores. We aren’t entirely certain why the bread wasn’t as good. It was serviceable, and many sandwiches were made. Taking a stab at reverse-engineering the bread, we’d guess that the kneading fell just short.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it was the off-gassing on the first round of loaves that was offputting. The manual had warned of this happening, instating doubt considering the other machines didn’t have the same problem. The plastic smell went away after the first loaf, but perhaps it had left an impression.</p>
<p>Our third guess is that the interior temperature of the machine might be off. One thing is for sure, this vaguely-sporty black plastic box left us in question and in doubt. For a task as complicated as bread making, choose a machine that inspires confidence.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>There’s no denying the magical appeal of the alchemy that is bread making. With your machine, you can transform mostly-inert powders and liquids into this magical food form of love. For hobbyists, these romantic ideas swirl with the practical outcome of consistent, controlled results. While yes, you will save some money baking your own bread versus going to the store, there is an intangible benefit and that can’t be expressed better than “joy.” There’s something special about using your time and effort creating something from scratch to nourish yourself and others.</p>
<p>For demanding users who want customizable program options and a machine built like a tank, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0067MQM48/?tag=ybdbrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zojirushi’s BB-PAC20</a> will bring you closer to home baking bliss. Its superior construction, consistent results and traditional-looking loaves are worth the investment, especially if you value product longevity.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent 40 hours toasting, broiling and baking to determine that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XBOXVIA/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BOV845BSS Smart Oven Pro</a> is the best toaster oven. Since our review, the Breville has been slightly updated, but it’s virtually the same high quality, feature-packed and most versatile toaster oven that we originally reviewed. For this 2019 update, we tested two new toaster ovens and have selected a new runner-up, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0AWSJX/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; TOB-260N1 Chef’s Convection</a>. The Cuisinart is almost identical to the Breville in features and performance, but it’s about one-third less expensive.</p>

<p>(<em>Editors note: For this 2019 update, we checked manufacturers&#8217; websites to see if any of the toaster ovens we originally reviewed had been updated and discontinued. All models, except for the Waring &#8211; TCO650 and the Panasonic &#8211; NB-G110P, had minor changes and didn&#8217;t warrant our retesting them. We found two new toaster ovens released in the past year &#8212; the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0AWSJX/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; TOB-260N1 Chef&#8217;s Convection</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07T3J3B13/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KCO-211BM</a> &#8212; and tested them to see how they compared. The new Cuisinart handily outperformed our previous runner-up, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E9HR7KG/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; TOB-135</a>, and we&#8217;ve named it our new runner-up.</em>)</p>
<h2 id="how-we-chose">How we chose toaster ovens to test</h2>
<p>We began our search for the best toaster oven by reading reviews and research from websites such as Amazon, Best Reviews, Good Housekeeping and Bon Appétit.</p>
<p>We also read countless individual consumer reviews and cooking blogs to find out what people use their toaster ovens for, what the most useful features are, what the most common complaints are and what makes the ideal toaster oven.</p>
<p>We discovered that people valued the following toaster oven characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capacity: How much food can be accommodated?</li>
<li>Accessibility: How easily can the toaster oven be used?</li>
<li>Functionality: How do the features affect your usage?</li>
<li>Versatility: Can the toaster oven cook a wide variety of foods?</li>
<li>Dependability: Do the preset cooking functions produce expected results every time?</li>
<li>Consistency: Is the food item cooked through evenly?</li>
<li>Attractiveness: How aesthetically appealing is the appliance?</li>
<li>Impression: How much kitchen space does the appliance require?</li>
<li>Tidiness: How easily can the toaster oven be cleaned?</li>
<li>Affordability: Do you have to spend more money to yield better results?</li>
</ul>
<p>To narrow the extensive list of toaster ovens we researched down to our seven finalists, we only chose the toaster ovens with the highest ratings. With all of them boasting Amazon ratings of 4 stars or more, we ordered them and performed a series of tests. We then compared the data we collected against each of the finalists.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs-one">Who needs a toaster oven?</h2>
<p>Whether your living space lacks a full kitchen or you are simply looking to add to your collection of kitchen appliances, a toaster oven can benefit any household. In addition to toasting your favorite breakfast items, a toaster oven can do anything from baking a classic rotisserie chicken to broiling some home-style barbecue ribs.</p>
<p>Toaster ovens provide the versatility that a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-toaster/">slot toaster</a> lacks and offers the convenience that a conventional oven does not.</p>
<p>While you may have to wait up to half an hour for a conventional oven to preheat, a toaster oven can cut the preheat time substantially. For the eco-conscious home cook, toaster ovens are a budget-friendly and energy efficient alternative to conventional ovens.</p>
<p>A toaster oven is also a pragmatic appliance for people who often cook smaller portions or feed smaller households.</p>
<h2>What is convection cooking</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4245" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/convection-fan.jpg" alt="closeup of convection fan" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/convection-fan.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/convection-fan-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/convection-fan-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/convection-fan-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/convection-fan-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/convection-fan-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/convection-fan-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/convection-fan-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/convection-fan-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Out of the seven finalists we originally tested and the two new finalists, five featured convection cooking: Breville Smart Oven Pro, Cuisinart &#8211; Chef’s Convection, Cuisinart Deluxe Convection, Oster 6-Slice Counter Top and Waring Pro Digital Convection. A convection toaster oven has a fan and exhaust system that can be used to better circulate and ventilate the hot air.</p>
<p>The fan blows hot air directly onto the food, which allows it to cook faster, and in turn, save energy. The convection system also eliminates any hot spots by evenly distributing the hot air around the food and throughout the oven, which allows you to achieve more even cooking.</p>
<p>Another benefit is that the convection mode minimizes the amount of moisture in the toaster oven. The dry environment allows you to achieve better browning compared to the normal mode because it will roast your meats and vegetables instead of steaming them.</p>
<p>In addition to roasting, the convection setting is great for baking cookies, pies and pastries as well as toasting and dehydrating food products. If you are braising or cooking something covered, you can also use the convection setting for faster cooking since dryness will not be a concern.</p>
<p>While toaster ovens with convection cooking are generally more expensive than those without, the additional benefits make the option worth considering.</p>
<h2>What are infrared heating elements?</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4244" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infrared-element.jpg" alt="Panasonic's infrared heating element" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infrared-element.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infrared-element-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infrared-element-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infrared-element-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infrared-element-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infrared-element-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infrared-element-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infrared-element-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infrared-element-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>To provide a complete roundup of heating methods available in toaster ovens, we tested one that uses infrared technology, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E07D76S/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic Flash Xpress</a>. Infrared technology uses light energy to cook food, similar to a microwave. The intensity of the light speeds up the cooking process dramatically, and the toaster oven requires virtually no preheating time.</p>
<p>However, the strength of the heat limits its use for more delicate foods. Infrared technology is better suited for toasting bagels and reheating pizzas and less ideal for cooking fish. The soft, flaky texture of fish requires more delicate handling. Speed and efficiency is by far the greatest advantage of infrared technology.</p>
<h2 id="features-to-look-for">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>The oven you choose will largely be determined by your kitchen space, cooking needs and budget. Then you can further narrow by aesthetics and features which usually come at a premium.</p>
<h3>Capacity</h3>
<p>For people who plan on using their toaster ovens to reheat or cook single servings of food, a small toaster oven that can accommodate four slices of bread or a 9-inch pizza will suffice. People who plan on using their toaster ovens to prepare multiple servings would benefit from a large toaster oven that can accommodate six slices of bread, a 13-inch pizza, or a whole chicken.</p>
<p>The size of your kitchen and your aesthetic taste will also determine how much of your counter space you want to allow to a toaster oven. If you have a small kitchen with limited counter space, a smaller toaster oven may be ideal.</p>
<h3>Crumb tray</h3>
<p>The crumb tray is a small, thin, stainless steel sheet that slides out from the bottom of the toaster oven. All of our seven finalists have crumb trays, and we strongly recommend purchasing a toaster oven with one. The tray is an essential feature because it makes cleaning your toaster oven much easier.</p>
<p>The tray covers the entire bottom of the inside and catches all of the crumbs and fragments that fall during the cooking process. Instead of watching the debris burn at the bottom of your toaster oven over time, you can simply pull the tray out after each use and sweep the contents into the trash. If you’re dealing with tougher substances, you can also easily wash the tray.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>Toaster ovens are one of the most versatile kitchen appliances because they can perform a variety of cooking tasks. Our finalists feature anywhere from three to 10 preset cooking functions. Six out of the seven finalists offer bake and broil settings, which is what differentiates a toaster oven from a regular toaster. Baking surrounds your food with hot air for even cooking while broiling directs the heat to the top of your food for a searing effect.</p>
<p>Other popular functions include bagel, pizza, and warm. The bagel setting will produce a slightly toasted outside and a crispier inside. The pizza setting can be used to melt the cheese and heat the toppings while crisping the crust. The warm setting maintains the temperature of hot foods to prevent bacterial growth. A few of the finalists also provide a reheat setting for leftovers and a defrost setting for frozen foods.</p>
<p>Beyond preset cooking functions, other convenient features to consider are interior lighting, digital displays, nonstick interiors, and automatic shut-off. You can also decide between dial and touchpad controls.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>Pricier toaster ovens almost always feature a sleeker look and more luxurious feel, but they aren’t necessarily better than cheaper options. However, some of the more expensive toaster ovens have more wattage for faster, more even cooking.</p>
<p>The price of more expensive models may account for the higher quality of materials and durability of components, which means that they are likely to last longer. Some of our finalists even offer limited product warranties. Ultimately, your decision will be determined by your personal budget and preferences.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<p>One of the most popular reasons why people use toaster ovens is convenience, specifically when it comes to speed. When it came time to start testing our finalists, we paid close attention to preheating and cooking times.</p>
<p>On average, toaster ovens with higher wattage were able to perform cooking tasks faster than toaster ovens with lower wattage. However, the toaster oven that won our speed test by a large margin was the only one that featured infrared technology.</p>
<p>Despite being powered by a modest 1300 watts, the median wattage amongst our finalists, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E07D76S/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic Flash Xpress</a> was the speed demon to beat them all. The Panasonic was able to produce perfect toast in one minute and 45 seconds, garlic bread in one minute, and frozen pizza in 12 minutes.</p>
<p>In our new testing, we were also impressed by the Cuisinart &#8211; Chef’s Convection’s speed. It has 1800 watts, just like the Breville, but an added feature is its “speed convection” setting. Not only does the convection function decrease cooking time, but the speed convection setting eliminates the need for preheating the oven: It immediately heats up to the desired temperature.</p>
<h3>Cooking functions</h3>
<p><strong>Toast</strong></p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/toast-comparison-1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We began our testing process with the classic toast function available on all of our finalists. The goal was to toast a slice of bread to a crisp, golden brown. We used a generic brand of pre-sliced white bread in order to get a clear visualization of the color and texture after toasting.</p>
<p>The toast setting works by emitting even heat from the top and bottom of the oven, similar to the way a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-toaster/">2 or 4-slice slot toaster</a> emits heat on two sides of the bread simultaneously. For this setting, we placed the wire racks on the middle level of the toaster ovens. For the five finalists that allowed us to choose a level, we set the toaster ovens to level two.</p>
<p>For the two that did not, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FN3MV88/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BLACK+DECKER</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AO24YX8/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach</a>, we simply watched and turned off the toaster oven once a crisp, golden brown color was achieved. The toasting time ranged from one minute, 45 seconds to four minutes.</p>
<p>When it came to evenly toasting bread, the majority of our finalists were disappointing, including our new finalist, the KitchenAid. Most of the toaster ovens produced shading that graduated from top to bottom with the edges of the bread either under- or over-toasted. In our prior testing, only the Oster and the Waring evenly toasted the bread on both sides. Our new runner-up, the Cuisinart &#8211; Chef’s Convection, also gave us evenly shaded golden-brown toast.</p>
<p><strong>Garlic bread</strong></p>
<p>To test the broil function, we decided to make some fresh garlic bread. With our French baguettes generously slathered in herbed garlic butter, the goal was to melt the butter and crisp the edges while maintaining the soft interior.</p>
<p>On the broil setting, the heat source comes from above the food. Since the Panasonic lacked the broil option, we utilized the toast option once again. We preheated all of the toaster ovens to 450°F or 500°F, depending on the temperature range available. We only kept the garlic bread in the toaster ovens until the optimal color and texture was achieved. The broiling time ranged from one minute to two minutes and 30 seconds.</p>
<p>While the cooking times varied, the cooking results of all of our finalists were nearly identical. Each toaster oven successfully produced a slice of garlic bread with melted butter, crisp edges, and a soft interior.</p>
<p><strong>Frozen pizza</strong></p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/pizza-animation.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>To kill two birds with one stone, we decided to evaluate our finalists’ ability to bake a pizza and cook frozen food in a single test. We chose to conduct our comprehensive test with frozen pizza. Our goal was to thoroughly defrost and heat the pizza so the cheese was melted and gooey and crust was browned and crispy.</p>
<p>We used the preprogrammed pizza function on the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XBOXVIA/?tag=ybdoven-20">Breville</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003Z34OME/?tag=ybdoven-20">Oster</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005RRBMVW/?tag=ybdoven-20">Waring</a> and<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E07D76S/?tag=ybdoven-20"> Panasonic</a> and the two new models, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0AWSJX/?tag=ybdoven-20">Cuisinart &#8211; Chef’s Convection</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07T3J3B13/?tag=ybdoven-20">KitchenAid &#8211; KCO211BM</a>. For the toaster ovens that did not have a pizza function, we used their bake function and preheated them to 400°F as the pizza packaging instructed.</p>
<p>The pizza setting works similarly to baking as it distributes heat from above and below the rack. We also followed the packaging’s instructions to bake the pizza for 16 to 18 minutes. The Panasonic cooked the pizza in 12 minutes and the Cuisinart and KitchenAid in 15 minutes.</p>
<p>The cooking results for our frozen pizza test were identical to our garlic bread test in its uniformity. In our first review, each toaster oven fully cooked the pizza with minimal variations in browning the crust. In this update, both the Cuisinart and KitchenAid performed similarly, although the pizza crust that was cooked in the KitchenAid was somewhat flabby.</p>
<p><strong>Cupcakes</strong></p>
<p>Since baking is a cooking function that can be used on almost any food item, we decided to test it on more than one. First, we brainstormed through the baked goods options, and to satisfy our sweet cravings, we chose to bake cupcakes using the Betty Crocker Super Moist Yellow Cake Mix. The goal was to produce cupcakes that were light in density, moist in texture, and even in color.</p>
<p>On the bake setting, the heat source comes from above and below the food. As instructed by the packaging, each toaster oven was preheated to 325°F and each timer was set to 12 minutes. They all produced essentially the same results in density, texture, and color, but the shape of the cupcakes varied.</p>
<p>Baking cupcakes also gave us an opportunity to see how the convection mode compared to the normal mode. This test was where the Breville and Cuisinart toaster ovens excelled as their convection baking produced the lightest, moistest cupcakes. In our 2019 testing, the Cuisinart &#8211; Chef’s Convection gave us perfect cupcakes as well.</p>
<p><strong>Baked potato</strong></p>
<p>For our final test subject, we needed to ensure that we covered the wide range of food that people use their toaster ovens for. We decided to bake potatoes, the item opposite of cupcakes on the density spectrum. The goal was to achieve a baked potato that had crispy skin but was soft through and through.</p>
<p>Using the bake function, we preheated our finalists to 425°F and set our timers for 45 minutes. Once again, the results were the same across the board. Our forks and knives were met with minimal resistance.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>

<p>The design of the toaster oven goes beyond how much space it will take and how it will look in your kitchen. While the aesthetic appeal can only be determined subjectively, we took it upon ourselves to judge the build and functionality presented by each model’s design.</p>
<p>The convection toaster ovens weigh significantly more than the others. The Waring is the heaviest at 22.8 pounds, nearly triple the weight of the Panasonic and BLACK+DECKER, which tied for the lightest at 7.5 pounds. While the weight difference accounts for the size, material, and addition of the fan and exhaust, the heaviness of the toaster ovens translates to the heaviness of the doors and their ability to insulate the heat. Among our finalists, the Breville had the heaviest, sturdiest door.</p>
<p>To evaluate functionality, we looked at the controls and displays. The toaster ovens were split evenly on whether they featured dial or touchpad controls, but every model featured digital displays except for the Black+Decker and the Hamilton Beach. By omitting this feature, they made it more difficult for us to set accurate times and temperatures.</p>
<h3>Other features</h3>
<p>Finally, we considered every other feature that our finalists advertised and how they benefited the user experience. We judged each toaster oven carefully on how simple the instructions were and how easy the model was to use. We considered how much effort was required for the crumb trays to be removed and cleaned as well as how effective they were in collecting food debris.</p>
<p>We looked at timer and temperature range. We took into account the presence of an interior light and the effectiveness of a nonstick interior. We evaluated how clear the displays were to see, how difficult the buttons were to push and how smooth the dials were to turn.

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XBOXVIA/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BOV845BSS Smart Oven Pro</a> proved to be the superior choice in almost every way. We say “almost every way” because when we tested the toasting function, the toast produced uneven shading after three minutes, which was the median toasting time among our finalists. While both sides were identical (sans grate marks), the toast got gradually darker towards the top. However, since most of the toaster ovens yielded the same results, we would recommend a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-toaster/">slot toaster</a> for optimal toast.</p>

<p>The Breville toaster oven boasts the highest wattage at 1800 watts, which boosted its preheat speed despite its large size. Once it was hot and ready, the Breville performed every other cooking function successfully. While the cooking results of all of the models were similar across the board, its convection mode pushed it past the rest. Appearance-wise, the cupcakes were an even yellow and had perfectly rounded tops, and with just one bite, we also determined that the cupcakes were more airy and moist than the rest.</p>
<p>The Breville toaster oven proved itself as the latest in technological advancement and the greatest in thoughtful design. Ultimately, the multitude of features is what makes it the clear winner.</p>
<p>The interior light is bright enough to get a clear visualization of its contents. The LCD display employs a sans serif font and a soft blue or orange backlight that is easy on the eyes. There are three separate easy-to-use dials: function, temperature and time.</p>
<p>The auto shut-off feature is an added benefit for anyone who has a habit of being forgetful or leaving their food unattended. The auto-eject rack is a luxury, but makes your food more easily accessible and lowers the chance of accidental burns. In addition to the clearly marked buttons and dials, the glass door provides indications for where you should place your wire rack for each cooking function.</p>

    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/breville-auto-eject.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Combining all of these user-friendly features, the Breville toaster oven was clearly designed with the customer in mind. The average consumer could painlessly operate the Breville using his or her intuition alone. For those who prefer to read the instructions, the easy-to-read instruction book is comprehensive and includes several bonus recipes. There is also a one-year limited product warranty.</p>
<p>Even before cooking anything, the Breville was stunning just to look at. The brushed stainless steel gave it a sharp, sleek look that made all of its competitors pale in comparison aesthetically. Along with the traditional wire rack, the toaster came with an enamel broiling rack, an enamel baking pan and a nonstick pizza pan. The remarkable quality of material and craftsmanship is in the price tag. As demonstrated by the Breville&#8217;s price tag, these luxuries come at a price.</p>
<p>The design closely mimicked that of a conventional oven and so did the size. At 0.5 cubic feet, it can fit up to six slices of bread and a 13-inch pizza. The capacity, along with the 10 pre-set cooking functions, makes the Breville the most versatile toaster oven we tested. The cooking functions include toast, bagel, bake, roast, broil, pizza, cookies, reheat warm and slow cook, and the convection fan can be turned on at any time whereas other models solely offer convection baking.</p>
<p>In addition, with a new technology developed by Breville called Element IQ, there are five independent heating elements that are controlled to accommodate whatever you are cooking. Once you choose a cooking function, the power is automatically funneled to where it is needed most, delivering the optimal amount of heat at the perfect time for precision cooking.</p>
<p>Swayed by the luxurious design that complements any high-end kitchen and the unparalleled functionality that provides the greatest user experience, we concluded that the Breville Smart Oven Pro was our pick for best overall.</p>

<p>Since our previous review, our pick for runner-up was the Cuisinart &#8211; TOB-135, which was subsequently updated to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M65AOK1/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TOB-135N</a>. There was no visible difference between the two models; however, Cuisinart recently released the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0AWSJX/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TOB-260N1 &#8211; Chef’s Convection</a>, and except for a couple of minor details, we found it to be very similar to the Breville and a worthy competitor.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart doesn’t have the Breville’s sleek curves, and it’s actually a bit bigger than the Breville, so this isn’t the toaster oven for a small kitchen with limited counter space. It has the same 1800 wattage and capacity, easily accommodating a 13-inch pizza, a standard cupcake tin or six pieces of toast.</p>

<p>Breville has also updated the model we reviewed and now has 12 instead of 10 programmed functions. The Cuisinart ups the number of functions to 15, including a “speed convection” function and an innovative “dual cook” function. The dual cook function allows you to program two modes of cooking &#8212; for example, slow-cooking followed by browning &#8212; for two different times.</p>
<p>The speed convection super-heats the oven to the programmed temperature in seconds, so you don’t have to wait to preheat the oven before putting food in. We programmed the pizza function, which is pre-set at 450℉ for 15 minutes, and the oven heated to 450℉ in 45 seconds.</p>
<p>Exactly like the Breville, the oven is programmed with an LED panel that has a menu selection for cooking modes, including one for warming up leftovers. The toast, bagel and waffle functions give you the option to choose shade and number of slices. We tested three different toast shades, from lightest to darkest, and all were evenly colored with no burnt or under-toasted edges.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart doesn’t have the handy built-in auto-eject rack like the Breville, but it does have two door hooks that latch onto the upper rack and pull it out when the door opens. The Cuisinart comes with the same extras as the Breville: two racks, an enameled broiler rack and baking pan and pizza stone, which produced a great pizza with crispy crust.</p>
<p>Although the Cuisinart is a bit bulkier and heavier, it offers almost identical features and performance as the Breville, but it’s one-third the price. If you’ve got the kitchen space and don’t mind a less esthetic design, the Cuisinart &#8211; TOB-260N1 is an excellent option.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Cuisinart &#8211; TOB-260N1 has all of the same features as the Breville, but it’s one-third less expensive.</li>
<li>Its innovative “dual cook” function allows you to program two different cooking modes and cooking times all at once.</li>
<li>The Cuisinart’s “speed convection” function heats up the oven to the desired temperature in seconds, eliminating preheating.</li>

<p>At a very budget-friendly price point, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GGFHH4U/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BLACK+DECKER &#8211; TO1313SBD</a> is the perfect choice for anyone cooking on a budget. This toaster was in fact about 1/8th and 1/3rd the cost of our other winners. While the price tag is reflected in the design, the black and stainless steel finish make it suitable for just about any kitchen. The quality of materials is lacking, which is evident in how easily it can scratch, but this has no effect on its performance.</p>

<p>The ultra-light seven and a half pound appliance can accommodate up to four slices of bread and a nine-inch pizza, which is the perfect size for the average toaster oven user.</p>
<p>With 1150 watts, the BLACK+DECKER is one of the slower toaster ovens, but it yields the same cooking results in the end. During testing, it did not stand out with any particular food, but it performed well. The BLACK+DECKER was able to produce crispy toast, melted cheese and soft cupcakes.</p>

<p>The three dials control the temperature, cooking function and timer. While the timer dial turns easily, the temperature and cooking function dials are slightly more difficult. The BLACK+DECKER provides four pre-set cooking functions: bake, broil, toast and warm.</p>
<p>The crumb tray is only accessible once the door is open. Since the door is light and opens easily, removing the crumb tray is quick and painless. The toaster oven also comes with a baking pan and broil rack. The instruction manual is a pamphlet that unfolds to one large piece of paper.</p>
<p>The most budget-friendly option amongst our finalists, the BLACK+DECKER 4-Slice does the trick without breaking the bank.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The BLACK+DECKER toaster oven is perfectly sized for the average individual.</li>
<li>It uses the least amount of energy at 1150 watts.</li>
<li>There are four pre-set cooking functions: bake, broil, toast and warm.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cuisinart &#8211; TOB-135</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4246 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cuisinart-runner-up.jpg" alt="Cuisinart convection runner up" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cuisinart-runner-up.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cuisinart-runner-up-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cuisinart-runner-up-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cuisinart-runner-up-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cuisinart-runner-up-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cuisinart-runner-up-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cuisinart-runner-up-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cuisinart-runner-up-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cuisinart-runner-up-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Although the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E9HR7KG/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; TOB-135</a> is no longer our runner-up, we still love this very capable toaster oven. This oven is a fraction of the price of the Breville we reviewed and it goes for a similar look and feel. With a capacity of 0.33 cubic feet, it includes a broiling rack and baking pan and can accommodate six slices of bread, a 12-inch pizza, or a four-pound chicken.</p>
<p>It is one of the most versatile toaster ovens with nine preset cooking functions: toast, bagel, warm, bake, broil, reheat, defrost, convection bake and convection broil. The instruction and recipe booklet is well-written and simple to follow.</p>
<p>A formidable size, the Cuisinart also boasts a high 1800 watts in order to preheat quickly and cook effectively. The cooking results of the Cuisinart were nearly identical to the Breville. While toast evenness was not achieved, all of the other food items succeeded as expected. When we tested the convection mode, it produced exceptionally light, moist cupcakes compared to the other finalists.</p>

    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cusinart-led-screen.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The Cuisinart toaster oven also employs many features that promote a positive user experience. The buttons are easy to press and allow you to choose which aspect of cooking you want to control, including shade, temperature and timer. The selector is a dial that is easy to turn and highlights the buttons below if they&#8217;re available for your selected function allowing you to adjust values quickly.</p>
<p>The LCD digital display utilizes a soft blue backlight that prevents eyestrain. The auto shut-off is a convenient feature for multi-taskers who can’t always reach their food immediately. The crumb tray is easily accessible from the outside of the toaster oven.</p>
<p>While the brushed stainless steel is virtually the same, the clean, modern design remains second to our top pick. Sporting a more approachable price tag without sacrificing the sharp look or any important features, the Cuisinart Deluxe Convection claimed the runner-up spot.</p>
<h3>KitchenAid &#8211; KCO211BM</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25137" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenaid-toaster-oven-solo.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1335" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenaid-toaster-oven-solo-1000x668@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenaid-toaster-oven-solo-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenaid-toaster-oven-solo-768x513.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenaid-toaster-oven-solo-885x591.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenaid-toaster-oven-solo-180x120@2x.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenaid-toaster-oven-solo-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenaid-toaster-oven-solo-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenaid-toaster-oven-solo-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenaid-toaster-oven-solo-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenaid-toaster-oven-solo-1000x668.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenaid-toaster-oven-solo-320x214.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenaid-toaster-oven-solo-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenaid-toaster-oven-solo-885x591@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenaid-toaster-oven-solo-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenaid-toaster-oven-solo-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenaid-toaster-oven-solo-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenaid-toaster-oven-solo-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kitchenaid-toaster-oven-solo-320x214@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>For this 2019 update, we tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07T3J3B13/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KCO211BM</a>, the company’s newest toaster oven. The KitchenAid has nine programmed settings that are the same as the other toaster ovens we tested. One function we hadn’t seen before is the program specifically for baking cookies. In this mode, the KitchenAid works like a convection (which it is not) and distributes heat evenly from top to bottom. We tested this function by baking cupcakes, and results were identical to the cupcakes we baked in the convection toaster ovens.</p>
<p>In fact, although the KitchenAid took a little longer to bake, its performance matched our budget pick, the BLACK+DECKER. Two design flaws, however, knocked it down in our rating. It’s on the expensive side, about $50 less than the Cuisinart, but it has only two slots for racks, as opposed to the Cuisinart’s four.</p>
<p>We found that the upper rack was too high, and the lower rack was too low, so we needed to move food between them to prevent over- or under-cooking. The second issue we had was with the KitchenAid’s internal capacity. It’s about the same size as the Breville, but we could not fit a standard-size cupcake tin inside.</p>

<h3>Oster &#8211; 6-Slice Counter Top Oven</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003Z34OME/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oster 6-Slice Counter Top Oven</a> is the largest toaster oven that we tested, with the ability to fit six slices of bread, a 12-inch pizza and a whole chicken. It provides six different pre-set cooking functions along with its convection mode. While its convection fan didn’t yield cupcakes as light and moist as our top two choices, the Oster was one of the two toaster ovens to produce evenly shaded toast.</p>
<p>The interior light provides decent visibility of the food. The touchpad controls are easy to navigate and the crumb tray is easy to access. The black and stainless steel design gives it a moderate aesthetic appeal.</p>
<h3>Waring &#8211; TCO650</h3>
<p><em>(Editor&#8217;s note: The Waring &#8211; TCO650 is no longer available on Amazon, but it can be purchased directly from the <a href="http://www.waringpro.com/catalog.php?pcID=135&amp;product_id=506" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Waring site</a>.)</em></p>
<p>The Waring &#8211; TCO650 Pro Digital Convection Oven is the heaviest toaster oven on our list. Weighing 22.8 pounds, it can cook up to six slices of pizza or a 12-inch pizza at once. Powered by 1500 watts, it can perform five different pre-set cooking functions. The Waring was the other toaster oven that succeeded in producing evenly shaded toast, but when it came to the convection cooking test, its cupcakes were also not as airy and spongy as our top two picks.</p>
<p>The design is somewhat dated, but the black and stainless steel makes it moderately attractive. It lacks an interior light, but the simple, clearly marked buttons and dial selector are redeeming qualities.</p>
<h3>Panasonic &#8211; NG-B110P</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E07D76S/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; NG-B110P Flash Xpress Toaster Oven</a> is the most unique finalist. While it is made of stainless steel like the others, it is the only white and square toaster oven. With 1300 watts and infrared technology, it is the most powerful toaster oven without convection cooking. In all of the tests, it led in cooking speed, and in turn, it had a tendency to brown all of the food items too quickly. The speed demon offers some interesting pre-set cooking functions: toast, waffle, roll, pizza, hash browns, reheat.</p>
<p>With useful features like an interior light, nonstick interior and auto-eject rack, it is also the most impressive toaster oven without convection cooking. However, Panasonic’s inefficient design is where it fell short. You cannot adjust the time or temperature for any of the preset settings, and when you can, you have to commit to the tedious task of excessive button-pushing because of its lack of a dial.</p>
<h3>Hamiton Beach &#8211; 31344D</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AO24YX8/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 31344D Easy Reach Oven</a> is the adult version of the Easy Bake Oven. The gray color and curved design distinguish it from its competitors and with a sliding door that you push upwards from the bottom, it lives up to its name. The lightweight toaster oven uses 1200 watts and can accommodate four slices of bread and a 9-inch pizza.</p>
<p>It performed well in the garlic bread, frozen pizza and baked potato tests, but it did not produce even toast or rounded cupcake tops The Hamilton Beach is notable in its simplicity with three basic cooking functions and two dials to control the temperature and time.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The toaster oven is an all-in-one product that can perform any number of cooking functions efficiently and effectively. A good toaster oven provides a household with simple user experience and convenient cooking method.</p>
<p>Our pick for the best toaster oven is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XBOXVIA/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville Smart Oven Pro</a> because of its style, usability and versatility. Its features made operating it a breeze, and the pre-set cooking functions made for endless possibilities.</p>
<p>We also recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0AWSJX/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; TOB-260N1 Chef&#8217;s Convection</a>, which has the same features as the Breville, but it&#8217;s one-third less expensive.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re on a tight budget or have limited counter space, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GGFHH4U/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BLACK+DECKER &#8211; TO1313SBD</a> is a great choice. This lightweight, low wattage four-slice toaster oven performs just as well as its pricier counterparts.</p>
