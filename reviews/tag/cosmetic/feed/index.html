<p>Before deciding on which mascaras to test, we read up on the science and design of mascara. We researched mascara formulas, the importance of the brush and wiper (the inside lip of the bottle that determines how much product is left on the applicator) design and whether or not there’s a major difference between designer and drugstore mascaras (spoiler alert: it has nothing to do with the formula).</p>
<p>Once we understood the mechanics of mascara, and which features produce which desired effect, we delved into the consumer side of things. Mascara is one of the most-loved products, used by <a href="https://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/formulating/category/color/Elevating-Mascaras-Formulating-Must-have-Lash-Effects-506459671.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">59 percent of female consumers</a>. What do consumers want most when choosing a mascara?</p>
<p>While washable mascara may be better for daily wear, some women have a personal preference for waterproof mascara. It’s more durable, and it’s better for a hot climate. We curated several waterproof mascaras to test in our roundup of finalists.</p>
<p>We looked at trends reported by <a href="https://www.mintel.com/press-centre/beauty-and-personal-care/global-colour-cosmetics-sales-to-exceed-us-48bn-as-mintel-identifies-4-growth-areas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mintel’s global beauty analysts</a>. We found that the industry is shifting towards natural and organic products, based on demand by consumers for environmentally-friendly products. The downside is that many of the natural mascaras do little to enhance lashes. We made sure to include several natural choices in the finalists we tested.</p>
<p>Our top pick for a natural mascara, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GC62MNF/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TetyanaNaturals &#8211; 4D Silk Fiber Lash</a>, impressed us with its ability to make lashes longer, bolder and more defined.</p>
<p>Then, we narrowed down specific mascaras, gathering information via consumer reviews on Sephora and Ulta. Due to concerns about counterfeit products (more on that later), we put less weight on Amazon reviews. Once we curated a list of the 35 best mascaras, we used eleven staff testers to wear, remove and rate them.</p>

<h3>Are designer brands really better than drugstore brands?</h3>
<p>Nearly all mascaras use the same basic ingredients: wax, carbon-black or colored pigments and film formers to coat lashes and help the pigment stick. Waterproof mascaras contain additional waxes (since waxes repel water), isododecane and cyclopentasiloxane to prevent pigment from running down your cheeks.</p>
<p>One exception to the basic wax-pigment formula would be fiber mascaras, which use tiny fibers made of silk, nylon or rayon to temporarily lengthen lashes. The product (and resulting length) is washed away at the end of the night. If extreme length is a feature you desire, you may want to go beyond looking at brush design and consider a fiber mascara.</p>
<p>Claims of benefits from vitamins or botanical extracts in certain formulas are usually just for marketing purposes. The basic combination of wax and pigment make up the majority of the formula, and these ingredients are at low percentages that make little difference.</p>
<p>The magic happens when the brush, formula and wiper work together to create a certain look (be it more volume or more definition). Some brands even use the same formula, but a unique brush, wiper and bottle design yields dramatically different results.</p>
<p>Let’s break down the anatomy of a mascara:</p>
<p><strong>Brush:</strong> These can be made of nylon or plastic bristles. The number of the bristles and their spacing, even the way the bristles are twisted and trimmed, can make a difference in the outcome. For example, bristles that are finely spaced will give more definition. Bristles that are further apart will give you thicker lashes with more volume.</p>
<p>Each brush is carefully designed by the manufacturer. Brands spend a large amount of money to patent their brushes, which goes to show that the design of the applicator is just as, if not more, important than the formula.</p>
<p><strong>Wiper:</strong> The wiper is the plastic ring inside the mouth of the tube. It impacts the performance of the mascara by wiping off excess formula. A wiper that is too tight will remove most of the formula before you get a chance to apply it. A wiper that is too large will result in clumpy lashes that dry slowly and tend to smudge. Mascaras with adjustable wipers allow you to determine how much mascara you want to leave on the brush, less for definition and more for a dramatic look.</p>
<p>Since the applicator design is the major component of a mascara’s performance, the amount of money a brand pours into the design of a bottle and wiper can make a difference in the end result. So even though the formulas in drugstore and designer mascaras are essentially the same, the designer mascaras we tested ranked higher overall than the drugstore versions.</p>
<p>However, choosing the right mascara doesn’t mean you need to make a large investment. Many of the drugstore mascaras we tested were low-rated by our panel of testers. Yet a drugstore mascara, the Neutrogena &#8211; Healthy Lengths, easily rivals its designer counterparts.</p>
<h3>How to choose the right mascara</h3>

<p>It can be tempting to stroll into a beauty store to try out a mascara before you buy, especially since the high-end designer brands can be expensive. However, testing in stores isn’t recommended. Since the brush and wiper play a major part in the final results, the disposable wand doesn’t give you an accurate assessment of the mascara. Also, other testers may have double-dipped, so there’s no guarantee the wand is free of bacteria.</p>
<p>Your best option is to focus on which brush style fits your needs, which we’ll detail in the next section.</p>
<h4>For sensitive eyes</h4>
<p>Even if a mascara claims to be opthamologist tested, you should always check to see if it causes you sensitivity by testing it on your arm first. If you do have a reaction, you don’t want to find out when it’s already left your eyes inflamed and bloodshot. Mascara gets the closest to the eyeball of any makeup, so it’s the most likely to be a culprit for dermatitis or allergies.</p>
<p>If you have sensitive eyes, you’ll want to steer away from waterproof mascaras. The ingredients that make these formulas waterproof or water resistant can dry out your lashes and cause them to fall out over time. This process is hastened when you sleep with mascara on, which happens more often with waterproof mascara because it can be difficult to remove.</p>
<p>You may also need to avoid mascaras with extension fibers or colored pigments; the fewer ingredients, the less likely the mascara is to cause irritation. That doesn’t mean you have to give up lashes with staying power: <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-magnetic-eyelashes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">magnetic lashes</a> are a great option for a natural day look or a night on the town.</p>
<p>No matter which mascara you choose, you should replace your mascara every three months. The more times you use a tube, the more potential it has to be infected with bacteria that can lead to irritation or eye infection.</p>
<p>If you’re hesitant to discard your mascara so frequently, you may feel better knowing there’s a <a href="https://www.appalachianwild.org/wands-for-wildlife.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wildlife organization</a> that wants your used wands to help save the lives of animals.</p>
<h3>Brush styles</h3>

<p><strong>Classic:</strong> These are best for volume and separation. If the style of wand has thicker bristles, it will give your lashes even more volume. A plastic bristle brush will give you more definition and less clumping than a nylon bristle brush.</p>
<p><strong>Hourglass:</strong> If you want lashes so dramatic they look like falsies, an hourglass shape can provide tons of volume while also lifting your lashes.</p>
<p><strong>Tapered:</strong> Also known as a cone brush, the thinner end helps you reach the small lashes toward the inner and outer corners of your eye.</p>
<p><strong>Inverted cone:</strong> If you want a wide-eyed look with volume and length, this brush will help you reach your goals. The smaller bristles grab onto the root of your lashes, pulling them upwards and outwards.</p>
<p><strong>Pointed:</strong> This wand has a dual use for full coverage. You can apply it as you normally would on the outer lashes. Then you can turn it and use the pointed end to lengthen.</p>
<p><strong>Curved:</strong> The main purpose of a curved brush is to curl your lashes. It mimics the natural curl of the lashes, hugging your lashes from the waterline to the tip. To add even more curl and prevent drooping, start with an eyelash curler and coat with a waterproof formula.</p>
<p><strong>Comb:</strong> If you have short and thin lashes, this type of wand will help grab and coat individual lashes without clumping.</p>
<p><strong>Skinny:</strong> This is another style for those with shorter lashes. A skinny brush helps coat lashes from the very root, giving your lashes more definition and making them appear longer.</p>
<p><strong>Jumbo:</strong> On the opposite end of the spectrum is the jumbo brush, which is best for thickening. It can give you thicker and fuller lashes in half the time of other brush styles.</p>
<p><strong>Rectangle:</strong> This style is best for volume and length, as the bristles stretch and pull your lashes to greater heights. The downside is it won’t easily reach the smaller lashes at the corners of your eye.</p>
<p><strong>Spiral:</strong> If you want curl, but also volume, this brush gives you the best of both worlds. It lifts the lashes as you roll, without losing out on any volume.</p>
<p><strong>Ball:</strong> Larger brushes don’t always reach the root of the lash, so if your lashes are blond or fair, you may want to consider a mascara with a ball brush. It concentrates on a few lashes at a time, for root to tip coverage and can coat all the lashes that traditional brushes have trouble reaching.</p>
<p><strong>Miniature:</strong> It may seem extra, but if you want a whole mascara just for your bottom lashes, there’s a brush for that. Paired with a long wear formula, you can avoid smudging using one of these super small brushes.</p>

<p>Counterfeit products made big news in 2017 when <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/amazon-recalls-potentially-hazardous-solar-eclipse-glasses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon recalled</a> thousands of eclipse glasses that could not be verified as authentic. Just as it can be hazardous to look directly at the sun without proper eye protection, counterfeit is also a concern with beauty products. It can be dangerous to apply counterfeit products to your hair or skin.</p>
<p>Thirty-four percent of beauty consumers <a href="https://www.allure.com/story/how-to-avoid-buying-counterfeit-beauty-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered they were using a fake</a> after having a bad reaction. Not only could you be applying toxic metals such as arsenic or mercury to your skin, you don’t know what other kinds of illegal operations you are funding.</p>
<p>Even though both brands and online marketplaces take measures to keep counterfeits off the market, it’s still a good idea to be aware when shopping online. That doesn’t mean you should never buy products online, but you should protect yourself by using the following tips to avoid purchasing (and applying) counterfeit beauty products:</p>
<ul>
<li>The only way to be absolutely sure you’re getting the real deal is to buy directly from the company’s website or official retailer.</li>
<li>If you order from an online marketplace such as Amazon or Walmart, avoid third-party vendors (sellers other than the brand or authorized retailer). Check the seller’s name next to the “ships from and sold by” information.</li>
<li>If the price seems too good to be true, you should be cautious. Verify the current retail price on the brand’s website or their authorized dealers (often found on the brand’s site). Even a small discount may be an indication that it’s a fake.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once we had our 35 mascara finalists in hand, we tested each mascara using a panel of 11 women of varying ages, ethnicities and beauty routines. We conducted tests for sensitivity, performance and wearability and how easily the mascaras were removed at the end of the day.</p>
<h3>The skin patch test</h3>
<p>Before our testers put the wands to their eyes, they patch-tested the product on their inner forearm in the morning. We asked them to use a cotton swab to swipe excess product from the base of the wand, then dab it on their skin. They covered it with an adhesive bandage and then checked it for redness at the end of the day.</p>
<p>None of our mascara finalists caused an allergic reaction on any of our eleven testers. However, since the experience is subjective (for example, those who wear contacts or are prone to allergies are more susceptible), there’s no guarantee these mascaras won’t make your eyes itchy or watery. You should always do your own patch-test first.</p>
<h3>The performance test</h3>
<p>In order to gain insight into the effect of each mascara on different peoples&#8217; lashes, we had our testers wear their designated mascaras for a 12-hour period. Our testers applied the mascara at 9 am and wore it until 9 pm. Immediately after applying mascara, they rated it on a scale of one to five (with five as best) on the following metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>How evenly the mascara applies</li>
<li>How well it defines and separates</li>
<li>How much volume it adds</li>
<li>The length of the lashes after application</li>
</ul>
<p>Later in the day, they reported on the following metrics using the same scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the mascara flakes</li>
<li>Whether the mascara smudges or runs</li>
<li>Whether the mascara is heavy or sticky</li>
<li>Whether the lashes are crunchy or remain soft</li>
<li>How well the mascara lasts through the day</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we averaged the ratings to see which mascaras performed best across the board. Mascaras often focus on one attribute, such as extreme volume or extreme length. This process allowed us to find the mascaras that did it all: providing volume, length and definition while remaining clump and smudge free.</p>
<p>While some of us may desire lift and others live for lengthening, the <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/eyes-to-kill-mascara-P393671" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giorgio Armani &#8211; Eyes to Kill</a> ranked high in every category, making it an ideal choice for most consumers. The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GC62MNF/?tag=ybdlash-20">TetyanaNaturals &#8211; 4D Silk Fiber Lash</a> was a close second, making it an excellent option if you desire length along with definition and don’t have a sensitivity to fiber extensions.</p>
<p>Another top contender for a mascara that doesn’t skimp on volume, definition or length is the M.A.C. &#8211; In Extreme Dimension Lash. However, it didn’t rank in the highest averages because it tends to be sticky after application and crunchy when it dries, while our top finalists left our lashes soft and fluttery.</p>
<p>Long lash lovers will appreciate the TetyanaNaturals &#8211; 4D Silk Fiber Lash, INIKI Organic &#8211; Long Lash Vegan, Too Faced &#8211; Better Than Sex and <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/diorshow-waterproof-mascara-P99901" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dior &#8211; Diorshow Waterproof</a>.</p>
<p>If you are looking for more volume, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ADRGV26/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neutrogena &#8211; Healthy Lengths</a> and M.A.C. &#8211; In Extreme Dimension Lash make lashes appear thicker without sacrificing definition. The Giorgio Armani &#8211; Eyes to Kill and Too Faced &#8211; Better Than Sex Waterproof are also extreme volume-boosters.</p>
<p>Those that want every lash to stand out will appreciate the TetyanaNaturals &#8211; 4D Silk Fiber Lash and Neutrogena &#8211; Healthy Lengths.</p>
<h3>The removability test</h3>
<p>The harder it is for a mascara to remove, the more tempting it is to go to bed with it still on our eyes. We all know it’s a terrible habit that stains your pillowcases and your cheeks, but you may become more disciplined once you learn that crashing with your mascara still on can contribute to blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelid that leaves your eyes looking greasy and crusted).</p>
<p>Some mascaras we expect to be harder to remove; the same ingredients that make a waterproof mascara stay all day make it more difficult to take off at night. But no one wants a mascara that fades by five o’clock and still requires some tugging to remove.</p>
<p>We had our testers gently wipe Cetaphil makeup remover wipes over their eyes after wearing their mascara for a 12-hour period. We asked them to count the number of wipes needed to fully remove mascara and then rate the mascara as easy or difficult to remove.</p>
<p>The vast majority of our finalists were easy or moderately easy to remove with the wipes. Notably, the Too Faced &#8211; Better Than Sex Waterproof, Maybelline &#8211; Full N&#8217; Soft Waterproof and Dior &#8211; Diorshow Waterproof were easy to remove, despite their waterproof capability.</p>
<p>The fiber mascaras, TetyanaNaturals &#8211; 4D Silk Fiber Lash, AsaVea &#8211; 4D Silk Fiber Eyelash and Thrive Causemetics &#8211; Liquid Lash Extensions, were easy enough to remove from the lashes but the extending fibers would clump and ball and stick to the cheeks.</p>
<p>The Buxom &#8211; Lash Waterproof, Essence &#8211; Lash Princess False Lash Effect and M.A.C. &#8211; In Extreme Dimension Lash all had great staying power, but were difficult to remove before bed.</p>

<p>The fat asymmetrical brush and blend of hard and soft waxes makes the <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/eyes-to-kill-mascara-P393671" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giorgio Armani &#8211; Eyes to Kill</a> a jack-of-all-trades mascara. This mascara is great for someone who wants big lashes and doesn’t want to have to watch a YouTube tutorial to make it happen.</p>
<p>The Giorgio Armani is a designer mascara, and it’s on the higher end of the price range of the finalists we tested. Even with blind-testing our mascaras to avoid bias, the Giorgio Armani emerged as the highest-rated mascara by our panel of testers.</p>
<p>It’s not too dry or too wet, and it glides through lashes easily. It has a Goldilocks sized wiper, so it leaves the right amount of product on the brush. That means that you can swipe it quickly and have big, bad lashes, but it doesn’t leave you with clumps.</p>
<p>We loved the buildable volume; one coat is perfect for a natural day look. Thanks to the oversized bristle weave brush, this mascara goes on faster than others. Since it gives you full and even coverage with just a swipe, you can apply it while multitasking in the morning (meaning you can get big, fluttery lashes before your toddler tips the cereal bowl all over his clean shirt).</p>
<p>You can ramp it up in the evening with two coats for a false lash effect. It lifts lashes and doesn’t droop or wear off, so even if you are making a quick transition between work and a night out, you can leave the tube at home and feel confident your lashes are still long, thick and lifted.</p>

<p>Contact wearers will rejoice that it doesn’t leave a film on the lens or flake into the eyes, making it comfortable for a 12-hour stretch. It has only minimal smudging, so you don’t end up with mascara on your cheeks, even after a full day of wear.</p>
<p>Another top rated mascara that we recommend as an excellent overall choice is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004UY9HLA/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M.A.C. &#8211; In Extreme Dimension Lash</a>. It leaves lashes crunchier than our top pick and is more difficult to remove, but the volume, length and definition will have you batting your lashes all day.</p>

<p>While waterproof mascaras can be notoriously hard on your lashes, the <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/diorshow-waterproof-mascara-P99901" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dior &#8211; Diorshow Waterproof</a> is our top pick for those days when you need your mascara to be extra. It holds up through splashing, swimming and watching your best friend walk down the aisle.</p>
<p>Women who prize long, fat and spidery lashes will especially love the Diorshow. It lifts, lengthens and separates using an extra wide brush with bristles that are grouped closely together. This means you can swipe it through quickly and finish applying without agonizing over every little lash. It has an inky-black pigment that gives your eyes a dramatic appearance, making it a definite go-to for a special occasion.</p>
<p>Our testers reported that the wiper is slightly too tight, so you may need more than one coat to get the right amount of product on your lashes. However, the fat brush gives you an instantly full effect. What the testers loved most is that it isn&#8217;t heavy at all, leaves the lashes very soft and, most importantly, lasts all day with no smudging or flaking.</p>

<p>It’s also easy to remove when you decide to turn in, so you won’t be tempted to sleep with it on overnight.</p>
<p>Another good choice for a waterproof mascara is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GC62MNF/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TetyanaNaturals &#8211; 4D Silk Fiber Lash</a> (which also happens to be our top pick for a natural mascara). We also like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008JVL7PE/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Buxom &#8211; Lash Waterproof</a>, although it does tend to leave lashes crunchier than our top pick.</p>

<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The super wide brush gives you instantly full, fat lashes without clumping, and the formula does not budge all day.</li>
<li>Unlike waterproof mascaras that can leave your lashes crunchy, the Dior &#8211; Diorshow Waterproof gives you soft, lush-looking lashes.</li>
<li>The overall effect of the length, fullness and carbon-black pigment gives you a dramatic and intense look.</li>
<li>Waterproof mascaras can be hard on your lashes, because they require tugging and pulling to remove, but the Diorshow Waterproof removes easily.</li>

<p>If you want long and natural looking lashes without splurging, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ADRGV26/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neutrogena &#8211; Healthy Lengths</a> gives results that rival the more expensive designer options.</p>
<p>If you love the separated lash look, the Neutrogena is your best bet for a drugstore mascara. It has a plastic bristle brush that’s skinny enough to reach the lashes at the corners of the eye. Our testers gave a rating of four out of five to the Neutrogena for length, but a five-out-of-five rating for definition and separation as well as volume. The formula is thin and buildable, so if you want extra length, you can apply more coats of mascara and it won’t cake up on your lashes.</p>
<p>The wiper is just the right size, so the formula applies evenly. It gives you fluttery, soft and separated lashes that last all day without smudging or flaking. If you want to pass yourself off as genetically blessed with good lashes (at a fraction of the price of high-end mascaras), this is the mascara you’ll love best.</p>
<p>One drawback is that the name may be a misnomer, as the <a href="http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/product/684315/Neutrogena_Healthy_Lengths_Mascara/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Environmental Working Group rates this mascara</a> as a six (one is best) in terms of hazardous ingredients. It has the poorest EWG ranking of all our mascara finalists, with fragrance being the main culprit for concern. If you have sensitive eyes or are keen on an environmentally friendly mascara, this may not be the right choice for you. Unless you are sensitive to fragrances, this may be a non issue for you.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GC62MNF/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TetyanaNaturals &#8211; 4D Silk Fiber Lash</a> is a good choice if you want long, bold lashes and don’t have a sensitivity to extending fiber particles (you may want to stay away from this one if you wear contacts as the particles can get into your eyes). It has a cone-shaped brush with plastic bristles, making it a good choice if you want to reach every last lash.</p>
<p>This mascara is waterproof, which makes it an excellent choice for days at the beach or special occasions. The TetyanaNaturals can be difficult to remove and leave fiber particles on your cheeks, so be sure you’re committed to a longer nighttime routine if you purchase this product.</p>
<p>It gets the right amount on the lashes, and applies evenly. However, there is a small trail of product on the tip of the brush, so we find we need to wipe it off before applying to avoid getting product on our cheeks.</p>
<p>If you apply the mascara with a simple swipe, you get natural-looking and well-defined lashes with extra length. We find that if you use a zig-zag motion to apply the mascara (wiggle it back and forth as you swipe upwards), you’ll have a lot more volume with this mascara. So depending on how you apply it, you have multiple options for how your lashes look.</p>
<p>While TetyanaNaturals isn’t rated by the Environmental Working Group (or the Think Dirty app), we researched individual ingredients, and the majority were rated low for concern. Only the last ingredient (triethanolamine) was listed with a moderate concern.</p>

<p>The mascara is also free from any of the dangerous chemicals that you probably don’t want on your face. In comparison, none of the mascaras that are top rated by EWG were as effective as we would like, so despite an official EWG rating, we feel the TetyanaNaturals is a good choice for a natural mascara.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072QGSDPD/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">INIKI Organic &#8211; Long Lash Vegan</a> is well-rated EWG mascara that we would recommend as another good natural choice.</p>

<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Extending fiber particles make the TetyanaNaturals a good choice whether you have short and sparse lashes or are naturally blessed.</li>
<li>The ingredients are listed by the EWG as low to moderate concern for the environment and your health.</li>
<li>This mascara is waterproof and lasts all day without flaking or smudging; however, it can be difficult to remove before bed.</li>
<li>Our testers report how soft and fluttery this lightweight formula leaves their lashes.</li>

<h3>INIKI Organic &#8211; Long Lash Vegan</h3>
<p>If you want a natural mascara that’s big on lengthening and don’t mind a little less volume, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072QGSDPD/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">INIKI Organic &#8211; Long Lash Vegan</a> is a good choice. Our testers remarked on its fluid formula; thicker mascaras can add volume but can also give them a tendency to clump. The wetness of the INIKI mascara ensures a smooth application. Because the lashes are so long and the formula is on the wet side, it can smudge on your eyelids if you don’t give it enough time to dry.</p>
<p>Animal testing isn’t the only thing to look out for when buying vegan-friendly cosmetics. Beeswax is commonly the first or second ingredient in mascaras, but INIKI Organic uses carnauba wax (obtained from the leaves of the Brazilian tropical palm tree).</p>
<h3>Thrive Causemetics &#8211; Liquid Lash Extensions</h3>
<p>If you have short lashes, you’ll appreciate the skinny wand and extending fibers of the <a href="https://thrivecausemetics.com/products/liquid-lash-extensions-mascara" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thrive Causemetics &#8211; Liquid Lash Extensions</a>. This type of brush helps you reach the very root, for longer-appearing lashes. It applies evenly and gives you volume and length, but leaves room for improvement in the area of definition. The Thrive Causemetics is long wearing, although the fibers tend to clump into little balls when you’re trying to remove the mascara at night.</p>
<p>Thrive Causemetics is “Beauty with a Purpose”: for every product purchased, they donate to help a woman thrive.</p>
<h3>Benefit Cosmetics &#8211; Roller Lash</h3>
<p>The curved skinny wand of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07167RSXS/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Benefit Cosmetics &#8211; Roller Lash</a> makes it best for lift and separation, especially if you have short lashes. It earns top marks for adding volume and length. It doesn’t flake, smudge or run and gives you soft-feeling lashes. The Roller Lash leaves the right amount on the wand, so there’s no need to wipe off extra or apply multiple coats, but it does tend to clump on lashes.</p>
<h3>BUXOM &#8211; Lash Volumizing</h3>
<p>The company touts the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K6MHGZY/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BUXOM &#8211; Lash Volumizing</a> brush as an hourglass shape, but our testers feel it functions more as an inverted cone (wider at the top and shorter bristles packed closely together at the bottom).</p>
<p>An hourglass shape is best for volume and lift, while an inverted cone gives you volume and length. Either way, our testers report that it doesn’t give enough volume, perhaps because there is too little product on the brush. What it excels at is making your lashes longer, darker and more lifted. It is durable and lasts all day without smudging or running.</p>
<h3>M.A.C. &#8211; In Extreme Dimension Lash</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004UY9HLA/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M.A.C. &#8211; In Extreme Dimension Lash</a> lost points for making lashes feel heavy and sticky, but it excelled in every other category. In fact, one of our testers was so impressed, she says she’s never using anything else again. The brush is extra long and the bristles are spread out so you can reach every lash. It has a ball tip to get root to tip coverage on each individual lash. On the flip side of all this praise, the M.A.C. is extremely difficult to remove.</p>
<h3>C&#8217;est Moi &#8211; Muse Mascara</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CKMCQJV/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">C&#8217;est Moi &#8211; Muse Mascara</a> is a top scoring natural mascara on EWG, meaning that the ingredients don’t pose any concern for you and the environment. The formula tends to be heavy, but it still leaves lashes soft. There’s no flaking or smudging, and it lasts all day.</p>
<p>The wiper leaves just the right amount of product on the applicator, but even though the brush separates lashes, the formula causes them to stick together again, and you have to work at definition.</p>
<h3>Dior &#8211; Diorshow</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/diorshow-mascara-P396240?skuId=1689744&amp;icid2=mascaras_bestsellers_carousel:p396240" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dior &#8211; Diorshow</a> has a pointed tip on a fat brush, so once you coat all your lashes, you can go back and focus on lengthening. It does leave a little too much product on the brush, so it doesn’t apply as evenly as we would like. We wouldn’t recommend this mascara for achieving volume or flexible lashes, but if you’re looking for definition (and don’t mind a floral scent), this could be a good choice.</p>
<h3>Buxom &#8211; Lash Waterproof</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008JVL7PE/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Buxom &#8211; Lash Waterproof</a> is an excellent runner up to our top pick for a waterproof mascara. It leaves lashes a little too much on the sticky and crunchy side to be our first choice, but it receives high marks across the board for even application, definition, volume and length.<br />
Like the other Buxom mascara we tested, it has an hourglass brush, but the waterproof formula delivers better results in terms of volume.</p>
<h3>Urban Decay &#8211; Perversion</h3>
<p>The fat brush and tight wiper of the <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/perversion-mascara-P387956" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Urban Decay &#8211; Perversion</a> gets just the right amount of product on the brush and applies evenly, but the formula leaves something to be desired. There is little definition, separating or lengthening. It does add volume and lasts all day, so if that’s a priority, you might still consider the Urban Decay.</p>
<h3>Benefit &#8211; They&#8217;re Real!</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/they-re-real-lengthening-volumizing-mascara-P289307?skuId=1343938&amp;icid2=mascaras_all_in_one_carousel:p289307" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benefit &#8211; They&#8217;re Real!</a> has a pointed brush for lengthening, and it really does an incredible job at giving you long, natural-looking lashes. If you were lucky enough to be born with lush lashes, it enhances them. If your lashes are on the shorter and sparser side, the Benefit makes them appear longer and thicker. It stays all day, but is difficult to remove at night. The other downside is that it tends to leave lashes slightly crunchy, rather than fluttery.</p>
<h3>Glossier &#8211; Lash Slick</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.glossier.com/products/lash-slick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glossier &#8211; Lash Slick</a> is fine if you want separation and lengthening, but don’t mind less volume and little definition. The tapered brush helps you get into the corners of the eye, and the wiper leaves the right amount of product on the brush for an even application. There is some slight smudging, and the mascara is less noticeable by evening.</p>
<h3>Hourglass &#8211; Caution Extreme Lash</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/caution-extreme-lash-mascara-P433809" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hourglass &#8211; Caution Extreme Lash</a> has a slightly fatter brush that coats your lashes with the right amount of formula. It applies evenly, but it doesn’t provide the definition, volume or length we are looking for. It has a tendency to smudge, and only lasts halfway through the day.</p>
<h3>Mineral Fusion &#8211; Volumizing Mascara</h3>
<p>The wiper of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CFQFG8/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mineral Fusion &#8211; Volumizing Mascara</a> is tight, so there is little product left on the brush, and it requires multiple coats. If you’re looking for volume or length, you’ll want to steer away from this one, as it leaves a lot to be desired in these areas.</p>
<h3>Too Faced &#8211; Better Than Sex Waterproof</h3>
<p>This brand was the first to come out with the hourglass-shaped brush, which gets every last lash and has been copied by other brands since its arrival on the market. However, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J4KYUJI/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Too Faced &#8211; Better Than Sex Waterproof</a> leaves a little too much product on the brush and therefore tends to smudge. If you want volume and length and can take a little more time to carefully apply your mascara, this is a good one.</p>
<h3>Maybelline &#8211; Lash Sensational</h3>
<p>One tester reported that despite passing the sensitivity test on her arm, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PFCT2R0/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Maybelline &#8211; Lash Sensational</a> irritated her eyes. The wiper is overly large and leaves too much product on the wand, which leads to an uneven application and clumping. It defines but doesn’t separate lashes. It adds volume and length and looks the same at the end of the day as when you first apply it.</p>
<h3>Too Faced &#8211; Better Than Sex</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J4KYUJI/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Too Faced &#8211; Better Than Sex</a> ran into a similar issue as the waterproof formula. Despite the volumizing effects of the hourglass brush, the wiper is too big. This leads to too much product, clumping and sticky lashes that feel crunchy when dry. We do love the staying power and big lashes this mascara gives us!</p>
<h3>Essence &#8211; Lash Princess False Lash Effect</h3>
<p>The best thing about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00T0C9XRK/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Essence &#8211; Lash Princess False Lash Effect</a> is that it doesn’t run, even with teary eyes. It didn’t make it as a contender for top pick, because it leaves too much formula on the lashes. One of our testers found she has to use her finger to get the lashes to separate. It clumps, flakes and doesn’t add enough volume or length to make up for the zealous amount of product.</p>
<h3>theBalm &#8211; Mad Lash</h3>
<p>If lifting is what you want, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D90BYKC/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">theBalm &#8211; Mad Lash</a> delivers with its curved brush. The product applies evenly, but you may need to go over your lashes a few times to get the desired look. It separates well, has decent volume and a good length. It leaves your lashes soft and isn’t heavy, but it does leave little flakes and can get on your lid pretty easily when applying.</p>

<h3>No7 &#8211; Lash Impact Ultra</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0743LTCP3/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">No7 &#8211; Lash Impact Ultra</a> left us feeling a little meh. Despite a tapered brush, this mascara does little to define or separate. It adds an okay amount of volume and length, but wears off by the end of the day and left our lashes looking droopy. The best thing we can say about it is that it doesn’t flake or smudge.</p>
<h3>CoverGirl &#8211; LashBlast Volume</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EMAM9BC/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CoverGirl &#8211; LashBlast Volume</a> has a plump brush with defined bristles, and delivers a little bit extra formula than you need. Because of this, it’s easy to get mascara on the top of your lid when applying but it doesn’t smudge once dry. It gives a little more volume than other drugstore mascaras, but doesn’t do much to lengthen or define. Our testers had to use the tip of the brush to separate lashes.</p>
<h3>Vivienne Sabó &#8211; Cabaret Première</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LYSCW6Z/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vivienne Sabó &#8211; Cabaret Première</a> is a good all-around mascara, although it adds more length than it does volume. It does not apply evenly, has a tendency to clump on the lashes and doesn’t stay put, so there’s some slight smudging throughout the day. In our ratings, this mascara earns an average of four out of five, but it doesn’t have the wow factor.</p>
<h3>Peter Thomas Roth &#8211; Lashes to Die For</h3>
<p>The wiper of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002Q52YKG/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Peter Thomas Roth &#8211; Lashes to Die For</a> could use some minimizing, as it leaves too much product on the brush, causing the mascara to smudge onto our lashes and cheeks. It defines lashes but doesn’t separate them, again because there is too much product. It adds a minimal amount of length and volume, but it does last most of the day.</p>
<h3>L&#8217;Oreal Paris &#8211; Voluminous Butterfly</h3>
<p>The purpose of the wing-tip applicator from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ISP83GM/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">L&#8217;Oreal Paris &#8211; Voluminous Butterfly</a> has an asymmetrical lash line shape to extend and lift corner lashes. It’s also supposed to volumize lashes by reaching the roots and stretching lashes outward, but our testers found it didn’t add any volume. They reported that it only adds a little length, as well. The primary benefits they found are definition and separation. It leaves lashes soft, lasts all day and doesn’t smudge.</p>
<h3>Lancôme &#8211; Définicils</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000UB23YK/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lancôme &#8211; Définicils</a> is overly enthusiastic with its delivery of product, so it does not apply evenly and leaves lashes somewhat crunchy. It has good longevity and stays where it should, but doesn’t do much in the first place to add volume, definition or length.</p>
<h3>AsaVea &#8211; 4D Silk Fiber Eyelash</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L6MWWZL/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AsaVea &#8211; 4D Silk Fiber Eyelash</a> has a tapered plastic bristle brush, so it applies evenly and separates fairly well. It takes a couple of coats to get the desired effect, but the end result is lengthy lashes with some volume and no flaking or smudging. It does have a sticky feel upon application and is slightly crunchy when dry. Like our other fiber mascaras, it is somewhat difficult to remove.</p>
<h3>Milk Makeup &#8211; Kush High Volume</h3>
<p>There was way too much product on the <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/kush-mascara-P429903" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Milk Makeup &#8211; Kush High Volume</a>, to the point where we had to wipe it against the tube. Because of this, it was difficult to apply and lashes clump. It smudges throughout the day for the same reason. The most disappointing part was that for all the extra formula, it does little to add volume or length.</p>
<h3>W3LL People &#8211; Expressionist</h3>
<p>If you’re going for a bare-faced makeup-free look, you’ll appreciate the slight enhancement of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O859WWU/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">W3LL People &#8211; Expressionist</a>. It leaves just the right amount of product on the applicator and separates lashes. Since it doesn’t add much volume, it doesn’t define them as much as it separates. Our testers reported that it is comfortable to wear until it starts to smudge (and it does), then it starts to feel sticky under your bottom lashes.</p>
<h3>Tarte &#8211; Lights, Camera, Lashes</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/lights-camera-lashes-P111902" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tarte &#8211; Lights, Camera, Lashes</a> does little more than darken lashes and tends to wear off by the end of the day. It leaves the right amount of product on the wand and applies evenly, but does little to separate or define. It adds minimal length and volume and flakes during the day.</p>
<h3>CoverGirl &#8211; Clump Crusher</h3>
<p>The curved brush of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0094GHKFE/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CoverGirl &#8211; Clump Crusher</a> makes it good for lifting, and it’s great at applying evenly and giving lashes definition. It doesn’t add volume or length, so it’s a better mascara for those who want lift and a natural look. You may be able to get a little more effect with multiple coats, as the wiper is tight and leaves little product on the brush.</p>
<h3>Marc Jacobs Beauty &#8211; O!Mega Lash Volumizing</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/o-mega-lash-volumizing-mascara-P387034" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marc Jacobs Beauty &#8211; O!Mega Lash Volumizing</a> doesn’t really do much for us in any of the metrics we considered. It delivers the right amount of product, but is just moderate across the board: length, volume and definition were not what we anticipated. The formula is heavy and leaves lashes crunchy when dry. The good news is that it’s easy to remove.</p>
<h3>Maybelline &#8211; Full N&#8217; Soft Waterproof</h3>
<p>Our testers report that the brush of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004OT29MA/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Maybelline &#8211; Full N&#8217; Soft Waterproof</a> feels cheap and flimsy. It delivers the right amount, but you have to use multiple coats for any effect. It doesn’t define or separate unless you use the tip of the brush. It doesn’t feel heavy or sticky, but it won’t last you all day, either.</p>
<h3>IT Cosmetics &#8211; Superhero</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/superhero-elastic-stretch-volumizing-mascara-P411396" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IT Cosmetics &#8211; Superhero</a> was the lowest rated of the mascara finalists we tested. It delivers too much product, so the lashes end up stuck together rather than defined or separated. They feel crunchy when dry, as well. It does add a lot of volume, but very little length.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>We all want something specific when it comes to our lashes, be it a higher lift or longer lashes. However, the <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/eyes-to-kill-mascara-P393671" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giorgio Armani &#8211; Eyes to Kill</a> is a real crowd pleaser and caters to a wide demographic with its ability to volumize, define and lengthen lashes. We consider it a one-size-fits-most mascara with mass appeal, especially since it has enough longevity to last from dawn to dusk and is still easy to remove.</p>
<p>For those who need more staying power, the <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/diorshow-waterproof-mascara-P99901" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dior &#8211; Diorshow Waterproof</a> is our recommendation. The hourglass shape gives you volume and length for bold, stunning lashes that stay coated through rain, sweat or tears.</p>
<p>If there’s one beauty item you don’t need to splurge on to look good, it’s mascara. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ADRGV26/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neutrogena &#8211; Healthy Lengths</a> proves this point by defining lashes and adding volume almost as well as its designer competition. Despite its name, it adds more definition than length, but it is without a doubt the mascara you’ll want to grab the next time you’re in the beauty aisle of your local drugstore.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After weeks spent trying on the best magnetic eyelashes on the market, we found that the Lash’d Up - Natural "i woke up this way" are the only ones worth buying.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent weeks consulting a professional lash expert and testing seven top products to determine <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DXB4CMQ/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Lash’d Up &#8211; Natural &#8211; i woke up this way</b></a> is the best magnetic eyelashes product on the market. Our testers loved Lash’d Up’s thinness and natural curl and said they would use these lashes on a daily basis. The same cannot be said for our other finalists; keep reading our magnetic eyelashes review to find out more.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We began our magnetic eyelash review by consulting online reviews from respected retailers like Amazon, Ulta, Target and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. From the get-go, frustration from consumers with the way these lashes were applied and looked was palpable. This was compounded when we began checking out beauty bloggers to get their thoughts on specific magnetic eyelash brands.</p>
<p>However, for every naysayer we came across, we also found bloggers happy about finding a product that freed them from traditional falsies. Often, bloggers would disagree about specific magnetic eyelash brands. Therefore, we picked eyelash brands that garnered the most positive support and conversation.</p>
<p>We also read up on other magnetic eyelash reviews from respected sources such as Elle and Today, and of course, scoured subreddits such as r/MakeupAddiction. We chose our top finalists based on which brands were leaders in the field and which had the most positive feedback from consumers.</p>
<h3>Discontinued Products</h3>
<p>We found that there was a lot of volatility on Amazon regarding magnetic lashes. Four magnetic lash brands we tested were discontinued on Amazon during the course of our testing. The quick appearance and disappearance of magnetic lash products could be a consequence of brands attempting to cash in on a trending product.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, we disregarded any magnetic lashes that had a low number of reviews or were removed from Amazon during the course of our testing.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-apply">How to apply magnetic eyelashes</h2>

<p>We won’t lie to you. Applying magnetic eyelashes is no cakewalk. However, if you give yourself about half an hour and follow these tips, you can get the technique down.</p>
<p>There are plenty of magnetic eyelash applicators on the market. We tested the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0778P44J5/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rapid Vitality &#8211; False Eyelash Applicator</a> to apply our lashes. Also, many of our magnetic eyelashes came with a cheaper plastic version of this type of applicator. Neither of our testers found these applicators particularly helpful. Instead, we recommend using <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-tweezers/">tweezers</a> or using the technique described by the lash expert we interviewed, Janelle Friedman. Janelle is the CEO and founder of <a href="http://www.goodjanes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoodJanes Beauty</a>. “This tactic will help to prevent the lashes and magnets from moving too far from the lash line, ensuring they look more natural,” Janelle explains.</p>
<p><b>Step 1: </b>Apply black eyeliner prior to lash application for a smoother blend.</p>
<p><b>Step 2: </b>Line up the bottom lash under your lash line.</p>
<p><b>Step 3: </b>Position the top lash to connect the magnets. Align the top and bottom lashes with your index finger and thumb takes some getting used to, but our testers were eventually able to get the hang of it.</p>
<p><b>Step 4: </b>Apply mascara to blend lashes.</p>
<p><b>Step 5: </b>To take off magnetic eyelashes, place your lashes between your index finger and thumb, then rub your fingers together to gently separate the magnets.</p>
<p>Janelle also recommends investing in a triangulated mirror. These mirrors allow you to see your lash line from multiple angles, which can help take some of the frustration out of applying magnetic eyelashes.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Length of lash</b>: The majority of the lashes we tested were about three-eighths of an inch in length. This is longer than what most people need, but you can always trim your magnetic lashes to be a more manageable length. One of our testers preferred their falsies to be about a quarter of an inch long, while the other preferred a full-length lash. It is a matter of personal preference, largely influenced by your natural lash length and thickness.</p>
<p><b>Material: </b>Magnetic Lashes can be made from synthetic fiber, silk, human hair or mink. Our top pick was made of silk, which we thought looked pretty natural. While we liked the look of some of the synthetic lashes we tested, watch out for those with a plastic, unnatural shine.</p>
<p><b>Full strip or accent: </b>Before buying magnetic eyelashes, you should decide if you want a full strip of falsies or just an accent for your outer eye. We tested both types of lashes and found that accents can be a bit tricky to blend. So, our advice is to go for a full strip and then cut it to the width that works best for you.</p>
<p><b>Amount of lashes</b>: The more lashes, the more dramatic the look. In our testing, we looked for falsies that added some drama to our eyes but didn’t have people asking us if our eyelashes were real.</p>
<p><b>Storage case</b>: All of the lashes we tested were advertised as being reusable. Therefore, a good storage case is important to keep track of teeny-tiny lashes. We wanted a storage case that closes securely, and that has designated spots for lashes.</p>
<p><b>Durability: </b>The last thing anyone wants is for their lashes to pop a magnet the third time they wear them. We tested our lashes multiple times to make sure they were durable enough for multiple uses.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/lashd-up-clip.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We had two testers. One works professionally in the lash industry. She tried on each of our false lashes and answered questions about each lash’s application, material, look and fit. The other tester wore each of our top ranking lashes three separate times to find any possible durability issues.</p>
<h3>Application</h3>
<p>As we said before, applying magnetic lashes is not easy. It took both our testers, even the professional, a while to get the hang of it. <b>There was not much range in difficulty of application, as all of our finalists proved equally difficult to get the hang of.</b> However, one of our testers noted that the One Two Lash &#8211; Founder’s Lash and 3 Second Lash &#8211; Magnetic Eyelashes were a bit easier to apply because they only had one magnet per strip.</p>
<h3>Material</h3>
<p>Most of the lashes we tested were made of synthetic fibers. Our testers had problems with the unnatural, plastic shininess of  3 Second Lash &#8211; Magnetic Eyelashes, AsaVea &#8211; Magnetic Eyelashes and VASSOUL &#8211; 3D Magnetic Eyelashes. In particular, one of our testers said that 3 Second Lash’s product looked “like lashes for a Halloween costume.”</p>
<p>However, our testers were fine with the way the lashes of the Eylure &#8211; Opulent Corner and One Two Lash &#8211; Founder’s Lash sets looked, even though these were also made of synthetic fibers.</p>
<p>We were amazed to find out that the Ardell &#8211; Magnetic Lash Accent #001 was made of human hair, as our testers rated its material as just average looking. Our testers were particularly pleased with the silk lashes of Lash’d Up &#8211; Natural &#8211; i woke up this way, which they described as, “thin and natural looking.”</p>
<h3>Natural vs. dramatic looks</h3>
<p>While trying on our finalists, we asked our testers whether they would use each set for a day look or a dramatic night look. Lash sets that had a large number of long lashes were categorized as dramatic looks, appropriate for a night out or special event. Sets that had fewer lashes were labeled as natural day looks.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that lashes that work for a natural day look still require some mascara and curling to fully blend into your lashes. Day-look lashes also had to be comfortable enough to wear for eight hours straight.</p>
<h3>Fit</h3>
<p>Fit refers to how well the magnetic eyelashes hugged the natural lash line and how comfortable they felt on. This was the “make it or break it” test for our finalists. We had many problems with magnetic eyelashes not curving to the lash line’s natural curve.</p>
<p>Lashes that had two to three magnets per strip generally did a better job at curving along the lash line than those that had one magnet per strip because they had multiple points of contact to bend around. We found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DXB4CMQ/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lash’d Up</a> lashes, which used a two magnet system, had the best fit.</p>
<p>While our testers loved the material and lightweight design of the One Two Lash &#8211; Founder’s Lash, they were unimpressed by the one magnet per strip design, which stuck out too far from the natural curved lash line. The three-second lash also used only one magnet per strip and scored low with our testers.</p>
<p>We were surprised to find that a secure fit was not a big issue for any of our lashes. None of our finalists fell off during the course of testing, even when testers shook their heads or jumped up and down. However, lashes with more magnets felt more secure in general.</p>
<p>Some lashes were a little too wide for our tester’s eyes. This can be easily fixed by trimming off excess lash at the inner corner. Therefore, we did not dock any of our finalists for being too wide.</p>
<h3>Reusability</h3>
<p>All of the lashes we tested were advertised as reusable. However, the reality of being able to reuse teeny-tiny lashes depends largely on having a handy, secure container for them.</p>
<p><b>The best holders by far were the sturdy plastic boxes of the </b><b>One Two Lash: Founder’s Lash</b><b> and the </b><b>3 Second Lash &#8211; Magnetic Eyelashes</b><b>, which were truly handy and easy to keep track of. </b></p>
<p>The Ardell &#8211; Magnetic Lash Accent #001 did not come with a holder, only the cheap plastic tray and cardboard box it came in. We thought that this made these lashes very easy to lose.</p>

<p>Our testers thought that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DXB4CMQ/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Lash’d Up &#8211; Natural &#8211; i woke up this way</b></a> magnetic lashes stood out from the pack because of their ability to curve to your natural lash line. These were the best magnetic lashes we found for all-day looks because of their lightweight design and natural appearance.</p>
<p>These lashes use one full-eye-length top strip with two magnets and two shorter bottom pieces that have one magnet apiece. These strips are pliable enough to be curved along your natural lash line using the two magnets at the inner and outer eye as anchors. Both our testers agreed that the Lash’d Up lashes were easier to get closer to the natural lash line and felt more comfortable than any of our finalists.</p>
<p>The Lash’d Up’s fit makes blending these lashes into your natural lashes much easier because the magnets don’t stick out too far from your eye. However, we still recommend using black eyeliner before application (and mascara after putting on your magnetic lashes) to fully blend them with your natural lashes.</p>

These lashes have two magnets per strip and are extremely flexible, which helps them curve close to your natural lash line.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DXB4CMQ/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Lash’d Up’s lashes are one of the shortest we tested, measuring only about a quarter of an inch in length. The majority of our finalists measured about three-eighths of an inch. The shortness of Lash’d Up’s lashes help give them a more natural curl and overall look.</p>
<p>These silk lashes also have a more natural look because there are fewer lashes in this set than most of our other finalists. This also makes these lashes very lightweight and comfortable to wear. One tester even thought you might forget you had these lashes on after a while.</p>
<p>One downside: The holder for your Lash’d Up lashes is very minimal — just a cardboard box with a plastic tray that slides out. This cardboard box already started breaking during our testing. We fear that it would completely fall apart if you were traveling. We wish Lash’d Up would invest in a more secure carrying case to ensure these lashes don’t get lost.</p>
<p>These lashes were a midrange price of about $15. A few of our finalists offered two pairs of lashes for a similar price, but because of the superior fit and look of Lash’d Up magnetic eyelashes, we are not complaining. This a fair price for magnetic eyelashes that deliver where it counts.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Lash’d Up &#8211; Natural &#8211; i woke up this way</b> magnetic eyelashes are your best pick for a natural day look because of their comfortable fit and lightweight.</li>
<li>Our testers found that Lash’d Up’s dual magnets and flexible strips were better for getting in close to your natural lash line.</li>
<li>These lashes are easy to blend with your natural lashes because of their shorter length, natural curl and silk material.</li>
<li>The holder for these lashes is subpar, but for about $15 you can afford to get a backup set or a better case.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-finalists">Other finalists we do not recommend</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, we were disappointed in the quality and fit of the rest of our finalists. Magnetic lashes are a relatively new beauty trend. Therefore, we are still waiting for a solid competitor to Lash’d Up’s superior quality. We are not able to recommend any of our other finalists, as we discovered during testing that we cannot justify using them over traditional false lashes.</p>
<h3>One Two Lash &#8211; Founder’s Lash</h3>

<p>The most outrageous thing about the <a href="https://www.onetwocosmetics.com/shop/founders-lash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One Two Lash &#8211; Founder’s Lash</a> is the $70 price tag attached to it. While our testers appreciated the natural look of the lash material and their sturdy carrying case (easily the best of our finalists), they were overall unimpressed with the fit of these lashes.</p>
<p>These lashes come with four lash strips per eye. One for your top outer corner, lower outer corner, top inner corner and lower inner corner. Each of these half-length strips comes with one magnet. Our testers liked that these magnets had a handy marking system to keep track of which magnets connected. However, they found that this system did not work well for keeping lashes close to your natural lash line.</p>
<p>Our top pick used dual top magnets as anchors to bend the false lash to match the curve of the natural lash line. However because the One Two Lash’s top magnets are separated, this bending cannot occur. This causes a weird separation to happen between natural and false lash, betraying your use of falsies.</p>
<p>Therefore, despite the obvious quality of the carry case and lash material, we don’t recommend shelling out $70 for these poor-fitting lashes.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/3-second-lash-trade-magnetic-eyelashes-in-black/5011937" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">3 Second Lash &#8211; Magnetic Eyelashes</a> set came with three separate pairs of lashes, two natural looks and one dramatic look. All of these lashes used one magnet per strip system that was not able to hold the lash close enough to the natural lash line. Like the One Two Lashes, these lashes had obvious separation from the natural lash line that was a major problem with our testers.</p>
<p>Our testers also described the material of these lashes as extremely shiny and cheap looking. The dramatic pair included in this set was described by one of our testers as looking like a cheap Halloween costume.</p>
<p>The only upside to this lash set is that it comes with a sturdy carrying case that makes it easier not to lose lashes. However, with the terrible fit and quality of these lashes, you might not care if they get lost.</p>

<p>Our testers found it nearly impossible to blend the dramatic <a href="https://www.ulta.com/magnetic-lash-accent-001?productId=xlsImpprod17631467" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ardell &#8211; Magnetic Lash Accent #001</a> with their natural lashes. These lashes simply have too many lashes to blend at all naturally as an accent lash. Even if you trim these lashes to a more reasonable length, the sheer density of lashes and magnets makes this accent stand out like a sore thumb from your natural lashes.</p>
<p>The Ardell lashes use a three-magnet system, which keeps lashes secure but adds to the visual weight, all located at the outer corner of your eye. Their material was also a bit shiny for our testers’ liking.</p>
<p>To top off this mess, Ardell’s lashes do not come with any decent storage. Putting them back in the cardboard and plastic box they came in is a pain and a mess.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07663DK66/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">VASSOUL &#8211; 3D Magnetic Eyelashes</a> are another hard-to-blend accent lash that frustrated our testers. These lashes were too shiny and thick to properly blend with natural lashes. Our testers also had issues getting the outer corner of these lashes close enough to the lash line.</p>
<p>This could be partly remedied by trimming the outer corner of these falsies closer to their outer magnet, but this still did not solve the glaring distinction between natural lash and false accent.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.target.com/p/eylure-magnetic-lashes-opulent-corner/-/A-53588324" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eylure &#8211; Opulent Corner</a> is also too opulent to blend with the rest of your lashes. In addition, these lashes are too stiff. So even though these lashes have a dual-magnet system, they do not bend enough to sit on your natural lash line. They sit too far down and in a completely straight chunk of dramatic eyelash on the outer corner of your eye — not the look anyone wants.</p>
<p>On the positive side, our testers liked the material of these lashes and the plastic carry case they came with. However, the terrible fit of these lashes makes them impossible to use for an attractive look.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KHBVIH6/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AsaVea &#8211; Magnetic Eyelashes</a> were a very similar story to the Eylure accent lashes. They had too many lashes, all localized in your outer corner, to blend with the rest of your lashes. Also, they too were very stiff, so they didn’t have any of the natural curve that keeps the falsies close to the lash line.</p>
<p>Because these lashes don’t curve along your natural lash line, separation occurs between the natural and false lash, especially near the outer corner of your eye. Our testers also commented that these lash’s material was too thick and shiny to look natural.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After spending over three weeks on our magnetic eyelashes review, we found that your best bet for a natural all-day-look magnetic lash was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DXB4CMQ/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Lash’d Up &#8211; Natural &#8211; i woke up this way</b></a>. What really separates Lash’d Up from the pack is their ability to curve close to your natural lash line, using a magnet at both your inner and outer corners. Our testers also like the more natural amount, thinness and curl of these lashes, which give an attractive look you could wear all day.</p>
<p>Our other finalists, despite having many good reviews, let us down. They did not sit close enough to the lash line and did not look natural enough to justify using them over traditional false lashes.</p>
<p>Our testers found that accent magnetic lashes, on the whole, did not look as natural as full-length lashes because they had more trouble curving with the natural lash line and many had simply too many lashes to blend.</p>
<p>If you want to try magnetic eyelashes, definitely go with the Lash’d Up &#8211; Natural &#8211; i woke up this way. Hopefully, in the coming year, there will be more competitors that offer the same quality as Lash’d Up. However, for now, there are a lot of lackluster magnetic eyelashes that do not sit close enough to the natural lash line to justify buying.</p>
