								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent 40 hours toasting, broiling and baking to determine that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XBOXVIA/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BOV845BSS Smart Oven Pro</a> is the best toaster oven. Since our review, the Breville has been slightly updated, but it’s virtually the same high quality, feature-packed and most versatile toaster oven that we originally reviewed. For this 2019 update, we tested two new toaster ovens and have selected a new runner-up, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0AWSJX/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; TOB-260N1 Chef’s Convection</a>. The Cuisinart is almost identical to the Breville in features and performance, but it’s about one-third less expensive.</p>

<p>(<em>Editors note: For this 2019 update, we checked manufacturers&#8217; websites to see if any of the toaster ovens we originally reviewed had been updated and discontinued. All models, except for the Waring &#8211; TCO650 and the Panasonic &#8211; NB-G110P, had minor changes and didn&#8217;t warrant our retesting them. We found two new toaster ovens released in the past year &#8212; the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0AWSJX/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; TOB-260N1 Chef&#8217;s Convection</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07T3J3B13/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KCO-211BM</a> &#8212; and tested them to see how they compared. The new Cuisinart handily outperformed our previous runner-up, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E9HR7KG/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; TOB-135</a>, and we&#8217;ve named it our new runner-up.</em>)</p>
<h2 id="how-we-chose">How we chose toaster ovens to test</h2>
<p>We began our search for the best toaster oven by reading reviews and research from websites such as Amazon, Best Reviews, Good Housekeeping and Bon Appétit.</p>
<p>We also read countless individual consumer reviews and cooking blogs to find out what people use their toaster ovens for, what the most useful features are, what the most common complaints are and what makes the ideal toaster oven.</p>
<p>We discovered that people valued the following toaster oven characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capacity: How much food can be accommodated?</li>
<li>Accessibility: How easily can the toaster oven be used?</li>
<li>Functionality: How do the features affect your usage?</li>
<li>Versatility: Can the toaster oven cook a wide variety of foods?</li>
<li>Dependability: Do the preset cooking functions produce expected results every time?</li>
<li>Consistency: Is the food item cooked through evenly?</li>
<li>Attractiveness: How aesthetically appealing is the appliance?</li>
<li>Impression: How much kitchen space does the appliance require?</li>
<li>Tidiness: How easily can the toaster oven be cleaned?</li>
<li>Affordability: Do you have to spend more money to yield better results?</li>
</ul>
<p>To narrow the extensive list of toaster ovens we researched down to our seven finalists, we only chose the toaster ovens with the highest ratings. With all of them boasting Amazon ratings of 4 stars or more, we ordered them and performed a series of tests. We then compared the data we collected against each of the finalists.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs-one">Who needs a toaster oven?</h2>
<p>Whether your living space lacks a full kitchen or you are simply looking to add to your collection of kitchen appliances, a toaster oven can benefit any household. In addition to toasting your favorite breakfast items, a toaster oven can do anything from baking a classic rotisserie chicken to broiling some home-style barbecue ribs.</p>
<p>Toaster ovens provide the versatility that a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-toaster/">slot toaster</a> lacks and offers the convenience that a conventional oven does not.</p>
<p>While you may have to wait up to half an hour for a conventional oven to preheat, a toaster oven can cut the preheat time substantially. For the eco-conscious home cook, toaster ovens are a budget-friendly and energy efficient alternative to conventional ovens.</p>
<p>A toaster oven is also a pragmatic appliance for people who often cook smaller portions or feed smaller households.</p>
<h2>What is convection cooking</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4245" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/convection-fan.jpg" alt="closeup of convection fan" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/convection-fan.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/convection-fan-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/convection-fan-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/convection-fan-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/convection-fan-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/convection-fan-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/convection-fan-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/convection-fan-180x119.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/convection-fan-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Out of the seven finalists we originally tested and the two new finalists, five featured convection cooking: Breville Smart Oven Pro, Cuisinart &#8211; Chef’s Convection, Cuisinart Deluxe Convection, Oster 6-Slice Counter Top and Waring Pro Digital Convection. A convection toaster oven has a fan and exhaust system that can be used to better circulate and ventilate the hot air.</p>
<p>The fan blows hot air directly onto the food, which allows it to cook faster, and in turn, save energy. The convection system also eliminates any hot spots by evenly distributing the hot air around the food and throughout the oven, which allows you to achieve more even cooking.</p>
<p>Another benefit is that the convection mode minimizes the amount of moisture in the toaster oven. The dry environment allows you to achieve better browning compared to the normal mode because it will roast your meats and vegetables instead of steaming them.</p>
<p>In addition to roasting, the convection setting is great for baking cookies, pies and pastries as well as toasting and dehydrating food products. If you are braising or cooking something covered, you can also use the convection setting for faster cooking since dryness will not be a concern.</p>
<p>While toaster ovens with convection cooking are generally more expensive than those without, the additional benefits make the option worth considering.</p>
<h2>What are infrared heating elements?</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4244" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infrared-element.jpg" alt="Panasonic's infrared heating element" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infrared-element.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infrared-element-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infrared-element-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infrared-element-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infrared-element-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infrared-element-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infrared-element-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infrared-element-180x119.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/infrared-element-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>To provide a complete roundup of heating methods available in toaster ovens, we tested one that uses infrared technology, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E07D76S/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic Flash Xpress</a>. Infrared technology uses light energy to cook food, similar to a microwave. The intensity of the light speeds up the cooking process dramatically, and the toaster oven requires virtually no preheating time.</p>
<p>However, the strength of the heat limits its use for more delicate foods. Infrared technology is better suited for toasting bagels and reheating pizzas and less ideal for cooking fish. The soft, flaky texture of fish requires more delicate handling. Speed and efficiency is by far the greatest advantage of infrared technology.</p>
<h2 id="features-to-look-for">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>The oven you choose will largely be determined by your kitchen space, cooking needs and budget. Then you can further narrow by aesthetics and features which usually come at a premium.</p>
<h3>Capacity</h3>
<p>For people who plan on using their toaster ovens to reheat or cook single servings of food, a small toaster oven that can accommodate four slices of bread or a 9-inch pizza will suffice. People who plan on using their toaster ovens to prepare multiple servings would benefit from a large toaster oven that can accommodate six slices of bread, a 13-inch pizza, or a whole chicken.</p>
<p>The size of your kitchen and your aesthetic taste will also determine how much of your counter space you want to allow to a toaster oven. If you have a small kitchen with limited counter space, a smaller toaster oven may be ideal.</p>
<h3>Crumb tray</h3>
<p>The crumb tray is a small, thin, stainless steel sheet that slides out from the bottom of the toaster oven. All of our seven finalists have crumb trays, and we strongly recommend purchasing a toaster oven with one. The tray is an essential feature because it makes cleaning your toaster oven much easier.</p>
<p>The tray covers the entire bottom of the inside and catches all of the crumbs and fragments that fall during the cooking process. Instead of watching the debris burn at the bottom of your toaster oven over time, you can simply pull the tray out after each use and sweep the contents into the trash. If you’re dealing with tougher substances, you can also easily wash the tray.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>Toaster ovens are one of the most versatile kitchen appliances because they can perform a variety of cooking tasks. Our finalists feature anywhere from three to 10 preset cooking functions. Six out of the seven finalists offer bake and broil settings, which is what differentiates a toaster oven from a regular toaster. Baking surrounds your food with hot air for even cooking while broiling directs the heat to the top of your food for a searing effect.</p>
<p>Other popular functions include bagel, pizza, and warm. The bagel setting will produce a slightly toasted outside and a crispier inside. The pizza setting can be used to melt the cheese and heat the toppings while crisping the crust. The warm setting maintains the temperature of hot foods to prevent bacterial growth. A few of the finalists also provide a reheat setting for leftovers and a defrost setting for frozen foods.</p>
<p>Beyond preset cooking functions, other convenient features to consider are interior lighting, digital displays, nonstick interiors, and automatic shut-off. You can also decide between dial and touchpad controls.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>Pricier toaster ovens almost always feature a sleeker look and more luxurious feel, but they aren’t necessarily better than cheaper options. However, some of the more expensive toaster ovens have more wattage for faster, more even cooking.</p>
<p>The price of more expensive models may account for the higher quality of materials and durability of components, which means that they are likely to last longer. Some of our finalists even offer limited product warranties. Ultimately, your decision will be determined by your personal budget and preferences.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<p>One of the most popular reasons why people use toaster ovens is convenience, specifically when it comes to speed. When it came time to start testing our finalists, we paid close attention to preheating and cooking times.</p>
<p>On average, toaster ovens with higher wattage were able to perform cooking tasks faster than toaster ovens with lower wattage. However, the toaster oven that won our speed test by a large margin was the only one that featured infrared technology.</p>
<p>Despite being powered by a modest 1300 watts, the median wattage amongst our finalists, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E07D76S/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic Flash Xpress</a> was the speed demon to beat them all. The Panasonic was able to produce perfect toast in one minute and 45 seconds, garlic bread in one minute, and frozen pizza in 12 minutes.</p>
<p>In our new testing, we were also impressed by the Cuisinart &#8211; Chef’s Convection’s speed. It has 1800 watts, just like the Breville, but an added feature is its “speed convection” setting. Not only does the convection function decrease cooking time, but the speed convection setting eliminates the need for preheating the oven: It immediately heats up to the desired temperature.</p>
<h3>Cooking functions</h3>
<p><strong>Toast</strong></p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/toast-comparison-1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We began our testing process with the classic toast function available on all of our finalists. The goal was to toast a slice of bread to a crisp, golden brown. We used a generic brand of pre-sliced white bread in order to get a clear visualization of the color and texture after toasting.</p>
<p>The toast setting works by emitting even heat from the top and bottom of the oven, similar to the way a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-toaster/">2 or 4-slice slot toaster</a> emits heat on two sides of the bread simultaneously. For this setting, we placed the wire racks on the middle level of the toaster ovens. For the five finalists that allowed us to choose a level, we set the toaster ovens to level two.</p>
<p>For the two that did not, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FN3MV88/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BLACK+DECKER</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AO24YX8/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach</a>, we simply watched and turned off the toaster oven once a crisp, golden brown color was achieved. The toasting time ranged from one minute, 45 seconds to four minutes.</p>
<p>When it came to evenly toasting bread, the majority of our finalists were disappointing, including our new finalist, the KitchenAid. Most of the toaster ovens produced shading that graduated from top to bottom with the edges of the bread either under- or over-toasted. In our prior testing, only the Oster and the Waring evenly toasted the bread on both sides. Our new runner-up, the Cuisinart &#8211; Chef’s Convection, also gave us evenly shaded golden-brown toast.</p>
<p><strong>Garlic bread</strong></p>
<p>To test the broil function, we decided to make some fresh garlic bread. With our French baguettes generously slathered in herbed garlic butter, the goal was to melt the butter and crisp the edges while maintaining the soft interior.</p>
<p>On the broil setting, the heat source comes from above the food. Since the Panasonic lacked the broil option, we utilized the toast option once again. We preheated all of the toaster ovens to 450°F or 500°F, depending on the temperature range available. We only kept the garlic bread in the toaster ovens until the optimal color and texture was achieved. The broiling time ranged from one minute to two minutes and 30 seconds.</p>
<p>While the cooking times varied, the cooking results of all of our finalists were nearly identical. Each toaster oven successfully produced a slice of garlic bread with melted butter, crisp edges, and a soft interior.</p>
<p><strong>Frozen pizza</strong></p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/pizza-animation.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>To kill two birds with one stone, we decided to evaluate our finalists’ ability to bake a pizza and cook frozen food in a single test. We chose to conduct our comprehensive test with frozen pizza. Our goal was to thoroughly defrost and heat the pizza so the cheese was melted and gooey and crust was browned and crispy.</p>
<p>We used the preprogrammed pizza function on the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XBOXVIA/?tag=ybdoven-20">Breville</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003Z34OME/?tag=ybdoven-20">Oster</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005RRBMVW/?tag=ybdoven-20">Waring</a> and<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E07D76S/?tag=ybdoven-20"> Panasonic</a> and the two new models, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0AWSJX/?tag=ybdoven-20">Cuisinart &#8211; Chef’s Convection</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07T3J3B13/?tag=ybdoven-20">KitchenAid &#8211; KCO211BM</a>. For the toaster ovens that did not have a pizza function, we used their bake function and preheated them to 400°F as the pizza packaging instructed.</p>
<p>The pizza setting works similarly to baking as it distributes heat from above and below the rack. We also followed the packaging’s instructions to bake the pizza for 16 to 18 minutes. The Panasonic cooked the pizza in 12 minutes and the Cuisinart and KitchenAid in 15 minutes.</p>
<p>The cooking results for our frozen pizza test were identical to our garlic bread test in its uniformity. In our first review, each toaster oven fully cooked the pizza with minimal variations in browning the crust. In this update, both the Cuisinart and KitchenAid performed similarly, although the pizza crust that was cooked in the KitchenAid was somewhat flabby.</p>
<p><strong>Cupcakes</strong></p>
<p>Since baking is a cooking function that can be used on almost any food item, we decided to test it on more than one. First, we brainstormed through the baked goods options, and to satisfy our sweet cravings, we chose to bake cupcakes using the Betty Crocker Super Moist Yellow Cake Mix. The goal was to produce cupcakes that were light in density, moist in texture, and even in color.</p>
<p>On the bake setting, the heat source comes from above and below the food. As instructed by the packaging, each toaster oven was preheated to 325°F and each timer was set to 12 minutes. They all produced essentially the same results in density, texture, and color, but the shape of the cupcakes varied.</p>
<p>Baking cupcakes also gave us an opportunity to see how the convection mode compared to the normal mode. This test was where the Breville and Cuisinart toaster ovens excelled as their convection baking produced the lightest, moistest cupcakes. In our 2019 testing, the Cuisinart &#8211; Chef’s Convection gave us perfect cupcakes as well.</p>
<p><strong>Baked potato</strong></p>
<p>For our final test subject, we needed to ensure that we covered the wide range of food that people use their toaster ovens for. We decided to bake potatoes, the item opposite of cupcakes on the density spectrum. The goal was to achieve a baked potato that had crispy skin but was soft through and through.</p>
<p>Using the bake function, we preheated our finalists to 425°F and set our timers for 45 minutes. Once again, the results were the same across the board. Our forks and knives were met with minimal resistance.</p>

<p>The design of the toaster oven goes beyond how much space it will take and how it will look in your kitchen. While the aesthetic appeal can only be determined subjectively, we took it upon ourselves to judge the build and functionality presented by each model’s design.</p>
<p>The convection toaster ovens weigh significantly more than the others. The Waring is the heaviest at 22.8 pounds, nearly triple the weight of the Panasonic and BLACK+DECKER, which tied for the lightest at 7.5 pounds. While the weight difference accounts for the size, material, and addition of the fan and exhaust, the heaviness of the toaster ovens translates to the heaviness of the doors and their ability to insulate the heat. Among our finalists, the Breville had the heaviest, sturdiest door.</p>
<p>To evaluate functionality, we looked at the controls and displays. The toaster ovens were split evenly on whether they featured dial or touchpad controls, but every model featured digital displays except for the Black+Decker and the Hamilton Beach. By omitting this feature, they made it more difficult for us to set accurate times and temperatures.</p>
<h3>Other features</h3>
<p>Finally, we considered every other feature that our finalists advertised and how they benefited the user experience. We judged each toaster oven carefully on how simple the instructions were and how easy the model was to use. We considered how much effort was required for the crumb trays to be removed and cleaned as well as how effective they were in collecting food debris.</p>
<p>We looked at timer and temperature range. We took into account the presence of an interior light and the effectiveness of a nonstick interior. We evaluated how clear the displays were to see, how difficult the buttons were to push and how smooth the dials were to turn. We compared every tangible aspect of using a toaster oven to help determine the best overall.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XBOXVIA/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BOV845BSS Smart Oven Pro</a> proved to be the superior choice in almost every way. We say “almost every way” because when we tested the toasting function, the toast produced uneven shading after three minutes, which was the median toasting time among our finalists. While both sides were identical (sans grate marks), the toast got gradually darker towards the top. However, since most of the toaster ovens yielded the same results, we would recommend a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-toaster/">slot toaster</a> for optimal toast.</p>

<p>The Breville toaster oven boasts the highest wattage at 1800 watts, which boosted its preheat speed despite its large size. Once it was hot and ready, the Breville performed every other cooking function successfully. While the cooking results of all of the models were similar across the board, its convection mode pushed it past the rest. Appearance-wise, the cupcakes were an even yellow and had perfectly rounded tops, and with just one bite, we also determined that the cupcakes were more airy and moist than the rest.</p>
<p>The Breville toaster oven proved itself as the latest in technological advancement and the greatest in thoughtful design. Ultimately, the multitude of features is what makes it the clear winner.</p>
<p>The interior light is bright enough to get a clear visualization of its contents. The LCD display employs a sans serif font and a soft blue or orange backlight that is easy on the eyes. There are three separate easy-to-use dials: function, temperature and time.</p>
<p>The auto shut-off feature is an added benefit for anyone who has a habit of being forgetful or leaving their food unattended. The auto-eject rack is a luxury, but makes your food more easily accessible and lowers the chance of accidental burns. In addition to the clearly marked buttons and dials, the glass door provides indications for where you should place your wire rack for each cooking function.</p>

    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/breville-auto-eject.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Combining all of these user-friendly features, the Breville toaster oven was clearly designed with the customer in mind. The average consumer could painlessly operate the Breville using his or her intuition alone. For those who prefer to read the instructions, the easy-to-read instruction book is comprehensive and includes several bonus recipes. There is also a one-year limited product warranty.</p>
<p>Even before cooking anything, the Breville was stunning just to look at. The brushed stainless steel gave it a sharp, sleek look that made all of its competitors pale in comparison aesthetically. Along with the traditional wire rack, the toaster came with an enamel broiling rack, an enamel baking pan and a nonstick pizza pan. The remarkable quality of material and craftsmanship is in the price tag. As demonstrated by the Breville&#8217;s price tag, these luxuries come at a price.</p>
<p>The design closely mimicked that of a conventional oven and so did the size. At 0.5 cubic feet, it can fit up to six slices of bread and a 13-inch pizza. The capacity, along with the 10 pre-set cooking functions, makes the Breville the most versatile toaster oven we tested. The cooking functions include toast, bagel, bake, roast, broil, pizza, cookies, reheat warm and slow cook, and the convection fan can be turned on at any time whereas other models solely offer convection baking.</p>
<p>In addition, with a new technology developed by Breville called Element IQ, there are five independent heating elements that are controlled to accommodate whatever you are cooking. Once you choose a cooking function, the power is automatically funneled to where it is needed most, delivering the optimal amount of heat at the perfect time for precision cooking.</p>
<p>Swayed by the luxurious design that complements any high-end kitchen and the unparalleled functionality that provides the greatest user experience, we concluded that the Breville Smart Oven Pro was our pick for best overall.</p>

<p>Since our previous review, our pick for runner-up was the Cuisinart &#8211; TOB-135, which was subsequently updated to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M65AOK1/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TOB-135N</a>. There was no visible difference between the two models; however, Cuisinart recently released the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0AWSJX/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TOB-260N1 &#8211; Chef’s Convection</a>, and except for a couple of minor details, we found it to be very similar to the Breville and a worthy competitor.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart doesn’t have the Breville’s sleek curves, and it’s actually a bit bigger than the Breville, so this isn’t the toaster oven for a small kitchen with limited counter space. It has the same 1800 wattage and capacity, easily accommodating a 13-inch pizza, a standard cupcake tin or six pieces of toast.</p>

<p>Breville has also updated the model we reviewed and now has 12 instead of 10 programmed functions. The Cuisinart ups the number of functions to 15, including a “speed convection” function and an innovative “dual cook” function. The dual cook function allows you to program two modes of cooking &#8212; for example, slow-cooking followed by browning &#8212; for two different times.</p>
<p>The speed convection super-heats the oven to the programmed temperature in seconds, so you don’t have to wait to preheat the oven before putting food in. We programmed the pizza function, which is pre-set at 450℉ for 15 minutes, and the oven heated to 450℉ in 45 seconds.</p>
<p>Exactly like the Breville, the oven is programmed with an LED panel that has a menu selection for cooking modes, including one for warming up leftovers. The toast, bagel and waffle functions give you the option to choose shade and number of slices. We tested three different toast shades, from lightest to darkest, and all were evenly colored with no burnt or under-toasted edges.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart doesn’t have the handy built-in auto-eject rack like the Breville, but it does have two door hooks that latch onto the upper rack and pull it out when the door opens. The Cuisinart comes with the same extras as the Breville: two racks, an enameled broiler rack and baking pan and pizza stone, which produced a great pizza with crispy crust.</p>
<p>Although the Cuisinart is a bit bulkier and heavier, it offers almost identical features and performance as the Breville, but it’s one-third the price. If you’ve got the kitchen space and don’t mind a less esthetic design, the Cuisinart &#8211; TOB-260N1 is an excellent option.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Cuisinart &#8211; TOB-260N1 has all of the same features as the Breville, but it’s one-third less expensive.</li>
<li>Its innovative “dual cook” function allows you to program two different cooking modes and cooking times all at once.</li>
<li>The Cuisinart’s “speed convection” function heats up the oven to the desired temperature in seconds, eliminating preheating.</li>

This toaster was in fact about 1/8th and 1/3rd the cost of our other winners. While the price tag is reflected in the design, the black and stainless steel finish make it suitable for just about any kitchen. The quality of materials is lacking, which is evident in how easily it can scratch, but this has no effect on its performance.</p>

<p>The ultra-light seven and a half pound appliance can accommodate up to four slices of bread and a nine-inch pizza, which is the perfect size for the average toaster oven user.</p>
<p>With 1150 watts, the BLACK+DECKER is one of the slower toaster ovens, but it yields the same cooking results in the end. During testing, it did not stand out with any particular food, but it performed well. The BLACK+DECKER was able to produce crispy toast, melted cheese and soft cupcakes.</p>

<p>The three dials control the temperature, cooking function and timer. While the timer dial turns easily, the temperature and cooking function dials are slightly more difficult. The BLACK+DECKER provides four pre-set cooking functions: bake, broil, toast and warm.</p>
<p>The crumb tray is only accessible once the door is open. Since the door is light and opens easily, removing the crumb tray is quick and painless. The toaster oven also comes with a baking pan and broil rack. The instruction manual is a pamphlet that unfolds to one large piece of paper.</p>
<p>The most budget-friendly option amongst our finalists, the BLACK+DECKER 4-Slice does the trick without breaking the bank.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The BLACK+DECKER toaster oven is perfectly sized for the average individual.</li>
<li>It uses the least amount of energy at 1150 watts.</li>
<li>There are four pre-set cooking functions: bake, broil, toast and warm.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cuisinart &#8211; TOB-135</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4246 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cuisinart-runner-up.jpg" alt="Cuisinart convection runner up" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cuisinart-runner-up.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cuisinart-runner-up-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cuisinart-runner-up-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cuisinart-runner-up-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cuisinart-runner-up-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cuisinart-runner-up-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cuisinart-runner-up-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cuisinart-runner-up-180x119.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cuisinart-runner-up-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Although the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E9HR7KG/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; TOB-135</a> is no longer our runner-up, we still love this very capable toaster oven. This oven is a fraction of the price of the Breville we reviewed and it goes for a similar look and feel. With a capacity of 0.33 cubic feet, it includes a broiling rack and baking pan and can accommodate six slices of bread, a 12-inch pizza, or a four-pound chicken.</p>
<p>It is one of the most versatile toaster ovens with nine preset cooking functions: toast, bagel, warm, bake, broil, reheat, defrost, convection bake and convection broil. The instruction and recipe booklet is well-written and simple to follow.</p>
<p>A formidable size, the Cuisinart also boasts a high 1800 watts in order to preheat quickly and cook effectively. The cooking results of the Cuisinart were nearly identical to the Breville. While toast evenness was not achieved, all of the other food items succeeded as expected. When we tested the convection mode, it produced exceptionally light, moist cupcakes compared to the other finalists.</p>

    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cusinart-led-screen.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The Cuisinart toaster oven also employs many features that promote a positive user experience. The buttons are easy to press and allow you to choose which aspect of cooking you want to control, including shade, temperature and timer. The selector is a dial that is easy to turn and highlights the buttons below if they&#8217;re available for your selected function allowing you to adjust values quickly.</p>
<p>The LCD digital display utilizes a soft blue backlight that prevents eyestrain. The auto shut-off is a convenient feature for multi-taskers who can’t always reach their food immediately. The crumb tray is easily accessible from the outside of the toaster oven.</p>
<p>While the brushed stainless steel is virtually the same, the clean, modern design remains second to our top pick. Sporting a more approachable price tag without sacrificing the sharp look or any important features, the Cuisinart Deluxe Convection claimed the runner-up spot.</p>
<h3>KitchenAid &#8211; KCO211BM</h3>

<p>For this 2019 update, we tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07T3J3B13/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KCO211BM</a>, the company’s newest toaster oven. The KitchenAid has nine programmed settings that are the same as the other toaster ovens we tested. One function we hadn’t seen before is the program specifically for baking cookies. In this mode, the KitchenAid works like a convection (which it is not) and distributes heat evenly from top to bottom. We tested this function by baking cupcakes, and results were identical to the cupcakes we baked in the convection toaster ovens.</p>
<p>In fact, although the KitchenAid took a little longer to bake, its performance matched our budget pick, the BLACK+DECKER. Two design flaws, however, knocked it down in our rating. It’s on the expensive side, about $50 less than the Cuisinart, but it has only two slots for racks, as opposed to the Cuisinart’s four.</p>
<p>We found that the upper rack was too high, and the lower rack was too low, so we needed to move food between them to prevent over- or under-cooking. The second issue we had was with the KitchenAid’s internal capacity. It’s about the same size as the Breville, but we could not fit a standard-size cupcake tin inside.</p>

<h3>Oster &#8211; 6-Slice Counter Top Oven</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003Z34OME/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oster 6-Slice Counter Top Oven</a> is the largest toaster oven that we tested, with the ability to fit six slices of bread, a 12-inch pizza and a whole chicken. It provides six different pre-set cooking functions along with its convection mode. While its convection fan didn’t yield cupcakes as light and moist as our top two choices, the Oster was one of the two toaster ovens to produce evenly shaded toast.</p>
<p>The interior light provides decent visibility of the food. The touchpad controls are easy to navigate and the crumb tray is easy to access. The black and stainless steel design gives it a moderate aesthetic appeal.</p>
<h3>Waring &#8211; TCO650</h3>
<p><em>(Editor&#8217;s note: The Waring &#8211; TCO650 is no longer available on Amazon, but it can be purchased directly from the <a href="http://www.waringpro.com/catalog.php?pcID=135&amp;product_id=506" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Waring site</a>.)</em></p>
<p>The Waring &#8211; TCO650 Pro Digital Convection Oven is the heaviest toaster oven on our list. Weighing 22.8 pounds, it can cook up to six slices of pizza or a 12-inch pizza at once. Powered by 1500 watts, it can perform five different pre-set cooking functions. The Waring was the other toaster oven that succeeded in producing evenly shaded toast, but when it came to the convection cooking test, its cupcakes were also not as airy and spongy as our top two picks.</p>
<p>The design is somewhat dated, but the black and stainless steel makes it moderately attractive. It lacks an interior light, but the simple, clearly marked buttons and dial selector are redeeming qualities.</p>
<h3>Panasonic &#8211; NG-B110P</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E07D76S/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; NG-B110P Flash Xpress Toaster Oven</a> is the most unique finalist. While it is made of stainless steel like the others, it is the only white and square toaster oven. With 1300 watts and infrared technology, it is the most powerful toaster oven without convection cooking. In all of the tests, it led in cooking speed, and in turn, it had a tendency to brown all of the food items too quickly. The speed demon offers some interesting pre-set cooking functions: toast, waffle, roll, pizza, hash browns, reheat.</p>
<p>With useful features like an interior light, nonstick interior and auto-eject rack, it is also the most impressive toaster oven without convection cooking. However, Panasonic’s inefficient design is where it fell short. You cannot adjust the time or temperature for any of the preset settings, and when you can, you have to commit to the tedious task of excessive button-pushing because of its lack of a dial.</p>
<h3>Hamiton Beach &#8211; 31344D</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AO24YX8/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 31344D Easy Reach Oven</a> is the adult version of the Easy Bake Oven. The gray color and curved design distinguish it from its competitors and with a sliding door that you push upwards from the bottom, it lives up to its name. The lightweight toaster oven uses 1200 watts and can accommodate four slices of bread and a 9-inch pizza.</p>
<p>It performed well in the garlic bread, frozen pizza and baked potato tests, but it did not produce even toast or rounded cupcake tops The Hamilton Beach is notable in its simplicity with three basic cooking functions and two dials to control the temperature and time.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The toaster oven is an all-in-one product that can perform any number of cooking functions efficiently and effectively. A good toaster oven provides a household with simple user experience and convenient cooking method.</p>
<p>Our pick for the best toaster oven is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XBOXVIA/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville Smart Oven Pro</a> because of its style, usability and versatility. Its features made operating it a breeze, and the pre-set cooking functions made for endless possibilities.</p>
<p>We also recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0AWSJX/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; TOB-260N1 Chef&#8217;s Convection</a>, which has the same features as the Breville, but it&#8217;s one-third less expensive.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re on a tight budget or have limited counter space, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GGFHH4U/?tag=ybdoven-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BLACK+DECKER &#8211; TO1313SBD</a> is a great choice. This lightweight, low wattage four-slice toaster oven performs just as well as its pricier counterparts.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After two years of testing 11 different models, we still think the Cuisinart - Touch to Toast gives you the top toast experience. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter more than 30 hours researching, toasting and tasting breads, bagels and breakfast pastries, we determined that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006OQSNYY/?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; Touch to Toast Leverless </a> is the best 4-slice toaster for everyday use. The Cuisinart stands out as the most consistent, even when toasting multiple batches of toast back-to-back. If you need to conserve counter space and are on a budget, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005O6SK3Y?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 22790</a> is a good 2-slice option and a terrific value.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-found">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We began our quest to find the best toaster by compiling reviews and research from popular sources on home goods like Consumer Reports, Good Housekeeping, CNET and Bon Appetit magazine.</p>
<p>We also read cooking blogs and talked to other consumers to discover how often people use a toaster, what functions are most useful, what the most common complaints are and what makes a great toaster.</p>
<p>The predominant characteristics that people look for in a good toaster are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reliability: Does a given setting produce an expected result time after time?</li>
<li>Consistency: Is the food item toasted evenly over the entire surface?</li>
<li>Versatility: Can the toaster accommodate a wide variety of foods?</li>
<li>Aesthetics: How visually attractive is the appliance?</li>
<li>Footprint: How much counter space is used?</li>
<li>Features: Do special features work accurately and intuitively?</li>
<li>Cleaning: How easily can the appliance be cleared of crumbs and debris?</li>
<li>Affordability: Do better results necessarily require spending more money?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-you-need">Why you need a pop-up toaster</h2>
<p>Some may think that there are many ways to heat bread, bagels and frozen waffles. An oven that can handle a Thanksgiving turkey can surely accommodate a couple slices of bread and a pan over the stove can also toast bagels. So, why even bother with a slot toaster?</p>
<p>Slot toasters are the best and easiest way to make toast and a lot of other foods quickly and consistently.</p>
<p>Making toast in the oven &#8212; or even in one of the winners from our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-toaster-oven/">review of the best toaster ovens</a> &#8212; makes inferior, dried-out toast. Because of an oven’s size, the heat source is far from the bread and with the volume of air inside, food dries as it cooks, which is why marinate and baste chicken and turkey.</p>
<p>In a slot toaster, the heat source of heat is close and the duration of toasting is quick, so the moisture inside your bagels and bread doesn&#8217;t escape. This creates the crispy outside you want but leaves a warm, soft and chewy inside.</p>
<p>You can also make toast on a stovetop or even a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-portable-induction-cooktop/">portable induction cooktop</a>, and it&#8217;s certainly quicker than waiting for the oven to preheat, but the pan has to be actively tended and then washed. The ability to simply push a button or lever and then move on to other tasks makes a slot toaster much more convenient — particularly for those mornings when minutes seem to fly by as you try to get out the door.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-toast">Beyond toast</h2>
<p>Clearly, the toaster is an ideal tool for making toast, frozen breakfast treats and bagels. But the vertical slots of a toaster make it less versatile than a toaster oven when you&#8217;re heating or cooking other food. That is, it was, until someone invented a clever hack.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0012XGM92?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Toaster bags</a>, made of heat-resistant and food-safe silicone or Teflon, allow you to cook pretty much anything that will fit in the slots. The bags, which trap any crumbs, melting cheese, or loose topping are washable and reusable. This is now the quickest, cleanest and easiest way to reheat last night’s pizza or create gourmet sandwiches.</p>
<p>With the confined shape of toaster bags, you can also add your favorite toppings or spreads before toasting. Grilled cheese or even peanut butter sandwiches come out hot and ready without any extra dishes. During our testing, we even made toaster panini with chicken, pesto and goat cheese.</p>
<p>You can also make hot sandwiches in a waffle maker, but as we found out in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-waffle-maker/">review of the best waffle makers</a>, even a non-stick waffle iron takes much more work to clean up than a toaster bag.</p>

<h3>Number of slots</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3535" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2-vs-4-slice-toaster.jpg" alt="2 vs 4 slot toaster" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2-vs-4-slice-toaster.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2-vs-4-slice-toaster-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2-vs-4-slice-toaster-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2-vs-4-slice-toaster-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2-vs-4-slice-toaster-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2-vs-4-slice-toaster-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2-vs-4-slice-toaster-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2-vs-4-slice-toaster-180x119.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2-vs-4-slice-toaster-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>A single person or couple will most likely be served well with a two-slot toaster while a larger family would probably benefit from the extra slots, particularly when multiple people need to use it in a short time period.</p>
<p>The size of your kitchen and your aesthetic taste will also dictate how much of your counter space you want to dedicate to a toaster. For a 300-square-foot studio with a small kitchen, a two-slot toaster is probably going to be the right decision.</p>
<h3>Crumb tray</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3536" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/crumb-trays.jpg" alt="toaster crumb tray" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/crumb-trays.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/crumb-trays-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/crumb-trays-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/crumb-trays-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/crumb-trays-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/crumb-trays-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/crumb-trays-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/crumb-trays-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/crumb-trays-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/crumb-trays-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The crumb tray &#8212; a small, thin, metallic sheet that slides out from the bottom of the toaster &#8212; is a crucial feature. The tray catches all of the inevitable crumbs and debris that flake off bread during the toasting process. All of our finalists have crumb trays and we strongly advise against buying a toaster without one.</p>
<h3>Slot size</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3537" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/measuring-slot-width.jpg" alt="toaster slot width" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/measuring-slot-width.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/measuring-slot-width-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/measuring-slot-width-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/measuring-slot-width-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/measuring-slot-width-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/measuring-slot-width-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/measuring-slot-width-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/measuring-slot-width-180x119.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/measuring-slot-width-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The length and width of the slots will determine what can actually fit inside and smaller slots limit your ability to toast larger and more varied food items. The emerging standard width is 1½ inches, which is featured in all except one of our finalists. The lengths hover between 5 and 6 inches, with the exception of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AZY3TFE?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BTA830XL</a>, which sports two unique 10-inch long slots.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>

<p>Beyond simple toasting, there are several other pre-programmed features with which some toasters are equipped that change exactly how the toaster heats a given food item. For example, the most common feature is the bagel setting, which makes a darker, crispier inside and prevents over-cooking the crust of a bagel by changing the intensity of the different heated coils. While all of our finalists have a bagel function, they are not all created equal.</p>
<p>Another popular setting is the frozen or defrost button, which is designed for food coming directly from the freezer. Again, all of our finalists have this feature, but it performs differently from model to model.</p>
<p>Some frozen settings simply increase the time of a given cycle while others actually lower the intensity of the heat or more gradually increase it to prevent burning the outside before the inside is done.</p>
<p>Other popular features to consider are levers, push buttons, LED displays, sound alerts, countdown timers, a cancel function and the ability to lift the food high enough out of the slots to make removing it by hand easy and safe.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>More expensive toasters almost always look sharper and sleeker, but they don’t necessarily make drastically better toast. Cheaper options may take a bit longer and produce less even coloring and texture than pricier models, which often have more wattage and more heated wires.</p>
<p>It’s likely that a more expensive model that&#8217;s made with higher quality, more durable components will last longer. Some offer warranties while others don’t. In the end, your budget and personal preferences will help determine which one of our top picks will be your favorite.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Speed and consistency</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3540" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/toast-comparison.jpg" alt="toast comparison" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/toast-comparison.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/toast-comparison-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/toast-comparison-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/toast-comparison-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/toast-comparison-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/toast-comparison-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/toast-comparison-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/toast-comparison-180x119.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/toast-comparison-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We wanted to find out how reliably each toaster produced the same shading and texture on the same medium setting over five toasting cycles. Everyone likes toast a certain way, but can the toaster predictably create that certain way for you every time?</p>
<p>For this test, we used slices of Wonder Bread and set each finalist to its middle setting. We also wanted to see any difference between slots, so we cycled through the slots over the five consecutive toasting cycles.</p>
<p>All of the finalists we tested decrease the amount of time per cycle progressively as the machine gets hotter. The average time to reach a medium toast the first time around was two minutes, 47 seconds. That dropped to an average of two minutes, 15 seconds on the second round, with further incremental drops each round.</p>
<p>The toasters that created the most consistent results adjusted the time that the toast spent in the slots while also altering the intensity of the heat. The toaster with the smallest variance in time between rounds, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F5NUOH6?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oster -TSSTTRJBG1</a>, also produced some of the most similarly toasted slices round after round. Other toasters that offered close to uniform consistency were the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006OQSNYY/?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F5NUOH6?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> and the </a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005O6SK3Y?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F5NUOH6?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">.</a></p>
<p>Not only were the Cuisinart and Oster toasters reliable, they were also the two fastest, both with first round times of two minutes and two seconds. At just under four minutes, the now-discontinued Frigidaire &#8211; Professional was by far the slowest to achieve a medium toast.</p>
<h3>Toast quality</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3539" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/toast-evenness.gif" alt="toaster evenness" width="900" height="506" /></p>
<p>After observing the speed and consistency of multiple rounds, we turned our attention to the quality of the toast itself. We wanted to see bread that had been evenly colored from left to right, top to bottom and on both sides. The ideal toast would be crispy on the outside without being too dry or flaky all the way through — a bit of a crunch with a warm and light interior.</p>
<p>Many of the toasters provide an evenly shaded slice from left to right on the same side, but there is a discernible difference between the top and bottom, with the bottom almost always being a bit darker. There was also often a large variation from one side of the bread to the other.</p>
<p>Only the toast made with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005O6SK3Y?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 22790</a> was the same on both sides of the bread. All of the others produced toast with a lighter side and a darker side. With some, the difference was very slight, like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003TT2Q1U?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid</a> and Cuisinart, but many were noticeably darker on one side, as with the KRUPS toaster.</p>
<p>Making a taste comparison between the models is difficult, as everyone has different taste buds, different expectations and different reactions. However, the toast that the Frigidaire toaster made had a clearly different texture than all the others. It seemed denser and compressed: The edges crumbled and flaked with even the most careful handling.</p>
<h3>Settings</h3>
<h4>Bagels</h4>
<p>All of the toasters on our list of finalists include a bagel setting. Most also have a decal near the slots that illustrates what direction to face the sliced side of the bagel. The goal is to toast a bagel with a golden brown, crispy cut side and a warmed but still chewy opposite side. We used fresh bagels that we cut in half right before toasting, and we also double-checked the mode with a slice of bread to see how big the difference between sides really was.</p>
<p>The bagel setting works by increasing the heat on just one side of the slot. Clearly this technology has been well-developed, as we were pleased with most all of the bagels that popped up. The one disappointment was the Oster, which seemed to do the exact same thing to both sides of the bagel. The medium bagel setting was also much darker than we would have expected.</p>
<p>Krups earned some points here with a bagel setting that crisped the inside while only just warming the outside of the bagel.</p>
<h4>Frozen</h4>
<p>In order to test the ability of the direct-from-the-freezer setting, we set each toaster to either frozen or defrost and lowered a Pillsbury Toaster Strudel into the slot. The goal was a crispy, flakey exterior and a warm — but not too hot — gooey filling inside. In addition to our texture and taste observations, we used an infrared thermometer to measure the temperature of both the outside surface and the inside filling of the pastry after one, and if necessary, two rounds of toasting.</p>
<p>Both the Cuisinart and the Krups needed two rounds on frozen set to medium to cook a finished product that was ready to eat. After just one cycle, the pastry was just barely warm to the touch, with a cool, less-than-delicious center. The other models all succeeded in making a toaster strudel with an interior temperature above 160<span style="font-weight: 400;">°F </span>after the first cycle.</p>
<h4>Slot size</h4>
<p>While all the toasters we tested are marketed as having large, wide slots, we wanted to see how the machines actually handled larger slices of bread. We cut several loaves of french bread into ½-inch, 1-inch and 1½-inch-wide segments and ran them through our finalists. For reference, a slice of Wonder Bread is about half an inch.</p>
<p>As the slices get wider, they get closer to the heated wires inside the slots and the edges darken quicker and more dramatically than the middle surface area of the bread. If you typically enjoy a traditional sliced toast at any given setting, you may want to decrease the setting for thicker slices since it will toast quicker.</p>
<p>For some of our finalists, 1-inch-thick bread came out a bit uneven in terms of shading and quality. Several toasters, including the Hamilton Beach and the Oster could not accommodate the 1½-inch cut pieces; their slots were simply too narrow. The others performed with varying degrees of success, with the clear winner in this category being the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AZY3TFE?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville</a>.</p>
<h3>Surface heat</h3>
<p>Obviously the inside of the toaster will be hot, but the outside should remain relatively cool to be handled easily after use. Again, we used our infrared thermometer to take the temperature of the outside surface of the toaster after one and two rounds on the medium setting.</p>
<p>Most of our finalists hung around the mid 80s and low 90s (F°) for surface temperature, which is warm but not dangerously hot. However, the Oster shot up above 100<span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span> after just one round and to 122<span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span> after the second. At this temperature, the toaster was very hot to the touch and couldn’t be moved without <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-oven-mitts/">oven mitts</a> for several minutes.</p>
<h3>Other features</h3>
<p>Finally, we tried to take into account all the other aspects of the user experience that are hard to quantify but are still important. We looked at how easily the crumb trays are removed and cleaned and how efficiently they trap crumbs inside the machine. We spent hours assessing how intuitive and easy each toaster is to use.</p>
<p>We observed LED screens, timers, lever lifts that raise the toast higher out of the slots and push buttons that automatically lower and raise the food. We compared dings, beeps and the feeling you get from using and simply looking at the toaster in the kitchen to help determine the best of the best.</p>

<p>Across all of our testing, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006OQSNYY/?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; CPT-440 Touch to Toast</a> performed extremely well. It is consistent, very fast and evenly shades the entire surface of sliced bread. The four slots are wide enough to accommodate large, 1½-inch-wide food, the dual crumb trays catch a large majority of debris, and the stainless steel finish looks sharp. It’s a well-performing appliance and a great addition to any kitchen.</p>
<p>During our test for consistency, the Cuisinart continued to decrease the time bread spent lowered into the slots, ensuring that a medium toast looked the same after five rounds as it did after the first.</p>
<p>The toast was also well-colored from top to bottom and side to side, with just the slightest detectable difference front to back. The outside was hot and crispy while the inside maintained a moistness and chewy mouthfeel that was perfect.</p>
<p>At just two minutes and two seconds to complete the first round of medium toasting, the Cuisinart toaster is the fastest four-slot toaster and matched the fastest two slot, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F5NUOH6?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oster</a>. Four slices of toast in just over two minutes puts the Cuisinart toaster in a league of its own.</p>

<p>Because of the shorter toasting time, the Cuisinart does not accumulate the surface heat that other machines do. In fact, the Cuisinart is the only finalist we tested that stayed below a 90-degree surface temperature after multiple runs. It can safely and easily be moved around the kitchen immediately after use.</p>
<p>The one test the Cuisinart toaster failed to hit out of the park was frozen food. It required a second round of toasting to bring the interior temperature of the toaster strudel up to the desired heat. While that may not be ideal, it still got the job done in a timely manner.</p>
<p>The bagel setting functions as it should ,and the bagels we enjoyed from the Cuisinart toaster were expertly crisped on the cut side and warm and soft on the outside. Just place the bagel in the slots as pictured on the machine and press the bagel button.</p>
<p>The extra-large slots can handle food items that are 1½ inches wide, so toasted sandwiches, frozen pretzels, or left-over pizza can easily be accommodated in a toaster bag. Keep in mind that you may want to lower the setting for extra-wide foods, as they do get close to the heated wires.</p>
<p>We also really like the design of the Cuisinart. The push-button automatic chamber feels futuristic and the heating mechanism slowly squeezes the food once it’s lowered to guarantee an even, complete toasting. The large LED screen is easy to view and the settings are intuitive.</p>

<p>At just under $85 for high-quality components and craftsmanship that make great toast and can handle so many more common cooking tasks, the Cuisinart four-slot toaster is our pick for best overall.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>

<p>If a four-slot toaster gives away too much precious counter space and you&#8217;re in the market for something more compact, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005O6SK3Y?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 22790</a> is the right choice. And at under $25, it offers the best value.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach toaster offers even shading over the entire surface of bread and the same on both sides. However, it does tend to toast darker in consecutive uses, so you may want to adjust the setting as you go, if you’re making lots of toast or bagels.</p>

<p>Both the defrost setting and the bagel setting operate extremely well. Our breakfast pastry was a hot 225<span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span> on the outside and a warm 185<span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span> on the inside, perfect and ready to eat after just one round. Our bagel had the optimal temperature and texture on both the crust side and cut side.</p>
<p>The compact design of the Hamilton Beach toaster means slightly smaller slots, measuring just past 1¼ inch wide. While that may somewhat limit your options, it is a necessary trade for a smaller footprint and a high-quality product.</p>
<p>One thing the Hamilton does better than any other machine we tested is making it easy to remove your food. The lever can be raised beyond its neutral resting position to bring the food clear of the hot slots. This allows you to get your food out without having to resort to a utensil or worrying about burning your fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Hamilton Beach toaster gives quality results on a budget.</li>
<li>&#8220;Toast boost&#8221; levers lifts food higher for easier removal.</li>
<li>Batch-to-batch results will vary more than with our top picks.</li>
<li>The Hamilton Beach defrosts a frozen pastry perfectly after one round.</li>

<p>Cuisinart has a toaster to fit every budget. The Touch to Toast model above is still the best of the best unless you need to toast something that won&#8217;t fit in the slots, but we know some readers want a value-priced toaster instead. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B0000A1ZN1/?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; CPT-180 Classic</a> gets you the impeccable toast quality of the 440, but at a much lower price. (It&#8217;s a bit easier to find, too.)</p>
<p>When you drop down from the Touch to Toast model to the Classic, you&#8217;re giving up the motorized levers, countdown timer, and a little bit of quality in the parts and finish.<br />
That said, the internal parts of Cusinart&#8217;s toasters all seem to be very similar, if not identical.</p>
<p>The one test where the stainless-sided Classic model pulls away from its siblings is in the defrost mode: For whatever reason, this was the only Cuisinart toaster we tested that kept heating until a frozen pastry was a piping-hot 157<span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span> on the inside. That&#8217;s not quite as hot as the Breville or Hamilton Beach results but nearly perfect for a quick snack.</p>

Evenly toasted results every time. This model works better on the defrost setting, though the slots are narrower.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000A1ZN1ybdslice-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>There are a few things holding this toaster back from the very top spot, however.<br />
For one, the slots are slightly narrow, with the wire holders only accepting slices 1.2 inches wide compared to the full 1.5-inch capacity of the CPT-440. The rest of the build quality is a little bit lower than the CPT-180 440 as well, with knobs and buttons that feel more like a $40 toaster than a $60 toaster should. And if we want to be really picky, the toast from this and the other Cuisinart toasters was often a little darker on one side than the other.</p>
<p>When all the crumbs are swept away, the heating element and temperature controls are what count most, and this Cuisinart is as good as it gets.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Cuisinart &#8211; CPT-180, like the CPT-440, consistently pops out great toast.</li>
<li>For defrosting toaster pastries, the CPT-180 was the best among Cuisinart models we tested.</li>
<li>Narrower slots make this model slightly less versatile than the CPT-440.</li>
<li>The Cuisinart &#8211; CPT-180 is not the cheapest toaster we tested, but the price for performance is excellent.</li>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AZY3TFE?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BTA-830XL</a> (about $180) is a two-slot toaster unlike all others. It can fit four regular slices of bread, two bagels or two larger pieces of sourdough within its two 10-by-1.75-inch slots. This can come in handy when toasting irregular slices of bread, making paninis or reheating a slice of pizza with a toaster bag.</p>
<p>Its modern matte stainless-steel design features a motor that slowly lowers and automatically raises the slices when they’re toasted without the user manually pushing down a lever and eliminating the need for a sudden pop-up when the toast is done.</p>

<p>During the evenness tests, we found that the Breville’s toast was close to the same shade across the slice, but the crust was slightly darker than the middle. However, after toasting five consecutive slices, the toast increased in doneness and by the last slice, the edges were burned.</p>
<p>The toaster continued to accumulate heat as our testing progressed and it was hotter to the touch at the end of several rounds than most other toasters we tested. After one toasting, which lasted two minutes and 40 seconds, the outside temperature was 85<span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span>, and after the second one-minute and 55-second toasting, it was 91<span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span>.</p>
<p>During our frozen pastry test, the Breville performed very well and the Toaster Strudel was perfectly toasted after just one round on the frozen setting — even though the outer edges ended up a bit more toasted than the middle. The outside crust came in at 210<span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span> and the inside filling was 162<span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span>.</p>
<p>When it came to toasting bagels, we found that the bagel setting performed as it should; the outside was still soft but warmed up, and the sliced inside was browned and toasted. However, the inside of the bagel was a bit too dark on the medium setting. Those who don’t want their bagel too brown should take it down to a lower level.</p>
<p>The Breville can accommodate bread just a bit wider than normal and a slice much longer than any other toaster we tested. However, it did brown the edges of the bread more than the middle, which is a pretty common trait as breads increase in thickness.</p>
<p>The Lift &amp; Look button allows the user to move the slices up and down slightly during the toasting process to observe the shade of the toast. As it toasts, its LED display shows a visual countdown of when the toast will be done. When it’s finished toasting, it slowly raises the slices and emits a soft beep, which is adjustable in volume.</p>
<p>After we finished the testing, it came time to clear the crumb tray. We found that it’s easy to remove but doesn’t cover a large amount of surface area under the toaster. Compared with other toasters, many more crumbs were caught on the floor of the toaster and less ended up in the crumb tray.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AZY3TFE/?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BTA-830XL</a> is perfect for artisanal breads like sourdough.</li>
<li>Two extra-long slots give this a wider, narrower footprint than other four-slice toasters.</li>
<li>LED tracking light that displays the progress of the toast is a great touch on a minimalist design.</li>

<p><em>(Editor&#8217;s note: For this 2019 update we tested three new models to see how they compared with our top picks. The new toasters did the basic tasks of toasting bread and bagels and heating frozen food, but there were discernible negative differences between them and our top picks for 2-slice and 4-slice toasters.)</em></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075H63RZS/?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KMT2116QG</a> is an attractive 2-slice toaster that melds modern technology with a retro look.  It doesn’t have a wide range of functions, so it’s very easy to use. Like the Breville, this KitchenAid model has a handy “lift and see” lever that allows you to check on the toast’s shading without interrupting the toasting cycle. It also has a “keep warm” button that holds the toast at a low setting for three minutes.</p>
<p>Of the seven shade settings, the first three were too low and barely colored the bread or bagel. The fourth shade setting was more to our liking and toasted the bread an even golden-brown. We had less success toasting a bagel; at the fourth setting, only the top of the bagel toasted. We turned the bagel upside down and toasted it again, and this way we finally got an evenly toasted bagel.</p>
<p>As we experienced with other toasters, the defrost setting successfully toasted the frozen pastry crust, and although this setting was very hot, the pastry’s filling was cold. The model we tested was KitchenAid’s “liquid graphite” color and sells for $64 (the red and black toasters are about $15 more), which we think is too expensive for a toaster that doesn’t perform as well as the 2-slice Hamilton Beach.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BBKKZMP/?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Proctor Silex &#8211; 24216</a> is a four-slot toaster with a plastic casing and very basic functions. It has six shade settings, but it toasts very lightly with the first three. We increased the shade setting and then tested the two end slots and the two middle slots separately: Both toasted the top half of the toast more than the bottom half.</p>
<p>The Proctor Silex doesn’t have a bagel function, but it actually toasted a bagel evenly with crispy bits on the cut side, and the non-cut side had the requisite chew that bagel lovers love. With the frozen pastry, it was trial and error. We toasted the pastry once, and since it needed more crisping, we flipped it over, lowered the setting and toasted it again. Finally, we got the results we wanted &#8212; flaky pastry and hot filling &#8212; but it took a lot of trouble to get them. The Proctor Silex is well-priced, but for a few dollars more, the Cuisinart &#8211; CBT-180 is a better toaster.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PJ7GB88/?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 24990</a> was just released this year. It’s a four-slot toaster made of brushed stainless and would look great in any kitchen. Its four slots are wide and long to accommodate irregularly cut bread. Like other toasters we tested, it has buttons for bagel, defrost, reheat and cancel and two knobs with seven shade settings. Hamilton Beach markets this toaster as “professional,” which is boldly stamped on the toaster’s front. You might find this toaster in a small diner, but besides that, no restaurant would use it.</p>
<p>During our first use, an acrid smell rose up from the slots, which made our first toast test unappetizing. It eventually wore off by the third test. Repeatedly, in all of our tests, the bread and bagels were evenly shaded, but slices facing the right side of the toaster browned darker than the left-facing slices. Also, the outer slots popped up at least 10 seconds before the inner slots.</p>
<p>The top half of the slots seemed to be less hot than the bottom half, as evidenced by our bagel, which popped up two-toned. The Hamilton Beach defrosted the frozen pastry, and the filling was hot, but again, the right-facing side browned more.</p>
<p>We expected more from a $60 toaster, and perhaps once Hamilton Beach fine tunes this brand-new model, it will be worth the price.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0083VCY16?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Krups &#8211; KH734D</a> is a four-slot toaster made of mirror-finished stainless steel and has a clean, modern look. Like the other four-slice toasters, it takes up a large amount of counter space, but its rounded edges give a sleeker, more circular appearance. For under $60, this is an impressively well-made toaster.</p>
<p>It proved itself as one of the most consistent toasters when we ran multiple batches. It reliably produced the same shading, texture and temperature across five slices of bread in our consistency test. However, it toasted one side of the bread more than the other and the bottoms of some slices didn’t toast as well as the rest of the slice. Overall, the Krups is also calibrated on the lighter side. Most users will find themselves only using settings four through six.</p>
<p>Bagels toasted perfectly with the Krups toaster. The inside was crunchy and a toasty golden brown and the outside was warm without getting too crisp.  Just remember to set it fairly high if you want to see some actual browning.</p>
<p>On the whole, there are a few more issues holding the Krups back. When it’s done toasting the popping sound is fairly subtle. Then, even when it’s fully raised, smaller slices of bread and our breakfast pastry did not clear the edges of the slot, making pulling them out tricky, with lots of care needed.</p>
<p>As with our top pick, the Krups didn&#8217;t heat our frozen toaster pastry through on the defrost setting, and the filling was only 88<span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span>. In comparison, the Cusinart &#8211; Classic nailed it on the first cycle.</p>
<h3>Oster &#8211; TSSTTRJBG1</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F5NUOH6?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oster &#8211; TSSTTRJBG1</a>, also called the &#8220;Jelly Bean,&#8221; is a two-slot toaster that produces a medium toast that looks exactly the same every time. It also toast faster than any four-slot toaster, popping out medium toast in under two minutes in every round after the first.</p>
<p>While the Oster does have a bagel setting, it does not appear to operate any differently from the traditional toast setting. Our bagel came out crispy and a bit dry on both sides.</p>
<p>The Oster’s exterior also heats up much more than our other finalists. After just two cycles on medium, the sides of the machine were 120<span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span>, nearly 20 degrees hotter than any other toaster we tested and very hot to the touch.</p>
<h3>Bella &#8211; 90076 Pro Series 4-slice</h3>
<p>Bella had our attention after they cleaned up in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-waffle-maker/">waffle iron review</a>, so we tested the Best-Buy exclusive <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/bella-pro-series-4-slice-wide-self-centering-slot-toaster-stainless-steel/6261437.p?skuId=6261437" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bella &#8211; 90076 Pro Series 4-slice toaster</a> on account of a second-best overall rank in Consumer Reports&#8217;s toaster reviews. It failed to win our hearts.</p>
<p>For about $10 less, the Cuisinart Classic had a more balanced range of toast settings, and the Bella didn&#8217;t differentiate enough on the bagel setting. Bella&#8217;s settings all ran a little longer than Cuisinart&#8217;s, and the toast was always darker on one edge.</p>
<h3>Black+Decker &#8211; TR2900SSD 2-slice</h3>
<p>We searched far and wide for another reputable, easy-to-find budget toaster, and the <a href="https://www.target.com/p/black-decker-2-slice-toaster-stainless-steel/-/A-50939822" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; TR2900SSD</a> at Target is a near-miss. This two-slice toaster with a brushed stainless-steel finish is fairly attractive, and they were least trying to be a little bit different with the cancel button in the middle of the control knob.</p>
<p>The Black+Decker delivered a good slice of toast, but the consistency across batches wasn&#8217;t as good as Cuisinart and the bagel setting was barely different from the toast setting. It also took 40 seconds longer to toast than the Cuisinart. At about $5 more than the Hamilton Beach, there&#8217;s really no reason to prefer this model.</p>
<h3>KitchenAid &#8211; KMT223 2-slice (discontinued)</h3>
<p>KitchenAid discontinued the sleek, high-end KMT223 two-slot toaster in 2019. During our initial testing, we observed that the KitchenAid toaster failed to modify the time and heat intensity in consecutive uses. Each slice of toast was darker and drier than the one before. There was also a clear difference between the bottom and top of the bread itself:  The bottom half toasted darker than the top half. The KitchenAid performed very well on both the bagel and the frozen food tests, however.</p>
<h3>Cuisinart &#8211; CPT-122 (discontinued)</h3>
<p><em>(Editor&#8217;s note: Since our review, Cuisinart has discontinued this model, although it is still available at many online retailers.)</em></p>
<p>Cuisinart&#8217;s line is carefully segmented by price and feature set: each retailer has a slightly different model, though most of them produce very similar toast.</p>
<p>The major practical difference between this toaster and the CPT-160 or CPT-180 &#8220;Classic&#8221; models is the insulating nature of the plastic sides: The hottest spot we could find on the sides of the plastic toaster was 97<span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span> after toasting most of a loaf of bread, compared to 130-degree hotspots on other toasters. Safety concerns really aren&#8217;t much different, though: Most toasters won&#8217;t burn you if you brush your hand against the side, and this plastic model still has metal slots that concentrate the 900 watts of heat up top.</p>
<p>The plastic Cuisinart, like the top-of-the-line digital model, requires multiple runs of &#8220;defrost&#8221; to actually get the inside of a frozen pastry hot. The Cuisinart &#8211; CPT-180 and Hamilton Beach &#8211; 24990 toasters fared better in that test.</p>
<h3>Frigidaire &#8211; Professional 4-slice (discontinued)</h3>
<p>We tested this digital-control toaster in our original roundup to see how it stacked up against the other premium models. We liked the reflective stainless steel finish and the digital LED countdown timer, but toast quality was disappointing. Frigidaire has discontinued this model and hasn&#8217;t replaced it.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Slot toasters are incredibly efficient and provide the perfect texture and toast shade quicker, easier and more reliably than other methods. With the use of reusable toaster bags, a good toaster becomes a versatile and almost essential appliance for any kitchen.</p>
<p>Our pick for the best 4-slice toaster is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006OQSNYY/?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; CPT-440 Touch to Toast Leverless</a> because of its consistency, usability and value. The four slots are wide enough to handle almost any food; the pre-programmed settings for bagels and frozen food work exceptionally well; and it looks and feels sharp and modern.</p>
<p>If a compact 2-slice toaster is the right decision for your kitchen, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005O6SK3Y?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 22790 Classic</a> provides the best quality without sacrificing a lot of counter space. It’s a good value and makes great toast every time.</p>
<p>If those premium digital control features aren&#8217;t what you&#8217;re looking for, the performance from the more conventional <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B0000A1ZN1/?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; CPT-180</a> is also very good.</p>
<p>For a bit more versatility, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AZY3TFE?tag=ybdslice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BTA830XL</a> offers unique 10-inch-long slots that are perfect for artisanal breads or reheating pizza. It also includes great features like &#8220;A Bit More,&#8221; which gives your food just a little more toasting, plus &#8220;Lift &amp; Look,&#8221; which lets you quickly see the food without halting the heating cycle.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter more than 35 hours of researching, handling, testing and cleaning the best oven mitts on the market, we concluded that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WUDQ61W/?tag=ybdmitt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HOMWE &#8211; Silicone Oven Mitts</a> are our top choice. They offer more coverage of the wrist and forearm than any other mitt we tested. These mitts also provide a secure grip for heavy items, and they&#8217;re flexible enough to manage small kitchen tools. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001HW3VG0/?tag=ybdmitt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; Silicone Oven Mitt</a> is another top contender.</p>

[Review Update: We originally tested the Red Lantana brand which ended up being our top pick, but this brand seems to have been discontinued. We&#8217;ve found that there is an identical replacement from HOMWE and have replaced all mentions and links in the article to point to the HOMWE as the new replacement.]
<h2 id="how-we-found">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>First, we dove into researching the best oven mitts, combing through blogs, reviews, burn statistics, and magazine articles. We watched videos of testing techniques and developed a system for rating our top mitts using both qualitative and quantitative data.</p>
<p>Then, we spent three days in an increasingly hot kitchen testing our top eight oven mitts in a variety of scenarios designed to measure their heat resistance, usability, and ease of cleaning. We also analyzed their aesthetics, materials, and design features.</p>
<p>All told, we spent more than 35 hours reading about, analyzing, and testing our top products.</p>
<p>We read blog posts that discussed different mitt features and materials, watched video reviews of the top oven mitts on the market, and analyzed test results from a variety of cooking websites.</p>
<p>First and foremost, oven mitts should protect the skin from burns. But after researching the features of the best oven mitts, we found that consumers want a lot more from this simple kitchen tool.</p>
<p>We found that people look for the following features most often when shopping for an oven mitt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heat protection</li>
<li>Maneuverability</li>
<li>Durability</li>
<li>Aesthetics</li>
<li>Affordability</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we finalized the metrics, we used them to shop for the best oven mitts and selected our top picks.</p>
<h2 id="best-mitts">Compare the best oven mitts</h2>
[table id=1 /]
<h2 id="why-you-need">Why you need a good oven mitt</h2>
<p>Even if you only cook occasionally, an oven mitt is essential. Cast iron, aluminum, and Pyrex are used in cookware because they’re excellent conductors of heat. While this is great for your food, it’s dangerous for your hands.</p>
<p>In order to insulate and protect your hands from burns, an extra layer of protection is key. Some people resort to using a dish towel, but they’re often too thin, don’t offer enough grip, and can cause burns when heat transfers through a wet towel. They must be folded in a way that restricts the mobility of the hands, and the cloth will easily burn.</p>
<p>Traditional potholders — squares of thick or knitted fabric used for handling hot dishes — provide no protection for the back of hands, wrists, or forearms. These exposed parts of the arm can easily come into contact with the hot interior walls and racks of an oven.</p>
<p>While it’s true that you won’t see oven mitts in professional kitchens, this is largely because hands that cook for a living have acquired calloused, more tolerant skin. Unless you’re willing to earn those chef hands through countless burns, you’re much better off using an oven mitt.</p>
<p>Not only are burns unpleasant and painful, but they can also cause infections and require medical treatment. In fact, more than 40,000 Americans visit the emergency room each year from burns suffered by direct contact with a hot surface. The best way to ensure safety when handling hot items in the kitchen is with oven mitts.</p>
<h2 id="use">How can I use an oven mitt?</h2>
<p>Oven mitts are ergonomically designed so you can confidently reach into a broiling oven and grab hold of anything — regardless of shape, size, or weight — and be able to move it safely and easily. Today, oven mitts are made with synthetic materials, like silicone, Kevlar, and Nomex, to increase heat resistance and provide a stronger grip.</p>
<p>Oven mitts aren’t just single-use products. Aside from handling hot kitchenware, they can be used for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grilling</li>
<li>Tending a campfire</li>
<li>Handling hot light bulbs</li>
<li>Protecting surfaces from hot dishes, like a trivet</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="things">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Material</h3>
<p>Cotton is an antiquated technology when it comes to oven mitts. None of the top eight mitts we tested relied on cotton alone to protect from heat.</p>
<p>Most of the best oven mitts use silicone, which can withstand temperatures in excess of 400 degrees Fahrenheit for a prolonged period without burning or melting. Silicone also ensures a more secure grip with a hot surface and it won’t slide like cotton.</p>
<p>Other mitts, like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0797DTFLM/?tag=ybdmitt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">‘Ove’ Glove</a>, are made using high-tech synthetic materials like Kevlar and Nomex. Kevlar is an incredibly strong fiber, used to manufacture bulletproof vests. When it comes to oven mitts, it provides a lot of durability and security. Nomex is a heat and flame-resistant material that often serves as the foundation for firefighter apparel and auto racing track suits.</p>

<h3>Size and Shape</h3>
<p>For an oven mitt to be the most effective, it must enclose the entire hand and have a cuff that covers the wrist and the beginning of the forearm. Our top eight products offer this kind of protection.</p>
<p>Most products on the market are designed in the style of a mitten, keeping the four fingers separate from the thumb. By forcing the four fingers together, this style may provide a stronger, more secure handle for heavier loads.</p>
<p>However, there are five-fingered glove options as well. This glove style allows for more delicate maneuvers, like stirring a dish with a kitchen utensil while it remains inside the oven or manipulating hot food directly.</p>
<h3>Appearance/Aesthetics</h3>
<p>Because oven mitts are used so frequently, they often become a part of a kitchen’s decor. Many people choose to hang or display their oven mitts, which makes their design an important feature to consider. Many of the mitts we tested come equipped with a small loop for the purpose of hanging them.</p>
<p>Some mitts are available in a variety of colors and patterns and are designed to go on display in a kitchen. Others look more utilitarian, like the fully silicone mitts, which can appear rubbery and unattractive.</p>
<h3>Price per mitt</h3>
<p>While price is a factor in choosing an oven mitt, it shouldn’t be a limiting one. As we were selecting our top pick, we chose not to weigh price heavily. We decided to focus primarily on performance metrics because an oven mitt should last many years, and the ones we tested are similar in price.</p>
<p>If you’re comparing prices, it’s important to consider the cost per mitt. Oven mitts are packaged in singles and in pairs. Our top eight were evenly split, with four products sold as pairs and four sold solo.</p>
<p>Most oven mitts cost under $20 for a pack of one or two. Our top eight range from about $7 per mitt to $18 per mitt. Our top pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WUDQ61W/?tag=ybdmitt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HOMWE &#8211; Silicone Oven Mitts</a>, come in a pack of two and fall on the lower end of the price per mitt range, at around $8.50 per mitt.</p>
<p>Many people can get by with just one, but we recommend owning two oven mitts to ensure a proper hold on heavy trays and dishes. We found that packs of two have the best value: a lower price per mitt and the extra support when you need it.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested our finalists</h2>
<h3>Dexterity test</h3>
<p>Most of the time, an oven mitt will be used to remove a dish from a hot oven, but sometimes a greater range of motion is required. During the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-portable-induction-cooktop/">cooking</a> process, we stir and mix contents, add new ingredients, measure temperature and rearrange racks — all with our hands in a hot oven.</p>
<p>We can also use oven mitts to assist us in handling hot surfaces like grills and household items like lightbulbs.</p>
<p>To test the flexibility and dexterity of our mitts, we used each one to pick up a tablespoon from a kitchen counter and then changed our grip of the spoon in a various ways. We rolled and rotated the spoon, grabbing different parts of the handle and maneuvering it as one might do when stirring or scooping food in the oven or over a hot stove.</p>

<p>The only product we tested that separated all five fingers was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0797DTFLM/?tag=ybdmitt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The ‘Ove’ Glove</a>, and it easily performed best. We were able to freely and quickly manipulate the spoon in our covered hand. The ‘Ove’ Glove also allows you to wrap your fingers around the handles of a dish or pot, which can make for a more secure grip on certain kinds of cookware.</p>
<p>Many of the silicone mitts offer a similar experience in terms of flexibility. The Calphalon Textiles &#8211; Twill Thumb Mitt and ZBling Mitts, because they have thicker cotton insulation, are bulkier and harder to maneuver. We could lift the spoon off the counter, but we couldn&#8217;t do much with it. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H0OJPTG/?tag=ybdmitt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Triumphant Chef</a> mitts provided more dexterity and allowed for manipulation of the spoon.</p>
<p>The OXO Good Grips mitt was much more difficult to use in this test because of the gripping strips that run across both sides of the mitts and wrap around the palm to cover the thumb. While they’re great for securely holding larger objects, they make it difficult to change your grip or perform other actions with smaller items in hand.</p>
<p>Likewise, the design of the Mastrad mitt, which forces the thumb under the four fingers instead of to the side, resulted in a limited range of motion and control over the spoon.</p>
<h3>Cleaning test</h3>
<p>Since oven mitts often end up on display in the kitchen and must be cleaned frequently to avoid spreading germs, it is important that they be easily and effectively washed.</p>
<p>In general, silicone is a great repellent of liquid. Simply wiping down or rinsing the silicone shell of many of the mitts was sufficient to keep them looking sharp. If a mitt has any fabric components, including the wrist cuff area and the interior lining, it can be much more prone to attracting grime, grease, and food stains.</p>
<p>To measure how our mitts stood up to common kitchen spills, we stained each mitt with a quarter-sized drop of two common kitchen condiments: hot sauce and soy sauce. If the mitt’s shell material was silicone, we stained the cotton liner in order to equally compare products.</p>
<p>We allowed the stains to set for two hours and then followed the recommended cleaning instructions for each product.</p>
<p>Some oven mitts — like the Calphalon, the OXO Good Grips, and The ‘Ove’ Glove — are completely machine washable. While tossing them in the laundry is easy, the spots of each condiment were still obvious after two washing cycles. The soy sauce stain faded more than the hot sauce, but both were still clearly visible on the light-colored cotton sections of the mitts.</p>
<p>The Mastrad mitt recommends separating the outer silicone shell from the cotton liner to wash. Both condiments wiped off very easily from the stain-repellant shell, and we added the machine-washable liner to the laundry load with the other mitts. After cleaning both components of the Mastrad, the liner and shell came out looking like new.</p>
<p>The ‘Ove’ Glove, made with Dupont’s high-tech flame resistant fabrics, proved the most difficult to clean. It’s the only white glove in the top eight, and its exterior stains remain visible.</p>
<p>Care instructions for the other mitts — the HOMWE and The Triumphant Chef recommend hand-washing with warm water and soap. These gloves cleaned up much better, and the condiment stains disappeared with one wash. In particular, The Triumphant Chef required the least amount of effort to remove the stains.</p>
<p>While the ZBling Mitts lacked cleaning instructions, we decided to be safe and hand-wash them. The condiments left a faint stain on the cotton part near the wrist.</p>
<p>The Triumphant Chef and Mastrad have no exterior fabric — just water-repellent silicone — so we performed our cleaning test on the interior lining. Because these gloves have less stainable surface area, they’re more likely to look better longer.</p>
<h3>Heat test</h3>
<p>We learned a lot about our mitts by testing their flexibility and how well they cleaned up, but nothing is more important than the protection they provide against heat. To measure their insulation capability, we placed the same ceramic casserole dish in the same oven set at 450 degrees.</p>
<p>After 15 minutes of baking, we used each oven mitt to pull the dish and its glass lid out of the oven. We gripped the dish the same way with each mitt, with fingers holding the bottom and thumbs keeping the glass lid in place.</p>
<p>We held the dish and timed how long it took for the initial feeling of heat to come through the mitt to the skin. Our results established three tiers of protection among the top eight.</p>

<p>The top performers protected our hands from the heat for upwards of 50 seconds. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001HW3VG0/?tag=ybdmitt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips</a> — with its thick cotton insulation, silicone construction, and added textured strips — exceeded all other mitts, at 59 seconds. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H0OJPTG/?tag=ybdmitt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Triumphant Chef</a> also provided excellent protection.</p>
<p>We felt the heat of the dish a bit quicker with the oven mitts in the second tier. The HOMWE, Mastrad withstood the heat at 43, 39, and 32 seconds, respectively.</p>
<p>The ‘Ove’ Glove and Calphalon fell in the bottom tier, due to their absence of total silicone coverage. The Calphalon, which is protected by thin strips of silicone over thick cotton, afforded the shortest protection time, at 18 seconds until with heat penetrated the mitt. The ‘Ove’ Glove, with its proprietary combination on Nomex and Kevlar, also failed early.</p>
<h2 id="our-best-pick">Best overall: HOMWE</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WUDQ61W/?tag=ybdmitt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HOMWE &#8211; Silicone Oven Mitts</a> are our top pick. They provide the best combination of protection, flexibility, and user experience.</p>
<p>We felt that the HOMWE&#8217;s design brings it to the top of the pack. The extra long fabric cuff, which extends the mitt nearly to the elbow, provides a much more functional level of protection. From the opening to the fingertip, the HOMWE Mitts measure 15 inches, a full two inches longer than any other product we tested.</p>

<p>While it didn’t rank first for protecting against a hot dish, it was one of the easiest mitts to manipulate while wearing. Our fingers didn’t feel trapped or inhibited as we performed common kitchen tasks with the mitts, and it grips onto heavy dishes effortlessly. Even small utensils, like the tablespoon we used in the dexterity test, were easily picked up and maneuvered.</p>
<p>The silicone construction of the mitt is very easy to clean, and the interior cotton lining is comfortable and insulating. Its wavy, red silicone and black cotton design looks sleek, and it comes with a loop to hang it. At $16.95 for a pack of two, it’s an excellent value.</p>
<p>For any task that might bring your hands in contact with hot surfaces, the HOMWE is the best option.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The HOMWE &#8211; Silicone Oven Mitts provide solid surface coverage of the hand, wrist, and forearm, and it protects more skin than any other mitt.</li>
<li>It’s equipped with a strong silicone gripping texture, that’s flexible enough to handle small kitchen tools and accommodate detailed kitchen tasks.</li>
<li>Priced just under $8.50 per mitt, it’s a great value without compromising quality.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-heat-protection">Best heat protection: OXO Good Grips</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-944" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/unspecified-7-1024x682.jpg" alt="OXO" width="1024" height="682" /></p>
<p>One of our other favorite oven mitts is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001HW3VG0/?tag=ybdmitt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; Silicone Oven Mitt</a>. It proved itself as an extremely effective product that would be a substantial addition to any kitchen.</p>
<p>The mitt from OXO Good Grips provided the longest protection against sustained contact with a hot object straight out of the oven. At 59 seconds until heat traveled through the mitt to the skin, it clearly established itself as being a stronger, thicker option than the other finalists.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001HW3VG0/?tag=ybdmitt-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/oxo-good-grips-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/oxo-good-grips-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/oxo-good-grips-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/oxo-good-grips-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/oxo-good-grips-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/oxo-good-grips-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/oxo-good-grips-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/oxo-good-grips-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/oxo-good-grips.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Heat Protection: OXO Good Grips</h3><p>If your kitchen experience requires prolonged and intense exposure to heat, OXO is a great choice.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001HW3VG0/?tag=ybdmitt-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The textured silicone strips that cover the mitt provide such a secure hold that it’s nearly impossible to drop something once they’ve latched onto it. This provides great confidence when grabbing the heaviest and largest dishes from the hottest ovens.</p>
<p>While the strong silicone has its benefits, it makes adjusting your grip on a dish or picking up a small kitchen utensil more challenging. In our dexterity test, it was the stiffest product in our top eight and the most difficult to maneuver.</p>
<p>In our cleaning test, the tough fabric prevented stains better than the other mitts, and the rubber ring attached to the cuff makes display easy and attractive.</p>
<p>At $14.99 per mitt, the 13-inch OXO Good Grips is one of the most expensive products we tested, but it’s a clear example of getting what you pay for.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The OXO Good Grips &#8211; Silicone Oven Mitt provides heat protection longer than any other oven mitt in our top eight.</li>
<li>Its unique gripping strips ensure a strong, secure hold on any hot item.</li>
<li>The silicone shell stays clean and looks sharp.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="most-versatile">Most versatile: The Ove&#8217; Glove</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ove-glove6.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p><b>We liked the five-finger dexterity of  </b><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0797DTFLM/?tag=ybdmitt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>The Ove’ Glove</b></a><b>. </b>It’s the only product in our top eight that can easily perform any action — not just in the kitchen but around the grill and campfire as well. However, it’s also the smallest and thinnest mitt, barely covering the wrist, and it lasted just 26 seconds of holding the hot dish in our heat test.</p>
<h2 id="best-hot-liquid">Best for hot liquid: Mastrad</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H0OJPTG/?tag=ybdmitt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mastrad &#8211; Orka Plus</a> was a strong contender because of its unique waterproof outer shell that allows you to grab items like eggs or potatoes directly out of boiling water. It also sports gripping strips similar to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001HW3VG0/?tag=ybdmitt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips</a> for added security. But its design forces the thumb under the other four fingers, instead of to the side, and makes even simple adjustments to grip more challenging that the other brands.</p>
<h2 id="other-finalists">The other mitts we tested</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Calphalon-Textiles-Twill-Thumb-Graphite/dp/B00I3W49EK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Calphalon Textiles &#8211; Twill Thumb Mitt</a> is available in 13 different colors and has a simple design with less silicone than the other brands. But because it has thin silicon strips over a cotton mitt, it came in last in the heat protection test. It also felt too bulky to perform many tasks around the kitchen.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-952" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Mastra_Boil-1.gif" alt="Mastra_Boil" width="900" height="600" /></p>
<p>The ZBling Mitts and The Triumphant Chef Silicone Oven Mitts look and perform similarly. They are great examples of the new standard of oven mitts, using a combination of solid silicone on the outside to cover a quilted cotton interior. However, nothing in terms of features or functionality separates them from the pack or from each other.</p>

<h2 id="long-term">Long-term testing notes</h2>
<p>We originally published this post in June of 2016. Six months later, we&#8217;re still as excited as ever with the Lantana mitt. It&#8217;s durable, isn&#8217;t showing any wear from heat exposure, and still retains the same positive impression it gave us when first using it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s most noticeable how great the Lantana is when we switch to other mitts still hanging around our kitchen. When one, poorly performing mitt causes us to burn our palm from the heat, the Lantana transfers almost none, emphasizing the gap difference between the Lantana and mediocre mitts in the same class.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The best way to guard against burns from hot surfaces is by using an oven mitt, and the best mitts on the market come from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WUDQ61W/?tag=ybdmitt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HOMWE Oven Mitts</a>.</p>
<p>The Lantana mitt provides great protection from heat, using high-quality silicone construction and an extended fabric sleeve that covers more of the arm than any other product we tested.</p>
<p>It withstands temperatures up to 460 degrees and does so for longer than average oven mitts. It cleans up easily and is priced well below other oven mitts that fail to offer the same level of protection.</p>
<p>We also recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001HW3VG0/?tag=ybdmitt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips</a> for its uniquely strong gripping strips and long-lasting resistance to high temperatures. It outlasted all the other products in our heat test and offers a premium user experience.</p>
<p>Other mitts may be better for specific functions, like the five-fingered <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0797DTFLM/?tag=ybdmitt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">‘Ove’ Glove</a> for dexterity or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003V8AMDS/?tag=ybdmitt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mastrad</a> for removing food from boiling water, but for overall, everyday protection the HOMWE Silicone Oven Mitts are our pick for best overall mitts.</p>
