								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter four weeks of testing five best-selling models in the summer heat, we&#8217;ve concluded that electric coolers are not actually very good at keeping things cold. If you need to keep food at a safe temperature over multiple days, check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">review of the best coolers</a> that use ice instead of ineffective thermoelectric devices. But if you only need to keep drinks or your lunch a bit cooler while you&#8217;re driving, the 29-quart <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001MQ7DQ/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koolatron &#8211; P27 Voyager</a> is the best thermoelectric cooler in a disappointing lineup.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>After searching for reviews, we found that only a few sites have really compared and tested electric coolers. We relied on the comparison from OutdoorGearLab to set our expectations, which is to say we realized that many buyers aren&#8217;t happy with these coolers.</p>
<p>We searched for coolers that customers liked most, and found a set of five with fairly good reviews and a similar set of features. We wanted to compare with a 45-quart ice-filled cooler from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">cooler review</a>, so we settled on that size as a baseline.</p>
<p>We specifically looked for an upgraded or higher-tier cooler to compare with mainstream models, and settled on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077HXJS6H/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dometic &#8211; TC35-DC-A</a> because of its thermostat control. Dometic isn&#8217;t the only company selling a model like this, but they have a good reputation among RV and van enthusiasts.</p>
<p>We also bought two smaller coolers with high review counts — the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001MQ7DQ/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koolatron &#8211; P27 Voyager</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007ZYH4BM/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Igloo &#8211; Iceless 28 Quart</a> — that we could use as a comparison for the effect of cooler capacity on cooling performance.</p>

<p>An electric cooler is a bit like the traditional <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">insulated ice chest coolers that we&#8217;ve reviewed before</a>, but it uses a thermoelectric “Peltier” device to move heat out of the cooler rather than absorbing it into ice.</p>
<p>The device itself seems almost too good to be true: Electricity carries heat from one side of a semiconductor pad to the other. Interestingly, that means if you reverse the polarity of the power cable, most of these coolers will turn into heaters.</p>
<p>These are usually advertised as &#8220;ice-free&#8221; coolers, and that&#8217;s how we used and tested them. You could add sealed gel ice packs to an electric cooler to help it absorb more heat, but dumping in a bag of ice can cause electrical shorts and isn&#8217;t recommended.</p>
<h3>Limitations of electric coolers</h3>
<p>There are two factors that limit the effectiveness of an electric cooler: the thermoelectric mechanism itself and the effectiveness of insulation.</p>
<p>The bigger the device and the more amperes of current you push through it, the more heat it can move. There are limits, though: Most thermoelectric systems can only change the temperature on one side by 30 or 40 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the problem of getting rid of all that heat on the outside: All the models we tested use an aluminum heatsink and fan to dissipate the heat once it&#8217;s on the outside of the cooler. Better performance would require larger, more complex heat-dissipation systems.</p>
<p>Coolers for drinks and snacks have another major hurdle to overcome. Even when the cooler has good insulation, If you’re opening the lid constantly, the heat rushing in makes efficiency quite poor.</p>
<h3>Power draw of electric coolers</h3>

<p>The coolers we tested are designed to only use 5 amps of 12-volt power, which is about the same draw as one headlight. That&#8217;s low enough that it won&#8217;t kill your battery over a short stop.</p>
<p>The battery for our tester&#8217;s Honda Odyssey minivan is rated for two hours of reserve capacity at 25 amps, so we could theoretically run one of these coolers for 8 hours before the battery would hit the bottom quarter of reserve life. You don&#8217;t ever want to go that low on the same battery you&#8217;re starting your vehicle with, though.</p>
<p>On a dedicated deep-cycle battery you can get away with more use, but most of us don&#8217;t have one of those in the car. These coolers are really only designed for active cooling while you&#8217;re driving or when you have access to a 120-volt AC outlet. (120-volt operation requires <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009PUQ3C/?tag=ybdecool-20">a separate adapter</a> not included with most electric coolers.)</p>
<h2 id="pros-and-cons">Pros and cons of electric coolers</h2>
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Electric coolers don’t require making or buying ice to keep lunch and drinks cool (or hot) while you&#8217;re driving.</li>
<li>No ice means no water soaking into your lunch.</li>
<li>Thermoelectric coolers are far less expensive than compressor-type refrigerators.</li>
<li>Fewer moving parts means that these coolers should be more reliable (or at least easier to repair) than refrigerators.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>An electric cooler won&#8217;t chill enough to protect raw meat on a hot day.</li>
<li>Most models aren&#8217;t as easy to clean as a good ice chest.</li>
<li>A thermoelectric cooler needs to run constantly, so it actually drains your battery faster when parked than a 12-volt compact fridge would.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vs-regular-coolers">Ice chests vs. electric coolers</h2>
<p>For the sizes that we tested, manufacturers rated the cooler performance at 40 degrees lower than the temperature outside the cooler, but that assumes a lot of things.</p>
<p>if you need to keep food (or anything else) below 40 degrees, you’d be better off using ice. When surrounded with ice, perishables are protected from heat for two or three days. So long as your food is in a waterproof container, even melted ice will typically keep food at safe temperatures for another day or so.</p>
<p>If you’re only keeping drinks chilled, or if you’re transporting something like medication that’s safe up to room temperature, an electric cooler will help you out without the constant re-stocking that makes ice inconvenient.</p>
<p>Adding frozen gel packs can help level the playing field between electric and regular coolers, but of course that still requires you to have access to a freezer.</p>
<h2 id="vs-fridges">Electric coolers vs refrigerators</h2>
<p>The key advantage that a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072MLT6QW/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">12-volt refrigerator like this 50-watt model from Dometic</a> has over a thermoelectric cooler is that it can keep your food cold even in extreme conditions.</p>
<p>Refrigerators use a coolant (like R-22, the modern replacement for Freon gas) that changes from liquid to gas inside a coiled metal tube. That process sucks all the heat out of your fridge very efficiently. A compressor makes that gas liquid again for another pass through the coil, and as the process repeats indefinitely, it can move an amazing amount of heat.</p>
<p>This phase-change system still works well on an incredibly hot day, but all those moving parts make a 12-volt fridge more expensive than a thermoelectric cooler.</p>
<p>Thermoelectric coolers will chill your drinks or help keep your lunch cold while your AC is on while you&#8217;re driving, but they need a constant supply of power. Reading <a href="http://campinnforum.com/community/threads/12v-120v-freezer-fridge.3816/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user testimonials about real-world use of 12-volt fridges and freezers</a>, it&#8217;s clear that the more expensive systems are more efficient at keeping things cold, but they still need extra battery capacity to be worthwhile.</p>
<p>Another big difference between an electric fridge and a thermoelectric cooler will be the built-in thermostat. A fridge cools quickly in short bursts to maintain a steady average temperature, while a thermoelectric cooler will need to run constantly and still not hit 40 degrees Fahrenheit on a hot day.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Internal size:</b> The size of a cooler is usually measured in quarts. The best way to keep food cool is to pack the cooler&#8217;s space full of pre-chilled or frozen beverages, so pick a size you&#8217;ll really use.</p>
<p><b>Shape:</b> Most coolers are roughly box-shaped, but some are designed to fit in between front bucket seats if you have that configuration in your vehicle.</p>
<p><b>Door orientation: </b>Coolers can be made to open upward, like an ice chest, or sideways, like a fridge. Some can work in both positions, but generally the top-opening models are the most versatile and popular.</p>
<p><b>Dividers and shelves:</b> If you have food that should be stored at different temperatures, large full-featured coolers should come with slide-in pieces that will help you keep specific items closer to or farther away from the cooling element.</p>
<p><b>Power draw:</b> Your vehicle&#8217;s battery has some reserve capacity, but you don&#8217;t want to risk getting stranded by using that all up. Higher power means better cooling power, though available models we looked at only differ by about 20 percent.</p>
<p><b>Thermostatic control: </b>A built-in thermostat will turn a premium cooler on and off to try and maintain a set temperature. This will save power if you&#8217;re only using it in an air-conditioned car or on a cloudy day, but in a heat wave it&#8217;ll be running full-time anyhow.</p>
<p><b>Drain plug: </b>This isn&#8217;t as critical a feature as it is for regular ice-filled coolers, but it still makes rinsing out an electric cooler much easier.</p>
<p><b>Heating mode:</b> Most thermoelectric coolers can be switched from chilling to heating simply by reversing the polarity of the power plug, moving heat into the cooler instead of out. This is a nifty perk if you&#8217;re delivering lunches, but our test crew agreed that they&#8217;d rarely use it.</p>

<p>We set up our group of coolers on the patio for six days of 90-plus-degree weather. Each cooler was loaded with a pack of hot dogs, a pair of yogurt cups, and a water bottle. All items were refrigerated to about 40° F before we loaded up the coolers, but the coolers themselves had been sitting in 80° outdoor temperatures.</p>
<p>The coolers were running off of household electrical power for this test, which required the use of adapters not included with most coolers.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re storing or transporting perishable food for more than a few hours, 40 degrees is the hottest temperature that will still stop bacteria from multiplying and keep your food safe.</p>
<p>We checked temperatures with an instant-read probe thermometer in the morning and afternoon, but we also tracked changes over the week with two SensorPush wIreless data-logging thermometers.</p>
<p>For a control, we loaded the top-ranked model from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">review of the best coolers</a>, the ORCA &#8211; 40 Quart Classic, with 20 pounds of ice and checked its temperature at the same time.</p>
<div id="visualizer-24388-476644917" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-24388"></div>
<p>The first day of the test was overcast, with temperatures starting at 80 degrees and dropping to the mid 70s. This is close to the conditions inside the back of a car or truck, and the coolers did not perform as well as we&#8217;d hoped. After two hours, temperatures in most of the coolers stabilized at a mere fifteen degrees colder than outside air. The high starting temperature of the coolers just couldn&#8217;t be overcome by the thermoelectric systems.</p>
<p>As expected, the temperatures in the evening were much better, finally dropping down below 40 and even freezing in one unit when outside temperatures were in the 60s overnight. But that&#8217;s still not the performance necessary to keep perishable items like potato salad safe if you have to unplug when you&#8217;re stopped.</p>
<div id="visualizer-24394-591246177" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-24394"></div>
<p>When we looked at the temperatures from the two data-log thermometers, it was clear that the insulation and cooling power of these coolers is insufficient for use outside on a hot day. As soon as the sun hit the spot they were sitting at around 10 a.m., the temperature would climb above 50 in a better cooler or all the way up to 70 in a cheaper cooler. Things only dropped again when outside temperatures fell below 70 overnight.</p>
<p>We weren&#8217;t expecting these coolers to perform well in the hot sun, but look at these results and think about what conditions you&#8217;ll actually be using your cooler in.</p>
<p>Ice and bear-proof insulation like you&#8217;ll find on <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">the best coolers we&#8217;ve reviewed</a> are still far superior to a small thermoelectric device when it comes to keeping the heat out of your food.</p>
<p>That goes double when you consider that ice doesn&#8217;t need electricity to do its job. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009PUQ3C/?tag=ybdecool-20">A 120-volt adapter</a> will help if you&#8217;ve got power hookups or a hotel room overnight, but that&#8217;s not usually an option if you&#8217;re camping.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001MQ7DQ/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koolatron &#8211; P27</a> has the best combination of size and performance. With the best cooling performance on a 90-degree day, this 29-quart cooler will help keep your food and drinks cool.</p>
<p>Koolatron makes a wide range of electric cooler sizes, from a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JLNBW4/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">tiny six-pack chiller</a> to a full <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000Q754E4/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">45-quart party cooler</a>. We picked the P27 based on reputation among reviewers, and it didn&#8217;t disappoint. This cooler is an ideal size for family road trips, holding a two-liter bottle along with a few days&#8217; worth of snacks.</p>
<p>This cooler kept coldest on hot days during our test, but it&#8217;ll still allow the contents to get up around 50 degrees sitting outside on a 100-degree day. That&#8217;s fine for chilling drinks and a packed lunch you&#8217;re going to eat the same day, but if you&#8217;ve got your vehicle parked in the sun for any amount of time it won&#8217;t keep dairy products safe.</p>

<p>If you do want to keep food below 40 degrees in this cooler, there are a few essential tricks you&#8217;ll need to use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t leave the empty cooler in the car when it&#8217;s parked in the sun; take it with you so it starts out at room temperature rather than baking-hot.</li>
<li>Use frozen water bottles and gel packs whenever you can to help absorb heat on a hot day. Yes, that makes this a barely-upgraded ice chest, rather than a truly iceless cooler, but it will help keep your food safe. Don&#8217;t dump ice inside or get this cooler wet, though.</li>
<li>Make sure there&#8217;s some room for air to move inside the cooler and chill everything evenly. If you want to sort the items from most temperature sensitive to least sensitive, that will help too, but watch out for items sitting beside the chiller fan getting frozen.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&#8217;re just carrying lunch and a drink every day, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00009PGNS/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">18-quart Koolatron P-20</a> is a better buy, since it&#8217;s slim enough to fit between the front seats of a van or truck with bucket seats. But if you&#8217;ve got room for this bigger cube-shaped cooler, it&#8217;s more versatile.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking at buying anything bigger than the P27, you&#8217;ve got to seriously ask yourself if mediocre cooling performance will be worthwhile. Thermoelectric coolers are an excellent choice for drinks, but milk and other quick-spoiling food will need extra ice packs or some different kind of cooling solution.</p>
<p>One final note about quality: While we don&#8217;t have any complaints about the electronics or operation of this cooler, the Koolatron label was not applied carefully at the factory. Also, the plastic slide-lock is pretty stiff and flimsy. There was also tape residue on the side of the cooler we bought. This is a good cooler, but it&#8217;s not a shining example of quality control.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The size and performance of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001MQ7DQ/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koolatron &#8211; P27</a> is better than the other models we tested.</li>
<li>While the Koolatron is better at cooling than the others we tested, it&#8217;s still no match for a 100-degree heat wave even when plugged in.</li>
<li>This cube-shaped cooler can sit so the door opens to the side or from the top.</li>
<li>For taking drinks and food on a small picnic, this is excellent.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a cooler that has a bit more room, the 45-quart  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072PRFQL3/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wagan &#8211; EL6244</a> has the right features and design to make the most of thermoelectric technology.</p>
<p>Compared to the size of the Koolatron &#8211; P27, the Wagan is just less than double the length. The lid opens in two sections, and you also get a set of wheels and an expanding handle to help cart all your drinks around.</p>
<p>With enough carrying capacity for two full 24-pack flats of beverage cans, this is a great cooler for tailgating. Note, however, that if you fill this cooler completely with warm beer or soda, it will probably never be able to cool them as well as it all off the way a refrigerator wcould. Always chill your food or drinks at home before you pack an electric cooler.</p>

With wheels, divider shelves, and a drain, this is one of the better-designed coolers we tested. Cooling performance was third-rate, though.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072PRFQL3/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Like every other model we tested, the temperature spikes we measured inside this cooler during the hottest parts of the day were extreme. On a 100-degree day, the thermoelectric components can only keep the contents of this cooler at 54 degrees.</p>
<p>If you just want to keep your beverages at a more refreshing temperature without dealing with ice, it&#8217;ll do just fine. If you want to pack this with food and take it to a party, make sure you carefully pack the most perishable items next to a frozen water bottle or ice pack.</p>

<p>Other extra features that make this cooler stand out are removable dividers and a drain plug. The drain probably hurts insulation a bit, but it&#8217;s very nice for easy clean-out after a longer trip. The dividers make all the difference when you&#8217;re trying to keep your perishable items close to the chiller unit and want to fill up empty space with heat-absorbing frozen water bottles.</p>
<p>Another perk is built-in storage for the power cord: Tthe standard arrangement on most models is a little pig-tail electrical cord sticking out the side or a flush-mount socket, but Wagan tucks all the connections inside a pop-open door on the lid. The lid itself might crack if you let this cooler roll around in the back of a truck, but it keeps electrical connections safe from damage and keeps your cord from getting lost.</p>
<p>Despite the bigger size and extra features, the Wagan usually sells for about $15 less than the half-size Koolatron. It&#8217;s tricky to suggest that this is going to be a better pick for most people, though, since it did get 6 degrees warmer on a hot day.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072PRFQL3/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wagan &#8211; EL6244</a> is a bigger, better-equipped 45- quart cooler.</li>
<li>The lower price of the Wagan reflects performance, cooling is in the middle of the pack.</li>
<li>Wheels will help you move food and drinks around when you reach your perfect picnic spot.</li>
<li>Internal dividers are great at keeping your food and drinks separate.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077HXJS6H/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dometic &#8211; TC35-DC-A</a> is a cooler with extra features that might justify its cost among a select group of buyers, but in terms of pure functionality it’s not doing much extra. The main feature to note is a thermostat, which will allow you to fine-tune the internal temperature and save power.</p>
<p>Dometic is well-known for their RV and trailer accessories: Ffrom fridges to air conditioners, Dometic products are all designed to make life on the road a little bit more luxurious. Compared to the full-power portable freezers Dometic sells, the TC35 is just not all that compelling despite the lower price.</p>
<p>The Dometic kept our lunches cooler than the Wagan, but not as cold as the Koolatron.</p>

<p>The one extra feature that separates it from the rest of this lineup is a digital thermostat: you can set a range of temperature controls to fine-tune the cold (or heat) from the thermoelectric plate.</p>
<p>With a seven-step range between freezing and 60 degrees Ffahrenheit when in cooling mode, this is the kind of control that might make the Dometic really useful when transporting something temperature-sensitive that can&#8217;t freeze and can&#8217;t get too hot.</p>
<p>That kind of control sounds great, but like a speedometer on your minivan that goes up to 300 miles per hour, it&#8217;s misleading. The ability of this cooler to hit anything below 50 degrees is dependent more on the outside temperature than on the controls.</p>

It was pretty good at keeping things cold, but not good enough to justify the price.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077HXJS6H/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The lid on the Dometic seals securely, which is great for insulation performance, but the spring latch is pretty stiff, and our tester accidentally left the lid cracked open during one afternoon of testing because he didn&#8217;t push down hard enough.</p>
<p>Dometic was the only manufacturer to include an AC 120-volt power adapter with their cooler. Cheap 5-amp adapters are easy to source, but it was a nice touch.</p>
<p>Dometic&#8217;s build quality is actually right in line with the higher price you&#8217;re paying, which is nice to see. Everything about this cooler is a little bit more rigid and carefully finished. Where other coolers feel like boxes of plastic with cooling modules glued to the side, this feels like a product someone set out to design.</p>
<p>That said, a nice-looking cooler that doesn&#8217;t keep your egg salad sandwich from spoiling on a hot day isn&#8217;t where we&#8217;d recommend spending extra money. The Wagan is just as nice to use, if you don&#8217;t need a thermostat to keep your cooler from freezing.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000Q754E4/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koolatron &#8211; P95</a> is a larger 45-quart version of our 29-quart top pick, and it has one nice feature that sets it apart: aA two-position shelf that keeps food and drinks organized in layers or sections for easier access. That&#8217;s especially handy if you&#8217;re using this cooler so the door opens sideways, like a fridge.</p>
<p>Unlike the P27, though, the P95 had terrible cooling performance. Given that it&#8217;s probably the same components in a larger box that shouldn&#8217;t be too surprising, but the other large coolers performed better.</p>

<p>With the smallest internal capacity and the lowest price, the Igloo &#8211; Iceless 28 Quart cooler was also able to get our test lunch to the lowest temperature on an overcast summer day. The Igloo was truly freezing cold at 25.9 degrees on a 65-degree afternoon.</p>
<p>That performance was followed up with a flop, though, as the Igloo failed to get below 64 degrees on the following 97-degree day.</p>
<p>The cooling element had built up some frost during the extra-cold day that we assumed might account for some of the poor performance. Even after the frost was thoroughly melted the next day it was clear that the Igloo just didn&#8217;t have the insulation to keep its cool.</p>
<p>If your requirements are flexible and you just want a cheap cooler, the Igloo is not a bad design overall, with a useful carry handle and a good-looking exterior. Don&#8217;t set anything heavy on the lid, though, or the head-dissipating fan inside will start to rub on the plastic shroud.</p>
<p>The Igloo is the only cooler that we tested which fits comfortably between the front seats of our tester&#8217;s minivan, but that&#8217;s not enough to make it a good buy. After thorough testing, we&#8217;d check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U6YTMRM/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">small coolers from Wagan</a> before we&#8217;d settle on the Igloo for this role.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After thoroughly testing these electric coolers side-by-side with our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">best-in-class ice-filled cooler</a>, we&#8217;re fairly disappointed in all of them.</p>
<p>Despite claims that an electric cooler can get 40 degrees below ambient temperatures, we mostly saw temperatures that would quickly lead to spoiled food over the course of a long trip. You also need to supply 12-volt power constantly to keep things cold, or treat the electric cooler like a regular cooler and pack it with frozen items anyhow.</p>
<p>If you only need to keep pre-chilled food and drinks cold while you&#8217;re driving on long trips, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001MQ7DQ/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koolatron &#8211; P27 Voyager</a> is the top performer. This 29-quart model stayed coldest throughout our testing, and it&#8217;s a useful size for carrying picnic-sized meals.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for something a little bit bigger, the 46-quart <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072PRFQL3/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wagan &#8211; EL6244</a> has wheels, dividers and a drain feature that makes clean-up easier. It sacrifices cooling performance, but the price is also slightly lower.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent a month using the best insulated tumblers side by side with water bottles and travel mugs.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>There are over 20,000 listings on Amazon for &#8220;insulated tumbler.&#8221; YETI is the undisputed brand king, with a tumbler that&#8217;s now even more popular than their ultra-rugged (and expensive) coolers. As with all things that are mass-produced and insanely popular, the number of competitors (and imitations) has expanded just as quickly as YETI&#8217;s profit numbers.</p>
<p>We read and watched dozens of YETI tumbler reviews and comparisons to narrow the mile-long list down to four of the best insulated tumbler cups. <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-tumbler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wirecutter</a>, as always, provides some in-depth testing, and <a href="https://www.savingfreak.com/best-tumbler-yeti-vs-rtic-vs-orca-vs-ozark-trail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saving Freak</a> compares the costs and benefits of the various copycat brands. GearJunkie, like most sites, only <a href="https://gearjunkie.com/yeti-rambler-tumbler-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passes a verdict on the YETI</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY5Kryq62SQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What&#8217;s Inside</a> tried to do a controlled test, but wound up destroying one of their samples.</p>
<p>In our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/" rel="noopener">water bottle review</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/" rel="noopener">travel mug review</a>, we&#8217;ve seen Klean Kanteen and Hydro Flask go head-to-head competing for a position in our tests. <b>For the first time, Hydro Flask offers something substantially different from Klean Kanteen: a bigger cup that actually matches what everyone else is offering.</b></p>
<p>Between the various well-known brands that are just barely different from YETI, RTIC is budget-friendly and offers a flip-cap lid that at least compares in functionality to the Mag-Slide on the new YETI lids.</p>
<p>CamelBak has an interesting contender in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LA4PUMc/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KickBak</a>, and it fared well in Wirecutter&#8217;s insulation test, but customer reviews of the lid are scathing so we skipped it.</p>
<p><b>We decided to test only the 30-ounce tumblers in this review, since they&#8217;re the most popular and represent a type of drink carrier that&#8217;s really different from a </b><a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/" rel="noopener"><b>16-ounce travel mug</b></a><b>.</b> It also allowed us to compare them directly to our favorite 30-ounce insulated <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/" rel="noopener">water bottle</a> to see what difference that narrower opening makes. We selected representatives from a range of prices to see if insulation quality really changes when you buy a $40 tumbler instead of a $16 tumbler.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-get">Should you get a tumbler, water bottle or travel mug?</h2>
<p>Like <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/#best-insulated-water-bottle" rel="noopener">insulated water bottles</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/" rel="noopener">travel mugs</a>, an insulated tumbler will keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold. The vacuum insulation also stops that slippery condensation from forming on the sides and leaving a puddle on your furniture.</p>
<p>The choice between a travel mug and an insulated tumbler is a tricky one. In most ways, these products serve an identical purpose for most people: They maintain temperature, and they&#8217;re convenient to sip from (no screw-top like an insulated water bottle).</p>
<p>The big difference with a tumbler is the lid. <b>While a travel mug is still designed for easy-access sipping, many tumblers don&#8217;t have any kind of stopper at all to slow down your sipping pleasure.</b> The lids are simple and easy to clean, but they offer far less insulation than good travel mugs. The best travel mugs keep your coffee hotter and your laptop (not to mention pants) safer from spills.</p>
<p>A tumbler is also available in much larger sizes than popular travel mugs. You can buy a thermos or a giant insulated water bottle, of course, but those aren&#8217;t easy to sip from.</p>
<p>So, the ideal setting for an insulated tumbler is on a hot afternoon where you want to keep your drink insulated, but you&#8217;re more worried about convenience more than spills. Drinking something cold poolside on a scorching-hot day is a perfect example. Reading on the patio in the early morning with a cup of coffee is also a case where the tumbler works better than an ordinary cup.</p>

<b>Size:</b> The most popular tumblers hold around 30 ounces, and among the friends and coworkers who use them daily, that was unanimously the preferred size for sipping cold beverages or ice water.</p>
<p><b>Spout stoppers:</b> Flip-up stoppers and slide-over stoppers are the two common approaches to keeping a tumbler closed. Look closely at what you&#8217;re buying, though: Many tumblers are made with a few different lid styles if you look for them.</p>
<p><b>Base diameter:</b> Do you need to keep your tumbler in a car cup holder? Check the size just to be sure, but most cup holders are designed to hold extra-large restaurant-size paper cups, which these tumblers mimic.</p>
<p><b>Painted, coated or brushed finish:</b> Color coordination is a nice benefit of painted or powder-coated tumblers, but they&#8217;ll show signs of wear eventually. Brushed stainless steel looks great even if it gets scratched, and there&#8217;s nothing that will peel off after a few years.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Everyday use tests</h3>
<p>Our tester used these tumblers in place of his usual water bottle and coffee mug for two weeks. At work, around the house, in the car and at the park, they all kept beverages handy. The 30-ounce size was bigger than our testers preferred for a morning cup of coffee, but for keeping hydrated (or keeping a rum and coke chilled) it&#8217;s just about perfect.</p>
<p>The differences between the mugs seemed smaller and smaller as we got used to them. The flip-lid from RTIC doesn&#8217;t flop around as much as most travel mug lids in this style, which was our biggest concern. The slide closures on the YETI and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0769CQYVS/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican &#8211; Traveler</a> were easy to use, though not any more so than the flip lid.</p>
<h3>Cleaning test</h3>
<p>Cleaning these tumblers and lids was easy, even by hand. Compared to popular travel mugs like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZI5XNO/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo &#8211; West Loop</a> with its springs and levers on the inside of the lid, a tumbler lid is dead simple to clean.</p>
<p>What about the dishwasher, though? <a href="https://www.rticcoolers.com/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTIC</a> and <a href="https://www.hydroflask.com/caring-for-your-hydro-flask/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hydro Flask</a> say that you should hand-wash only, while <a href="https://www.yeti.com/en_US/are-yeti-tumblers-dishwasher-safe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YETI</a> specifically claims their tumblers will survive dishwashing. (Pelican doesn&#8217;t comment either way.) Given the number of outright contradictions we&#8217;ve seen over our years researching vacuum-insulated products, we&#8217;re not surprised by either answer. Extra-hot drying cycles will make the metal expand and contract, so there&#8217;s some risk to every mug, but the biggest problems are usually with color coatings and glued-on plastic pieces.</p>
<p>If you want to keep your insulated tumbler looking and working its best, hand-washing is the safe way to go. But it seems clear that one trip through the washer won&#8217;t destroy the insulation if you find a week-old smoothie in the back of your truck.</p>
<h3>Insulation test</h3>
<p>We took our four tumblers and our <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07996C56J/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">top-performing insulated water bottle</a> and filled them all with 28 ounces of hot water. Temperature ranged from 190 to 194 degrees Fahrenheit, which is on the upper end of coffee temperature after brewing.</p>
<p>We then checked on the heat loss for the next six hours, and again at 12 hours. The chart below models the results for easy comparison. (The raw data had a difference of four degrees Fahrenheit in starting temperature. The chart shows an adjusted starting temperature, but the temperature change from one sample to the next is as recorded.)</p>
<div id="visualizer-18187-1930914443" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-18187"></div>
<p>The differences between these tumblers is so small that it would be impossible to tell them apart. The real difference is between the tumblers and the water bottle: because the vacuum-sandwich stainless steel walls provide the most effective insulation, the wide lid of a tumbler is a real liability. Even the fact that the Hydro Flask tumbler has no seal to keep steam in made only a tiny difference in the test.</p>
<p>We also added the results from an old test of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp 16-ounce travel mug</a> to this chart for comparison. <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/#how-we-tested" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The testing conditions were different</a> (starting temperature was lower, and we didn&#8217;t test for as long), but we&#8217;ve normalized the starting point on this graph so the sample intervals line up. It&#8217;s clear that even a small narrow-neck bottle keeps heat better than the tumblers.</p>
<h3>Ice test</h3>
<p>In our research, we saw so many variations of the ice test, we were a little surprised that there wasn&#8217;t some kind of consensus. Instead, it seemed that every test had a slightly different result. The real problem with an ice test is getting around the margin of error: It&#8217;s hard to know if you&#8217;re measuring the temperature of the water or the ice cubes. (Infrared thermometers are also often used, and those <a href="https://blog.thermoworks.com/thermometer/how-to-use-an-infrared-thermometer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only read the surface temperature</a> of the water, not the temperature of the whole bath.) It&#8217;s also tricky to ensure that all your ice is the same temperature going in.</p>
<p>We ultimately decided not to repeat an ice test because the insulation performance is so clearly demonstrated by a hot-water test. If heat coming into the cup is any different than heat escaping, the amount of time it takes for that difference to show is measured in hours. If you really want the best insulation possible to keep ice frozen all day long (or if you want to keep small amounts of liquid nitrogen, or something similar), a sealed narrow-neck bottle is still your best bet.</p>
<h3>Leak test</h3>
<p>In our travel mug tests, we went as far as putting the mugs into a spin dryer to see if they would leak in the most extreme circumstances. By comparison, most tumblers will spill some of your drink when you tip them sideways. We filled each tumbler with water and turned them upside down to see if any of the stoppers actually prevent leaks.</p>

Don't put this in a bag with a laptop, but if you knock it over it's not going to dump your drink.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The RTIC&#8217;s lid is surprisingly secure, given the competition. You can usually hold this cup upside down, or even leave it sitting on a table upside down, and not see more than a few drops. As soon as you shake it or drop it on the floor, though, all bets are off. (The more fluid you have inside, the more explosive the spill will be when the flip-cap pops open.)</p>
<p>Of the two brands that are trying sliders, YETI is fairly successful, while Pelican&#8217;s lid is a hot mess. It&#8217;s not clear exactly what the issue is, since the basics of the mechanism seem the same, but the Pelican lid always dribbled a stream of water when we turned it upside down. The YETI &#8220;Mag Slider&#8221; lid isn&#8217;t as magical as it sounds, but it works fairly well to stop anything more than occasional drips.</p>
<p>Hydro Flask gives you nothing to work with for spill prevention. If you really want the color options and tapered form factor they&#8217;re offering, they do have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07943NMYX/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a straw lid option</a> that might be better at stemming the flow of sticky drinks in case of an accident.</p>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RTIC &#8211; 30-Ounce Insulated Tumbler</a> is the best bargain in this lineup, and it&#8217;s our top pick overall. The stopper actually prevents some spills, and compatible accessories are easy to find. This is an updated version of the RTIC, but the old <a href="https://www.amazon.com/RTIC-30-oz-Tumbler-Pink/dp/B019D9HESO/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">all-metal-no-stopper version</a> is still available.</p>
<p>Without buying and trying out these tumblers, it&#8217;s easy to make assumptions about performance. &#8220;Maybe the steel is thinner,&#8221; you think. &#8220;Maybe the vacuum is actually less of a vacuum.&#8221; Our testing shows, though, that If there&#8217;s anything fancy that other brands are doing to improve theoretical insulation performance, the giant plastic lid is an equalizer that levels the playing field.</p>
<p>In every case we&#8217;ve seen (even among top-class insulating mugs and bottles from Zojirushi, Thermos and Hydro Flask) a big lid means mediocre insulation. Improving the insulation of a tumbler without making the lid area smaller is like adding better insulation to your house while the doorways and windows are sealed with plastic sheets.</p>

The plastic base is a drawback, but the price makes this a real winner. If you're picky enough about durability or insulation that a budget model is a turn-off, you should probably check out a travel mug or thermos anyhow.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>So, what is the difference that brings the price down? The plastic &#8220;foot&#8221; on this new RTIC is less tough than the YETI if you drop it on a hard surface, but the difference in price more than makes up for that.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important consideration when it comes to recommending a bargain-priced tumbler is availability: <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-30-Ounce-Double-Wall-Vacuum-Sealed-Tumbler/171452737" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ozark Trail</a>, <a href="https://www.target.com/p/zak-designs-174-30oz-stainless-steel-tumbler/-/A-52542332" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zak! Designs</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Steel-Tumbler-Insulated-Greens/dp/B01AZB6TQW/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BEAST</a> and a dozen other companies are also producing similar tumblers at low price points, but inventory (and new brands) come and go seasonally. RTIC has been around since the beginning of the fake-YETI game, and availability online is always good. That popularity also means that accessories (like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0779M1CBK/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this handle</a>) will actually be designed to fit this cup.</p>
<p>The main feature that bumped this tumbler to the top of our lineup is the spill-proof lid. If you don&#8217;t want the flip-cap to stick up into your face when you&#8217;re drinking, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019D9HESO/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">older version of the RTIC</a> with no stopper is going to be just as good at insulating your drink. Note that the outer dimensions are slightly different; old-style handles don&#8217;t fit new-style mugs with the plastic foot.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The RTIC &#8211; 30-Ounce Insulated Tumbler is a bargain-priced drink vessel that will keep your beverage just as cold (or hot) as other brands.</li>
<li>This flip-up lid stopper is the only option we found that really prevents leaks, though it&#8217;s still not safe to put in a bag.</li>
<li>RTIC compromises on quality very slightly, with some plastic parts, but the vacuum insulation is all that it needs to be.</li>

If you want something better than a budget-priced tumbler, there&#8217;s no way to beat the original <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YETI &#8211; Rambler</a>. YETI didn&#8217;t technically invent this category of drinkware (similar insulated travel mugs have been around for a very long time), but they created a new market with big 30-ounce tumblers targeted at outdoor enthusiasts who loved their coolers for camping and tailgating.</p>
<p>This is not a Yeti thermos: You can easily beat this kind of insulation with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07996C56J/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">narrow-neck bottle from Klean Kanteen</a>, for about the same price. If you want the easy-filling and easy-sipping convenience of a tumbler, YETI has the same performance drawbacks as the other brands.</p>

The magnetic slider is more convenient than a flip-up stopper, but it doesn't make this cup leakproof. The main reason to pick this tumbler is if you've gotta have that logo.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The one category YETI manages to squeak ahead of some competition is in spill prevention. The Rambler&#8217;s slide cover actually stops most (but not all) leakage and only lets drops escape. In comparison, the Pelican will dribble out a stream. The RTIC is more leak-proof, but the YETI really is ready for those times when your friend fires up the motor on the jet boat and you haven&#8217;t finished your drink.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a YETI for coffee that&#8217;s a little different than the classic 30-Ounce Rambler, there&#8217;s also the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BM72ZXT/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YETI &#8211; 14-Ounce Rambler Mug</a> for about $10 less. The small amount of coffee it holds compared to the large lid surface means it&#8217;s only going to keep your coffee hot for about 45 minutes, but compared to six minutes for an open-top ceramic mug for some people this is exactly what they&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>The other case where this is an obvious pick is if you&#8217;re buying a gift. Nothing says &#8220;I only sorta love you&#8221; like a knock-off version of a trendy product. If you know someone who actually wants a YETI, the price difference is worth it.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The YETI &#8211; Rambler is the product that got everyone buzzing about giant insulated cups, and they&#8217;re still the most recognizable.</li>
<li>The price of this tumbler is high, and it doesn&#8217;t keep your drink any hotter or colder than others.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll get drips if you hold the YETI upside down or drop it on the floor, but this lid is good at keeping your drink inside.</li>
</ul>

In many ways, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0769CQYVS/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican &#8211; Traveler</a> hits the optimal price to performance ratio in this lineup, but that doesn&#8217;t make it the best buy.</p>
<p>Pelican is a company that makes quality flight cases for sensitive equipment, and in many ways they&#8217;re like YETI: a small company who established a niche with a specific product, then started building a brand around it. This tumbler is a bit different than the rest, and if you love the screw-on lid with the bigger spout area it&#8217;s a good buy.</p>
<p>The slide-cover lid isn&#8217;t as good at sealing against leaks as YETI&#8217;s lid, though. It dribbles a small stream if you hold the cup upside down. If you really want to keep your drink in, the flip-up lid on the RTIC (or the old-style <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071KW6MRN/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican Snap Lid</a>, which you can still buy in 2018) is a better choice.</p>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079445ZGP/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hydro Flask &#8211; 32 Ounce Insulated Tumbler</a> is a notable contender from one of the big names in the world of insulated drinkware. Many publications give it a win for the sleek profile and brand reputation.</p>
<p>About the only feature that really stands out, though, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07943NMYX/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the straw lid</a>. If you want your insulated tumbler to look like a Big Gulp, this is the way to go. It&#8217;s a hefty price tag, though: The straw lid was a $13 accessory for a $40 tumbler when we checked. The basic lid that comes with the tumbler is claimed to be designed for good insulation, but without even a stopper to keep heat from circulating in and out it doesn&#8217;t make any difference.</p>
<p>If you or the person you&#8217;re buying for already have a Hydro Flask water bottle, buying a matching tumbler for use around the house is a nice touch. They&#8217;re good looking tumblers, but they don&#8217;t perform any better than the other brands to justify the huge price difference.</p>

If you primarily want an insulated cup to drink coffee from, we think a sealed and better-insulated travel mug is a smarter pick than a tumbler. If you want to carry water around with you, likewise, water bottles are better at making water portable while keeping it colder (or hotter.)</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re just looking for the functionality of the classic SOLO party cup with the benefit of better insulation, the double-wall stainless steel vacuum-insulated tumbler checks all the right boxes.</p>
<p>The brand everyone knows is YETI, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">our best buy pick from RTIC</a> beats that cup in two ways: first, RTIC is selling their cup at less than half the price with no loss in performance. Second, the RTIC has a flip-up spout stopper that actually keeps your drink inside, even if you turn it upside down and shake it.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t like the flip-up lid or if you don&#8217;t like supporting imitation products, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the YETI &#8211; Rambler</a> has an updated lid that&#8217;s pretty good at keeping drinks inside without sticking a flap in your nose.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent an entire summer prepping picnic lunches and transporting nine coolers to parks, pools, beaches and other destinations to find that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EY7HQ06/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Orca &#8211; 40 Quart Classic</a> is our top pick among the best coolers, including both rigid and soft style. The Orca kept ice the longest, has a lock-down lid and a simple design that allows for easy transportation and cleaning. For 10 quarts more capacity and a slightly higher price, the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G7KG5PA/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Pelican &#8211; Elite</a> is the largest we tested and comes with lockable lid and a beefy ruler on the lid for measuring that fresh catch.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>There are a ton of reviews on coolers, but we noticed a lack of focus on testing with practical foods so we made sure to give that a go. We read through some reputable reviews like Outdoor Gear Lab’s, as well as some from Outside Online and Wirecutter. We read about the basics of cooling and ice chests and then consulted a professional.</p>
<p>We spoke with Ray from REI, who, having worked there three years and camped and hiked for eight years,  knows his way around a cooler. When we asked Ray about the most important features, he said the most important thing for him is always insulation. Makes sense.</p>
<p>YETI has been making their roto-molded cooler since 2005, and when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPXhi7psQUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTubers start cutting these expensive products in half</a> you know it might be a big deal. Orca&#8217;s a newcomer that clearly aims to compete on this turf, and their insulation is thicker and their warranty is better than YETI&#8217;s. We&#8217;re not saying YETI coolers are bad, but between Orca and Pelican we&#8217;re confident that our bases are covered.</p>
<p>Our expert Ray personally uses the YETI but says that his friends own Orca and Pelican coolers and have had similar rave reviews. We asked Ray what really made a cooler stand out. “Function is what matters,&#8221; he told us. &#8220;Gear-nerds want everything like attachments and bottle openers, but all you need is a cooler that keeps the ice and can hold up outdoors.”</p>
<p>The durability and warranties alone tell you a story of quality, and that&#8217;s where we saw the biggest difference in the products we researched. The return procedure at a retailer like Amazon or REI is pretty generous if you find a flaw in a product right away, but that doesn&#8217;t help much if a hinge fails after a summer of light use.</p>
<p>We then scoured Amazon for customer reviews to further narrow our selection. We finalized our selection to five hard coolers and four soft coolers to give you the best nine coolers on the market.</p>

<h2 id="cooler-types">Types of coolers</h2>
<p>There are really only two types of coolers: hard and soft.</p>
<p>The hard cooler is the classic, usually made of plastic or steel, used for parties, boats and camping. They either have wheels or side handles. A hard cooler is the more durable, of course, if you&#8217;re throwing it in the back of a truck or the bottom of a boat.</p>
<p>Soft coolers are a good compromise for on-the-go activities like kayaking at the beach, or anytime that portability is more important than maintaining the ice-chest shape of a hard cooler. A shoulder strap makes a soft cooler easy for one person to carry, and you can collapse it after you&#8217;re done chilling down your food and ice.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Insulation: </b>The main function of a cooler is to keep drinks cold and food edible. For the best cold-retention, you’ll want to get a cooler with thick insulating walls and a tight seal. This means that for better performance you need to be prepared to store and transport a bigger cooler: Even though two coolers may both have an inside volume of 40 quarts, the one with thicker insulation will take up a lot more space in your car.</p>
<p>We checked inside volume against the outside measurements of all the coolers, and the best-performing models are nearly 70 percent devoted to insulation space, while the least-insulating cooler was only 36 percent. You can check out this chart below in the <a href="#how-we-tested">how we tested section</a>.</p>
<p><b>Carrying capacity:</b> What purpose do you want this cooler to serve? Is it a picnic-day cooler, a beach-day cooler, a multi-day camping cooler or another type of adventure cooler?</p>
<p>Generally speaking, you can fit about one-and-a-half 12-ounce cans and a good amount of ice in a quart of space. So, a giant 50-quart cooler like the Igloo &#8211; MaxCold will hold 72 drink cans for your next backyard gathering (where you can relax in comfort in a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-zero-gravity-chair/">zero gravity chair</a>). On the smaller side, then, the Arctic Zone &#8211; Titan&#8217;s 32-quart size should do the trick for 48 cans worth of a bonfire or half as much drink and a few days of perishable lunch ingredients.</p>
<p><b>Portability:</b> Here’s where the soft coolers take the cake (though the cake may get soggy in there). You only need one person to move a soft cooler because they are lightweight and come with shoulder straps. Unfortunately, the trend of coolers has been to lose the wheels, especially with the more high-end coolers (brands like Orca and Pelican). However, you can still buy Orca wheel add-ons and a Pelican cooler with wheels.</p>
<p>For handles, they can be swinging or stationary. For example, the Orca uses thick fabric, the Coleman &#8211; Steel-Belted Cooler uses metal swivels, and the Pelican uses plastic handles molded into the side. During our portability test, we found it is usually easier to carry coolers with swinging handles because it gives you some leeway when walking with another person.</p>
<p><b>Overall size:</b> If you can’t fit it in your car, what’s the point? There&#8217;s a trade-off between carrying capacity, insulation and how much space a cooler takes up.</p>
<p><b>Durability:</b> Hard coolers tend to be more durable than soft coolers, but the really cheap plastic can crack with rough use or storage in the sun.</p>
<p>The soft coolers we tested all used hardy materials like nylon and vinyl (though our consultant told us nylon is more durable). The AO Coolers &#8211; Vinyl Fishing Cooler claimed to be tear-resistant up to 375 pounds; we could only get 160 pounds into the cooler, but we were very satisfied it would take anything you can throw at it.</p>
<p>The top two coolers we tested, the Orca and the Pelican, both have holes for multiple padlocks so that bears can’t break in. Don’t believe us? Both are certified by conservationists!</p>
<p><b>Drainage:</b> All of the hard-side coolers we tested feature a drain except the Arctic Zone. It’s very handy to have a drainage system when going on longer trips so that you can replace ice as it melts.</p>

<p>If you’re using the cooler for longer than a day and you can’t replace the ice that melts with your <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-portable-ice-maker/">portable ice maker</a>, the cold water can still keep your perishable food out of the danger zone. Until the water itself gets warmer than 40 °F, it&#8217;s still helping keep bacteria at bay by absorbing heat when you open the lid.</p>
<p><b>Dry storage</b>: If you’re transporting any food, there are only a couple options: Either get waterproof storage containers for the food or a dry storage container for the cooler.</p>
<p>The dry storage bin acts as a shelf to keep the top of the cooler dry. Note: You’ll have to keep the cooler level for this to be effective, so don’t expect dry food after you go 4-wheel-driving.</p>
<p>A couple little fun extras you can find in coolers are things like the big angler&#8217;s ruler on the surface of the Pelican. Having a bottle opener attached to the cooler proves to be very useful, since it&#8217;s not going to get lost in the dark. Cup holders are another classic feature that comes in handy on a boat.  Add-on wheels are another consideration</p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Before we got into the more scientific approach of testing insulation, we took each cooler to multiple locations including parks, beaches and barbeques. We used them with our families and friends to get a user’s more general opinion in addition to our own, plus the information from the expert on what to look for.</p>
<p>We carried them over rocky terrains, flat ground and sand and got input from those who helped us. These real-life evaluations made certain aspects of the coolers easy to spot. For instance, the narrow opening on the YETI &#8211; Hopper not only makes it really hard to pack but also difficult to reach in and quickly grab an item (though it will keep things colder).</p>
<p>We considered which coolers needed flat ground, those that could be put on uneven surfaces when you’re camping and those that could be used as a seat. We looked at how easily all of the coolers could be loaded up, carried and cleaned (nobody wants a smelly cooler). All of the everyday use and trip uses were looked at from many different people’s perspectives.</p>
<h3>Insulation tests</h3>
<p>As to the science, we conducted two different “ice tests” that measured the insulation abilities of each cooler in controlled but realistic scenarios.</p>
<p>In the first test, we loaded up each cooler with seven pounds of ice from our army of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-portable-ice-maker/">ice makers</a> and a Bluetooth thermometer. Nothing else was put in, minimizing variables that might skew the test.</p>
<p>This was just to get a baseline for an idea of how the coolers compared to one another. It is just about as simple of a test as you can run; just ice and temperature. We found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EY7HQ06/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Orca &#8211; 40 Quart Classic</a> holds ice the best in this test, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010CRX6QK/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Igloo &#8211; MaxCold</a> did incredibly well when we look at performance-to-price ratio.</p>
<div id="visualizer-13084-1336808924" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-13084"></div>
<p>The next test we conducted was an attempt to see what would happen to real food in real-world conditions. We simulated a typical picnic and added some raw chicken to see how long that would keep fresh on a camping trip before it needed to be cooked.</p>
<p>Each cooler was filled with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>20 pounds of ice</li>
<li>Two 16.9 fluid ounce water bottles</li>
<li>Half a pound of cooked penne pasta and raw cherry tomatoes</li>
<li>Two grilled chicken breasts</li>
<li>One raw chicken breast</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the items’ temperatures were measured every few hours with an infrared surface thermometer until the ice was gone. We also had Bluetooth thermometers to measure the overall temperature inside the cooler to see how that compared to the temperature of the food and drink. (You can see the results in the graph below.)</p>
<div id="visualizer-13426-1533675311" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-13426"></div>
<p>Note that the <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/ad74bb8d-1dab-49c1-b05e-390a74ba7471/Chicken_from_Farm_to_Table.pdf?MOD=AJPERES" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service</a> (USDA FSIS) mandates 40 °F as the maximum safe temperature for storage of perishable raw food like chicken and dairy. If your ice melts the cold water will still capture some heat for a while, but once you cross the 40 °F threshold you should cook the food within hours.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that the USDA FSIS safe food-handling guideline suggests keeping raw chicken in the refrigerator for only one to two days and cooked chicken for three to four days. Due to limited space in some of the coolers, the chicken was not always in the coldest spot, so it’s essential that you factor in a margin of safety for your camping trip cooking plans.</p>

Though we picked coolers with similar internal capacities, most between 40 and 50 quarts, the outer dimensions of the coolers varied quite a bit. For example, the Pelican was the biggest overall at over 9,500 cubic inches whereas the Igloo, rated for the same 50 quarts of carrying capacity, only takes up 6,700 cubic inches in your boat or trunk.</p>
<p>Note that the percentage of a cooler&#8217;s volume that&#8217;s devoted to insulation tracks very closely to insulation performance. There&#8217;s definitely more to insulation than just the thickness of a cooler&#8217;s walls, but fancy materials clearly don&#8217;t help the AcrticZone &#8211; Titan as much as the YETI &#8211; Hopper.</p>

<p>We measured both the interior and exterior dimensions with a standard measuring tape. And, just to make sure, we measured the volume in quarts by pouring water into each cooler until each was full. As you can see, the sizes and shapes vary quite a bit.</p>

For portability tests, we loaded each cooler with 40 pounds to make it a realistic full weight. We then marked out a 500-foot test walk and (with a little help from our friends) we carried or wheeled each cooler to the point and back, which took about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>We did this with two people, both in-shape males in their mid 20s, as well as with just one person. After each carry, we rated how ergonomic the handles were. We could definitely feel the burn with the larger coolers (the Orca and Pelican) because they weigh about 25 and 30 pounds without any added weight.</p>
<p>The weight definitely plays a role in how portable a cooler is, but if you&#8217;re using a heavier cooler over a long weekend, hopefully you won&#8217;t have to move it once you make camp.</p>
<p>The only wheeled cooler we tested (the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00363RV32/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coleman &#8211; Performance Wheeled Cooler</a>) was incredibly easy to move on paved ground, so it is perfect for pool days and local events. But when we took it to the beach, the wheels did us no good, and the molded handles are just adequate.</p>
<h3>Cleanability</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13373" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cooler-cleaning-test.jpg" alt="washing the outside of a red cooler" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cooler-cleaning-test.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cooler-cleaning-test-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cooler-cleaning-test-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cooler-cleaning-test-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cooler-cleaning-test-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cooler-cleaning-test-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cooler-cleaning-test-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cooler-cleaning-test-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cooler-cleaning-test-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cooler-cleaning-test-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cooler-cleaning-test-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cooler-cleaning-test-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We made sure to dirty up the coolers when taking them with us to our various locations. But the worst thing we did, at least in terms of smell, was leave all the food in the coolers for an extra week to make sure that they smelled terrible. What can you expect with gross raw chicken? We then threw away all the food and hosed them down, scrubbed them with dishwashing soap and used our nostrils to determine when they were finally clean (hesitantly). Other than the ribbed interior of the Pelican, we found the smooth surfaces of the hard coolers very easy to clean.</p>
<p>Some of the soft coolers had harder-to-reach spots on the interior, but the material from which they’re constructed made them a breeze to clean. All of the hard coolers were cleaned with a little scrubbing with a rough-sided sponge, soap and hose. They were all as easy to clean as you’d hope, and the smell was nowhere to be found!</p>
<p>One of the more time-consuming parts to clean was the cup holders, just because you can’t clean it in big swiping motions like you can the coolers without cup holders. Also, the Arctic Zone cooler took a bit longer to dry because it has the most fabric, which absorbs water; but we found that if you just leave it in the sun it’s fine. All of the coolers are waterproof, so that makes for great clean up.</p>
<h3>Packing and unpacking</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, the soft coolers are much harder to pack and unpack, especially the YETI as it has only one zipper down the middle, which only creates a small opening (about a fourth the size of the Orca).</p>
<p>The packability of most coolers was great. On the whole, the hard coolers scored beautifully, though the lid on the Coleman Wheeled had trouble staying open due to the plastic hinge. As far as soft coolers go, the AO and Polar Bear have large openings when they are not buckled down. The only real letdown here is the YETI; the zipper leaves little room to pack and unpack. If you’re just using it for drinks, then it’s a nonissue.</p>

<p>In days of yore, before glamping was even a thing, it used to be hard to find a cooler that could keep ice for five days in 90+ degree weather. Now we have amazing coolers like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EY7HQ06/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Orca &#8211; 40 Quart Classic</a>. This smooth, white 40-quart cooler has a prideful simplicity, and if your camping buddies razz you about not buying the more popular YETI, you can brag about the lifetime warranty and thicker insulation.</p>
<p>This cooler is chockfull of thoughtful features, like a very handy Velcro pouch in the back for dry storage (even the well-equipped Pelican lacked this feature).</p>
<p>Though there are plenty of add-ons you can buy, as you’ll see, the Orca concentrated their efforts on what really matters: keeping things cold. We expected the Orca and the Pelican to be very close in performance (especially given the price), but the Orca outperformed its rival in nearly every category, especially when it comes to portability.</p>

Twenty pounds of ice lasted five days in blistering heat upwards of 90 °F. On top of that, the drainage system gets rid of nearly every ounce of water to keep your food dry. Plus it's easy to clean and makes for a great bench.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EY7HQ06/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Orca also cleans incredibly well, with smooth surfaces all over. We didn’t have to use any special brush to reach the nooks and crannies as we did with the Pelican. At the end of the day, the less scrubbing we need to do, the happier we are.</p>
<p>The 24-pound Orca uses one-inch thick rubber swing-handles that hang eight inches on each side. We all know that coordinating with another person — even on something as simple as carrying a cooler — can be difficult at times (though we got the hang of it after the first few portability tests). We found that extra room between your hands and the side of the cooler to be very useful when going up stairs or across uneven terrain. Coordination is still required, but it’s much easier with good handles.</p>
<p>At about an inch in diameter, the handles have an ergonomic curvature to fit your hand when carrying. This thickness works well, because you can use different parts of your forearm muscle when holding it. In other words, it’s small enough to only use your fingertips, but large enough to allow for a full squeezing grip.</p>
<p>Note: If you really want, you can loop your arm through so the handle rests in between your forearm and bicep, using your other arm to hold your hand for double the strength.</p>
<p>So you’ve easily transported the Orca to your campsite, had a blast over the weekend, and it’s time to go, but there’s water in the cooler. Not to worry, the drainage system in the Orca requires no tilt, and empties pretty much every drop due to its miniature sump area at the bottom. Just unscrew the plug and voila, dry cooler for the car ride home.</p>
<p>As our REI expert shared with us, one of the points of durability to look for is the latch. At first glance, the rubber whale straps seem dinky, but after feeling them for ourselves and watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmjIti_Kblc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this video</a> of a bear going at it, our minds quickly changed. If they do break, however, Orca is the only company in this class that covers rubber parts under their warranty.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EY7HQ06/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Orca &#8211; 40 Quart Classic</a> holds ice longest in blistering heat: about four hours longer than the runner-up and 20 hours longer than our budget pick.</li>
<li>Orca provides you with sturdy-yet-flexible handles that make carrying a heavy load easier.</li>
<li>The tough roto-molded plastic has a clean design and is easy to maintain with a quick rinse and wipe-down.</li>
<li>The drainage system is also flawless. No tilt required, and the plug can also come all the way off for cleaning. Very simple.</li>

<p>Pelican is a well-known name for hard-sided storage cases: For everything from cameras to rifles, Pelican is the brand to beat. After using the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G7KG5PA/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican &#8211; Elite</a> for a few months, we love their coolers, too.</p>
<p>This 50-quart cooler is the biggest we tested and kept 20 pounds of ice for just five hours less than the 40-quart Orca&#8217;s 115-hour win. The Pelican is 10 quarts larger than the Orca, seven pounds heavier and $25 more expensive on average. Pelican also falls a bit short on warranty, specifically excluding rubber feet and drain components in their guarantee of excellence.</p>
<p>Pelican&#8217;s lid is sturdy enough to sit on, and it has four cup holders. There&#8217;s even an angler&#8217;s ruler and cutting board to measure that freshly caught salmon and clean it.</p>
<p>Pelican has you covered for campground security concerns: They’ve equipped it with not one, not two, but three holes for padlocks and lock-down cables. Bear-safe, guaranteed.</p>

Its huge carrying capacity, built-in ruler and full-width handles are evidence that this is the kind of cooler you take on all of your extreme outdoor endeavors.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G7KG5PA/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Okay, you’ve caught your fish, and now it’s time to head home, but you&#8217;ve still got the worst part of unpacking: cleaning the cooler. The Pelican cleans quite easily, but there are so many non-smooth surfaces that it takes more time to wash and dry every nook and cranny than the smooth finish on other coolers. We found using a brush with about two-inch bristles worked best — firm but flexible enough to get in the harder-to-reach spots.</p>
<p>Something that we noticed when performing one of our cleaning tests is that the Pelican is a bit top heavy when it’s empty. For example, if you shoot the hose at the open lid, the cooler will topple over. So we just put some soap and water in the bottom first. The drainage system is second only to the Orca, with just a few ounces of water sitting in the bottom after draining.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget that this is a heavy duty cooler: It weighs 35 pounds when empty. There are wide, firm handles to compensate for this, so more than two people can grab hold if need be. The handle is a two-inch thick, nine-inch-wide hunk of plastic; plenty of space for two hands on each side, but they don&#8217;t swing out like the Orca&#8217;s strap-handles.</p>
<p>The Pelican isn’t going to be the cooler that you take to a crowded beach or anywhere else that you can’t easily pull a car up to. You can’t buy add-on wheels from Pelican, but they do make a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XRSWXPS/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">wheeled version of the Elite</a> that gives up some space for that convenience. Definitely consider whether the wheels are a requirement before purchasing.</p>
<p>After all of our tests, we prefer the Orca for carrying long distances. We know that if you’re looking to buy this cooler you probably won’t be moving around a lot (more so in a truck or boat), but it’s just something to keep in mind.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G7KG5PA/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican &#8211; Elite</a> kept 20 pounds of ice cold for about 108 hours in 90+ degree weather.</li>
<li>This is the mountain cooler, the fishing cooler. Pretty much anytime you think you&#8217;ll test the durability of your cooler, Pelican should be at the top of your list.</li>
<li>Pelican has built in three padlock holes, an angler&#8217;s ruler and a bottle opener.</li>
<li>It’s a bit harder to clean when compared to the Orca, but it&#8217;s sturdy and has a lifetime warranty on the plastic body.</li>

<h2 id="soft-cooler-pick">Best soft cooler: Polar Bear &#8211; Solar Bear</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/polar-bear-conversion.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Usually when you think of a “soft” cooler you assume it will rip or tear easily: not the case with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072R14BQS/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Polar Bear &#8211; Solar Bear</a>. The amount of material used to keep this cooler cold and strong is pretty astonishing, and more than half of the total volume is insulation. Its double-coated 850-denier nylon is the same material used in backpacks, motorcycle jackets and boat skins, definitely outdoor-proof.</p>
<p>Thankfully all of the soft coolers we tested held up to their claims of being leak-proof and sweat-proof: Nobody wants to drive home from the mountains or beach with a soggy mess in the car. The Polar Bear gives you a huge opening for access, and then you can choose to buckle it down to squeeze out some air or leave it in a taller pouch shape.</p>

Although it can be buckled down to a box-like shape, we found it’s easiest to pack and unpack when unbuckled due to its huge opening.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072R14BQS/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>At first we kept it buckled, but after a few uses we preferred keeping it unbuckled for easier access to the items inside. The shoulder strap on this bag is nowhere near the quality of the YETI, but for a third of the price, we’re okay with that. It’s still decently comfortable, and we had no problems carrying this bag on short hikes.</p>
<p>Something you’ll definitely want to look at if comparing the Polar Bear to the AO Fishing Cooler is the dry storage. The Polar Bear only has a small pocket, compared to about half a side of the AO.</p>
<p>Another bonus is that Polar Bear lets you order a customized cooler from <a href="http://www.polarbearcoolers.com/custom-cooler-shop.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their custom embroidery shop</a>.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>If you want durability and ice-retention, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072R14BQS/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Polar Bear &#8211; Solar Bear</a> is a great soft cooler for around 100 bucks.</li>
<li>Its 840-denier nylon and YKK buckles and zippers should make this a very tough bag, with tie-downs for rigging to your boat or bike.</li>
<li>Thick insulation holds the cold for over 75 hours, about 10 hours less than the Yeti.</li>
<li>When unbuckled, its huge opening allows generous access, and the Solar Bear can be flattened down for easier packing.</li>
<li>Also, the Polar Bear can be customized with a logo of your business or a family name so you never have to worry about whose cooler is whose.</li>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010CRX6QK/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Igloo &#8211; MaxCold</a> came in third place for insulation performance, with thick walls that kept food cold for about 90 hours with 20 pounds of ice in our test. That&#8217;s not as impressive as our other top picks, but the price is only 20% of those super-coolers.</p>
<p>We bumped it, dropped it, slid it, and haven&#8217;t seen any damage from the wear. The polyethylene Igloo hides scratches well, and in their earlier days Igloo would test ice chest designs by lowering jeeps onto them. Igloo makes a simple cooler for a good price, nice to bring to a beach and easy to carry around.</p>

We treated this cooler with a throw-around mentality, and it took the beating like a champ.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010CRX6QK/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Because the handles swivel about five inches on each side, this gives you about 10 inches of wiggle-room when transporting the cooler. So whether you’re going to the beach for a bonfire or the park for a picnic, this cooler provides great cold for its weight, is very portable and provides a great seat.</p>
<p>There is a strong plastic band that holds the top of the cooler from going back too far, which helps keep the hinges from taking the brunt of the weight. This, of course, is done to ensure a longer life of the hinges.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you must tilt this behemoth to drain it properly, because the plug sticks out about an inch into the cooler, rather than sitting flush with the wall or bottom. That said, it still drains adequately and will do a great job for the price.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>For a classic plastic cooler, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010CRX6QK/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Igloo &#8211; MaxCold</a> is big, durable and allows for easy transportation with its well-designed handles.</li>
<li>This is rugged enough to toss in the truck, and it kept ice for almost four whole days!</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re looking for function over features, and you don’t want to spend hundreds on a cooler, then this is a great pick.</li>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0175L8DDM/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YETI &#8211; Hopper</a> is a great-looking cooler, with hard-won brand recognition among those ruggedly stylish ‘luxury camping’ people on Instagram who do yoga on top of mountains.</p>
<p>The strap alone feels so good in your hand and over your shoulder that you might not even care how well it keeps your ice. (that may be an exaggeration, but it did hold 20 pounds of ice for four days — about 10 hours longer than other soft coolers we tested.)</p>
<p>The reasons we didn&#8217;t deem the YETI &#8211; Hopper as best soft cooler were the way its zipper runs down the middle and its lack of flexibility at the opening of the cooler, which makes it difficult to pack and unpack. It’s easy enough to grab a drink, but if you’re trying to find an ingredient for your mountaintop raw-cheese avocado toast, bring a flashlight and a wish.</p>
<p>All soft coolers have the same problem when it comes to keeping food: The sides squeeze everything inside, so you need Tupperware to keep your food from getting squashed. If you&#8217;re really good at packing the most delicate food on top, and are extremely careful when you&#8217;re transporting the cooler, you can get by. If you’re not — as we unfortunately found out on our way to a barbecue— the shaking can turn your sandwiches soggy.</p>
<p>If you’re a “gear nerd,” as our consultant from REI so eloquently put it, and are sad that the YETI doesn’t have a bottle opener on the zipper pull like the Polar Bear, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B016CI2B5A/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here’s a YETI bottle opener</a> that attaches to the YETI’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOLLE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MOLLE</a>-compatible &#8220;hitchpoint grid.&#8221; The grid is actually incredibly useful as it allows you to attach carabiners, ropes and a ton of other compatible gear directly to your cooler.</p>
<p>On top of that there are multiple ways to strap this bad boy down with six D-ring tie-down points. And you can always loop through the handles, from which there are four to choose as well as a shoulder strap.</p>
<p>The Hopper is a cool bag, but it&#8217;s the most expensive cooler we tested. The insulation performance is impressive given the size of the bag, but if it&#8217;s mostly going to be a lunch bag (and not especially convenient to use), then we really don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth the price.</p>

<p>Warning: If you were alive in the 70s the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009PURKE/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coleman &#8211; Steel-Belted Cooler</a> may elicit nostalgia. This throwback not only brings back that classic look, it can hold the cold! For four days it held the ice intact in some pretty blistering sun (hovering around 90 °F). Total time at below 40 °F is just shy of the Igloo at 80 hours. Not too shabby, Coleman.</p>
<p>So, it looks good, it holds the ice well &#8230; What’s the catch? Well, there’s no real catch per se, but the paint coating on the surface is pretty easily scratched. It&#8217;s also eight pounds heavier than the Igloo, so you&#8217;ll have to really love the retro style to make this worth your while.</p>
<p>This Coleman has a nice drain channel so that you don’t have to tilt it to empty the water. The channel is only about a quarter-inch deep though, as compared to the Orca and Pelican where drain channels are a few times as deep. But, like the Orca, the Coleman is smooth all over so all it took to clean was a spray-down and a little scrubbing. Let it air dry or wipe its surfaces with a towel, and you&#8217;re good until next year.</p>
<p>The metal swivel handles are a good try, giving you an extra two inches on each side to work with. However, the handles are only about three-quarters of an inch thick, which is a bit too small for a comfortable carry. You basically have to put the cooler in your fingertips and can’t really utilize your handy-dandy opposable thumbs for grip.</p>
<p>Coleman backs up this cooler with a six-year limited warranty, which is pretty good for hard coolers in this price range. That said, if you leave a steel cooler rusting in a boat for six years, you&#8217;re not really covered under the &#8220;defects in materials or workmanship&#8221; terms of the warranty.</p>
<p>Here’s something you may want to take notice of when thinking about its size and how it will fit in your trunk. <b>The dimensions on Amazon are wrong: Instead of 25.1 x 17.5 x 17.2 inches, it&#8217;s actually 22.5 x 14.5 x 16.2 inches. </b>So, it’s smaller in every conceivable way, which makes it easier to pack.</p>
<h3>AO Coolers &#8211; Vinyl Fishing Cooler</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00329NRH4/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AO Coolers &#8211; Vinyl Fishing Cooler</a> is like a vinyl half-brother to the nylon Polar Bear. The vinyl is not quite as tough as the nylon, but it never gave us pause during our testing. And, although it has less insulation that the Polar Bear, it retained the ice for almost three full days, just falling a couple hours shy of the mark at 67 hours.</p>
<p>The Fishing Cooler really bests its counterpart with dry storage: There is a full horizontal zipper that goes halfway up and runs across one whole side of the cooler.</p>
<p>We drove it to the beach for the day and back, and it neither sweated nor leaked, meaning our seats stayed dry. And on top of that, the foods we kept in the pocket stayed entirely dry as well.</p>
<p>There is no little bottle opener on the zipper, but it does open up a bit nicer than the Polar Bear. Another way it beats the Polar bear is that it is able to fold up smaller, about four inches thick. This makes it very easy to tuck away while it’s not in use or after all the food and beverages have been consumed.</p>
<p>All things considered, this is a nice soft cooler that just doesn&#8217;t quite keep up with the Polar Bear for insulation or ruggedness. At nearly the same price, we&#8217;d say the best reason to buy this is if you need it to sit in the bottom of a fishing boat for days. (The nylon used on the outside of the YETI and Polar Bear designs will absorb a little bit of water, even though the coating on the inside of the fabric will keep them from leaking.)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00363RV32/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coleman &#8211; Performance Wheeled Cooler</a> is that generic cooler you see everywhere: tell-tale red base, white top, wheels and big handle. It&#8217;s the one everybody seems to bring to pool parties and for good reason: It works well, and it&#8217;s less than 50 bucks. It held ice and food below 40 °F for 85 hours in 90+ °F weather. What more do you want?</p>
<p>Its good performance in ice-retention (fourth place) is due to its thickness (no surprise, fourth-thickest insulation). On top of the quality cold-retention, it has four drink holders molded into the plastic on the top of the lid (just like the Pelican).</p>

It was easily the most portable cooler we tested and is incredibly affordable.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00363RV32/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>This was the only cooler we tested that came with wheels (and our forearms were thankful for a break during our portability test). The wheeled Coleman was by far the easiest to transport for this reason, and you only need one person to move between picnic spots. If you do need to carry it over a rock or ravine, it has handles molded into the plastic on each side.</p>
<p>The handles, though, require a lot of finger strength and don’t allow for a good grip, but they are seldom needed. Even so, the good price does come at a cost: The top doesn’t stay open easily (and you feel like you’re going to break it if you push it back too far). Now, this is good for keeping in the cold (it&#8217;s hard to leave open by accident), but it makes it pretty annoying if you&#8217;re rummaging for ingredients to make a more complex meal.</p>
<p>It has an okay drainage system, but you still need to tip the cooler to get all the water out. Also, Coleman support reps told us on the phone that they don&#8217;t technically have any warranty for this model, though they&#8217;ll often do a &#8220;courtesy replacement&#8221; in the first year of ownership. But hey, it&#8217;s only $35.</p>
<h3>Arctic Zone &#8211; Titan</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ALB98IM/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Arctic Zone &#8211; Titan</a> is definitely a picnic-type cooler. It has the most uninsulated dry-storage pockets of any cooler we tested: five pockets if you count the two separate zippers in the front. It comes with a shelf that keeps things out of the ice, too. (Note that this will definitely mean your food heats up more than it would if it were submerged during a days-long trip.)</p>
<p>All of our dry food stayed dry during a day trip to the pool. It was refreshing to have a cooler that came with a dry shelf after our soggy sandwich incident. However, we noticed the dry storage on the outside wasn’t completely waterproof when we brought out the hose for cleaning. So, it’s “waterproof” as long as you don’t absolutely soak it. Thankfully, the shelf insert doesn&#8217;t prevent you from cooling a certain kind of 12-ounce bottle standing upright.</p>
<p>Okay, so great dry storage, but what about the cold-retention? It performed the poorest out of all the coolers we tested, but that’s some stiff competition! It still had ice after 69 hours in some hot, hot sun, which is more than enough cold-retention for a day-cooler. Note, however, that if you keep something like raw chicken on the dry shelf instead of submerged in your ice, it might spend a whole day above the 40-degree safe zone before it finally gets cooled down enough.</p>
<p>The shoulder strap is attached at a nice angle that makes for carrying it a bit easier. But, especially when compared to the strap of the YETI, it is not exactly comfortable with a heavy load. Also, there is no drainage system; you’re going to have to empty it the old-fashioned way.</p>
<p>Also, we noted that during our summer of tests the sun faded the black fabric. So, if you’re someone who doesn’t like the look of wear-and-tear, then we suggest going with a more UV-resistant option, like the Polar Bear.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Whether gearing up for a weekend trip or a casual outing to the park, you want a cooler that can keep the ice cold and that’s easy to transport. We chose the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EY7HQ06/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Orca &#8211; 40 Quart Classic</a> as the top cooler, because it maintained ice for more than 110 hours, was one of the easiest coolers to clean and provided the best handles for carrying.</p>
<p>If you’re heading to bear country or salmon streams, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G7KG5PA/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican &#8211; Elite</a> will satisfy all your outdoor needs with its durable materials, built-in ruler and triple-locking lid. Fifty quarts of capacity also means you could put even more ice in there to get better than our tested 108 hours of raw-chicken-safe cooling.</p>
<p>If you’re going for cost effectiveness, then the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010CRX6QK/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Igloo &#8211; MaxCold</a> can fulfill your quest as it performs nearly as well as the coolers in the couple-hundred-dollar range. Fifty-quart capacity, 90 hours of ice, and it’s only about 60 bucks.</p>
<p>Soft coolers are great for the more adventurous outings, as they can be packed down very compactly once they’ve finished their job. With 48 quarts of capacity and almost 75 hours worth of ice-keeping insulation, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072R14BQS/?tag=ybdcoo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Polar Bear &#8211; Solar Bear</a> came out on top in this category, mostly because of better zipper design and a much better price than the big-name competition.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ver a long, hot summer, we tested 19 of the top lunch boxes, bags and coolers designed to keep your food cool and fresh. Our top pick for best lunch box is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006HFC3K2/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coleman &#8211; 9-Can Insulated Lunch Bag</a> with removable hard liner.

<h2 class="collapse" id="how-we-chose">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We scoured the web for reviews and mentions of great bags. As always, we picked finalists that have plenty of verified purchaser feedback on major retail sites and eliminated contenders with consistent complaints (even if the complaints were in the minority of reviews).</p>
<p>“Lunch box” is a diverse product category. We looked at four groupings:</p>
<h3>Bento boxes</h3>
<p>These are minimalist trays designed to carry enough food to get most people through the day, and nothing else. Most offer some means of carrying silverware, too; if you need more than 900 calories in a lunch, though, this is definitely not the best way to go (unless you’re carrying something like single-serving potato chips and soda in some other bag, in which case portion control might be exactly what you want).</p>
<h3>Lunch bags</h3>
<p>This is a category that’s a bit ambiguous, but for the most part this is an insulated nylon bag that works like a reusable paper sack. The trick is that some of these bags actually have more capacity than small coolers; the major distinction is that they’re tall rather than wide. For adults, we looked at bags with enough room to keep a big sandwich and something on the side. For kids, we were looking for frustration-free opening and intuitive organization features.</p>
<h3>Small coolers</h3>
<p>The most ambiguous category, we defined the small cooler as capable of carrying more than six but fewer than 13 12-oz. beverage cans. These are mostly horizontally-oriented in the way they sit, though you could argue that a few of them are “tall.”</p>
<h3>Large coolers</h3>
<p>These bags can all carry a twelve-pack of beverages with room for ice, and will carry enough food to feed a family or a small party. A few have multiple insulated compartments, which really makes a difference if you’re carrying a lot of different types of food. If you&#8217;re planning on hauling a picnic for a crowd, check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">review of the best cooler</a> or the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-thermoelectric-cooler/">best thermoelectric cooler</a>.</p>

[table id=70/]
<h2 class="collapse" id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Number of insulated compartments:</strong> Separate compartments give you the opportunity to take hot or warm items in the same bag without unnecessarily heating up your ice packs in the main compartment. Some of the bags even have insulated pockets. This will be listed as, for example, 2.1 for two main insulated compartments and one insulated pocket.</p>
<p><strong>Capacity:</strong> People eat different things for lunch; that’s an uncontrolled variable in a comparison like this. We tried to sort our recommendations into three helpful size categories, but we’ve listed the <a href="#the-19-best" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capacities on our master table</a> based on how many 12 oz. cans we could fit into each bag.</p>
<p><strong>Liners:</strong> Some of the bags we tested feature removable liners. While a removable liner is not inherently more waterproof or stain-resistant than a sewn-in liner, it’s easier to deal with a bag that’s dirty if you can take the liner out to wash it.</p>
<p><strong>Accessories:</strong> A few of these bags come with additional items that you might use: beverage containers, picnic flatware and even reusable storage containers.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We took these lunch bags and coolers everywhere. We took lunch to work, and to the park. We had picnics at the lake, and snacks at the library. We strapped them to a motorcycle, and we even took food to Disneyland in the middle of a hot July.</p>
<p>At the end of our time with the bags, we sat down and rated each one according to these criteria:</p>
<h3>Construction quality</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9473" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/zipper-construction-quality-1024x682.jpg" alt="Construction quality testing" width="900" /><br />
This is a ranking of considerations like stitching, zippers, durable materials, easy-to-clean liners and insulation that seems like it’ll maintain its shape over time.</p>
<p>Lunch bags aren’t like gear bags or luggage where the contents are more valuable than the container, so we didn’t do any abusive tests. We definitely took away points for cheap liners or thin nylon, though.</p>
<h3>Leak-proofing</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9465" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/leak-proof-testing-1024x682.jpg" alt="testing for leaks" width="900" /><br />
Any of these bags will keep food off your car seat, but we wanted to find out if they were good enough to be truly leak-proof. We filled all the bags with water then shook, flipped and dropped them to see how much they leaked. We also scored this category based on how easy it is to clean the liner of a bag.</p>
<p>While each of the plastic single-meal-sized bento options will keep liquids in place, shaking them around means liquid all over the lid of the entire box. PlanetBox’s metal tray is not watertight at all, but the included soup cup is, and that’s definitely the most mess-free way to carry and eat your tikka masala. (Too bad you can’t put it in a microwave.)</p>
<p>The big bags were quite waterproof, but only to a point. None will actually keep water from leaking out the zipper, and even the locking lid on the Stanley cooler will leak if you hold it upside down. So at the end of testing, a five-star rating means that the liner held water perfectly in an upright position and was easy to remove for cleaning. If the bag scored less than a four in this category, that means water had soaked through the liner (or worse, came dribbling out a seam).</p>
<p>Note that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NSM088G/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jaxx &#8211; FitPak</a> can stop leaks with the included accessories: six portion-control-friendly reusable containers. The bag has an easy-to-wash rubberized liner, but liquids will slowly leak out at the seams if they’re not in the containers. (We give the system a five, the bag itself an even three.)</p>
<h3>Design and practicality</h3>
<p>This score is based on a variety of considerations, including bag shape, how comfortable the straps are, removable liners, features like expanding water bottle pockets and any other unique design considerations that made the bag better.</p>
<h3>Insulation</h3>

According to the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/keeping-bag-lunches-safe/ct_index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perishable food like your egg salad sandwich should be kept at 40° F or below.</a> Any higher than that, and you run the risk of bacteria multiplying (yes, there’s already bacteria in your food) to a level that might make you sick. Not all bacteria will make you sick, but unless you can assay a thoroughly representative sample of every lunch you pack… just pack some ice with your fresh food.</p>
<p>To see how much the insulation in these bags can help, we tested each bag in the hot sun. Smaller bags were loaded with three ounces of ice, and the bigger coolers were tested with six ounces. We left all the bags out in the hot sun (ambient temperature was approximately 102 °F) and checked on them after five hours. The score above is the percentage of that 40° target that the bags achieved; higher is better.</p>
<p>The results are not very promising. There was actually very little difference between the bags; smaller bags stayed cooler, but the biggest difference within a category was five degrees Fahrenheit (4% further from the target temperature).</p>
<p>None of these bags would keep a potato salad safe in a car on a hot day without extra ice to soak up the heat. The more ice you keep in your cooler, the longer your food will stay safe; that’s one more reason to carefully choose the capacity you need.</p>
<p>On a hot day in direct sun, even the single ice pack included in the Jaxx kit and the ice-gel-liner in the PackIt bag were insufficient to keep a lunch in the safe zone for five hours out in the sun. The FSIS recommends at least two ice packs per bag, or an ice pack and a frozen beverage. If you have an icemaker and a supply of sturdy zip-seal bags, you can use ice cubes. However, commercial ice packs are durable and convenient. That said, keeping your bag out of the sun is the most important step.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Coleman &#8211; 9-Can Soft Cooler</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9461" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/coleman-lunch-bag-solo-1024x682.jpg" alt="Coleman 9-can" width="900" /><br />
With a hard plastic “tub” style liner, good pockets and all the other features we looked for in a basic bag, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006HFC3K2/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coleman &#8211; 9-Can Soft Cooler</a> represents an amazing value at around 14 dollars. This is an ideal lunch box for adults or even a picnic bag for two.</p>
<p>While the Coleman wasn’t the very best at keeping a lunch cold without ice, the real trick to keeping perishable food safe is to use lots of ice, and that’s what this cooler is built for.</p>
<p>The removable hard liner is an ideal ice bucket. This is perfect for keeping a six-pack well buried on a scorching hot day, or carrying a 12-pack (without any ice) on a less-intense outing. Could there be a better way to design a lunch box for men?</p>
<p>The best thing about the hard tub liner is that it’s easier to clean and dry than the soft zip-in liners used in many of the other coolers. Trying to get the last few drops of water out of a vinyl bag is a pain, but the Coleman will air-dry without problems and is easy to wipe down with a towel.</p>
<p>This makes an ideal lunch bag for large or bulky lunches. There’s a zippered mesh pocket in the lid that will hold a small ice pack, and of course lots of room for more ice packs inside the tub.</p>

The leak-proof tub liner also makes this much less hassle to clean than other bags.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006HFC3K2/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The best reason we could find to use a different bag is if you really need to keep warm and cold food separate. With only one large compartment, you need to decide if you want everything warm or ice-cold. Even in a small insulated bag, though, most hot food will cool quickly: unless you’re carrying soup in a vacuum-sealed container, keeping a hot lunch hot for more than an hour is unrealistic.</p>
<p>The other thing this bag didn’t do is carry the picks from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/" rel="noopener">water bottle review</a>. With a 2.9 inch diameter, the 20-oz Kleen Kanteen will barely squeeze into the mesh side pocket, and while it might count as “fitting,” we’re pretty sure the elastic would tear if you did that every day. Most non-insulated 12-ounce water bottles should fit in the pocket, but there’s enough room inside that you’ll wind up keeping your water in there anyhow.</p>
<p>If you only have a small lunch and don’t want to carry around something this bulky, there are other options. This cooler is a better bargain than even the smallest lunch bags we tested, though, so we recommend that everyone consider it first.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Coleman &#8211; 9-Can Soft Cooler is a good size for a bigger lunch and has room for plenty of ice in the hard liner ‘tub.’</li>
<li>Well-built and utilitarian, Coleman designed this bag with a great set of features and options for the price.</li>

<h3>The best lunch box for work</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9470" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/mobento-solo-box-1024x682.jpg" alt="Monbento" width="900" /><br />
An insulated cooler with sandwich bags or reusable containers inside is probably the way most people will want to pack a lunch, but there are other options.</p>
<p>If you’re working in an office that has a break room with a fridge, a microwave and a sink, you might be happiest with a compact lunch box.</p>
<p>The Japanese “bento” concept of taking a lunch in boxes with portion-sized compartments dates back more than four centuries, and modern-day practitioners have <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=character%20bento%20kyarben&amp;rs=typo_auto_original&amp;auto_correction_disabled=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made it into an artform.</a></p>
<p>The three compartmentalized boxes we tried each had some quirks, but on the whole, our favorite was the stacking <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DC29MRU/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Monbento &#8211; MB Original.</a> With two stacking compartments, it has room for a decent-sized lunch, and you can fit a small banana or carrot inside without cutting it into tiny pieces. The included tiny dish also works as a divider of sorts, which will help if you&#8217;re looking for a bento box mostly because you don&#8217;t like your foods to touch one another.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DC29MRU/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/monbento-mb-original-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/monbento-mb-original-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/monbento-mb-original-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/monbento-mb-original-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/monbento-mb-original-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/monbento-mb-original-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/monbento-mb-original-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/monbento-mb-original-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/monbento-mb-original.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Great for Work: Monbento - MB Original</h3><p>It isn't cheap, but Monbento gives you a clever way to carry a minimalist lunch.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DC29MRU/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Modetro Bento also performed quite well if your lunches are small enough, but it’s not as flexible as the Monbento. All three of the boxes we tested offered some way to seal liquids inside (PlanetBox includes a cup with a rubber lid), but we felt the Monbento’s seal was the most reliable and easiest to clean.</p>
<p>None of the bento-style boxes offered much insulation at all, and even the included carry bag provided with the Modetro box doesn’t give you a way to use an ice pack. (It barely has room for utensils.)</p>
<h3>The best insulated lunch bag</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9463" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/high-sierra-solo-bag-1024x682.jpg" alt="High Sierra with a sandwich" width="900" /><br />
There are two ways to maximize insulation performance in a lunch bag: use a bag that’s no bigger than you need, or take a lot of ice.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D2PJWM6/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/high-sierra-stacked-comp-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/high-sierra-stacked-comp-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/high-sierra-stacked-comp-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/high-sierra-stacked-comp-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/high-sierra-stacked-comp-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/high-sierra-stacked-comp-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/high-sierra-stacked-comp-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/high-sierra-stacked-comp-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/high-sierra-stacked-comp.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Insulation: High Sierra - Stacked Compartment</h3><p>This bag maximizes the cooling of your ice packs by separating your lunch into two compartments. It also has a separate pocket for stuff that doesn’t need to be kept cold.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D2PJWM6/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>In our testing, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D2PJWM6/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">High Sierra &#8211; Stacked Compartment Lunch Bag</a> was 3% better at keeping cold than our top pick, almost certainly because its main compartment is smaller. If you’re not using much ice, this bag will also let you pack non-perishable food in a second compartment where it won’t warm up the food in your main compartment. If your lunch bag will sit in a climate-controlled environment all morning, this is a good way to manage.</p>
<p>The one downside to this bag is that with all those zippers, there’s a bigger chance that any leaking liquids will spill out. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0078K40OC/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid Lunchblox Bag</a> was slightly better at keeping water in for that reason. In either case, you don’t want to pack liquids inside unless you’re very sure they’re not going to leak.</p>
<h3>The best cooler bag</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9462" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ebags-large-bag-solo-1024x682.jpg" alt="Crew Cooler with lunch" width="900" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to keep things cold for a long time but can&#8217;t haul around a large insulated cooler chest, A large bag with plenty of ice is still your best bet. If you need enough food for a few people, then a large bag like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004BNN0MM/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Crew Cooler II</a> from eBags has room to spare.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004BNN0MM/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ebags-crew-cooler-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ebags-crew-cooler-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ebags-crew-cooler-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ebags-crew-cooler-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ebags-crew-cooler-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ebags-crew-cooler-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ebags-crew-cooler-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ebags-crew-cooler-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ebags-crew-cooler.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Jumbo Pick: eBags - Crew Cooler II</h3><p>Designed for airline crews who pack food for long trips, eBags has packed almost every feature you can imagine into this bag: two insulated compartments, two expanding water bottle pockets and beefy construction all around. A generous insulated lid compartment holds hot food or just accessories you don’t want to ice.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004BNN0MM/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>We could get 23 12-ounce beverage cans into the two insulated compartments, and the zip-in removable liner is sealed tight so you don’t have to worry about puddles at the end of the day. Like the High Sierra lunch bag, the second insulated compartment is great for stuff that you don’t want to pack in ice — we found that you can fit a bigger-sized DSLR like a Canon 5D in the lid.</p>
<p>The Mojecto &#8211; Large Cooler Bag is very similar to the Crew Cooler, but it’s four inches shorter; it also has a more padded shoulder strap. If you anticipate carrying your cooler any significant distance, that might be a better pick. Both bags have expanding water bottle pockets, a removable liner and quick-release buckles for the shoulder strap.</p>
<h3>The best lunch bag for kids</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9469" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/LunchBoxes_028-1024x682.jpg" alt="rubbermaid lunchblox with school lunch" width="900" /><br />
A small lunch bag with easy-to-use features is going to be the key to success when picking a lunchbox for school kids. Our favorite small bag is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D2PJWM6/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">High Sierra &#8211; Stacked Compartment Lunch Bag</a>, but for school lunches the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0078K40OC/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Lunchblox</a> bag has a few things going for it. The simplicity of a single compartment in the Lunchblox bag might be better for some kids, and the shoulder strap might come in handy for those who tend to drop things and forget them in the hall or on the bus.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0078K40OC/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubbermaid-lunchblox-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubbermaid-lunchblox-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubbermaid-lunchblox-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubbermaid-lunchblox-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubbermaid-lunchblox-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubbermaid-lunchblox-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubbermaid-lunchblox-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubbermaid-lunchblox-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubbermaid-lunchblox.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best for Kids: Rubbermaid - Lunchblox</h3><p>This is a simple bag that will hold plenty of lunch and keep utensils organized.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0078K40OC/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The LunchBlox bag is also a tiny bit better than the High Sierra bag at preventing spills, since it makes a better “tub” shape when it’s lying on its back. If you flip it over, though, liquids will still leak through the zipper.</p>
<p>We love that there&#8217;s a place to store utensils securely and enough space to hold a lunch and a water bottle. (Frozen water bottles are a great way to keep perishables cold.)</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="others-tested">Finalists tested but not recommended</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9471" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/other-lunch-bags-1024x682.jpg" alt="The other lunch bags we tested" width="900" /></p>
<h3>Modetro &#8211; Bento Lunchbox</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0178BIE5G/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Modetro Bento</a> is the least expensive of the bento options we tried, and that might be enough to make it your first pick. The main reason we didn’t pick this over the Monbento is size: the three small compartments limit what you can pack. If you’re chopping up all your food and arranging it sculpturally it’s probably a great choice, especially since the lid is see-through, but if you want to include a stick of celery or a carrot you’ll almost certainly prefer the two deep rectangles of the Monbento box. We were also concerned that the white plastic might stain more easily over time than the black plastic of the Monbento.</p>
<h3>PlanetBox &#8211; Rover</h3>
<p>PlanetBox is all about retro cool, and depending on how you look at things <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006IVM9VS/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the all-metal Rover</a> might be more earth-friendly than plastic. There isn’t any other reason we could find to choose this to carry a lunch, though. Without a way to carry ice, you’d better have a fridge to keep it in, but in that case the tray will get uncomfortably cold.</p>
<p>The compartments stamped into the Rover are functional, but small. The best thing about this lunch box is the securely-sealing soup cup, but we’re pretty sure you already have a reusable container that will do that job (and if you don’t you shouldn’t pay these prices to get one).</p>
<h3>Jaxx &#8211; FitPak</h3>
<p>Probably the biggest downside to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NSM088G/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Jaxx FitPack</a> is a lack of flexibility. No shoulder strap, no removable liner, and a design that forces you to find a way to divide your food among four two-cup and two one-cup containers.</p>
<p>The FitPak set is designed for gym gorillas, so it seemed like overkill for most of our testers; if you’re packing for a family it’s a fairly reasonable size (so long as nobody complains about sharing containers).</p>
<p>Many of the other bags will do the same job, though, with enough cash leftover to buy multiple sets of reusable containers. (Those bags all have shoulder straps, too.)</p>
<p>This is probably a pretty good package for someone who specifically wants the accessories included to fit efficiently into one bag, but we can’t rationalize the price if that’s not exactly what you’re after.</p>
<h3>Everest &#8211; Cooler Lunch Bag</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006HMPVEK/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Everest’s Cooler Lunch Bag</a> is a simple product that meets all the basic criteria. It’s sealed against leaks and fairly well-built, but without even a liner or pocket there aren’t any perks. For a few dollars more, the Coleman 9-Can will be easier to clean and hold more lunch.</p>
<h3>Stanley &#8211; 7QT Heritage Cooler</h3>
<p>A stalwart representative of the old school, we have mixed feelings about our time with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0019D78H0/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stanley’s Heritage Cooler</a>.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this is the most rugged of the coolers we tested — we’re pretty sure you could run over it with a truck, but the editors don’t like it when we do that. “Few people,” they say, “are ever going to drive over a cooler.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, people do have to carry a lunch bag around. This thing has a handle, but it’s not exactly easy to carry. The Heritage Cooler’s divided compartment also holds fewer than half as many cans as the other coolers its size; you can fit nine cans and some ice in the 15.5 inch-wide frame; the EvoVox cooler mentioned below holds 21 cans in a space just 13” wide.</p>
<p>If the Heritage Cooler gained significant thermal performance or leak-proofing over other bags, it might have earned a special mention, but it leaks when you turn it upside down and it doesn’t really insulate very well, either. What you need for long-term food preservation is plenty of ice, and there are cheaper, better ways of carrying ice than this behemoth.</p>
<p>We do like the included vacuum-insulated ‘Thermos’ flask, though. (Buy it separately, or just buy a good <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/" rel="noopener">travel mug</a> if that’s what you really need.)</p>
<h3>PackIt &#8211; Freezable Lunch Bag</h3>
<p>PackIt had an interesting idea in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HJ8DFGC/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Freezable Lunch Bag</a> that didn’t really pan out in execution. This is a lunch bag only in the most basic sense of the word; it’s a bag, and you could put lunch in it. It’s small, it’s not easy to carry when it’s frozen and stiff, and when we put liquids in it they soaked through the inner liner. If you’re only ever carrying a dry lunch it might be fine, but absorbing liquids generally means smells will start to accumulate over time, too.</p>
<p>Certainly, the idea of a self-contained ice pack is a good one, but it’s not worth the compromises presented here. The High Sierra or Rubbermaid bags are superior in every way, so long as you can make ice, freeze a water bottle, or buy a separate freezable gel pack.</p>
<h3>Mojecto &#8211; Cooler Bag</h3>
<p>For all intents and purposes, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M9DD67G/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mojecto Cooler Bag</a> is the same bag as the eBags Crew Cooler II, but a little bit smaller. (It’s about four inches shorter and holds four fewer drink cans when you pack them tight.) That’s not an exaggeration: the way the compartments are designed and even the expanding-wing water-bottle pockets are almost identical. The zipper on the eBags cooler is a bit beefier, but the shoulder strap chosen by Mojecto is a bit better.</p>
<p>If you don’t need the extra space and you can find the Mojecto for less, it’s a good choice. List price for the Mojecto is higher than for the eBags cooler, though, so if you’re looking for a big bag, just get the bigger one.</p>
<h3>EvoVox &#8211; Insulated Cooler Bag</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018HE44QG/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Insulated Cooler Bag from EvoVox</a> is a great bag, and nearly got our pick for big-capacity cooler. The construction is rugged, and it seems that EvoVox used neoprene or some other stiff foam in the insulation here that makes the sides stiffer and more protective than the spongy foam in all the other bags. It didn’t make the insulation properties any better, though.</p>
<p>The reason this isn’t recommended above the eBags Crew Cooler or the Mojecto bag is that there’s only one compartment. If you’re not going to be carrying anything that won’t squeeze into the pockets this might be a great bag, but we really loved the flexibility of the two-compartment system when we filled the other coolers with ice.</p>
<h3>Oniva &#8211; Pranzo</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006B0MQU/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pranza “Picnic Time” bag</a> was tough to review. Onvia has carefully thought out many of the features included: dual-compartment insulation for hot-and-cold (okay, ice and no-ice) storage, plus a full set of silverware for your romantic day-trip picnic.</p>
<p>If the main compartment were a little larger and included a removable liner, this would have easily scored a special mention. As it is, the eBags &#8211; Crew Cooler II can do everything this bag does and more, so long as you can come up with some silverware on your own.</p>
<h3>Arctic Zone &#8211; Titan</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00URO2JAS/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Titan</a> is very similar to the Coleman &#8211; 9-Can Cooler, but with a liner you can’t remove, a hard lid and velcro instead of a zipper.</p>
<p>We like the removable shelf and the capacity offered by this cooler, but since it sits in the middle of the size range, it’s hard to say for sure it’s going to be big enough for those who pack for a group. The hard lid does seem more robust than the soft lid offered by the Coleman, but it still doesn’t hold water if you flip it upside-down. We’re also not sure how well the Velcro will hold up over time, compared to a zipper.</p>
<p>If you want more capacity than the Coleman bag and find the Arctic Zone Titan on sale, it might be worth going for. At list price, you can buy two of the Coleman bags and get more drinks with the money you saved.</p>
<h3>Igloo &#8211; Maxcold Gripper 16</h3>
<p>If Igloo could have included a liner and a better pocket on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007QEY9ZA/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Maxcold Gripper 16</a> without increasing the price substantially, this probably would have been our favorite bag.</p>
<p>If you want to carry around a whole twelve-pack with ice and stuff some hot sandwiches in the insulated lid for an hour, this bag is fantastic. You don’t get a water bottle pouch, though, and the patch-style pockets that are sewn on won’t hold anything bulkier than the flattest of flatware.</p>
<p>The shoulder strap is basic but well-made, and the handle is very comfortable. The stitching is reinforced at all the right spots, and the strap is even sewn on at a slight angle to reflect the way a bag hangs when it’s loaded. The zippers aren’t exactly heavy-duty, but the main zip is sewn with a liner tape for snag-free zipping.</p>
<p>The antimicrobial lining proved to be fully waterproof in our testing, which is good, but we’d take a removable liner over anti-microbial materials any day.</p>
<p>The Igloo Maxcold doesn’t have features that make it an alternative to pricey coolers like the Mojecto, and it’s also not cheap enough to compete with our top pick. The only things it has on the Coleman nine-can is a bit more capacity and a separate insulated compartment in the lid; the Coleman is better in every other way for about $10 less.</p>
<h3>Ramaka &#8211; Large Insulated Lunch Bag</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011AVNESM/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ramaka’s Large Insulated Lunch Bag</a> is basic, but it fared well in testing. It has everything except a removable liner: sturdy YKK zippers, a nice strap and a big water bottle pocket that actually holds a large Nalgene bottle. It’s not that much bigger than the Coleman, though, and without a removable liner it won’t be as easy to clean.</p>
<h3>GreEco &#8211; Large Capacity Cooler Bag</h3>
<p>If you’re looking for the most capacity-per-dollar, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M13FC46/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GreEco’s Large Capacity Cooler Bag</a> does score a win on that metric. We paid $12 and got 18 cans to fit into the super-tall compartment.<br />
The GreEco bag didn’t leak in our testing, but the construction was merely “good enough” and the shoulder strap was quite short. For a basic bag that you could fold up to keep in a glovebox, this one might be worth considering, but we liked the Coleman much, much more as an every-day lunch bag.</p>
<h3>BF Systems &#8211; Extreme Pak</h3>
<p>We hoped that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004F5IZBM/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Extreme Pak from BF Systems</a> would be a good bargain bag, but there were too many corners cut. The biggest problem here is the liner: It’s sealed with some kind of seam tape, but water still leaked through in the course of our tests. It wasn’t a really bad leak, but if you’re going to be toting ice around all day you’ll wind up leaving puddles everywhere. Not recommended.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9472" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/top-three-bags-1024x682.jpg" alt="Top three bags" width="900" /><br />
We’ve tried to include enough data in our review to help you find a cooler that meets your particular needs. What most people want is a bag that holds enough ice, doesn’t leak or get stained and is easy to clean out at the end of the day.</p>
<p>If you want a small bag to carry a simple lunch around, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D2PJWM6/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">High Sierra &#8211; Stacked Compartment Lunch Bag</a> does all the right things. Split stacked compartments help calm your lunch-organization compulsion and help keep the cold stuff colder.</p>
<p>If you want to be able to carry drinks around for an afternoon (or if you’re packing a monster-work-day sandwich) then the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006HFC3K2/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coleman &#8211; 9-Can Cooler</a> (which can hold up to 12 cans) is a fantastic choice. The hard liner makes it perfect for ice, but it also means your lunch won’t get crushed and any spills will be easy to clean up.</p>
<p>We tested some large cooler bags, too, and we loved the features offered by the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004BNN0MM/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">eBags Crew Cooler II</a>. If you want to carry more food and ice than this will hold (between the two compartments you can almost squeeze in a 24-pack of drink cans) then you almost certainly need something with wheels.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e&#8217;ve been using, cleaning and trying to destroy travel mugs over three years of testing. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a> is the best travel mug for maximum heat retention and easy clean-up. It also proved nearly invulnerable to the drop tests we put it through. If you&#8217;re looking for easy sipping without the risk of spills, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160LEYFY/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo &#8211; Auto-Seal Transit</a> is also a great pick, though it&#8217;s not very easy to clean.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected" class="collapse">How we selected mugs to test</h2>
<p>Our testers have used travel mugs daily for many years and while engaged in activities ranging from truck driving to theatrical stage management, so they had some long-standing demands and expectations. We sorted through countless published professional and consumer reviews and dove into enthusiast discussion boards to find our finalists. We’ve especially kept an eye out for online buzz about flaws and weaknesses, which we’ve tested for and noted. Value is an important consideration for items like this, and we’ve included mugs that ranged in price from $16 to $30 at the time we ordered them.</p>
<p>After our old top pick from Camelbak was discontinued, we started looking for replacements. The Burnout promised to solve all our problems with heat-retention tradeoffs, so we added it to the list. We&#8217;re watching for a new auto-seal design that&#8217;s as easy to clean as the Camelbak, but we haven&#8217;t found it yet.</p>

<h2 id="features-to-look-for" class="collapse">Features to look for</h2>
<p>There are a handful of usability factors that make the difference between your go-to travel mug companion and a dud you’d rather just leave at home. We’ve found the most important factors to be the following:</p>
<p><strong>Leak and spill protection:</strong> You should be able to use a travel mug without fear of spills on your lap or in your backpack.</p>
<p><strong>Ease of opening:</strong> If you want to enjoy a hot beverage while driving, one-handed operation is as much a safety feature as a convenience.</p>
<p><strong>Mess avoidance:</strong> All spouts and lids will collect some liquid while you’re drinking (flip-open lids tend to be the worst in this regard), so in our usability table we’ve rated how safe they are around white silk shirts.</p>
<p><strong>Ease of cleaning:</strong> Nobody wants to use a mug they can’t get clean.</p>
<p><strong>Heat retention:</strong> Hot drinks like your coffee or tea should stay pleasantly hot.</p>
<p><strong>Cup holder/single-brewer compatible:</strong> For those looking for compatibility with a single-cup coffee brewer, we’ve noted which mugs are seven inches or shorter (typical height for a single-cup brewer when the drip tray is removed; your machine may vary), and whether a “shorty” model (usually in 12 oz capacity) is available.</p>
<p><strong>Durability:</strong> Drops happen. A winning travel mug can survive the accidental fall from the top of your car as you absentmindedly back down the driveway on a hectic Monday morning.</p>
<h3>Notes for tea and pour-over brewing</h3>
<p>If you want a built-in loose-leaf-infuser option: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZI5XNO/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VG761C/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stanley</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HYOGTTG/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zojirushi</a> all sell tea-steeping versions of the mugs we tested here (or snap-in accessories) that might help you out, but we’ve been happy with the convenience of drop-in or basket infusers.</p>
<p>Both loose-leaf tea drinkers and pour-over coffee geeks should note mouth-width before they buy: we found the necks of the Klean Kanteen, Thermos Direct Drink and Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 were too small to take any but the narrowest tea infusers; the Hario V60 pour-over coffee brewer just fits the mouth of the Thermos.</p>
<h3>Why are they all stainless steel?</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5461" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors.jpg" alt="stainless steel cup interiors" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Most heat from your mug (once you put a lid on it) is lost through conduction, and the material that conducts the least is nothing at all — hard vacuum. Keeping a vacuum inside the wall of a mug requires a material that’s stiff and strong: steel is stiff, strong, easy to work, and economical. Most of the steel mugs tested specify “18/8 grade” steel or SAE/AISI “304 Stainless”, which contains approximately 18% chromium and 8% nickel. 304 is one of the most widely used alloys in the world (for everything from cookware to the DeLorean to the Gateway Arch) because of its versatility and stain resistance, so there’s a good chance the mugs that don’t specify an alloy are using it or something very similar.</p>
<p>In a strong bath of citric acid, 304 will release slightly more chromium than other alloys do, but for beverage use 304 stainless is as inert as any other stainless alloy, and none of us tasted any unusual metallic flavors in these mugs (even after we left hot orange juice in our top picks for a few hours). If you’re sensitive to trace amounts of nickel or chrome and you drink extra-acidic tea or coffee, consider the Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 (which was nearly our favorite and is “non-stick” lined).</p>
<p>It’s probably worth noting here: all these manufacturers specify that they use BPA-free plastics.</p>
<h3>Non-steel mugs</h3>

<p>We included one non-steel mug in our lineup, the Ello &#8211; Mesa double-wall ceramic mug. We looked at other popular ‘reusable to-go cup’ designs, but none of them had spill-proof lids or insulating properties that would make them competitive in this line-up. (Some issues, like reports of a smelly latex rubber lid on one popular brand, or lids that were difficult to snap on, made our choice not to test even easier.)</p>
<p>The Mesa does keep your drink hot three times longer than a conventional open-top single-wall ceramic mug (an hour above 140°F instead of 15 minutes), but the sliding closure on the lid did not prevent spills.</p>
<p>While some manufacturers of the stainless steel mugs say you can put them in the dishwasher, the microwave is territory held securely by mugs like the Mesa: we microwaved water to a piping-hot 186°F and were happy to find that the outside of the mug was only a pleasantly-warm 93°F, unlike some ceramic mugs that get insanely hot on the outside when nuked.</p>
<p>So, if you are simply looking for slightly better insulation in a ceramic tumbler that can go in the microwave and the dishwasher, the Mesa is worth considering; if you want to stop spills and keep your drink hot for a long commute, read on.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested" class="collapse">How we tested</h2>
<p>Well on our way to developing permanent caffeine dependence after our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-french-press/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">French Press</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-single-cup-coffee-maker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Single-Cup Coffee Maker</a> reviews, we indulged another caffeine binge as we filled, drained, cleaned and tried to break 13 travel mugs for multiple weeks.</p>
<h3>Leak test</h3>

<p>The ability to put a travel mug in your bag without fear of making book-and-computer soup separates the best of the travel mugs from the rest. It’s easy to say “this lid locks in the closed position so it won’t leak!” but some locks are easy to defeat accidentally (Contigo West Loop, we’re looking at you). To say without equivocation that the best mugs won’t leak, we put all the mugs in a duffle bag that spent half an hour inside an industrial dryer.</p>
<p>The mugs were filled, dried carefully, weighed, wrapped in a towel and sealed in an individual bag. Then the seals on each mug were double-checked by shaking (all passed) and dropping them before we put them in the dryer. We started the spin-cycle, checked once at ten minutes, then again at the 30-minute mark. All leaks were clearly visible, and we weighed the mugs again after taking them out of their bags to see how much water had leaked out.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HYOGTTG/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48</a>, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a>, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H4LUMUA/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klean Kanteen</a> leaked nothing in the half-hour they were tossed around inside the dryer. The Forge, without any lock or back-up mechanism to keep the seal from opening, only let out a single drop that we could see on its towel-wrap at the ten minute mark, and we didn’t see any more evidence of leaks at the end (nor could we measure the amount of water that had escaped.)</p>
<h3>Spill test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5464" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test.jpg" alt="ceramic Ello in a spill test" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Another important duty of a travel mug is stopping spills. Some of our testers have worked in locations where only spill-proof mugs are allowed, and far too many of us have experienced the tragic consequences of using unworthy mugs in moving vehicles or at desks covered with important documents.</p>
<p>We simulated a desk-spill by filling each mug halfway with a measured amount of water, then tipping it on its side (spout down). After 15 seconds, we picked up the mug and re-checked the amount of water to determine how much water spilled. We wanted to be sure we were simulating a real-world spill: a lid or seal you can manually close might be great for throwing in a bag, but the spills that matter are the ones that happen while the lid/lock isn’t closed. (Note: we tested the Ello &#8211; Mesa both opened and closed. It spilled so much while it was supposed to be “sealed” we included that number on the chart.)</p>
<p>The self-sealing mugs practically cheat on the spill test, and that’s why we like them. Of the mugs that spilled nothing when knocked over, also note that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EPGMZZS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Forge</a> has a lid design which prevents it from rolling off your desk.</p>
<h3>Clean-up test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5506 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results.png" alt="cleaning test results chart" width="900" height="942" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results.png 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-610x638.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-768x804.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-287x300.png 287w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-295x309.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-885x926.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-360x377.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-375x393.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-414x433.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-320x335.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Keeping a mug clean is one of those tasks that makes the difference between “buy it for life” and trashing an expensive mug in disgust. Our rating here is based on hand-washing with a sponge, scrubber or bottle-brush, but we’ve also noted if the manufacturer says you can put the whole mug in the dishwasher.</p>
<p>We tested how easy it is to effectively field-clean the mugs with a method similar to systems used by metallurgists looking for cracks in airframes: a (non-toxic, water-based) fluorescent paint was poured into the mugs and then out through the drinking spout. Next, the mugs were filled with soapy water, agitated, drained through the spout, and rinsed in the same way.</p>
<p>While the paint came out in our simple rinse procedure without any obvious dribbles or droplets remaining in most cases (there was a tiny drop left inside the Klean Kanteen’s three-piece seal), we did spot some residue left behind on all the mugs under a UV inspection light.</p>

<p>The Contigo Autoseal system is great for convenient spill-free sipping, but its springs and levers are immersed in your pumpkin-spice foam and nutmeg sprinkles.</p>
<p>The hinged-lid Thermos and Zojirushi mugs are pretty easy to clean, with the Thermos Direct Drink taking an edge here because of a vent design that&#8217;s a hole rather than a tube.</p>
<p><strong>Some notes on dishwasher compatibility</strong></p>
<p>All of the lids for these mugs (with the exception, inexplicably, of the OXO Good Grips) are guaranteed safe for top-rack dishwasher cleaning. Some also guarantee that the body of the mug will be okay on the top rack, but only if it’s an unpainted stainless steel body — a mark against the Auto-Seal Transit’s silicone grip design. Stanley and Bubba are both willing to back up their mugs in dishwasher use despite paint and plastic accessories; the hammertone paint looks OK, but the plastic rings on the Bubba seem destined to trap dishwater over time.</p>
<p>While we wouldn&#8217;t recommend daily dishwashing of these mugs (the extreme heat expands and contracts the steel along the seams that keep the vacuum in, which is why many manufacturers say it voids their warranty). If you want to be able to throw it in the top rack every once in awhile for a deep-cleaning, though, it&#8217;s encouraging to know that a company has your back even if the vacuum fails after ten or twenty years.</p>
<h3>Heat retention test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5465" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners.jpg" alt="top four heat test winners" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-300x200.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We ran two tests to measure how well these mugs retain heat. The first test gives a broad overview of mug performance when starting with water at typical restaurant serving temperature; the second test shows how our favorite mugs performed when starting with a lower temperature.</p>
<p><strong>High-temperature heat retention</strong></p>
<p>In the first test we poured very hot water (it was a lot of pouring, so starting temperature varied, but we’ve normalized the differences to show loss from a 185°F starting temperature) into all the mugs and checked the temperature after an hour. Results are in the main table above.</p>
<p>We found that all of the mugs, even the air-insulated Ello &#8211; Mesa, will keep your Starbucks coffee hot enough to be ‘drinkable’ after sitting around for an hour. Not only that, <strong>two of the mugs we tested kept beverages hot enough to burn you</strong>. We want to point out that this kind of test obscures some basic usability complaints that are frequently made in comments about award-winning mugs: they keep boiling-hot coffee so hot that you may need to take extra steps in order to drink it. Some mug-owners on Reddit suggest ice cubes — no, that’s not a joke, <em>ice cubes</em> — to get your fresh cup of hot coffee or tea down to a drinkable temperature.</p>

<p>The Redditors were absolutely right: when we made tea with freshly-boiled water in either of the top two insulation performers (the Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 or the Thermos Direct Drink Insulated Bottle) we found that it won’t be cool enough for most people to drink (below 155°F) until an hour later, even if you leave the lid off completely.</p>
<p>Mugs like these are great if you want to keep drinks hotter for longer. Just be sure you cool your coffee or tea before adding to the mug, or pour out your beverage to drink until temperatures inside the mug have reached a safe level.</p>
<p>Studies show that the severity of burns start getting significantly worse at temperatures above 175°F, so temperature curves between 200°F and 175°F aren’t showing anything but a danger zone. A study published in the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2002.tb08814.x/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Journal of Food Science</em></a> shows that most people will mix cream/milk (or colder coffee) into their hot coffee to bring it down to around 140°F if they’re going to drink it immediately. Further, the Specialty Coffee Association of America cupping and tasting protocols recommend that evaluation of flavor should not begin until coffee has cooled to between 160 &#8211; 140°F.</p>

<p>With that in mind, our second test used water heated to only 167°F. We filled five mugs: three top-ranked in our first heat test, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EPGMZZS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CamelBak &#8211; Forge</a>, and a heavy, 18 oz-capacity open-top ceramic mug as a control.</p>
<p>After 30 minutes, 50ml of water was decanted from each mug into a 100 ml pyrex beaker every 15 minutes. With a bench thermometer and K-type probe, we took eight samples from each mug, leaving a slightly larger sample at the end. This controls for the way most of us drink away the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water#Heat_capacity_and_heats_of_vaporization_and_fusion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specific heat capacity</a> of the water in our travel mugs if we sip periodically over the course of a commute or while working at a desk.</p>
<p>The best and worst performance in this test still correspond roughly to what we saw the first test we ran, but it does show that even in this less-generous scenario the Forge can keep coffee in the “comfortably hot” zone all the way up to two hours, though it’s 15°F cooler than the Thermos. That’s longer than any of us likes to keep the same mug of coffee around, so we’re more than satisfied. (Any insulated mug is also far, far better than a ceramic open-top mug, which lost the same amount of heat in less than 20 minutes.)</p>

<p>Other than falling off a desk, the most likely accident a mug will endure is falling off the roof of a car or truck. We subjected the mugs to a battery of drop tests to give a real-world worst-case assessment of what will happen when you forget which pocket your keys are in and set your mug on the car’s roof “just for a second.”</p>
<p>We included a drop onto a padded surface in our leak test earlier, and all of the mugs escaped that without damage (most didn&#8217;t even leak).</p>

<p>In the first part of our (more destructive) drop test, nearly all the mugs also survived falling from desk height onto concrete with only some road rash. The exception is the the Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48, which cracked badly enough that the lock is only barely holding together.</p>
<p>We carried on dropping the mugs from higher and still higher heights, eliminating mugs that were too broken to be usable. The eight-foot drop cracked five of the remaining eleven mugs. After the ten-foot drop, one more (the Thermos Direct Drink) was eliminated. We’ve separated those mugs still working into “indestructibles” which look the same as they did after the first drop, and “juggernauts” which still do their jobs perfectly, but bear cracks or other deformation beyond scuffs or scrapes. The Forge, for example, shows obvious signs of fracture on one arm of the carabiner loop — it doesn’t flex or bend, though, and the seal mechanism functions as before.</p>

<p>Two of the mugs we tested kept heat inside so well, they actually made it difficult to test what we considered “normal” use because we had to dump extra cold half-and-half or ice cubes in so that we could drink from them without suffering burns. Make no mistake, this almost-magical feat is surely appreciated by those who want to drink a hot cup of home-brewed coffee eight hours after they pour it.</p>
<p>We’ve picked the The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a> (sometimes called Direct Drink) bottle as our favourite for that kind of use, since it was slightly easier for us to clean and it didn’t rattle around in our cupholders as much as the skinny Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 did. Bloomberg called this &#8220;the best mug for heat freaks” and we concur with that assessment: this mug stayed 15°F hotter than lesser mugs even when we were pouring the heat away in our 165-minute “sipping test.”</p>

<p>The Thermos performed flawlessly in our leak test, sealing its lid tight and locking with a back-up mechanism. It doesn’t seal itself every time you set it down, the way our top pick does, so you have to either close the top every time you sip or invite spills — but if you do knock it over with the lid open, it won’t spill as much as most of the other mugs we tested.</p>
<p>The Thermos &#8211; Sipp started developing a crack in the eight-foot fall. While that’s not nearly as durable as the CamelBak &#8211; Forge, the Thermos is much tougher than the other best-insulating mug, the Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 (which probably won’t close anymore if you drop it onto concrete). The Thermos is also entirely dishwasher-safe and easy to hand-wash, and has a handy loop on the back of the lid that makes it easy to carry around.</p>
<p>Note: This is one of the more confusingly-named products we researched — it’s sometimes called things like “Sipp Stainless Insulated Drink Bottle” and is nearly identical to the “Commuter Bottle.” Whatever the name, we liked it.</p>

Contigo is now one of the most prolific brands in the travel mug market, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160LEYFY/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Auto-Seal Transit</a> is the best model in their line.</p>
<p>Auto-sealing mugs like the transit are perfect for use at your desk, around fussy librarians or while driving. It&#8217;s basically impossible to spill anything from this mug while you&#8217;re drinking from it, and the spout prevents drips from gathering the way they will in flip-top designs.</p>
<p>Contigo mugs represent what really has become the baseline for travel mug functionality: To beat Contigo at their own game, a mug must be easy to drink from with one hand while still preventing spills, must be easier to clean, stay hot for longer, and take more abuse. The now-discontinued Camelbak &#8211; Forge was the only model that was better overall (still losing in heat retention), while the Thermos &#8211; Sipp has much better heat retention but doesn&#8217;t stop spills.</p>
<p>The Transit survived our ten-foot drop test with only a superficial crack in the easily-removed spout-cover. That cover is an interesting perk; a quick turn covers up the drinking spout to keep dirt out. It&#8217;s a nice perk that doesn&#8217;t get in the way when you don&#8217;t need it.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160LEYFY/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Safe Sipping: Contigo - Transit</h3><p>A great mug from a trusted brand that's highly durable and spill resistant. A great choice if you don't mind sacrificing heat performance and if you're OK with hand-washing.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160LEYFY/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Auto-Seal mechanism is unmatched at stopping knock-down spills, but the Transit gave up a teaspoon worth of liquid in our 30-minute tumble test. That&#8217;s a good result, but not as good as the bank-vault seal on the Thermos &#8211; Sipp. If you want to stash a mug in your bag this is not a bad pick, but we wouldn&#8217;t take it on an all-day trip with a full load of coffee inside a backpack.</p>
<p>In our temperature test, the Transit only lost 34°F of heat in the first hour, while the base-model Contigo &#8211; West Loop lost 40, so the minimal price difference is far less significant than the performance gap. That&#8217;s still a major difference from the Thermos and Zojirushi mugs, which lost less than half as much heat in the same time. The Transit&#8217;s result is in line with other good wide-mouth mugs that you can fit a sponge into, but it&#8217;s not amazing.</p>
<p>One failing of Contigo&#8217;s design is the seal mechanism: it&#8217;s a pain to clean. If you have a dishwasher or only drink clear tea, you&#8217;ll probably never have a problem with this, but you&#8217;ll still want to double-check that nothing gets stuck in the springs and levers inside this lid. The Transit&#8217;s lid is the only part you should put in the dishwasher, but the body isn&#8217;t difficult to hand wash.</p>
<p>On the whole, this is a great mug with a long heritage of good design. The price is right at about $15, and if you ever need to drink your coffee in a place where spills would be a disaster this is an excellent choice.</p>

<li>The Contigo &#8211; Auto-Seal Transit is easy to use for one-hand-sipping without leaving you vulnerable to spills.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re looking for an affordable mug that won&#8217;t break quickly, the Transit is very good on both counts.</li>
<li>Clean-up is the only weakness in this design: The springs that seal the spout are immersed in your drink, and can&#8217;t be removed for washing.</li>
<li>For secure carry in a bag the Transit was better than most, but it did leak a teaspoon worth after half an hour in a spin-cycle.</li>

<p>From a startup company founded by rocket scientists, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DJS1LHN/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Burnout termperature regulating travel mug</a> is one of the few new products that&#8217;s trying something different. We bought this mug for our 2019 update.</p>
<p>Burnout pulls the heat out of your drink in the first minute after you pour. This neat trick is accomplished with a layer of wax that&#8217;s inside the mug&#8217;s stainless steel walls. Once the wax melts, it&#8217;ll help keep all of that heat inside the vacuum-insulated chamber, even as you drink your favorite hot beverage away.</p>
<div id="visualizer-19338-1155102802" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-19338"></div>
<p>The problem with the heat-sucking material inside the Burnout is that it&#8217;s too good at its job.  If the mug starts at around room temperature, hot coffee (at just below an ideal brewing temperature of 190-200°F) will cool to 140 in fifteen minutes. If you like warm coffee instead of hot coffee, that&#8217;s probably ideal.</p>
<p>You can get a bump in heat if you take the time to boil some extra water and dump that in the Burnout for a few minutes before you add your beverage. (Pre-heating with 110°F tap water does basically nothing.)  Boiling extra water isn&#8217;t such an inconvenience for pour-over, french press and tea drinkers, but it&#8217;s a big hassle if you&#8217;re relying on a coffeemaker like <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-keurig/">our favorite Keurig</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, pre-heating with boiling water also cancels out the safety goal of this mug, since the temperature is still at a scalding 172 after thirty minutes and takes two hours to hit our preferred 155. Yes, you can pre-heat for a shorter time and add milk to fine-tune the temperature, but you can do the same with our top heat-retention pick, the Thermos &#8211; Sipp, by adding an ice cube when you pour your coffee.</p>
<p>Even if a hot-ish 135°F sound perfect to you, the biggest problem with the Burnout is the lid. This design uses an internal stopper that seals a sippy-cup spout (very much like the Contigo Autoseal designs) but with a sliding, locking toggle switch instead of a push-to-drink system. This means you don&#8217;t get automatic sealing when you stop drinking, but it&#8217;s still difficult to clean out all of the springs and levers on the inside. It can also spit out drips when you close it.</p>
<p>Worse still, even when the stopper is in the closed position, it leaks. It&#8217;ll keep dribbles from coming out if you turn it upside down, but as soon as you drop it on the floor or shake it around it&#8217;ll let drips out. The slider switch is fairly easy to use, but it&#8217;s also vulnerable to getting bumped open inside a bag; this mug did poorly in our tumble test.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s the price. If you&#8217;ve been waiting and waiting for a travel mug that would give four-hour warmth without burning your tongue, maybe $100 doesn&#8217;t sound like a lot. Compared to our other mugs, though, that&#8217;s a pretty crazy price.</p>
<p>We love the idea of this mug, but the concept just hasn&#8217;t been executed well enough to justify this price tag. If it were dishwasher safe and had a bomb-proof seal like the Thermos, maybe the price tag and fiddly work required to plan a perfect pre-heat routine would be worth it.</p>
<h3>Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 and YAE48</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5469 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles.jpg" alt="two Zojirushi travel mugs" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HYOGTTG/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48</a> has received so many accolades from reviewers, it’s hard to imagine a review that excludes it. This mug is the state of the art in vacuum insulation performance from a company with a long history of designing great food and drink containers. That said, the diminutive SA48 was so narrow and tall that it rattled around in our cupholders (and was hardest to clean inside, even with a bottle brush).</p>
<p>We also included the SA48’s sibling, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01077GFV8/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YAE48</a>, which is specifically marketed as a “Travel Mug” and seems designed to address concerns about cup holder size and the height restriction imposed by single-cup coffee machines. The wide mouth means that the YAE48 is easier to get a kitchen sponge into when cleaning, but it sacrifices insulation and leak-proof performance with that giant lid (which actually unscrewed from the body during our spin-cycle bag-leak test).</p>
<p>Neither mug is especially durable; the SA48’s lid shattered on a desk-height drop and the YAE48 wouldn’t stay closed after an eight-foot drop split it across the lock. The warranty on these mugs is also limited to insulation performance for five years, which is disappointing when the lids and locks have this many intricate parts.</p>
<h3>Contigo &#8211; Auto-Seal West Loop</h3>
<p>This is the third version of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZI5XNO/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Auto-Seal West Loop</a> design, now easier to clean than old models, and with a lock button. Sadly, the lock doesn&#8217;t prevent leaks and it&#8217;s still immersing springs in your drink.</p>
<p>The West Loop is a good mug, but the Transit is more durable and holds heat better. The only trade-off is that the Transit sacrifices dishwasher compatibility because of the silicone grip. The West Loop&#8217;s insulation is guaranteed to be safe in the dishwasher, but if you buy a painted model you can count on flaking and peeling of the finish after a few months cleaning it that way.</p>
<h3>Klean Kanteen &#8211; 16 oz. Wide-Mouth</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5470 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo.jpg" alt="Klean Kanteen mug on a white counter" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We included the winner from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/">insulated water bottle review</a>, the Klean Kanteen, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H4LUMUA/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">but in a 16 oz. size</a> to match the other mugs and with the manufacturer’s leak-proof “café cap.” (We did not include the Hydro Flask in our line-up; in our water-bottle test the 32 oz Hydro Flask didn’t insulate as well as a 20 oz Klean Kanteen, and while the flip-cap lid on the Hydro Flask is easier to use with one hand, it has all of the problems of the other drip-flip lids we tested).</p>
<p>The Klean Kanteen is still a drink container we like, but it’s not easy to open and close with one hand (and in fact took a fair bit of effort to open with two hands), and it has more parts to disassemble for cleaning than any of the other mugs.</p>
<h3>Thermos &#8211; Stainless King Travel Mug</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5471 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug.jpg" alt="solo of Thermos King stainless mug" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Thermos is the oldest and best-known name in insulated drink containers in the western world (“thermos” became such a prevalent word that US courts ruled it was legal to use as a generic term for insulated bottles in 1963). We tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DZQT0E2/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Stainless King Travel Mug</a> along with our runner-up, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a>.</p>
<p>The King is available with a handle, which may appeal to those who keep a mug in the cold and pick it up with bare hands, but we found that a trigger-action mug like our top pick was even better since we could carry it and take drinks from it even with gloves on. The twist-action closure on the Stainless King wasn’t really designed to open and close with one hand, and requires disassembly if you want to put it in the dishwasher.</p>
<h3>Stanley &#8211; Classic</h3>
<p>We’ve included this self-sealing mug, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VG761C/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stanley &#8211; Classic</a>, which only comes in their retro-lunchbox-style “hammertone” finish, as the only painted mug guaranteed dishwasher safe; the paint does seem thick and durable, and we haven&#8217;t seen reports of it chipping or peeling the way the Contigo paint does. The functionality is generally good, but it wasn’t even as leak-proof as the Contigo mugs were. The spring on the trigger-button of this mug was also much, much stronger than the other self-sealing designs, which was a big turn-off for some testers (and didn’t keep it from leaking at all). The design also had more parts to keep track of than the other self-sealing mechanisms.</p>
<h3>Bubba &#8211; Hero Elite</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0186EP0JW/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bubba</a> was included because it has the highest price to consumer rating ratio of any of the mugs we found, and the ceramic liner is a unique feature. While on the whole this mug seems a decent value, that liner didn’t prove to be an asset in any way we could find, and the way the lid collects drips and spreads them around is just annoying. The fact that the plastic ring which attaches the lid to the body just popped off in our eight-foot drop test makes us wonder how long it would take for grime and water to start collecting at that joint (even in normal use).</p>
<h3>Timolino &#8211; Icon</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0038XKF60/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Timolino &#8211; Icon</a> won top marks from <em>Cook’s Illustrated</em>, and it performed well in our cleaning and drop tests, but the drip-flip lid is a serious annoyance that was also noted by Amazon reviewers. While it didn’t break, this mug did leak around the seal every time we looked at it funny, so we wouldn’t put it anywhere near a computer bag.</p>
<h3>OXO Good Grips- SSDWTM</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-01/the-best-spill-proof-travel-mug-for-every-professional" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a> found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XF97OTI/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this OXO mug</a> quite difficult to destroy. Dropping it three times from ceiling height before giving up. We like its durability, but the push-button lid is the only one we tested that isn’t dishwasher safe, and it traps a good quantity of fluid in the spout even after it’s closed, which makes it messy to drink from.</p>
<h3>The discontinued champion: CamelBak &#8211; Forge</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5467 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge.jpg" alt="the CamelBak - Forge on a table" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><strong>Ed: the Camelbak &#8211; Forge was discontinued in 2018, and we&#8217;re sad to say that it hasn&#8217;t been replaced with an equivalent design. Our original review is preserved here for posterity.</strong><br />
The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EPGMZZS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CamelBak &#8211; Forge</a> is as smart as it is tough. The mechanism for opening and sealing the spout whenever you pull the “trigger” is simple and effective, and the Forge practically turns itself inside out for you when you need to clean it. (Even replacing the o-ring for the seal would be trivial.)</p>
<p>The Forge keeps your drink hot for a very long time; not as long as some of the mugs we tested, but well within the expected performance of a vacuum-insulated travel mug with a wide-mouth opening. Mugs with narrower openings (like our runner-up pick below) will keep the heat for longer, but that makes them harder to clean and fill.</p>
<p>In our leak test, the Forge did leave evidence that it had let out a single drop when we checked at 10 minutes into the half-hour spin-cycle test; no further leaks were found at the end of the test, and the amount lost didn’t register on our electronic kitchen scale.</p>
<p>The Forge doesn’t have a way to lock out its trigger the way Contigo’s latest designs do, but CamelBak has shaped a loop at the back of the lid that totally protects the trigger from basically anything other than your finger. It’s possible that some object of the right shape could press on it in just the right circumstances, but on the spin-cycle leak test the Forge was far more effective than the other self-sealing mugs (even the ones with locks).</p>
<p>What’s more, the loop is a convenient way to clip the Forge onto a backpack, bike bag, or just to hook a finger through, and it also prevents it from rolling if it’s knocked over. (That means it won’t just stop you from spilling coffee: it’ll also save you from that embarrassing conversation where you have to ask your coworkers if they’ve seen a mug rolling around on the floor.)</p>

<p>CamelBak has catered to the outdoor enthusiast crowd for decades, and has a great reputation for warranty work and customer service. They guarantee this mug for life against defects in the workmanship or materials, which doesn’t strictly cover things like worn rubber o-rings or driving over it with a cement truck, but when we looked for comments on repair services we found that CamelBak is often very generous.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line" class="collapse">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Caffeine keeps us alert, awake, and energized. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160LEYFY/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo &#8211; Transit</a> ensures that it will also go into your mouth, not onto your lap or computer. The easy-to-sip-from self-sealing design make it a clear winner for most uses, though it doesn&#8217;t have the best heat retention.</p>
<p>If you like your drinks at tongue-scalding temperatures, consider the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a>, which keeps boiling water too hot to drink for an hour, even with the lid off. The Thermos is also easier to clean than most mugs. It will spill if you knock it over with the lid flipped up, but when it’s locked you can rest assured it won’t come open in your bag.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We tested 22 different bottles over several weeks in order to determine the best pick in each frequently-used category.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent several weeks subjecting 22 water bottles to rigorous testing that included washing, carrying, performing leak and stress tests — and, of course, drinking. Of our five categories, we found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004PXWG4G/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klean Kanteen &#8211; 20-Ounce Insulated</a> is the best water bottle due to its wide mouth, performance, versatility and sleek design.</p>

<p>With all the different types of water bottles — plastic, metal, glass, insulated or not — it can be confusing to pick the best one for your needs. In addition to our top pick, we’ve identified four runner-up options to give you plenty of choices to pick from, including a collapsible version.</p>
<p>Each bottle material has its own strengths, and knowing the advantages of each will help you find a bottle you&#8217;ll be happiest with. The only type of bottle to keep drinks hot <em>or</em> cold are vacuum insulated bottles. Every other type does not, and these other ones all form condensation on the outside when you put cold water inside. Check out the breakdown below for more differences:</p>
<p><a href="#best-insulated-water-bottle">Vacuum insulated bottles</a> are the best way to keep your water super cold for an entire day, or to keep beverages hot for an impressive five hours. These insulated bottles have two inner chambers, one for the water and then one surrounding that with a vacuum channel. This proves to be a very effective method for insulation, but these weigh more because of it.</p>
<p><a href="#best-glass-water-bottle">Glass water bottles</a> eliminate plastic or metal tastes and chemicals / BPAs. Being able to see how much liquid is left without having to pick up or open the bottle is a nice perk. All were covered in a silicone sleeve for drop protection (no bottles cracked or shattered in our drop tests) but glass and silicone will not insulate your water. Condensation formed on all glass and silicone surfaces even though the silicone sleeves helped improve grip.</p>
<p><a href="#best-stainless-steel-water-bottle">Stainless steel bottles</a> are an effective, low-cost option. They’re non-reactive, BPA free, and lightweight compared to glass or their insulated stainless steel counterparts. You can&#8217;t put hot water in these as directed by the manufacturers (and you&#8217;ll burn your hands). But if you just need something for short amounts of time and don’t care about insulation, it’s tough to beat the value. Some folks prefer glass to avoid the metal smell or taste, but we found no issue with tastes on these bottles at all. We also tested one aluminum bottle, which is a bit lighter but otherwise similar.</p>
<p><a href="#best-plastic-bottle">Plastic water bottles</a> are geared towards sports and workouts. Even if you&#8217;re not using it for those purposes you can still benefit from their sporty design features. Three of the bottles we tested had a flip-top lid that lets you drink using one hand, which we loved. They&#8217;re also lightweight compared to glass and insulated bottles. Every bottle we tested was made of Tritan, a material claiming to be free of BPAs, estrogenic and androgenic activity. We still found these bottles to have the strongest smell though.</p>
<p><a href="#best-collapsible-water-bottle">Collapsible water bottles</a> are perfect if you&#8217;re traveling or hiking and space is very limited. They are incredibly thin and the lightest weight option by a large margin &#8212; collapsible bottles we tested weighed eight times less than insulated bottles, and four times less than our tested plastic bottles. These do have a smell but mostly go away after a few washes.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-chose">How we chose the best bottles to test</h2>
<p>There are a lot of water bottle options out there, so we started by narrowing our list of finalists by only selecting those that fit specific criteria. There are many materials and styles these bottles are made in, so we tested five of the most popular types.</p>
<p>We searched Amazon, Reddit, forums and other water bottle reviews to find the highest quality and most popular brands of water bottles.</p>
<p>A review on Outside Online cited a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GOF6TAU/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SIGG bottle</a> that outperformed anything we’ve heard of in terms of thermoregulation, so we had to add that to the test list as well.</p>
<p>Every bottle we chose fit these criteria:</p>
<p><strong>Water capacity:</strong> It held enough water to quench thirst, but it wasn&#8217;t too big that it would be cumbersome to lug around. Many brands have larger bottles at 32 and even 64 oz capacities.</p>
<p><strong>They&#8217;re well-reviewed:</strong> Other reviews that praised bottles, and bottles on Amazon&#8217;s best-sellers list were slightly favored.</p>
<p><strong>Fewer issues with quality:</strong> Any bottles that have a higher than average history of complaints on build quality, leaking or other functional qualities were omitted.</p>
<p><strong>They&#8217;re not too specialized:</strong> We avoided bottles that were designed for very specific tasks, such as cycling.</p>
<p><strong>They&#8217;re not knockoffs:</strong> Whether it&#8217;s a knockoff or rebrand, many of these are actually the same exact bottle so we didn&#8217;t test duplicates. See more detail below.</p>
<h3>Knock-off and rebranded water bottles</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2991" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles.jpg" alt="two different rebranded bottles side by side" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>If you shop for water bottles online or in many retail stores, you&#8217;ll notice many brands with products that look identical. For example, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MIRA-Insulated-Double-Vacuum-Stainless/dp/B00XK4BCZ0/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mira</a> bottle we tested seems to have the same design as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Modern-Vacuum-Insulated-Bottle/dp/B01GKGEZUI/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Simple Modern</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ICONIQ-Stainless-Vacuum-Insulated-Bottle/dp/B01BFX24XG/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ICONIQ</a>, and the popular <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Swell-Womens-Teakwood-Water-Bottle/dp/B00M00OPZ4/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">S&#8217;well</a> to name a few.</p>
<p>The popular Hydro Flask looks to have the same design as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vacuum-Insulated-Mouth-Stainless-Bottle/dp/B0181FY83K/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">321 Strong</a>, Glacier Point, and Fifty Fifty.</p>
<p>Some Redditors explained the source of the many knock-offs of popular water bottle brands out there: most knock offs are just rebrands that come out of the same factory as the originals. So we assumed their performance to be the same and avoided testing any rebranded products.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more that goes into a great water bottle than meets the eye! We put our 22 finalists through an extensive series of tests to see which would come out on top. Those tests included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thermal insulation test</li>
<li>Hot water test</li>
<li>Leak and drop test</li>
<li>Condensation test</li>
<li>Usability test</li>
</ul>
<h3>Thermal insulation test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2835" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures.jpg" alt="testing water bottle temperatures with thermometer" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Since drinking room-temperature water isn&#8217;t something most people prefer, we tested every bottle for its ability to keep water cold. For the bottles that were designed for it, we tested their ability to keep water hot too.</p>
<p>We tested temperatures with an <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-digital-meat-thermometer/">instant-read thermometer</a> so the bottles only needed to be opened for a short amount of time during temperature testing.</p>
<p>Just for good measure, we tested the vacuum insulated bottles as well as the uninsulated bottles with cold water: glass bottles, plastic bottles, collapsible plastic bottles and stainless steel bottles. Starting with cold, 42°F water, we let the bottles duke it out in a temperature controlled room  and measured the temperatures along the way.</p>
<p>The cold water in uninsulated bottles rose a whopping 20°F in the first hour and coasted to room temperature after just five hours.</p>
<p>Insulated bottles, on the other hand, fared much better. It took about 20 hours for all of the bottles to reach near room temperature, which is very impressive! This means you can be sipping on ice-cold water throughout the course of a normal 8 or 10-hour day using an insulated bottle.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2976 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900.png" alt="water bottle cold water test chart" width="900" height="584" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900.png 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-610x396.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-885x574.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-360x234.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-375x243.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-414x269.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-295x191.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-180x117.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-320x208.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
It&#8217;s clear from the poor rank of the 10-ounce Sigg in this test that a big factor in keeping your drink cold is how much water is inside. With cold water (or ice), the more you can keep inside, the better it will stay cold.</p>
<h3>Hot water test</h3>
<p>Four of our five vacuum insulated bottles were suitable for use with hot water. We tested the Klean Kanteen, SIGG, Hydro Flask, and the Mira bottles. We added boiling water to each bottle, and adjusted water levels until each reached 196°F, then checked on them in even intervals.</p>
<p>We removed the lids and tested temperatures with the same instant-read digital thermometer we used on the cold water test. Hot water returned to room temperature much faster than the cold water did, but these bottles performed according to manufacturer promises.</p>

<h3>2018 Updates: 32oz bottle test</h3>
<div id="visualizer-18685-1391700654" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-18685"></div>
In 2018 we tested our new contenders in another heat retention test. This time, we picked a standard size (32 ounces) and tested with an uninsulated stainless steel bottle as a control. Water started at a rolling boil, but by the time we pre-filled and blended the water between the bottles to get a fair comparison the average temperature was 184.</p>
<p>In this test, it was once again the narrowest-neck bottle that took top position. Unlike the narrow mouth on the Mira bottle from our first lineup, Klean Kanteen&#8217;s Classic 1.7-inch opening is wide enough to fit full-size ice cubes, but it still gives an edge in insulation performance. 160 degrees after 12 hours is toasty, even on the edge of piping hot.</p>
<p>The other standout in this test is YETI, with the heavy (and expensive) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072BVN7JB/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rambler Bottle.</a> If you want top insulation with a wide-open mouth, YETI was only four degrees lower than the Klean Kanteen after a full twelve hours, compared to more than 20 degrees difference in the other wide-mouth bottles.</p>
<h3>Leak and drop test</h3>
<p>A bottle that leaks is not much more useful than a lidless cup, so we tested each bottle for leak potential. Thankfully, none of the bottles leaked with normal use and vigorous shaking or twisting, so we decided to do some drop tests to see how they stand up to some abuse.</p>
<p>We filled each bottle to 75% capacity, then dropped it from standing position three feet from the ground on its bottom, then once again on its top, and finally we pushed it off a table about three feet tall.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, all bottles remained leakproof after being dropped. All stainless steel bottles dented to some degree, and the uninsulated steel variety dented the worst, causing them to wobble when placed on a flat surface.</p>
<p>We expected the sport bottles with seemingly fragile flip caps &#8212; like the Embrava, Under Armour and the Thermos &#8212; to break or at least leak after they were dropped, but they did not. During one drop, the Embrava&#8217;s lid actually shifted off the cap threads a bit and took some force to unscrew &#8212; yet it still remained leakproof after being put back on.</p>
<p>While dropping the glass bottles, we were bracing ourselves for shattered glass everywhere with each drop, yet no bottles ever shattered. The silicone sleeves did a good job of absorbing the drop impact.</p>
<h3>Condensation test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2836" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles.jpg" alt="condensation buildup on bottles" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Condensation forms on the outside of cold water bottles because cooler air around the bottles can&#8217;t hold as much moisture as warmer air, causing the moisture to condense. This matters because it will affect grip on the bottle, as well as potential to damage electronics you&#8217;re storing in the same bag as your water bottle if enough moisture is formed.</p>
<p>Every uninsulated bottle had condensation form on the outside of the bottle when there was cold water inside. Even the glass bottles with silicone covers had condensation form on top of the covers.</p>
<p>The amount of moisture was consistent between the bottles, but varied by day, depending on the humidity. If you plan to transport bottles with laptops or other electronics, the safest option is to use a vacuum insulated bottle or room temperature water.</p>
<h3>Usability test</h3>

<p>Each bottle went through usability testing, to see how it stood up to regular use.</p>
<p><strong>Ice:</strong> We wanted to know if it was possible to add ice and how easy it was to add water. We used standard ice cubes from a freezer&#8217;s automatic ice machine. About five of the bottles we tested didn&#8217;t have mouths wide enough for ice or for cleaning with brush. Some could only fit one at a time, while many wider mouth bottles could be filled with multiple cubes at once.</p>
<p><strong>Loops and grip:</strong> We took bottles out on trips over the course of a few weeks to test how easy each was to carry. Loops in the lid made it much easier to hold a bottle at the same time as groceries, bags or keys, whereas bottles without any loops forced you to dedicate a hand to it. Loops and clips make it easy to hang bottles from a backpack too.</p>
<p><strong>Cupholders:</strong> Larger bottles and most collapsible bottles we tested were not made to fit in cupholders. Most fit fine, but some barely made the cut. We tested the bottles in our cars for fit.</p>
<p><strong>Cleaning:</strong> Before the first use and after multiple refills, we washed each bottle by hand with a bottle brushing, hot water and dish soap. This proved fairly easy for most bottles, but a few caused problems with a spout that was too small, or just because the bottle was too long.</p>
<h2 id="best-insulated-water-bottle">Best insulated: Klean Kanteen</h2>

<p>After testing a variety of sizes over the last three years, the best insulated bottle is from Klean Kanteen, either the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Klean-Kanteen-Insulated-Stainless-20-Ounce/dp/B004PXWG4G/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">20-ounce wide mouth</a> if you need a compact bottle or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SA2XNWW/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">32 ounce classic</a> if you want to keep beverages cold or hot all day long.</p>
<h3>A smaller insulated bottle</h3>
<p>The wide mouth of the 20-ounce made it easy to fill with ice and to drink out of, and its slim design made it easy to fit in cupholders and bottle compartments in most backpacks. The wider mouth is a slight compromise in insulation, but for a smaller bottle you might not notice the difference since you&#8217;ll be refilling long before your ice is gone.</p>

This rugged Kleen Kanteen also held up well when we subjected it to our drop test.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0093ISEPI/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>The big loop lid makes it easy to carry with a few fingers or loop onto bags with a carabiner. If you don&#8217;t care for this feature, wide mouth Klean Kanteen bottles can also take the totally leakproof <a href="http://www.kleankanteen.com/products/cafe-cap?variant=19736711878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cafe Cap 2.0</a> twist-open lid. We tested this design in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/#how-we-tested" rel="noopener">travel mug review</a>. We liked it better than cheap flip-up lids, though it&#8217;s not as good as other mugs for one-hand sipping and has a lot of parts to clean.</p>
<p>This bottle fared well in our drop tests with minimal damage to both the bottom and the lid. In the insulation tests it ranked 2nd for cold water, and 3rd for hot water. One downside of any steel bottle is that the mouth gets hot to the touch after letting it bake in the car on a hot day.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SA2XNWW?th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klean Kanteen-Classic 32-ounce</a> is a great water bottle for storing and sipping ice-cold water without as many refills. The opening is about half an inch narrower than the wide mouth on Klean Kanteen&#8217;s mug-size bottles, which means it&#8217;s a little more tricky to pack with ice, but still much easier than the wine-bottle shaped MIRA and S&#8217;WELL bottles.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re filling with ice water or some other beverage, this insulation will keep it cold (or hot) for longer than any wide-mouth bottle. Klean Kanteen also sells this same bottle design with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Klean-Kanteen-Insulated-Stainless-Growler/dp/B00X6ZNOAO" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">with a clamp-down growler lid</a> for filling up at your favorite micro-brewery. (The Growler model also works with the standard lid.)</p>

<h3>Hydro Flask vs. Klean Kanteen</h3>
<p>The 32 oz. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K5ZRUZ8/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hydro Flask</a> is a strong runner-up. Hydro Flask ranked 3rd in our cold water test and 4th in the original hot water test, but they&#8217;re a very close competitor for our top pick. The loop on the cap makes it easy to pick up with one finger if your hands are full carrying other things and the grip on the cap makes it easy to open and close the lid.</p>
<p>We interviewed loyalists for each brand, and they all have glowing accounts of how great the bottles are. They also rave about how easy it was to get a replacement cap or sometimes even a free replacement bottle after a dramatic accident.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between Klean Kanteen and Hydro Flask is in the availability of different neck shapes. Hydro Flask uses wide-mouth openings for sizes from 18 to 64 ounces, with the narrower &#8220;standard&#8221; mouth is only available in 18, 21 and 14 ounce bottles. Klean Kanteen has almost the opposite selection, with their &#8220;classic&#8221; narrow-mouth design available in sizes from 12 up to 64 ounces, with wide-mouth options in 12, 16 and 20 ounces.</p>
<p>Since the narrower mouth is better at insulating while still making ice fairly easy to add, and the 32 ounce Klean Kanteen is more affordable, we think Klean Kanteen has the edge overall. If you&#8217;re carrying a bottle packed with ice for sipping cold water on a hot day, the temperature difference is going to be less important and you should feel free to buy whichever bottle has the cap and styling you prefer.</p>
<p>Both of these brands also makes a spectrum of durable powder-coat colors that should satisfy anyone, but the availability of your favorite color might change from month to month. If you can&#8217;t find the color you like in stock, it&#8217;s probably worth checking the other brand.</p>

The 25 oz. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H9F72H1/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mira bottle</a> performed best in the cold water test. It likely gets a bump in performance due to its relatively small cap design &#8212; the main area where there isn&#8217;t vacuum insulation and where external temps would seep in.</p>
<p>The smaller opening of this bottle also comes with a downside though &#8212; it&#8217;s slightly awkward to drink out of since it&#8217;s sized perfectly to hit your nose with each sip. In the hot water test, it was not a surprise that the Mira ranked second. The 25 oz. bottle we tested was a bit on the larger side for cupholders, so if you opt for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0764P6DR2/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mira&#8217;s 17 oz. bottle</a> it would be a nicer fit.</p>

We also liked its latch mechanism, but unfortunately it's intended only for cold beverages (not hot liquids).</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E6O7CAC/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>As another great option geared for sports, we liked the 24 oz. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E6O7CAC/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Under Armour bottle</a>. It ranked fourth in our cold water test, but is by no means a poor performer given its other perks. This bottle features a spring-loaded flip cap and silicone grip makes it easy for one-handed operation while running or driving. It even has a latch to ensure the bottle stays locked during transport in your backpack or gym bag. One downside is the manufacturer says this bottle can&#8217;t be used with hot water, likely because of the plastic components in the lid.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GOF6TAU/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SIGG Thermo</a> performed best of the small bottles in our first hot water test, sadly, it&#8217;s becoming difficult to track down. Specifically designed for tea drinkers, the SIGG has a built in metal filter, if you won&#8217;t ever use that feature you can remove it for hot water or coffee. You have to separate the lid by unscrewing it which is not as simple as it should be, but it is an option. We looked at the larger versions in Sigg&#8217;s Classic series, but most owners agree they&#8217;re better as a thermos (using the cup that slides over the base of the bottle) than as a bottle to drink from.</p>

<p>Our top pick for glass bottles was the Takeya Classic 22 ounce. We loved the large cap threads around the top of the bottle, which makes it easy to open and close the cap without missing the threads.</p>
<p>This bold and simple design of the cap helps prevent it from damage when dropped too. In our drop tests there was minimal cap damage, and the silicone sleeve surprisingly prevented the bottle from shattering. The sleeve design on this bottle makes it easy to see the remaining water levels too.</p>

<p>Just like the other glass bottles we tested, there&#8217;s no insulation, but there&#8217;s also no lead or chemicals and it&#8217;s completely dishwasher safe. However, this bottle&#8217;s perfectly sized for easy holding and drinking, and the silicone grip makes it even more secure if you&#8217;re using it for sports.</p>

The silicone sleeve isn't just for looks — it also helped the Ello survive our impact tests.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BUUW476/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>We ranked the 20 oz. Ello bottle in a close second place, largely due to its simplicity. It gets the job done without features that are prone to issues. Like the Takeya, it has large threads in the cap for easy opening and closing of the lid. Its large loop on the cap lets you carry the bottle with multiple fingers, distributing the weight for comfortable carrying for longer periods of time.</p>
<p>This cap design also helped spread the impact nicely in our drop test that left no noticeable damage on the bottle. Like the other glass options, we have lots of options in silicone sleeve design and color too.</p>
<p>The little drinking spout on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B9DJWTM/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Life Factory</a> bottle might be convenient to some, but there was no other hole to let air in as you drink from it, so you basically have to waterfall from the little spout to take a sip. Although this bottle didn&#8217;t leak in our tests, the mini spout cap is very prone to popping off so you don&#8217;t want to throw this into a bag that you can&#8217;t keep an eye on.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007L6953Y/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CamelBak&#8217;</a> storable straw doesn&#8217;t have issues with potential leaks because it is easily folded back when not in use. The uncentered design of the cap loop can affect the outcome of a drop depending on how it happens to be dropped, but in our testing it fared well. The CamelBak is a well-designed bottle overall that&#8217;s easy to use, but the straw makes it pretty difficult to ensure a proper cleaning, putting it further down on our list.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard for the short <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PV9Y72W/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bKr bottle</a> to go unnoticed &#8212; it looks very well designed! This one&#8217;s basically famous for being used by celebrities and being covered in magazines. When we bought it, the price was $35; this is an astounding 2-3x the cost of the other glass options. The slanted cap made screwing the cap on particularly difficult, and the small spout makes it impossible to fit any ice or a bottle brush. The bKr bottle is definitely a design-centric purchase if you&#8217;re willing to put up with its issues and price tag.</p>
<h2 id="best-stainless-steel-water-bottle">Best Stainless Steel: Klean Kanteen &#8211; Classic</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3081 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen.jpg" alt="best stainless steel bottle" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The Klean Kanteen was an easy #1 pick out of the three finalists. The mouth was much bigger, easier to fill with ice and water and more pleasant to drink from. It also had a cap with bigger threads to more easily open and close the bottle.</p>
<p>Its lid was the best of the steel bottles we tested, but a bit squeaky sounding and not as smooth in opening and closing as the insulated or glass bottles. For those who want options, this brand has many cap options you can buy separately, like a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0083F0TQ4/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">sport cap</a> or a sippy cap.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079911D89/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Stainless Steel: Kleen Kanteen - Classic</h3><p>Large cap threads, a mid-size and a polished design make the Kleen Kanteen - Classic a pleasure to drink from. This bottle also uses high-quality materials that make it seem more polished than our other contenders.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079911D89/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>You also can&#8217;t really appreciate the importance of the bottle&#8217;s mouth size until you&#8217;re trying to aim it under your fridge&#8217;s water dispenser. Klean Kanteen sells a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F3JJDBA/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">version of this bottle with a mouth that&#8217;s even wider</a>, but the classic is noticeably wider than the other two bottles we tested. It&#8217;s easy to sip from, but still easy for adding ice, too. All three stainless steel bottles are very basic products and similar in concept, but the Klean Kanteen is built with better materials and feels like a more polished product, making it our clear winner in this category.</p>
<h3>The other metal bottles we tested</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3119" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles.jpg" alt="two other stainless steel bottles we tested" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The bottom of all of these bottles were dented in our drop test, which caused a few to wobble on the table. However, all remained leakproof afterwards. None of these were made to insulate liquids, and all had condensation running down the outside. These are a good cheap route to go if you just need to keep water cold for shorts amount of time.</p>
<p>The aluminum <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006PTIVTW/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SIGG</a> bottle is lightweight, but it has a tiny cap and threads. This made for a slightly clumsy opening and closing, and was the only bottle in this category that couldn&#8217;t fit ice in the mouth unless it was crushed. The aluminum dented slightly on the bottom in our drop test but still sat perfectly flat on a table. Even though it can&#8217;t fit ice, this bottle felt a little more polished than the Cheeki bottle.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BYGAAUE/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cheeki</a> was the largest stainless steel bottle we tested, perhaps contributing to the amount it was dented in our drop test. This bottle was noticeably uneven and even wobbled on the table after this test. Its mouth was large enough to fit ice cubes in, but the usage of the flip top lid is a bit awkward because of its small size and poor design. In terms of quality of materials, this bottle was easily the worst when you examine the cap material, design, and loop material.</p>
<h2 id="best-plastic-bottle">Best plastic: Thermos &#8211; Intak</h2>

<p>We loved the Thermos &#8211; Intak, ranking it our top plastic water bottle. The flip top lid and single-handed use were pretty big factors that helped set this model apart. It&#8217;s tough to beat that convenience.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This bottle&#8217;s the only one that has a textured design built into the bottle to help improve grip &#8212; great for when you&#8217;re using this for sports since this bottle builds up condensation with cold water inside. </span></p>

<p>Although all of the plastic bottles we used had markings to measure liquids on the side, the Thermos has a unique ring built into the cap ranging from 1-5 so you can track how many times you&#8217;ve refilled or used the bottle throughout the day.</p>

<p>We loved the look of the plastic CamelBak bottle and it proved to be very durable and leakproof. The spout has a cap that locks into the lid, which is a bit difficult to snap in each time, but it works to keep it out of the way. This bottle features a loop that keeps the lid attached to the bottle when you remove the lid for refilling too, something not present on the Embrava or Contigo or Thermos.</p>
<p>Although the the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B011LC85PM/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Embrava</a> and the Contigo also had single-handed operation, the Embrava was slightly on the small side, with six ounces less capacity than the top ranking Thermos. Embrava&#8217;s next size up is a whopping 32 ounce bottle, which is a bit on the large side. However, we appreciated the spout&#8217;s added air vent in the cap for easier drinking. The flip cap was surprisingly strong in our drop test too. If you prefer a slightly smaller bottle than the Thermos and can get past Embrava&#8217;s design aesthetics, this was a close runner up.</p>
<p>Both the CamelBak and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NCDE8Y/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Nalgene</a> had large threads for an easy opening lid and a wide mouth for cleaning and adding ice. However, the Nalgene had pretty bad plastic smell, even after a few washes. It looks like many other owners of this bottle had this issue too, although many reported no smells. Perhaps they vary by bottle or manufacturing batch, but this factor, combined with a very cheap looking lid, pushed this bottle further down our list.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A74ZU18/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo Autoseal</a> has a unique button you hold on the back to open the drinking spout. This bottle was leakproof when the button isn&#8217;t held, but it&#8217;s far too easy for that button to be pressed when thrown into a bag. Having to put your mouth on the bottle proved to be a little weird, and almost like a toddler&#8217;s sippy cup, but it has an air valve so you can drink without having to waterfall.</p>
<p>These bottles are not for hot beverages. If you&#8217;re looking for a hot beverage bottle take a look at our vacuum insulated stainless steel pick above. All five bottles we tested were made of the copolyester, Tritan, which is a trademark of Eastman Chemical Company. This material is popular because it&#8217;s impact resistant, free of BPAs, as well as estrogenic and androgenic activity. However,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> every bottle we tested, including the collapsible plastic bottles, were made from BPA-free plastic.</span></p>

<p>Our top pick was the Vapur &#8211; Element bottle. This bottle has a flip-top cap for easy access, but it also closes securely with an audible click and will not pop off accidentally in your bag. The Vapur and the Tap were the only two we tested with mouths wide enough for ice cubes and for a brush to fit inside for thorough cleaning.</p>

It's durable and made with quality materials. We also like its vibrant color options.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007UU6JI0/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>This was a 0.7L model, and you can get the most of that capacity by first blowing up the bag to expand it before adding water. Materials and construction on this bottle are excellent and should last for many years of use. In addition, it&#8217;s light weight and easily folded, which makes it great for taking on runs, hikes, or stowing away into luggage or carryons when traveling.</p>
<h3>The other collapsible water bottles we tested</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3121" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles.jpg" alt="three other collapsible bottles we tested" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Our second pick for collapsible bottles was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B575B96/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Tap</a>, which was sold in a pack of two. Like the Vapur, it has high quality construction and has a wide mouth for ice cubes and for cleaning with a bottle brush. Cleaning is much harder without a wide mouth since it wouldn&#8217;t clean well in a dishwasher. This bottle has a carabiner for convenience, but is only pushed to second place because lack of a convenient spout when compared to the Vapur.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012H5QDYW/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aquabod</a> is a unique bottle since you can roll it up, secure it, then stash in your gym bag or backpack until you&#8217;re ready to use it. It&#8217;s also the only collapsible one we tested made of silicone. The bottle has a neat spout designed to limit how much water comes out, but both the cap and the carabiner felt cheap compared to the others.</p>
<p>Although all these bottles have some flop to them when you drink, the Aquabod was extra floppy since there&#8217;s less structure to it, forcing you to use two hands to drink most of the time. The flop also makes it difficult (but not impossible) to put this bottle into a backpack&#8217;s bottle pocket, making clipping with the carabiner the way to go.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t need a carabiner, you might appreciate the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0076ZSR3Y/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Platypu</a>&#8216; more utilitarian design, and slim center for easier handling. Its mouth was too small for ice or a cleaning brush, so you might have to boil it or do lots of manual shaking to get it clean. The only reason to go with a Platypus is to utilize the push-pull cap option they have. For us, we would rather just go with the Tap bottle with a carabiner and wider mouth.</p>
<p>All bottles had a slight smell &#8212; plastic or otherwise, before the first wash. You might have to wash it a few times or soak it in vinegar and water to get rid of most of the smell and taste. If you&#8217;re very sensitive to smells, you may want to consider another bottle material altogether.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">The bottom line</h2>
<p>What better way to stay hydrated throughout the day and your workouts than by bringing along a bottle? There are so many <em>types</em> of water bottles and seemingly endless varieties within those that it helps to narrow down your search first.</p>
<p>We found it best to start your search by thinking about what you&#8217;ll be using the bottle for most.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ll be stowing a bottle in a bag which may contain electronics or other moisture-sensitive items you want to keep away from condensation, a vacuum insulated bottle is the best option for you. Specifically our top pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004PXWG4G/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klean Kanteen</a>. This is the only type of bottle suitable for hot beverages. This bottle is also our overall top pick too, because of its wide mouth design and easy usability and maintenance. This brand also has some well-loved lid options to fit your needs like the new <a href="http://www.kleankanteen.com/collections/accessories/products/cafe-cap?variant=19736711878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cafe Cap 2.0</a>, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0093IKZGY/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Flip D-Ring</a> lid.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re on the move or prefer something lighter, something made of plastic might be the best fit for you. For extreme portability at the cost of some utility, our top pick for collapsible bottles was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007UU6JI0/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vapur Element</a>. If you&#8217;re just hitting the gym or just want something lightweight and convenient to use at your desk, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002VJX4C4/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos Intak</a>.</p>
<p>Although all the plastic bottles we tested were BPA-free, some still had an odd smell. If you&#8217;re particularly sensitive to that kind of thing and don&#8217;t care about insulation, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EAIW5MY/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klean Kanteen &#8211; Classic stainless steel bottle</a> is a good option for you, thanks to its wider-than-normal mouth and easy-to-use loop cap.</p>
<p>And if you don&#8217;t mind a little weight and like the clear look and vibrant designs that come with glass bottles, then we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003DTLNY2/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Takeya Classic</a>. Glass is totally safe for the dishwasher, and is void of any smells or concerns about chemicals and tastes we have with the other bottles. Even if you&#8217;re a bit of a klutz, our tests showed these all are capable of surviving a few drops.</p>
