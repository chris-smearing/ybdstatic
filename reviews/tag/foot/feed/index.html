<p>We began our research by exploring recommendations by medical experts, including podiatrists and physical therapists. First, we learned that the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) recognizes products, including insoles, that are found to be beneficial to foot health with a <a href="https://www.apma.org/Patients/content.cfm?ItemNumber=1108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seal of Acceptance</a>. Five of our six insole finalists have received this endorsement; the sixth received excellent user reviews at an economical price point.</p>
<p>Next, we contacted an experienced podiatrist, Dr. Benjamin Cullen of <a href="https://www.sandiegopodiatrygroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">San Diego Podiatry Group</a>, for his opinion on the best insole. Dr. Cullen explained that for an average person with mild heel pain, a pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033BPBD4/?tag=ybsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet &#8211; GREEN insoles</a> often resolves any issues. He suggests this type both for active exercisers and for people who are on their feet for long periods of time. These insoles, Dr. Cullen says, provide enough support for most individuals without being too rigid.</p>
<p>In general, Dr. Cullen recommends breaking in new shoe insoles first before wearing them for a full day. This involves wearing them for 1-2 hours per day and gradually increasing the time worn over several days. Most manufacturers of the insoles we chose make this same recommendation, particularly if you aren’t used to wearing shoe insoles or orthotics.</p>
<p><strong>Note that while insoles are heavily marketed for a range of different activities (from “running” to “work”), our podiatrist suggests that it is not necessary to have different insoles for each activity.</strong></p>
<p>We also discussed the benefits of using insoles with exercise enthusiast and physical therapist, <a href="https://www.uchealth.org/provider/christine-kittles-pt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christine Kittles</a>. She explained that putting your feet into proper alignment can relieve pain in your feet and lower body, plus improve overall mobility. Kittles has seen positive results with all types of Superfeet insoles, which mold to the shape of your feet over time.</p>
<p>Finally, we researched previous product testing by The Wirecutter, along with a variety of articles, expert advice and product information online from sources like Runner’s World, Orthotic Shop, REI Expert Advice and The Insole Store.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs an insole?</h2>
<p>Almost everyone who puts stress on their feet can benefit from a pair of quality insoles. This stress may come from high-impact physical activity such as running, fitness walking and intensive training. Or, it can come from long hours of standing on your feet in professions like nursing, food service or retail. If you stand in the same spot all day, consider using an <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-anti-fatigue-mat/" rel="noopener">anti-fatigue mat</a> too.</p>
<p>Whether you are currently experiencing foot, ankle, knee, hip or lower back pain, or simply want to avoid it in the future, a good pair of insoles may help. For the majority of people, putting feet into a neutral position — which is what most shoe insoles aim to do — helps solve and prevent related pain and discomfort.</p>
<p>Foot pain can be due to <a href="https://www.apma.org/Patients/FootHealth.cfm?ItemNumber=985" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plantar fasciitis</a>, flat feet, high arches, heel pain, <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/gear/a20795259/pronation-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overpronation</a> or repetitive stress. If you have a proper insole already and are still experiencing foot pain from repetitive stress, using a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/foot-massagers/">foot massager</a> may help relieve some pain. Shoe insoles provide both cushioning and overall support, thereby relieving pain not only in your feet, but often in other areas of your lower body as well. Shoe insoles can also help prevent blisters and even keep your feet warm.</p>
<p>Choosing a pair to try may seem overwhelming. As previously mentioned, insoles are marketed for many types of activities, such as standing all day, walking, running and hiking. Our experts, however, suggest that there are only two main types of insoles — support insoles and gel/cushioned ones.</p>
<p>Most people can benefit from better support, but some individuals may simply need extra padding. Although our testing focused on full-length support-style insoles (which generally provide the maximum level of support and, ultimately, comfort) the final six selections offer a range of cushioning levels.</p>
<p>Insoles can be used in various types of shoes, including athletic, casual, dress and work. Generally, they are meant to replace (as opposed to go on top of) the original shoe insoles.</p>
<p>Full-length insoles tend to be designed for sturdier, roomier athletic shoes, so there are certain styles of shoes that insoles won’t work for. This can be an issue particularly affecting women’s styles: sandals, high heels and very tight-fitting shoes. In these cases, other types of partial inserts/lifts/pads may be more appropriate.</p>
<p>If your shoes do not have removable insoles to start with, getting a pair of insoles to fit could be challenging.</p>
<p>When it comes to insoles, sometimes the “best” pair depends on the actual shape of your foot, any problems you are having and what activity you are doing.</p>
<p>Women, for example, tend to have issues with forefoot pain from wearing high heels; good arch padding can help divert the pressure from that area. Runners, on the other hand, often experience heel pain, so a deep, stable heel cup could help.</p>
<p>Our feet come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. As you explore the many insoles on the market, it is helpful to understand your foot type. Are you flat-footed or do you have unusually high arches? Take this test to find out. Are your feet wide or narrow? Do you over- or under-pronate? Finally, are you currently experiencing any pain? If you are having severe foot, ankle, knee, hip or back pain, consult your doctor before starting your search.</p>
<p>If chronic health problems, such as diabetes or circulation issues, are contributing factors to your foot, ankle or lower body pain, please consult your medical provider. Custom orthotics and/or additional treatment may be needed.</p>
<p>One important aspect that our testers noticed was that every single pair of insoles tested was a major improvement over the thin, floppy, formless insoles that come standard in shoes. Bottom line? Give shoe insoles a try! Your feet don’t need to hurt.</p>
<h2 id="store">Store-bought insoles vs prescription orthotics</h2>
<p>There are many reasons to try over-the-counter shoe insoles before rushing to the podiatrist for custom orthotics. The biggest reason, of course, is financial. The average cost of prescription orthotics is $400-600. Because this isn’t generally covered by insurance, podiatrists and physical therapists often suggest trying over-the-counter shoe insoles first, since they are generally priced at $10-100.</p>
<p>When making your decision, consider that because custom orthotics are costly, most people only purchase one pair and transfer them between various shoes. This isn’t as convenient as owning multiple pairs for all of your shoes. If store-bought insoles prove effective for you, their more affordable price point may allow you to purchase multiple pairs for this convenience.</p>
<p>Next, note that custom orthotics can also be more of a hassle to obtain, often requiring a referral from a primary care doctor to a podiatrist or orthopedic specialist. This can cause delays in treating foot discomfort. Quality over-the-counter insoles can be conveniently purchased at many stores selling footwear or online from various outlets.</p>
<p>Custom orthotics are customized to your feet, either to correct certain motions or to accommodate specific problems and relieve related pain. They can also be customized to particular shoes, including high heels.</p>
<p>Also, custom orthotics are made from top-quality materials and can last one to five years, depending on a variety of factors. Your podiatrist can help determine when it’s time to replace them. Store-bought insoles tend to wear out faster, though there is a wide range of durability between products. Superfeet, for example, can last up to a full year.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing any active foot pain, Dr. Cullen recommends giving it some time to resolve once you start wearing your new shoe insoles. After the initial break-in period of several days, wear them full-time for an additional two to four weeks. If there’s no improvement in your pain at that point, you may need custom orthotics.</p>
<p>Finally, if you are in doubt as to whether you should try over-the-counter or prescription orthotics, and/or your foot-related pain is severe, please consult your medical provider.</p>

<p><strong>Overall support:</strong> For proper foot health, good support is key. In our testing, we generally found that the more rigid pairs of insoles, particularly in the arch and heel areas, provided the best overall support. Again, a supportive pair of insoles will place the foot in a neutral position, minimizing foot pain and discomfort and/or avoiding future issues with these.</p>
<p><strong>Overall comfort:</strong> Comfort is also very important. The whole point of insoles, after all, is to make your feet happy! Of course, this measure is more subjective than others, since it depends on the needs of your feet, but the majority of our testers found Superfeet the most comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Arch support:</strong> Many individuals seeking insoles mention arch pain as a motivating factor. The arch area should be shaped appropriately for your foot and be strong enough to not collapse under your weight. Those with very flat feet may not find very high arch support as comfortable as those with naturally higher arches, but the exact shape of the arch curve can factor in as well.</p>
<p>Appropriate arch support can help divert pain from other areas, such as the forefoot or heel areas, so it is beneficial for the entire foot. We found that Superfeet offered a nicely shaped, moderate arch curve with strong support that did not collapse under weight. The SOLE, Powerstep, and Physix models had the highest arches; Spenco the most mild.</p>
<p><strong>Heel cup:</strong> The heel is another area of the foot where many people experience pain. Some insoles offer a cradling effect for the heel which can improve stability and comfort. Consider the width and depth of the heel cradle (if any) and how it fits your particular foot.

<p><strong>Cushioning:</strong> The level of padding varies significantly from insole to insole. Some offer a fairly uniform cushion while others focus the padding onto certain areas of the foot. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KVT3AW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spenco</a> insoles were by far the most cushioned of the ones we tested.</p>
<p><strong>Thickness:</strong> Shoe insoles are designed to replace the ones that come standard with a pair of shoes. Shoes with removable insoles are generally higher-volume, with some flexible space to accommodate a slightly larger insole. However, if you need to fit the insoles into a greater variety of shoes, look for a thinner design.</p>
<p><strong>Material:</strong> All of the insoles we tested are made from synthetic materials, primarily foam and plastics. However, there are shoe insoles on the market made from leather and natural materials.</p>
<p><strong>Odor and moisture control:</strong> Although we didn’t notice any particular odor or moisture issues with any of the insoles tested, we can certainly imagine this could become an issue over time. To avoid, remove the insoles entirely from the shoe after heavy use and let them air out overnight. Many insoles can be hand washed, but check care instructions for specifics.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Running-sm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We recruited two product testers, one male and one female, to spend some time wearing our six finalists. Both testers either walked or ran a regular route multiple times per week; both also spent a fair amount of time standing in place. Insole tests were conducted after an initial 3-day break-in period, as recommended by our medical experts and manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
<h3>Comfort ratings</h3>
<p>The first product test assigned comfort ratings —scale of one (poor) to 10 (excellent) — for each insole after being placed into a pair of athletic shoes. Each model was rated 1) after first putting them on, 2) after an hour of brisk walking and/or running, and 3) after an hour of standing. Care was taken to ensure comparable conditions such as speed, time of day, type of socks and length of route.</p>
<p>These tests were repeated for all of our insole finalists to ensure an accurate and consistent assessment. We then averaged all individual comfort scores to create an overall comfort score for each finalist. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033BPBD4/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet</a> insoles received the highest overall comfort ratings.</p>
<h3>Padding inspection</h3>
<p>Next, a visual and touch inspection on padding was completed. This took note of padding levels in the following areas: overall, heel, arch, toe and metatarsal. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KVT3AW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spenco</a> insoles offered the best overall padding and cushioning. SOLE and Powerstep also performed well.</p>
<h3>Shoe fit</h3>
<p>We placed the insoles into a variety of shoes to check fit: experimenting with men’s and women’s hiking shoes, running shoes, fashion sneakers, dress shoes and boots. It quickly became clear which insole was more difficult to put in, take out and move into another shoe.</p>
<p>For anyone wanting to transfer their insoles between shoes regularly, the flexible, floppy style of the Spenco insoles made them the most challenging to maneuver; the SOLE ones were next most challenging due to their slightly larger size, though we found the others fairly comparable.</p>
<p>This stage of testing was also designed to reveal which, if any, insoles slipped around within the shoe. We found that they all stayed in place quite well. We also discovered which ones were more likely to fit in lower-volume shoes.The thinner forefoot area of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078GSPH61/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Physix</a> made them the lowest profile insoles and most likely to fit into tighter dress shoes and boots or low-volume fashion sneakers.</p>
<h3>Stability measurements</h3>
<h4>Heel cup</h4>
<p>Heel pain is a big problem for many individuals and a major component of why people turn to insoles in the first place. Therefore, a key point of marketing for shoe insoles involves claims of a “deep heel cup.”</p>
<p>To attach some relative meaning to this claim, we investigated by assigning each insole one of three categories: strong, moderate or mild. Two of the insoles landed in the “strong” category and offered the best cradling of the heel area — the Superfeet and SOLE.</p>
<h4>Arch height</h4>
<p>Insole arches were compared to each other and rated high, moderate or mild. SOLE and Powerstep had the highest arches and strong arch support — but note that the arch curve could be too high for some individuals. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00124J8JW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078GSPH61/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Physix</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058YGR8W/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vionic</a> offered more moderate arch support; Spenco was the lowest.</p>
<h4>Rigidity of insole</h4>
<p>When it comes to insoles, there must be a balance of being rigid enough to offer good support while still flexible enough for the feet to comfortably bend and move. We rated each insole model in one of three categories: flexible, rigid or semi-rigid. Our top choice, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00124J8JW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet</a>, and runner-up, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00124J8JW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOLE</a>, both landed in the “rigid” category, although note that while the heel and arch areas are fairly rigid, both are still flexible in the forefoot area.</p>
<h3>Customization</h3>
<p>Most shoe insoles are designed to custom-mold to your foot over time. None of the insoles we tested require heat molding, though the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00124J8JW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOLE</a> model offered the option to heat mold, a simple process involving an oven at low heat before wearing to speed up the customization process.</p>
<p>With either heat or wear molding, our manufacturers’ recommendations consistently suggested breaking in new insoles over a several-day period, slowly increasing the time worn each day. We noticed that the Superfeet insoles showed visible shape changes as they molded to our feet.</p>
<h3>Odor and moisture</h3>
<p>We planned to take note of any unusual odor or moisture after wearing, but all insole models that we tested provided effective odor and moisture control.</p>
<h2 id="best">The best insole overall: Superfeet &#8211; GREEN</h2>

<p>After extensive online research to narrow down the field to six finalists, we conducted a variety of product tests that had us running for miles, walking briskly, standing in place and pulling out a variety of shoe styles from our closets. We explored insole support, stability, comfort, cushioning, shoe fit — and even potential issues with bad odors (yikes!). In the end, our feet are extremely grateful and the winner of best insole overall is abundantly clear: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033BPBD4/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet &#8211; GREEN</a>.</p>
<p>This product comes highly endorsed by medical experts. Along with our runner-up, SOLE &#8211; Softec Ultra-U, this one has received the APMA Seal of Acceptance — a distinction demonstrating that podiatrists agree these insoles add significant value to overall foot health.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Superfeet insoles are recommended by our expert podiatrist, Dr. Cullen, for the vast majority of people with mild foot pain. They are appropriate for high-impact activities, long periods of standing, and general daily wear. Dr. Cullen generally suggests that patients give these a try before spending hundreds of dollars on custom orthotics; however, if active foot pain has not improved within two to four weeks, custom orthotics may be necessary.</p>
<p>Exercise enthusiast and physical therapist Christine Kittles agrees that Superfeet makes the best insoles. She uses them personally and recommends them to help resolve or avoid both foot and lower body pain — thereby improving an individual’s overall mobility. Over time, Superfeet insoles visibly mold to your foot to provide a higher level of customization than many other store-bought insoles.</p>

<p>Superfeet insoles are highly reviewed by a number of product sites that we know and trust, including <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-insoles-for-running-and-walking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wirecutter</a>, <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/advanced/a20790036/a-guide-to-running-shoe-inserts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Runner’s World</a>, <a href="https://www.orthoticshop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orthotic Shop</a>, <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/insoles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REI Expert Advice</a> and <a href="https://www.theinsolestore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Insole Store</a>.</p>
<p>From our series of product tests, Superfeet &#8211; GREEN earned top comfort marks by all product testers, offering a combination of excellent arch and heel support. The arch support offers a moderate, nicely shaped curve that is appropriate for most foot types and a deep cradle provides excellent heel stability. SOLE also offers a nice heel cradle and good arch support, although the arches are a bit higher so they may not be appropriate for all foot shapes.</p>
<p>Superfeet has a fairly rigid structure to the heel and arch areas, similar to our runner-up, along with a flexible, moderately cushioned forefront. While SOLE offers more cushioning in the forefoot area, they are also higher-profile and thicker as a result, leading to more challenges with shoe fit. Superfeet allows for a nice trade-off between comfort and functionality.</p>
<p>The downside mostly comes with cost. Superfeet (and SOLE) are definitely on the pricier end of store-bought insoles. However, we believe that they will last much longer than less expensive options, which we could see visible wear and tear on after just a handful of wearings. Superfeet claims their insoles will last up to one year or 500 miles and they come with a 60-day satisfaction guarantee.</p>

<p>We also really like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SOLE-Softec-Ultra-U-Support-Inserts/dp/B01KT2XVLI/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOLE &#8211; Softec Ultra-U insoles</a>. Like Superfeet, they have the APMA Seal of Acceptance and performed well in all areas of our product testing. SOLE can be used for a variety of activities and work best in high-volume shoes.</p>
<p>SOLE performed especially well for overall support. The arch of the SOLE insoles provides high, fairly rigid support, making them a good option for individuals with high arches. Like all models tested, the forefoot area of the insole remains flexible. They have a very similar cradling heel cup to Superfeet &#8211; GREEN, which is part of their appeal and offers excellent heel support and stability.</p>
<p>For individuals with particularly high arches, SOLE is a good option. Even for those with more moderately arched feet, they might be still be comfortable due to the nicely shaped and cushioned arch curve. Alternatively, Superfeet offers more moderately raised arches.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole insole, the cushioning was noticeably thicker on SOLE than all the other finalists, with the exception of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KVT3AW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spenco</a>. This especially stood out in the forefoot area where other insoles tend to run much thinner.</p>
<p>While the padding is certainly nice to have, there is a trade off because it makes the size of the insoles slightly larger than the others, including Superfeet. This makes shoe fit more challenging, although there is still room in high-volume shoes for these to be comfortable.</p>

<p>The main drawbacks are that they are higher in price and that there may be some shoe fit issues since they are also thicker than some of the others, as a result of more cushioning. We also found that they run a little longer than some of the others, so may require trimming. (Superfeet also required some trimming.)</p>
<p>If you’re looking for good support that also offers good cushioning, and plan to use them in high-volume shoes, SOLE might be a good option. They are extremely comfortable, supportive and padded, earning them best runner-up choice.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SOLE-Softec-Ultra-U-Support-Inserts/dp/B01KT2XVLI/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOLE &#8211; Softec Ultra-U insoles</a> offer excellent cushioning with high, rigid arch support and stable heel cradling.</li>
<li>They have received the APMA Seal of Acceptance.</li>
<li>Because of their thick cushioning, they are best suited for high-volume shoes.</li>
<li>There is a heat-moldable option to speed up the break-in process and provide more customization in less time.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078GSPH61/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Physix &#8211; Gear Sport Soles</a> offer an ultra-thin design, leaving lots of toe space and also making them a good choice for tighter fitting shoes. The trade-off is that the forefoot cushioning is quite mild. They have a moderately cradling heel cup and moderate/high arch support.</p>
<p>As one of the least expensive options, they are easy on the budget and come with a 100% money-back guarantee if you’re not satisfied. One area of concern is that they do not have the APMA Seal of Acceptance. However, they tested higher than some of the other insoles that do. Like all of our insole finalists, they are generally highly reviewed by previous customers.</p>
<h3>Spenco &#8211; Polysorb Cross Trainer</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KVT3AW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spenco &#8211; Polysorb Cross Trainer</a> is another budget-friendly option that is almost exclusively focused on cushioning and shock absorption, though there is also a soft, moderate arch support that is designed for low- to medium-arched feet.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the foam under the metatarsal area already showed some signs of wear and tear after just a couple wearings, so the low price point suggests a trade off with long-term durability, but they also come with a one-year unconditional guarantee.</p>
<p>They are comfortable and cushioned and accepted by the APMA, but may not be right for everyone due to fewer stability features.</p>
<h3>Powerstep &#8211; Pinnacle</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20484" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles.jpg" alt="Powerstep Pinnacle" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Designed by podiatrists, Powerstep offers a full range of insoles, with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001BVHS1Q/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Powerstep Pinnacle</a> being an “Amazon choice” and APMA-accepted. These have high firm and flexible arch support and a moderate/high cradling heel cup designed for mild to moderate pronation.</p>
<p>The heel is raised slightly higher than some of the other products, taking up somewhat more space in the shoe. The insole’s texture caused some friction for one of our testers on the bottom of the foot and the high heel cup caused heel blistering (due to shoe fit issues) for our other tester.</p>
<p>Powerstep offers a moderate amount of cushioning and is also priced in the middle of the range. Insoles come with a lifetime guarantee against breakage of the plastic foot support.</p>
<h3>Vionic &#8211; Orthaheel Active</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058YGR8W/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vionic &#8211; Orthaheel Active</a> insoles are designed by podiatrists and have a moderately sloped, fairly rigid arch support with mild overall cushioning and a moderately cradling heel cup. There is visible targeted padding in the metatarsal and heel strike areas.</p>
<p>Vionic offers a 30-day guarantee and has the APMA Seal of Acceptance. While there was nothing specific wrong with them, testers just generally didn’t find them as comfortable as the top choices.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>We believe that our top-rated shoe insoles, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033BPBD4/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet &#8211; GREEN</a>, will help you say goodbye to sore feet. These insoles scored well on all aspects of our product testing including overall comfort, arch and heel support, padding, rigidity, shoe fit and functionality — and were clear favorites among our product testers.</p>
<p>They are appropriate for all levels of activity. The combination of cradling heel support, well-shaped and rigid arches, and overall comfort made them winners for best insole.</p>
<p>Our runner-up, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SOLE-Softec-Ultra-U-Support-Inserts/dp/B01KT2XVLI/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOLE &#8211; Softec Ultra-U insoles</a>, is another great option for sore feet.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we picked our test products</h2>
<p>When we first started researching the electric foot massagers market, we discovered that there were lots of products available, but relatively few that were highly-regarded. This meant that the first step was eliminating products that had significantly negative reviews on Amazon.</p>
<p>We also limited our focus to foot massagers that were mentioned positively on forums, professional reviews, and Reddit threads. Finally, we spoke with <a href="http://www.psychiatry.emory.edu/faculty/rapaport_mark.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Rapaport</a> &#8212; a nationally-recognized doctor with experience in psychology, behaviorial science, and the benefits of massage therapy &#8212; as well as other doctors who helped us determine which electric foot massagers (as well as which <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-neck-and-shoulder-massager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neck massagers</a>) were best suited to have a positive impact on health.</p>
<p>We also strongly prioritized massagers with heating functionality &#8212; however we did make an exception for the MedMassager, both because of the significant number of positive reviews it had as well as the fact that it is designed to work differently than Shiatsu and heat-based foot massagers.</p>
<p>Once we narrowed the list, we looked for massagers that had the best combination of features and specs, and ordered the five products from that curated list to test in our office.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Once we had our list of five finalists, we assessed each of them individually based on a number of criteria, including ease of use, effectiveness, and features offered. We also took weight, portability, and power usage into account.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3957 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart.png" alt="feature comparison chart" width="880" height="561" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart-610x389.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart-360x230.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart-375x239.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart-414x264.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart-295x188.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart-180x115.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart-320x204.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>In general, we were looking for foot massagers that were easy to operate, comfortable on our feet, and had a substantially positive impact on how our feet felt after five to 10 minutes in the massager.</p>
<p>Secondary metrics we looked included the power usage of each foot massager while in use, the weight of each massager, whether the massagers had a handle for easier portability, and whether there was an automatic shutoff built in.</p>
<p>While these features did have an impact on our selection of finalists as well as our top picks, they were secondary to the actual operation and benefits of each electric foot massager.</p>
<h3>Foot massage focus group</h3>
<p>During testing, we realized that massaging preferences can be fairly subjective. Some people prefer intense ones that really get the knots out, while others prefer a more gentle and soothing massage; possibly with some heat to relax their muscles.</p>
<p>While we did our best to assess each machine as objectively as possible, ultimately we realized that having a larger sample size, which included a wider range of people, would help us find the best possible product.</p>
<p>We came up with five different metrics and asked 10 people to rate each of the electric foot massagers on a scale of one to 10 using those metrics. We also made sure each person had walked a lot that day, and felt like they could really use a foot massage.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3958 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results.png" alt="focus group reults" width="880" height="608" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results-610x421.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results-360x249.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results-375x259.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results-414x286.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results-295x204.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results-180x124.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results-320x221.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Aesthetics</h3>
<p>For this category, we asked each member of the focus group to rate the appearance of the foot massager. If they were to own the massager in question, would they put it somewhere easily visible in a living room or bedroom, or hide it away when not in use?</p>
<h3>User Friendliness</h3>
<p>For the user friendliness rating, we asked each member of the focus group to describe how easy it was for them to figure out how to use the massager. This included both turning the massagers on and off as well as adjusting the massager to their desired settings.</p>
<h3>Comfort</h3>
<p>We distinguished “comfort” from the “pain relief” metric. For comfort, we asked our focus group to limit the rating to their comfort without the massagers turned on.</p>
<h3>Pain Relief</h3>
<p>This is the key measurement, and was used to compare how each person felt before and after they used the foot massager.</p>
<h3>Want to use it again?</h3>
<p>We used this metric as a way to gauge the “overall” score each member of our focus gave to the massagers. We specifically asked them not to consider the cost when providing this rating.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the survey made it clear that the </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JKS3HXS?th=1/?tag=ybdftm-20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RENPHO – Shiatsu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the favorite when taking into account all categories. Our testers found it to be the most attractive looking massager, the most comfortable and very user friendly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Relaxzen was a close runner up, ranking as well as the RENPHO in terms of aesthetics and pain relief. It ranked highest of our finalists in terms of being user friendly. However, our testers found it less comfortable than our top choice and were less likely to use it again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MedMassager also stood out for the significant pain relief it offered — even if the aesthetics were rated lower than average by our panel of testers.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 update</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We originally chose the Brookstone as our top pick, but it has been discontinued since we first published this article. For our update, we once again read through professional reviews, Reddit threads and Amazon reviews to find an additional three products to test in our office.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A focus group of four testers of varying ages (one of whom had completed a 5k the same day) provided us with their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">impressions and numerical rankings of the additional products. We compared these with the scores of our original models to determine our top choice.</span></p>
<h2 id="what-to-think-about">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>If you decide to purchase a foot massager, the first step is to determine what the primary purpose of the massager will be. If you’re getting one for a specific medical condition &#8212; such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or an inflammatory disease like arthritis &#8212; there are certain features you’ll want to make sure your choice includes.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you simply want a foot massager as a way to relax after a long day, you can be a bit more flexible about which massager you choose. You may want to consider an <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-anti-fatigue-mat/">anti-fatigue mat</a> for all-day standing relief. Insoles may help relieve the source of your pain too. See our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-insoles/">insoles review</a> to see if its something else you should add.</p>
<p>Once you know the primary purpose of what you&#8217;re looking for, the next step is to find the one that offers the features you want. Some of the features you should think about include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the massager heat up?</li>
<li>Are there intensity settings?</li>
<li>Is the massager easy to carry?</li>
<li>How noisy is the massager?</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll also want to decide whether you want a foot massager that is designed to improve circulation in your foot, or more of an “all-purpose” option. If your top priority is improving circulation, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IF89MY/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MedMassager</a> is hands-down the best massager on the market. This one uses a design that oscillates a platform to massage instead of Shiatsu style rollers.</p>
<p>If you want more of an all-purpose massager, it’s worth looking into the specific features and settings of each machine. In general, a product that provides heating, variable levels of pressure, and a shiatsu-style massage will be effective for general wellness.</p>
<p>It’s also worth considering the weight and portability of the foot massager as well &#8212; particularly for the elderly or those with health conditions. Having a handle can make a massager significantly easier to move around, and of course the lighter a product is, the easier it is to move around when needed.</p>

<p>One interesting consideration that we didn’t realize until we started testing was the challenge of using MedMassager in an apartment, hotel, or anywhere else that your floor is someone else’s ceiling. That’s because the MedMassager works by creating fairly strong vibrations &#8212; which can potentially be felt, and heard, from the floor below.</p>
<h2 id="health-benefits">The health benefits of massage</h2>
<p>In order to learn more about the benefits of massage, we spoke with Dr. Mark Rapaport of the Emory University School of Medicine. Dr. Rapaport has an extensive history of studying how massage helps, and is the Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Emory University.</p>
<p>Dr. Rapaport also has more than 180 articles published in peer-reviewed publications and has received grants from nationally recognized organizations, including the National Institute of Mental Health.</p>
<p>We spoke with Dr. Rapaport on the phone, and got some great insight into the significant and wide-ranging impact of massages on the mental, physical, and psychological health.</p>
<h3>General benefits</h3>
<p>According to Dr. Rapaport and the research studies he has published, massages have a number of substantial health benefits. These range from reductions in anxiety and irritability to a decrease in unhealthy levels of cortisol. Massage can also modulate immune function and increase levels of the “feel-good” hormone oxytocin.</p>
<p>Massage therapy is increasingly recognized as a powerful medical treatment, with benefits for everyone from cancer patients to reducing post-pregnancy discomfort. Even if you’re in great health, massage can significantly increase your quality of life.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Rapaport, massage in healthy individuals can decrease allergic responses and potentially harmful inflammation in the body, and can even improve temporary bouts of depression in otherwise healthy individuals.</p>
<h3>Medical benefits</h3>
<p>For individuals who have particular medical needs, massage can have an even more profound impact. For example, women who have recently given birth via “Cesarean section” (otherwise known as a C-section), can experience <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27502807" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly lowered levels of anxiety and pain</a>.</p>
<p>Individuals with severe flus and other systemic infections benefit from massages due to an increase in lymphatic flow, which helps to flush out the disease more quickly. This is also the case for terminally-ill individuals who are receiving palliative care.</p>
<p>Perhaps most interesting impact massage has on individuals suffering from one of the many forms of cancer. According to the doctors we spoke to and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26991721" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several peer-reviewed studies</a>, massage has a statistically significant impact on the vital signs of cancer patients.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Rapaport, a NIH study studying fatigue in cancer survivors also indicated a marked decrease in fatigue and other symptoms. Those studies are being followed up with a more detailed look into inflammatory markers, and how massage might improve those as well.</p>
<p>The bottom line is this: massage has been unequivocally proven to have substantial health benefits both for healthy individuals, as well as those with a wide range of medical conditions.</p>
<h2 id="health-benefits-foot-massagers">The health benefits of foot massage</h2>
<p>One concern that people considering a foot massager bring up is whether a mechanical option can effectively do the job of an actual massage therapist.</p>
<p>While there are certainly benefits associated with having an actual person performing the massage, the doctors we spoke to said that many of those translate to mechanical foot massagers as well.</p>
<p><strong>In fact, since the specific massages are complex, and the shiatsu/oscillation is so well programmed in certain mechanical massagers, in some cases individuals can be even better off with a mechanical option.</strong></p>
<p>That being said, a highly-trained massage therapist will always be better than a mechanical massager. But when comparing the one-time cost of a foot massager to a massage therapist, it is certainly more cost-effective to have a mechanical foomassager &#8212; if nothing else than to supplement relatively infrequent massages from a licensed therapist.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best overall: RENPHO &#8211; Shiatsu</span> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23199" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu.jpg" alt="Renpho - Shiatsu massager" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When choosing products to test for our 2019 update, we knew we wanted at least one finalist with features similar to our original top pick (which has since been discontinued). Just like our original choice, the </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JKS3HXS?th=1/?tag=ybdftm-20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RENPHO – Shiatsu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> effectively combines Shiatsu-style rollers with air compression and heat to relax the muscles in your feet and remove tension that built up during the day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RENPHO ranked nearly equal in comparison to the Brookstone by our panel of testers. Even before we tallied the final scores, the impression this model left on our testers made us fairly certain it would earn the highest ranking. They liked the way it looked and the customizable experience meant that each of our testers found their own “sweet spot” after playing with the varying modes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The touch buttons are large enough and spaced far enough apart that you can easily control them with your feet. However, our testers preferred the remote control. The programmable settings &#8211;low, medium and high&#8211;are straightforward and easy to understand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you combine the variables of kneading intensity and air compression, the RENPHO caters to all users. Those who prefer a strong massage might combine a high intensity with high air compression, while those who are more sensitive might prefer low or medium settings.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JKS3HXS?th=1/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="" data-srcset="" width="" height="" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Top Pick: RENPHO - Shiatsu</h3><p>Ranked highest by our focus group, the varying selections in terms of kneading intensity, air compression and heat gives the user a customizable massage experience. It has a nice aesthetic and is easy to move from room to room.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JKS3HXS?th=1/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At only eight pounds, the RENPO is easy to move from room to room. Our testers liked the aesthetics, saying they would be willing to leave it out in the living room if they were having company over. It’s easy to clean, with a hard plastic shell that can be wiped down.  The cloth cover (where you insert your feet) is detachable and machine washable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing to note is that while it can accommodate different size feet with no adjustments needed, it reaches its limit at a men’s size 12. Two of our testers who wear a men’s size 12 reported that the space was just big enough to fit their feet, and was a little tight getting inside.</span></p>
<h3>Aesthetics</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RENPHO is priced moderately compared to our other finalists, and consistently scored high across the board in our focus group. In fact, the average score of 8 was far ahead of the rest of the pack, with Relaxzen coming in second place with an average score of 7.8, and the overall average for the seven massagers coming in at 6.9. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our testers agreed that while the size might necessitate putting the RENPHO away before guests arrive, the design was attractive enough to leave it out and the massager could seamlessly integrate into any room. </span></p>
<h3><b>User friendliness</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When researching products, we found that some had needlessly complicated controls and functionality. While customizability and flexibility are valuable, overdoing it on something relatively simple like a electric foot massager adds more difficulty than benefit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operating this machine was fairly straightforward, with clearly marked low, medium and high settings for knead and air intensity. Heat is as simple as turning on and off, and the time setting is color coded to easily determine which setting (15 or 30 minutes) is on. The remote control corresponded exactly to the settings on the massager, with LED lights to see which setting is active.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone in our focus group had an easy time using this foot massager, which is why it had the second-best score among our finalists </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(behind only the Relaxzen and tied with the</span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IF89MY/?tag=ybdftm-20"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">MedMassager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<h3><b>Comfort</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lining is fairly comfortable, although the polyester fabric isn’t as plush as the Relaxzen. You can feel the massagers underneath your feet before you turn it on, but they aren’t knobby. Our testers used it without socks for a fair comparison with other finalists; however, the manual recommends wearing socks (which does make it more comfortable).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The massager as a whole received a score of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">8.1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of 10 for comfort. While that seems slightly low for a top pick, it was the best scoring massager overall, and was well-above the average of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">7.0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>Pain relief</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pain relief is one area where this machine particularly shined, and was one of the primary factors in our naming it our winner. After all, the purpose of a foot massage is to make your feet feel better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we used the foot massager, the consensus was that the air compression and the Shiatsu-style kneading massage worked particularly well to improve blood flow and relax the muscles. After about 5 minutes using this machine, we felt pretty great.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our impressions were backed up by the focus group as well. This massager earned a score of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">8.9</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of 10 from our 10-person focus group, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which was the highest rating of all the remaining finalists</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>Want to use it again?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all four of the other metrics ranking so high, it came as no surprise that our everyone in our focus group was interested in trying it again in the future &#8212; leading to a score of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">9.6</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of 10.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before conducting the focus group, we already had this foot massager marked as our likely top pick based on our own testing and assessment. However, </span><b>with a total score of </b><b>43.7</b><b> out of 50 in our focus group, the </b><b>RENPHO’s</b><b> place as our top pick was solidified.</b></p>
<h3><b>Things we didn’t like</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, we found this massager to be the best option available. While it was relaxing, there were a couple of issues we noticed while testing that are worth mentioning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most significant issue is that it takes a while for the heat to fully activate. During our testing, we noticed that it took about 30 seconds to start heating up, and another minute and a half (for a total of two minutes) before the heat was significant enough to have a positive impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a foot massage that might only be five to 10 minutes, this is somewhat of an issue. Our solution was to let the massager heat up for about a minute before putting our feet in, which was an effective workaround.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we would have preferred that the massager heat up more quickly, it is reasonable to expect heat to take some time to turn on, and none of the other massagers we tested were any better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, those with big feet might not be comfortable with this machine. The massager itself is rated to fit individuals with shoe sizes up to 12</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.5</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, however </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">two</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the people in our focus group had a shoe size of 12 and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mentioned that it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> felt a little too “snug”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This massager is an excellent choice, and is easily the best foot massager we tested thanks to its effective foot massage technique, attention to style and aesthetics, and comfort and usability.</span></p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JKS3HXS?th=1/?tag=ybdftm-20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RENPHO – Shiatsu</span></a> foot massager was our top pick thanks to its effective foot massage technique.</li>
<li>The massager is easy to use, with clearly marked buttons.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only significant downside is the size limit, fitting only up to a men’s size 12.</span></li>

<h2 id="best-for-circulation">Best for circulation: MedMassager &#8211; 11 Speed</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3272 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/med-massager-1.jpg" alt="MedMassager massager" width="900" height="596" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IF89MY/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MedMassager</a> is very popular online and is frequently recommended by doctors as a way to improve circulation in the feet.</p>
<p>Unlike the other massagers we tested, this device uses oscillations to stimulate the skin and muscles to improve circulation instead of Shiatsu-style kneading massage with rollers. This results in a distinctly different foot massage experience.</p>
<p>This device has 12 settings, one through 11 and an “off”, which makes operation fairly straightforward. Operating the massager is as simple as twisting the knob to the desired intensity and putting your feet on the rubber pad. This machine has many intensity levels but it only has one oscillating motion, and no heat function.</p>
<p>According to the company that makes the MedMassager, the massager’s lowest setting operates at 1,000 RPM and the highest operates at 4,000 RPM. This means there is significant variance between each of the settings, making it easy for anyone to choose one that is right for them.</p>
<p>When first using this, we found that the oscillations were a little intense and took some getting used to. However, once we got past the initial surprise, there was no question this massager was relaxing the muscles not only in our feet, but in our lower legs as well.</p>
<p>One feature that is often overlooked is the “Arch Bar” located across the top of the massager. According to the doctors we spoke to, this bar is used to directly stimulate the tendon in the arch of the foot &#8212; known as the plantar tendon.</p>
<p>For individuals that have periodic or frequent foot and leg cramps, the stimulation of this tendon can provide significant relief. Even if you don’t have cramps or another medical condition (such as in our case) using the bar felt great.</p>
<p>One other minor detail that we appreciated was the fact the company has their website and phone number printed on the top of the massager.</p>

<p>While they won’t be earning any style points for that one &#8212; especially when compared to the Brookstone &#8212; it is useful to have that information available for those who have questions or problems with their massager. For the elderly or sick, this can be a particularly significant convenience.</p>
<p>Finally, this device has excellent build quality, which means it will last for many years. In fact, the it comes with a one-year warranty, with an option to purchase a three-year warranty for $29.99, or a lifetime warranty for $39.99.</p>
<p>Even if you choose not to purchase the extended warranty, the fact that such a robust one-year warranty is included speaks volumes about the quality of the MedMassager.</p>
<p>While this machine isn’t as relaxing or “therapeutic” as our top pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EP5EC2I/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brookstone</a> foot massager, we felt quite relaxed once we were done with our 10 minute session.</p>
<h3>Things we didn’t like</h3>
<p>While there are plenty of positive things to say about the MedMassager, there are a few negatives that stood out to us during our testing and focus group.</p>
<p>The first, and perhaps most significant issue is primarily limited to individuals that live in apartments (or anywhere else that your floor is someone else’s ceiling).</p>
<p>Since the this deviceworks by oscillating at a very rapid rate, vibrations are also transferred to the floor. What was surprising was just how significant those vibrations could be, to the point that we could feel them even when standing 15 feet away.</p>
<p>If you live in an upstairs apartment, the oscillations could be prohibitively loud and irritating for your downstairs neighbors &#8212; particularly if the floors aren’t that thick. If you do decide to get one of these and you live in an apartment, make sure you ask your downstairs neighbor if they can hear when the massager is being used.</p>
<p>Another design feature we would have liked to see was a handle. Unlike the Brookstone electric foot massager, the MedMassager doesn’t have an easy way to carry it. That, in conjunction with its 11 pound weight, could pose a problem for some users.</p>
<p>Finally, the it&#8217;s a specialized product. That has several implications, such as a lack of a heat function and just a general inability to be an all-purpose foot massager. This device is great for those who are looking for exactly this type of product, but others might find it lacking in certain respects.</p>
<h3>Focus group results for MedMassager</h3>
<p>This one came in second place, with a final score of 38.5 out of 50. The areas where the it was weakest were in aesthetics and comfort, with a score of 6.8 and 6.1 respectively.</p>
<h3>Aesthetics</h3>
<p>With its utilitarian appearance and somewhat-tacky large-font phone number printed on top, looks like it would be better suited for a doctor’s office instead of a living room. That’s because for most of the product’s history it was used in a doctor’s office.</p>
<p>The MedMassager has been used by doctors, physical therapists, and other medical professionals for years. It’s only relatively recently that this device has been marketed directly to consumers.</p>
<p>While this led to a somewhat weak “aesthetics” score, it’s worth noting this device&#8217;s appearance is also a reflection of the trust medical professionals have placed in it over the years.</p>
<h3>Comfort</h3>
<p>Compared to the Brookstone, as well as the other foot massagers we tested, the MedMassager is not as comfortable. This is largely due to the fact that the other foot massagers we tested allow you to sit back with your feet flat, whereas this one is set up on an angle.</p>
<p>Again, this is a reflection of the MedMassager’s primary role as a medical device in the past, so it’s worth taking the 6.1 comfort score with a grain of salt. That being said, if you’re looking for a purely relaxing, “spa-like” foot massager, the MedMassager might not be the way to go.</p>
<h3>User friendly</h3>
<p>One area where the this device particularly stood out in our focus group was it’s user friendliness score At 9.1 out of 10, this was the highest user friendly rating of all the massagers we tested &#8212; including out top pick, the Brookstone.</p>
<p>This rating matches our own assessment of the MedMassager. Operation is extremely straightforward, with a single knob turning anywhere from off to 11 for varying degrees of intensity.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3273 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/med-buttons-1.jpg" alt="MedMassager controls" width="900" height="596" /></p>
<h3>Pain relief</h3>
<p>Despite its simple operation, the MedMassager proved to be effective at pain relief; as reflected in its 8.2 out of 10 score. Once again, the MedMassager was second only to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EP5EC2I/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brookstone</a> (9.2).</p>
<p>One frequent comment from our focus group was that the pain relief from the MedMassager was mostly noticed after the massager was over. This stands in contrast to the other massagers, which provided pain relief right from the beginning.</p>
<p>The MedMassager is an excellent &#8212; if somewhat specialized &#8212; foot massager. If you’re looking for a foot massager that improves circulation, this one should be at the top of your list.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IF89MY/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MedMassager</a> is the best for improving circulation</li>
<li>The massager doesn’t have certain important features, such as a carrying handle, a heat function, or kneading massage capabilities.</li>
<li>This device is the most specialized of the massagers we tested, which means it is ideal for those who need its specific features, but won’t be right for everyone.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-foot-massagers">The other products we tested</h2>
<p>The remaining three foot massagers we tested all had one thing in common: they were decent, but not outstanding, products. There wasn’t anything glaringly wrong with them, but they didn’t excel neither.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relaxzen</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23198" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2.jpg" alt="Relax Zen " width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Relaxzen was our second-highest rated massager in the aesthetics category; it looks like a pair of soft slippers and all our testers agreed they would feel comfortable leaving it out in a living room or bedroom. If you’re looking for a foot massager on a budget, this would be our recommendation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mechanics are more simplistic than our other finalists. The only variables it offers are a change of direction and the choice of adding heat. Our focus group gave it only a 6.75 rating for comfort, but it rated slightly above average with a score of 8 for pain relief. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best Choice Products</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23197" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu.jpg" alt="Best Choice Products - Shiatsu" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our focus group testers jokingly referred to the </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0170XC7XM?th=1/?tag=ybdftm-20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best Choice Products – Shiatsu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as “Darth Vader” due to its sleek black appearance. Its heavy weight and large size made it less aesthetically appealing than our top pick, although one tester pointed out that it would fit right in with a modern design nail salon. It rated average for all categories, with mostly scores of 7 across the board. It has an open toe design, meaning that you don’t have to place your toe in an enclosed space as with some of our other finalists.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One issue we noted was that the remote control needed to be held very close to the panel in order to change the settings. The terms on the remote control and the device control panel don’t align; it took some deduction to figure out that “personality” on the remote control was the “custom” setting on the device. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the Best Choice offers a decent massage and is easy enough to use but our focus group were relatively lukewarm about this model.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3959 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runners-up-1.jpg" alt="foot massager runners up units" width="900" height="600" /></p>
<h3>uComfy</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DSICT1Y/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">uComfy</a> did an all-around decent job. Its appearance is fine, but feels somewhat dated, and the foot massage itself was close in quality to the Brookstone. However, the controls on this device didn’t work great, and there wasn’t much variation between the settings.</p>
<p>In our focus group, the user friendliness score was 6.8, which was towards the bottom of the list. It performed in the mid-seven range for the rest of the metrics, and was the closest of the remaining three to be considered an “honorable mention”.</p>
<h3>Homedics Deep Kneading</h3>
<p>We were disappointed by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DPMDWAA/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Homedics massager</a> because there were several very positive reviews. It is the simplest and most straightforward device we tested featuring Shiatsu style kneading massager rollers. However, we found the quality of the massage to be underwhelming.</p>
<p>The underwhelming foot massage was also supported by our focus group, which gave the Homedics massager a comfort and pain relief rating of 5.1 and 5.5 respectively.</p>
<h3>3Q</h3>
<p>The 3Q was similar to the uComfy in the sense that the controls don’t offer much variation. Features are basically limited to turning kneading, air pressure, and heating on or off without any variation in intensity. There are also two programs to choose from, without any description about how they differ.</p>
<p>In the focus group, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H8Z7DIM/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">3Q</a> received a score of 6.5 out of 10; the lowest of all our finalists. We think this score matches with our own experience as well.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discontinued products</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brookstone &#8211; Shiatsu</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We originally named the </span><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EP5EC2I/?tag=ybdftm-20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brookstone &#8211; Shiatsu </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">our top pick, but it is no longer available. In addition to looking the best, it was easy and straightforward to operate and provided the right amount of pressure and intensity on pressure points on our feet. Shiatsu-style rollers, air compression and heat work together to knead out muscle tightness in the feet and promote overall relaxation. Unsurprisingly, our top pick for the 2019 update possesses similar features.</span></p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The health impact of foot massagers are significant and scientifically proven. Whether you are an average healthy adult or you’re recovering from a pregnancy or even a chronic illness, foot massagers can improve your blood pressure and circulation, reduce unhealthy levels of cortisol from your body, and provide you with a general sense of well-being.</p>
<p>The other three products we tested did an acceptable job. However, if you’re going to spend $100 or more on a foot massager, we think its worth getting a product that will perform well for many years.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of publishing this article, the </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JKS3HXS?th=1/?tag=ybdftm-20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RENPHO – Shiatsu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> falls in the middle price range of the massagers we tested. Given its higher ratings in terms of above average ratings in every category we considered, we think it is more than worth it. This is especially true given the adjustable settings and strong ability to personalize the experience, more so than our other finalists.</span></p>
<p>If you want a more medically-focused product and aren’t as concerned about getting the “spa treatment”, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IF89MY/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MedMassager</a> is a proven product that has been used by doctors and physical therapists for years to improve circulation.</p>
<p>If you enjoy relaxing to massages from time to time, or have a medical condition which requires regular massages, foot massagers can be a valuable and cost-effective supplementary device.</p>
