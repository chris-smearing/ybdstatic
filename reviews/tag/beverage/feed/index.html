								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent a month using the best insulated tumblers side by side with water bottles and travel mugs. We found that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RTIC &#8211; 30 Ounce Tumbler</a> gives you all the same insulation performance and better leak-proofing at less than half the price of the best-known <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YETI &#8211; Rambler</a>. If you&#8217;re willing to pay, YETI does give you a slide-open spout that&#8217;s less annoying, though you run the risk of dribbles and drips.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>There are over 20,000 listings on Amazon for &#8220;insulated tumbler.&#8221; YETI is the undisputed brand king, with a tumbler that&#8217;s now even more popular than their ultra-rugged (and expensive) coolers. As with all things that are mass-produced and insanely popular, the number of competitors (and imitations) has expanded just as quickly as YETI&#8217;s profit numbers.</p>
<p>We read and watched dozens of YETI tumbler reviews and comparisons to narrow the mile-long list down to four of the best insulated tumbler cups. <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-tumbler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wirecutter</a>, as always, provides some in-depth testing, and <a href="https://www.savingfreak.com/best-tumbler-yeti-vs-rtic-vs-orca-vs-ozark-trail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saving Freak</a> compares the costs and benefits of the various copycat brands. GearJunkie, like most sites, only <a href="https://gearjunkie.com/yeti-rambler-tumbler-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passes a verdict on the YETI</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY5Kryq62SQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What&#8217;s Inside</a> tried to do a controlled test, but wound up destroying one of their samples.</p>
<p>In our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/" rel="noopener">water bottle review</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/" rel="noopener">travel mug review</a>, we&#8217;ve seen Klean Kanteen and Hydro Flask go head-to-head competing for a position in our tests. <b>For the first time, Hydro Flask offers something substantially different from Klean Kanteen: a bigger cup that actually matches what everyone else is offering.</b></p>
<p>Between the various well-known brands that are just barely different from YETI, RTIC is budget-friendly and offers a flip-cap lid that at least compares in functionality to the Mag-Slide on the new YETI lids.</p>
<p>CamelBak has an interesting contender in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LA4PUMc/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KickBak</a>, and it fared well in Wirecutter&#8217;s insulation test, but customer reviews of the lid are scathing so we skipped it.</p>
<p><b>We decided to test only the 30-ounce tumblers in this review, since they&#8217;re the most popular and represent a type of drink carrier that&#8217;s really different from a </b><a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/" rel="noopener"><b>16-ounce travel mug</b></a><b>.</b> It also allowed us to compare them directly to our favorite 30-ounce insulated <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/" rel="noopener">water bottle</a> to see what difference that narrower opening makes. We selected representatives from a range of prices to see if insulation quality really changes when you buy a $40 tumbler instead of a $16 tumbler.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-get">Should you get a tumbler, water bottle or travel mug?</h2>
<p>Like <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/#best-insulated-water-bottle" rel="noopener">insulated water bottles</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/" rel="noopener">travel mugs</a>, an insulated tumbler will keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold. The vacuum insulation also stops that slippery condensation from forming on the sides and leaving a puddle on your furniture.</p>
<p>The choice between a travel mug and an insulated tumbler is a tricky one. In most ways, these products serve an identical purpose for most people: They maintain temperature, and they&#8217;re convenient to sip from (no screw-top like an insulated water bottle).</p>
<p>The big difference with a tumbler is the lid. <b>While a travel mug is still designed for easy-access sipping, many tumblers don&#8217;t have any kind of stopper at all to slow down your sipping pleasure.</b> The lids are simple and easy to clean, but they offer far less insulation than good travel mugs. The best travel mugs keep your coffee hotter and your laptop (not to mention pants) safer from spills.</p>
<p>A tumbler is also available in much larger sizes than popular travel mugs. You can buy a thermos or a giant insulated water bottle, of course, but those aren&#8217;t easy to sip from.</p>
<p>So, the ideal setting for an insulated tumbler is on a hot afternoon where you want to keep your drink insulated, but you&#8217;re more worried about convenience more than spills. Drinking something cold poolside on a scorching-hot day is a perfect example. Reading on the patio in the early morning with a cup of coffee is also a case where the tumbler works better than an ordinary cup.</p>

<b>Size:</b> The most popular tumblers hold around 30 ounces, and among the friends and coworkers who use them daily, that was unanimously the preferred size for sipping cold beverages or ice water.</p>
<p><b>Spout stoppers:</b> Flip-up stoppers and slide-over stoppers are the two common approaches to keeping a tumbler closed. Look closely at what you&#8217;re buying, though: Many tumblers are made with a few different lid styles if you look for them.</p>
<p><b>Base diameter:</b> Do you need to keep your tumbler in a car cup holder? Check the size just to be sure, but most cup holders are designed to hold extra-large restaurant-size paper cups, which these tumblers mimic.</p>
<p><b>Painted, coated or brushed finish:</b> Color coordination is a nice benefit of painted or powder-coated tumblers, but they&#8217;ll show signs of wear eventually. Brushed stainless steel looks great even if it gets scratched, and there&#8217;s nothing that will peel off after a few years.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Everyday use tests</h3>
<p>Our tester used these tumblers in place of his usual water bottle and coffee mug for two weeks. At work, around the house, in the car and at the park, they all kept beverages handy. The 30-ounce size was bigger than our testers preferred for a morning cup of coffee, but for keeping hydrated (or keeping a rum and coke chilled) it&#8217;s just about perfect.</p>
<p>The differences between the mugs seemed smaller and smaller as we got used to them. The flip-lid from RTIC doesn&#8217;t flop around as much as most travel mug lids in this style, which was our biggest concern. The slide closures on the YETI and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0769CQYVS/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican &#8211; Traveler</a> were easy to use, though not any more so than the flip lid.</p>
<h3>Cleaning test</h3>
<p>Cleaning these tumblers and lids was easy, even by hand. Compared to popular travel mugs like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZI5XNO/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo &#8211; West Loop</a> with its springs and levers on the inside of the lid, a tumbler lid is dead simple to clean.</p>
<p>What about the dishwasher, though? <a href="https://www.rticcoolers.com/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTIC</a> and <a href="https://www.hydroflask.com/caring-for-your-hydro-flask/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hydro Flask</a> say that you should hand-wash only, while <a href="https://www.yeti.com/en_US/are-yeti-tumblers-dishwasher-safe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YETI</a> specifically claims their tumblers will survive dishwashing. (Pelican doesn&#8217;t comment either way.) Given the number of outright contradictions we&#8217;ve seen over our years researching vacuum-insulated products, we&#8217;re not surprised by either answer. Extra-hot drying cycles will make the metal expand and contract, so there&#8217;s some risk to every mug, but the biggest problems are usually with color coatings and glued-on plastic pieces.</p>
<p>If you want to keep your insulated tumbler looking and working its best, hand-washing is the safe way to go. But it seems clear that one trip through the washer won&#8217;t destroy the insulation if you find a week-old smoothie in the back of your truck.</p>
<h3>Insulation test</h3>
<p>We took our four tumblers and our <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07996C56J/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">top-performing insulated water bottle</a> and filled them all with 28 ounces of hot water. Temperature ranged from 190 to 194 degrees Fahrenheit, which is on the upper end of coffee temperature after brewing.</p>
<p>We then checked on the heat loss for the next six hours, and again at 12 hours. The chart below models the results for easy comparison. (The raw data had a difference of four degrees Fahrenheit in starting temperature. The chart shows an adjusted starting temperature, but the temperature change from one sample to the next is as recorded.)</p>
<div id="visualizer-18187-1227765884" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-18187"></div>
<p>The differences between these tumblers is so small that it would be impossible to tell them apart. The real difference is between the tumblers and the water bottle: because the vacuum-sandwich stainless steel walls provide the most effective insulation, the wide lid of a tumbler is a real liability. Even the fact that the Hydro Flask tumbler has no seal to keep steam in made only a tiny difference in the test.</p>
<p>We also added the results from an old test of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp 16-ounce travel mug</a> to this chart for comparison. <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/#how-we-tested" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The testing conditions were different</a> (starting temperature was lower, and we didn&#8217;t test for as long), but we&#8217;ve normalized the starting point on this graph so the sample intervals line up. It&#8217;s clear that even a small narrow-neck bottle keeps heat better than the tumblers.</p>
<h3>Ice test</h3>
<p>In our research, we saw so many variations of the ice test, we were a little surprised that there wasn&#8217;t some kind of consensus. Instead, it seemed that every test had a slightly different result. The real problem with an ice test is getting around the margin of error: It&#8217;s hard to know if you&#8217;re measuring the temperature of the water or the ice cubes. (Infrared thermometers are also often used, and those <a href="https://blog.thermoworks.com/thermometer/how-to-use-an-infrared-thermometer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only read the surface temperature</a> of the water, not the temperature of the whole bath.) It&#8217;s also tricky to ensure that all your ice is the same temperature going in.</p>
<p>We ultimately decided not to repeat an ice test because the insulation performance is so clearly demonstrated by a hot-water test. If heat coming into the cup is any different than heat escaping, the amount of time it takes for that difference to show is measured in hours. If you really want the best insulation possible to keep ice frozen all day long (or if you want to keep small amounts of liquid nitrogen, or something similar), a sealed narrow-neck bottle is still your best bet.</p>
<h3>Leak test</h3>
<p>In our travel mug tests, we went as far as putting the mugs into a spin dryer to see if they would leak in the most extreme circumstances. By comparison, most tumblers will spill some of your drink when you tip them sideways. We filled each tumbler with water and turned them upside down to see if any of the stoppers actually prevent leaks.</p>

Don't put this in a bag with a laptop, but if you knock it over it's not going to dump your drink.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The RTIC&#8217;s lid is surprisingly secure, given the competition. You can usually hold this cup upside down, or even leave it sitting on a table upside down, and not see more than a few drops. As soon as you shake it or drop it on the floor, though, all bets are off. (The more fluid you have inside, the more explosive the spill will be when the flip-cap pops open.)</p>
<p>Of the two brands that are trying sliders, YETI is fairly successful, while Pelican&#8217;s lid is a hot mess. It&#8217;s not clear exactly what the issue is, since the basics of the mechanism seem the same, but the Pelican lid always dribbled a stream of water when we turned it upside down. The YETI &#8220;Mag Slider&#8221; lid isn&#8217;t as magical as it sounds, but it works fairly well to stop anything more than occasional drips.</p>
<p>Hydro Flask gives you nothing to work with for spill prevention. If you really want the color options and tapered form factor they&#8217;re offering, they do have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07943NMYX/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a straw lid option</a> that might be better at stemming the flow of sticky drinks in case of an accident.</p>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RTIC &#8211; 30-Ounce Insulated Tumbler</a> is the best bargain in this lineup, and it&#8217;s our top pick overall. The stopper actually prevents some spills, and compatible accessories are easy to find. This is an updated version of the RTIC, but the old <a href="https://www.amazon.com/RTIC-30-oz-Tumbler-Pink/dp/B019D9HESO/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">all-metal-no-stopper version</a> is still available.</p>
<p>Without buying and trying out these tumblers, it&#8217;s easy to make assumptions about performance. &#8220;Maybe the steel is thinner,&#8221; you think. &#8220;Maybe the vacuum is actually less of a vacuum.&#8221; Our testing shows, though, that If there&#8217;s anything fancy that other brands are doing to improve theoretical insulation performance, the giant plastic lid is an equalizer that levels the playing field.</p>
<p>In every case we&#8217;ve seen (even among top-class insulating mugs and bottles from Zojirushi, Thermos and Hydro Flask) a big lid means mediocre insulation. Improving the insulation of a tumbler without making the lid area smaller is like adding better insulation to your house while the doorways and windows are sealed with plastic sheets.</p>

The plastic base is a drawback, but the price makes this a real winner. If you're picky enough about durability or insulation that a budget model is a turn-off, you should probably check out a travel mug or thermos anyhow.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>So, what is the difference that brings the price down? The plastic &#8220;foot&#8221; on this new RTIC is less tough than the YETI if you drop it on a hard surface, but the difference in price more than makes up for that.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important consideration when it comes to recommending a bargain-priced tumbler is availability: <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-30-Ounce-Double-Wall-Vacuum-Sealed-Tumbler/171452737" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ozark Trail</a>, <a href="https://www.target.com/p/zak-designs-174-30oz-stainless-steel-tumbler/-/A-52542332" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zak! Designs</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Steel-Tumbler-Insulated-Greens/dp/B01AZB6TQW/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BEAST</a> and a dozen other companies are also producing similar tumblers at low price points, but inventory (and new brands) come and go seasonally. RTIC has been around since the beginning of the fake-YETI game, and availability online is always good. That popularity also means that accessories (like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0779M1CBK/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this handle</a>) will actually be designed to fit this cup.</p>
<p>The main feature that bumped this tumbler to the top of our lineup is the spill-proof lid. If you don&#8217;t want the flip-cap to stick up into your face when you&#8217;re drinking, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019D9HESO/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">older version of the RTIC</a> with no stopper is going to be just as good at insulating your drink. Note that the outer dimensions are slightly different; old-style handles don&#8217;t fit new-style mugs with the plastic foot.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The RTIC &#8211; 30-Ounce Insulated Tumbler is a bargain-priced drink vessel that will keep your beverage just as cold (or hot) as other brands.</li>
<li>This flip-up lid stopper is the only option we found that really prevents leaks, though it&#8217;s still not safe to put in a bag.</li>
<li>RTIC compromises on quality very slightly, with some plastic parts, but the vacuum insulation is all that it needs to be.</li>

If you want something better than a budget-priced tumbler, there&#8217;s no way to beat the original <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YETI &#8211; Rambler</a>. YETI didn&#8217;t technically invent this category of drinkware (similar insulated travel mugs have been around for a very long time), but they created a new market with big 30-ounce tumblers targeted at outdoor enthusiasts who loved their coolers for camping and tailgating.</p>
<p>This is not a Yeti thermos: You can easily beat this kind of insulation with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07996C56J/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">narrow-neck bottle from Klean Kanteen</a>, for about the same price. If you want the easy-filling and easy-sipping convenience of a tumbler, YETI has the same performance drawbacks as the other brands.</p>

The magnetic slider is more convenient than a flip-up stopper, but it doesn't make this cup leakproof. The main reason to pick this tumbler is if you've gotta have that logo.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The one category YETI manages to squeak ahead of some competition is in spill prevention. The Rambler&#8217;s slide cover actually stops most (but not all) leakage and only lets drops escape. In comparison, the Pelican will dribble out a stream. The RTIC is more leak-proof, but the YETI really is ready for those times when your friend fires up the motor on the jet boat and you haven&#8217;t finished your drink.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a YETI for coffee that&#8217;s a little different than the classic 30-Ounce Rambler, there&#8217;s also the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BM72ZXT/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YETI &#8211; 14-Ounce Rambler Mug</a> for about $10 less. The small amount of coffee it holds compared to the large lid surface means it&#8217;s only going to keep your coffee hot for about 45 minutes, but compared to six minutes for an open-top ceramic mug for some people this is exactly what they&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>The other case where this is an obvious pick is if you&#8217;re buying a gift. Nothing says &#8220;I only sorta love you&#8221; like a knock-off version of a trendy product. If you know someone who actually wants a YETI, the price difference is worth it.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The YETI &#8211; Rambler is the product that got everyone buzzing about giant insulated cups, and they&#8217;re still the most recognizable.</li>
<li>The price of this tumbler is high, and it doesn&#8217;t keep your drink any hotter or colder than others.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll get drips if you hold the YETI upside down or drop it on the floor, but this lid is good at keeping your drink inside.</li>
</ul>

In many ways, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0769CQYVS/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican &#8211; Traveler</a> hits the optimal price to performance ratio in this lineup, but that doesn&#8217;t make it the best buy.</p>
<p>Pelican is a company that makes quality flight cases for sensitive equipment, and in many ways they&#8217;re like YETI: a small company who established a niche with a specific product, then started building a brand around it. This tumbler is a bit different than the rest, and if you love the screw-on lid with the bigger spout area it&#8217;s a good buy.</p>
<p>The slide-cover lid isn&#8217;t as good at sealing against leaks as YETI&#8217;s lid, though. It dribbles a small stream if you hold the cup upside down. If you really want to keep your drink in, the flip-up lid on the RTIC (or the old-style <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071KW6MRN/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican Snap Lid</a>, which you can still buy in 2018) is a better choice.</p>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079445ZGP/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hydro Flask &#8211; 32 Ounce Insulated Tumbler</a> is a notable contender from one of the big names in the world of insulated drinkware. Many publications give it a win for the sleek profile and brand reputation.</p>
<p>About the only feature that really stands out, though, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07943NMYX/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the straw lid</a>. If you want your insulated tumbler to look like a Big Gulp, this is the way to go. It&#8217;s a hefty price tag, though: The straw lid was a $13 accessory for a $40 tumbler when we checked. The basic lid that comes with the tumbler is claimed to be designed for good insulation, but without even a stopper to keep heat from circulating in and out it doesn&#8217;t make any difference.</p>
<p>If you or the person you&#8217;re buying for already have a Hydro Flask water bottle, buying a matching tumbler for use around the house is a nice touch. They&#8217;re good looking tumblers, but they don&#8217;t perform any better than the other brands to justify the huge price difference.</p>

If you primarily want an insulated cup to drink coffee from, we think a sealed and better-insulated travel mug is a smarter pick than a tumbler. If you want to carry water around with you, likewise, water bottles are better at making water portable while keeping it colder (or hotter.)</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re just looking for the functionality of the classic SOLO party cup with the benefit of better insulation, the double-wall stainless steel vacuum-insulated tumbler checks all the right boxes.</p>
<p>The brand everyone knows is YETI, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">our best buy pick from RTIC</a> beats that cup in two ways: first, RTIC is selling their cup at less than half the price with no loss in performance. Second, the RTIC has a flip-up spout stopper that actually keeps your drink inside, even if you turn it upside down and shake it.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t like the flip-up lid or if you don&#8217;t like supporting imitation products, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the YETI &#8211; Rambler</a> has an updated lid that&#8217;s pretty good at keeping drinks inside without sticking a flap in your nose.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We blended over 30 pounds of produce in the most popular blenders on the market. Ultimately, we thought the Cuisinart - CBT-2000 blended the best for a mid-range price. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hether you’re making a fruit or green smoothie, you need a powerful blender that can pulverize gnarly seeds, tough leaves and stems into a silky-smooth drink. But with so many blenders on the market at different price points, it’s hard to figure out which one is right for you. Our professional chef spent 30-plus hours blending 30 pounds of produce to determine that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X3N9O58/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; CBT-2000</a> is the best blender.</p>
<p>We tested three price ranges of blenders and think the Cuisinart &#8211; CBT-2000 is the best all-around mid-range blender for making smoothies, soups and nut butter on a frequent basis.</p>
<p>If making smoothies or juices is part of your daily lifestyle — and you don’t mind spending substantially more money — then we recommend the high-performance <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-A3500-Programmable-Connectivity-Professional-Grade/dp/B075713NNL/?tag-ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vitamix &#8211; A3500</a>. Our low-priced pick, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0094B94BM/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cleanblend &#8211; 2001</a>, doesn’t have programmed functions and it isn’t great for processing nut butters, but it matched the Cuisinart and Vitamix in overall blending.</p>

<h2 id="selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>The initial phase of our research comprised of reading through posts on Reddit and Amazon to determine the primary reasons consumers are purchasing a blender and how much they’re willing to spend. We found that an overwhelming majority of people are looking for an inexpensive blender that can make fruit and vegetable smoothies.</p>
<p>However, the cheaper blenders for $50 or under don’t have the powerful motors that are needed to break down ice, fruit seeds and skins and sturdy vegetables into a palatable consistency. Another frequent complaint from consumers is that cheaper models simply don’t last long, especially if they’re used on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Vitamix’s marketing and “road show&#8221; promotions at warehouse stores have certainly worked in convincing people that a Vitamix will change their lives by significantly improving their diet. However, not everyone wants to spend $600 or more on a blender. So we looked at the wide swath of blenders on the market and divided them into high-end, mid-range and low-end price categories and see how consumers compared them.</p>
<p>We then cross referenced the blenders rated the best by consumers with the most recent reviews for blenders at Wirecutter, America’s Test Kitchen and Consumer Reports before deciding on the eight blenders we would test. Finally, since manufacturers are frequently upgrading — or sometimes just changing the appearance of — their blenders, we went to their websites to ensure we would be testing the latest model.</p>

<h2 id="who">Who should buy a blender</h2>
<p>Since 1933 when the Oster company introduced the blender to the world, it’s considered to be an essential kitchen countertop appliance. Initially, the blender was created for mixing alcoholic drinks and frozen desserts, but in the last several years it’s taken on a new role as the means for improving diet with fruit or vegetable smoothies and juices.</p>
<p>The build quality of a blender corresponds with its price. The more expensive, high-end blenders, are designed and built to last for years. On the opposite end of the scale, budget blenders ($50 and under) aren’t made well enough for long-term use, and their motors tend to burn out after a year or two.</p>
<p>There are many varieties, sizes and shapes of blenders, and deciding which one is right for you can be confusing. The type of blender you choose will depend on what you want to make and how often you plan to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Low end</strong> ($100-$199): Occasional use for blending frozen drinks and desserts. The blenders we tested in this category are the Cleanblend, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Countertop-1100-Watt-Smoothies-BL660/dp/B00939FV8K/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ninja</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BBL620SIL1AUS1-Furious-Blender-Silver/dp/B07GJ24VXV/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CXKTNDU/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Mid-range</strong> ($200-$399): Frequent use for blending smoothies, juices, nut butter, soups and sauces. These blenders are more advanced than the occasional-use blender and can handle a wider range of food and drink processing tasks. In this category are the Cuisinart and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004UJKKI4/?tag=ybdblender-20">Waring</a>.</p>
<p><strong>High-end</strong> ($400-$599): Everyday, heavy-duty blending for diet, weight loss and overall health improvement.  This type of blender would be excellent for raw-food, vegetarian and vegan diets. There are really only two high-end blenders, the fiercely competitive Vitamix and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blendtec-D725C3216A1A-AMAZON-Designer-Blender-Stainless/dp/B01FASW6OY/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blendtec</a>, and they both have several expensive models.</p>

<p><b>Power of motor:</b> Most manufacturers market their blenders’ ability to reach between 2 to 3.5 “peak horsepower.&#8221; This is a meaningless claim, as a blender will only reach its peak or maximum speed for a couple of seconds at the pulse function. You will also see a blender’s high RPM advertised (30,000 and upwards), which is also misleading since all blenders work at a high RPM. What’s important is whether the motor can sustain a high RPM without burning out.</p>
<p>A more accurate gauge is the blender’s wattage since you want the blender’s motor to have enough power to handle tough blending and grinding jobs. Think whole, hearty fruits and vegetables or nuts. The blenders we tested fell between 1100 and 1800 watts.</p>
<p>As stated by April Jones in <a href="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/article/287/Understanding-Blender-Specifications/print" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cooking For Engineers</a>, “Compare watts, not horsepower ratings. Higher watts mean smoother smoothies and a longer motor life.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Blender jar size and shape:</b> The majority of the blender jars we tested were 64 ounces, which is ample room for the blades to create a vortex that pulls food down into the blades and then pushes it backup for even distribution and blending. We found that jars were those with a slight tapering down to the blades. The tapering created a tighter and more efficient vortex for drawing up ingredients that settled to the bottom.</p>
<p><b>Blade position:</b> Seven of the eight blenders we tested had wing-shaped blades positioned in the bottom of the jar. The Ninja has a blade spindle with three sets of (wickedly) sharp blades evenly distributed. During our testing, the Ninja’s blade created a centrifuge that whirled ingredients but didn’t entirely pulverize them, and the spindle couldn’t reach ingredients in the lower part of the jar.</p>
<p>The other blenders had two to eight wing-shaped blades. The blades that were the most efficient in our tests had upward and downward prongs and the smallest gap between the tip of the blades and the jar. This position allowed the blades to grab ingredients from the bottom and sides without our needing to constantly scrape the insides of the jar.</p>
<p><b>Pre-programmed functions:</b>   The blenders that we found to be most convenient and easy to use had pre-programmed functions. These functions are at a set speed that the manufacturer considers ideal for blending smoothies, juices, soups, ice-crushing and self- or auto-clean. They can each be adjusted with a variable speed-control dial or button to increase or decrease speed as needed. Two of the low-end blenders, the Ninja and the KitchenAid, do not have adjustable speed control, and it was definitely a function we missed.</p>
<p>Both Vitamix and Blendtec have a single, all-purpose speed/time function for smoothies, but the Breville and Cuisinart have two different speeds and times for fruit and green smoothies.  All four blenders made great smoothies, but the blenders that had separate functions dedicated to either fruit or green were slightly better.</p>

<p><b>Hot-soup function: </b>It’s not a “must have&#8221; function, but it’s certainly nice to have. Half of the blenders we tested had a pre-programmed function for blending and then heating the soup to piping hot. (The three low-end blenders and the mid-range Waring do not have the soup function.) The Vitamix and Cuisinart performed exceptionally well, evenly blending and heating the soup in about six minutes. Blendtec’s soup function is programmed at three minutes, and the soup only heated to warm.</p>
<p><b>Noise:</b> Many consumers apparently have the hearing of bats, because complaints about the noise level of high-performance blenders are voluminous. To be fair, <i>all </i>of the blenders we tested were loud, ranging in sound from a high-pitched whine to the roar of a lawnmower. The quietest blender was the KitchenAid, which also has the lowest wattage (550), so there does seem to be a correlation between the blender’s power and its noise output.</p>
<p><b>Warranty:</b> If you’re spending a lot of money on a blender, then you’ll want assurance that it’s going to last, and if something fails, the manufacturer’s warranty will repair or replace the blender. The next most frequent consumer complaint is motor burn-out of the low-end blenders, usually after about a year, and the manufacturer’s limited one-year warranty no longer covers replacement or repair.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0094B94BM/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cleanblend</a> — our top pick in the low-end category — is the exception and has a remarkable <a href="https://cleanblend.com/pages/warrenty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five-year full warranty</a>. Vitamix and Blendtec are confident that their blenders are solidly built and have the most impressive warranties, <a href="https://www.vitamix.com/us/en_us/shop/10-year-warranty" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">10-year</a> and <a href="https://www.blendtec.com/pages/warranty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight-year</a>, respectively.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We carefully chose several tests that would equitably rate all three categories of blenders. All the blenders advertise that they are the best blender for smoothies, so clearl,y we needed to test that claim.</p>
<h3>Ice crushing</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17644" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice.jpg" alt="Crushed ice in a blender." width="2000" height="1335" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-1000x668@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-768x513.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-885x591.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-1000x668.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-320x214.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-885x591@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blending-ice-320x214@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Our first test was a simple one: we added two cups of ice cubes to each blender and timed how long it took to pulverize the ice into a snowy consistency, which is necessary for for a properly blended smoothie. Half of the blenders had a separate “crush ice&#8221; function. For the blenders that didn’t, we simply turned the blender up to its highest speed.  All of the blenders pulverized ice to a powdery snow from three seconds (the Ninja) to one minute (Cleanblend).</p>
<h3>Fruit smoothies</h3>
<p>Most fruit smoothies contain several ingredients: a liquid (such as milk, almond milk, coconut milk), yogurt (usually Greek yogurt, but any style of unsweetened yogurt will do), fresh or frozen fruit and ice. The ingredients should be layered exactly from bottom to top as we’ve listed, since it allows the blender blades to grind the fruit first, then draw the ice down into the vortex to be pulverized and blended with the fruit mixture.</p>
<p>One of the most commonly used fruits is berries — strawberries, raspberries and blueberries. Strawberries and raspberries present a challenge for any blender because of their tiny seeds, which need to be completely ground up and integrated into the smoothie. We decided on <a href="https://www.blenderbabes.com/lifestyle-diet/diabetic/light-pre-workout-raspberry-smoothie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this recipe for a raspberry smoothie</a>; it’s simple but would also determine which blender is best for a seeded-fruit smoothie.</p>

<h3>Green smoothies</h3>
<p>The next most frequently blended smoothie is a green vegetable smoothie. These concoctions also have a milk of some sort in their ingredients and a combination of a green vegetable, such as kale or spinach, another vegetable or two and for sweetness, a bit of fruit. Kale is the heartiest of green vegetables, and it also can be a struggle for a blender to completely grind and pulverize the kale into a smooth green smoothie without any sediment.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.cookincanuck.com/kale-apple-green-smoothie-recipe-vegan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recipe for a kale-apple smoothie </a>tested how well each blender made green smoothies. We thought the apple added enough sweetness and so we omitted the agave. We also left out the flax seeds, since we wanted to focus on how well a blender did in grinding up notoriously tough kale.</p>
<p>As a general note for smoothies, make sure that you use only well-washed organic fruits and vegetables. The blenders blend the whole fruit and vegetable, including seeds and skins. You’ll be drinking them, and you don’t want to ingest pesticides or preservatives.</p>
<p>An egg-based sauce, such as mayonnaise, takes about 30 seconds to make in a blender, and if you haven’t tried it, you’ll be amazed at how easy it is and how much better it tastes than the bottled stuff.</p>
<p>One of our favorite sauces is Hollandaise, and made in the traditional way — whisking eggs over a pot of simmering water — but it’s a bit of a pain. <a href="https://toriavey.com/toris-kitchen/julia-childs-easy-blender-hollandaise-sauce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a blender, however, it’s simple</a>. Basically, it’s mayonnaise with egg yolks, lemon juice and hot butter instead of oil. There’s no cooking involved — other than melting butter in the microwave — and you pour the hot butter into the egg yolks spinning in the blender. Within seconds, the mixture emulsifies, and you have a thick sauce for vegetables or Eggs Benedict.</p>
<p>The Hollandaise test was quite eye-opening, because it highlighted the importance of the jar shape and blade position in each blender. The blender jars that were uniform in shape with no tapering failed the test miserably, because their blades couldn’t reach the egg yolks in the bottom of the jar. When the speed of the blender was increased, the vortex lifted the eggs up, but they weren’t contained tightly enough to bond chemically with the hot butter. The result was a thin buttery liquid that didn’t hold together as a sauce.</p>
<p>The one test that all of the blenders did well in was a simple tomato-basil soup. We used the <a href="https://www.vitamix.com/us/en_us/recipes/tomato-soup" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vitamix recipe</a>, because there weren’t many ingredients, and we wanted a soup that required no pre-cooking and took minutes to make. (If you want to make this recipe, only add one-half cup of water and not the two cups as instructed.) Although half of the blenders did not have the “hot soup&#8221; function, they all made a relatively smooth and fresh-tasting soup that could be heated up in a microwave.</p>
<p>The most daunting challenge for the blenders was peanut butter, since this really put their motors to the test. But also, again, the shape of the blender jar and blade position significantly contributed to the blender’s passing or failing this test.</p>

<p>Only two of the eight blenders we tested — the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X3N9O58/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BBL620SIL1AUS1-Furious-Blender-Silver/dp/B07GJ24VXV/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville</a> — succeeded at our first attempt. The Vitamix model that we tested had a wide, non-tapered blender jar, so the peanuts were too far spread out in the bottom of the jar for the blades to reach. The peanuts were finely chopped and got lodged beneath the blades. We consulted the instruction manual, and for this particular model, we needed to double the peanuts from two cups to four cups. We tried again, and the second time, the blades could reach the additional peanuts and process them into peanut butter.</p>
<p>Half of the blenders we tested had a self-clean function. This is a pre-programmed button that spins water and dish soap for up to one minute. The function begins at a low speed for a few seconds, then shifts into high speed for about 30 seconds, before finishing at a low speed for the final few seconds.</p>
<p>We did find the self-clean function effectively removed food residue from the top and sides of the jar to beneath the blades.</p>

<p>In the ongoing marketing battle between the most expensive blenders, Vitamix and Blendtec, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-A3500-Programmable-Connectivity-Professional-Grade/dp/B075713NNL/?tag-ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vitamix &#8211; A3500</a> wins hands down. The Vitamix’s powerful 1500-watt motor crushes ice cubes into powdery snow in seconds, purees and heats vegetables to hot soup in minutes and pulverizes entire fruits — seeds, core and fruit skins — and sturdy kale and other hearty greens into silky smoothies with no sediment.</p>
<p>Initially, we were a bit suspicious of Vitamix. There’s so much hype around it, and the product demonstrations at stores can be overbearing. Subsequently, we were a bit more stringent in testing Vitamix, but, except for one test, this powerhouse blender completely won us over.</p>
<p>So why is Vitamix so good? Let’s start with the smoothies, since they will most likely be a major consideration if you’re thinking about buying one.</p>
<p>Vitamix has a pre-set function for smoothies timed at a mere 50 seconds. The cycle begins at the mid-speed, level 5, for ten seconds, during which it draws down the ice to the blades and pulverizes it to powder. The cycle then speeds up to its highest level and processes the ingredients in 40 seconds. We were hypnotized by the cyclonic blur of the Vitamix’s vortex as the smoothies were blended.</p>
<p>No other blender we tested could beat Vitamix’s ability to grind the raspberry seeds in the fruit smoothie. The ground seeds had texture but not graininess. We strained the smoothie, and no seed bits were left behind.</p>
<p>Vitamix doesn’t have a separate cycle for green smoothies, but no matter, it worked exactly the same, and our green smoothie was silky with no sediment. Because of Vitamix’s marketing videos depict whole fruits and vegetables being processed, we threw in whole kale leaves, an entire apple — without coring or seeding — and un-cut stalks of celery. Vitamix processed it all without a struggle, and gave us a smoothie that was like a super-refined juice.</p>

<p>As we noted above, the soup function is a wonder, if you enjoy hot soup on a cold day, you can have it freshly made and piping hot in under six minutes. The tomato-basil soup we made in the Vitamix exploded with fresh tomato and herbal flavor, and although it was composed entirely of vegetables, the Vitamix blended it into a frothy emulsion that tasted creamy.</p>
<p>Making peanut butter was a little less stress-free. As we noted earlier, the width of the blender jar for this particular model necessitated our using a minimum of four cups of nuts; otherwise, the finely ground peanuts got lodged beneath the blades. When we added more peanuts on our second attempt, the Vitamix achieved peanut butter in about two minutes.</p>
<p>The only test that the Vitamix failed was the Hollandaise. For the sauce to emulsify, the eggs needed to be beaten for 30 seconds. But the eggs could not be tightly contained in the Vitamix’s wide blender jar, so they just whizzed around underneath the blades. We tried increasing the speed, and the vortex lifted the eggs up but again failed to beat them. When we added the hot butter, it simply splattered and never came together as a thick sauce.</p>
<p>The Vitamix has a great auto-clean function that’s preset at 35 seconds. It goes through three cycles that effectively washes away everything along the sides and bottom of the pitcher all the way up to the lid.</p>
<p>If we had one negative about the Vitamix’s design, it’s that the lid attaches to the blender jar by two plastic tabs. They’re made of the <a href="https://www.rawblend.com.au/assets/files/Vitamix-Container-Info.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">same tough Tritan copolyester</a> as the blender jar, but when we pressed down on the tabs, there wasn’t a click to indicate that we had actually fastened the lid securely on.</p>
<p>Of course, at $600, the Vitamix is certainly an investment. But if improving your diet is important, and blending smoothies or making fresh juices is part of your daily regimen, we believe it will be money well spent. Vitamix’s amazing and unique ten-year warranty is proof they’re confident this blender will last with everyday use.</p>

<p>If you don’t want to spend a good chunk of your paycheck on a Vitamix, but you do want a blender for a daily smoothie, there are several mid-range blenders to consider. During our testing, we found that a couple of the mid-range blenders performed nearly as well as Vitamix, and the differences in texture and consistency of their smoothies and soups were minimal.</p>
<p>At 1,677 watts, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X3N9O58/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; CBT-2000</a> has plenty of power. It has five pre-programmed functions, an LCD screen with a countdown timer and a variable speed dial that can be minutely adjusted from lowest to highest any time during blending. The dial also has a push-button “turbo&#8221; function that instantly increases the speed to high in short bursts.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart’s function for fruit smoothies is preset at 45 seconds and runs through various speeds at ten-second intervals, finishing with a final burst at high. Its fruit smoothie was nearly as perfect as the Vitamix’s with just a touch of miniscule seed bits.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart has a separate function for green smoothies with a longer time (one minute, 30 seconds) and the different cycle of speeds. Again, the Cuisinart’s performance matched Vitamix, blending the tough kale and apple seeds and core to velvety smoothness.</p>
<p>The soup function blends and heats the soup in six minutes, and it may not have had the creamy emulsification of Vitamix’s soup, but it was still perfectly smooth and nearly boiling hot.</p>

<p>As noted earlier, it was a chore to make peanut butter in <i>all of the blenders</i> we tested. The Cuisinart’s lowest speed finely chopped the peanuts in seconds, but as we increased the speed to form butter, the peanut bits splattered up the sides of the blender jar and lodged underneath the blades. We had to continuously scrape together the ground peanuts for about five minutes before they coalesced into a relatively smooth peanut butter.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart did not perform as well in making Hollandaise. Its blender jar is similar to the Vitamix and has almost no tapering at the bottom. Consequently, the blades couldn’t contain the eggs in a tight vortex, so when the butter was added, everything sprayed up without ever emulsifying.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart’s preset clean function is 30 seconds at medium speed, which worked fine for washing off smoothie and soup residue. But we needed to run the program twice to clean off the sticky peanut butter that was lodged underneath the blades.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart &#8211; CBT-2000 comes with an attractive recipe book that includes recipes for smoothies, frozen cocktails, soups, salad dressings and desserts. We were extremely impressed by the Cuisinart’s versatility, durability and its ease of use, and at under $300, it’s a great alternative to Vitamix.</p>
<p>We should note that the Breville &#8211; BBL910XL (“The Boss&#8221;) was one of our best contenders in the mid-range category. However, near the end of our test period, Breville abruptly discontinued this excellent blender, which is now <a href="https://www.breville.com/us/en/products/blenders/bbl910.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only available on the Breville website</a>.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Cuisinart &#8211; CBT-2000 can do virtually everything the Vitamix can, but it’s half the price.</li>
<li>Its powerful and durable 1677-watt motor blended velvety smooth fruit and green smoothies with barely perceptible residue from seeds.</li>
<li>The Cuisinart’s accurate, preset functions include hot soup, ice crush, auto-clean and two different programs for fruit and green smoothies.</li>
<li>It’s easy and convenient to use, and its versatility makes the Cuisinart “Hurricane Pro&#8221; one of the best all-around blenders you could buy.</li>

<p>Fans of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0094B94BM/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cleanblend &#8211; 2001</a> claim that it performs exactly the same as a Vitamix for a third of the price. Their claim didn’t entirely hold up, but the Cleanblend was far superior to the two other low-end blenders we tested. It has an extraordinarily powerful motor — 1800 watts — more powerful than the Vitamix, and excellent speed control.</p>
<p>Outwardly, compared to Vitamix, the Cleanblend looks simple. It’s very easy to operate and physically recalls a slightly squatter version of a 1970’s Waring blender. It has no pre-programmed functions and operates simply with an on/off switch. A center knob controls the speed levels and a second switch allows short controlled bursts.</p>
<p>The motor is quite heavy, but Cleanblend has further ensured the blender holds firmly in place, even at its highest speed, by adding four super-strong rubber anti-slip feet. A tamper is included, but we found it to be too short to reach more than half-way into the 64-ounce blender jar.</p>
<p>Since there is no program for crushing ice, we used the pulse switch. The Cleanblend’s pulse is a bit explosive, shooting crushed bits of ice upward like hail. It pulverized the ice in a minute, much slower than blenders with less wattage, and its consistency was granular rather than snowy.</p>
<p>Despite the propulsive nature of the ice, the Cleanblend did a beautiful job blending the fruit and green smoothies. After a couple of pulses to get the ice crushed, the speed control dial could be adjusted in small increments, gently increasing the speed from a true low to a pulverizing high. We enjoyed having an interactive role with the blender rather than just standing back and watching it do its automated thing.</p>

<p>We did need to add more liquid during the processing of both smoothies to keep the ingredients flowing. The raspberry smoothie that the Cleanblend produced had small bits of seeds. However, the kale in the green smoothie was completely liquified in 30 seconds and left behind no sediment when strained.</p>
<p>It took the Cleanblend only 30 seconds to process the tomato-basil soup (the Cleanblend does not have a function for heating the soup) and to whip the Hollandaise into a thick and creamy emulsion.</p>
<p>The blender’s only fail was the peanut butter. We began by pulsing the peanuts in short bursts, and half splattered upwards. We scraped it down and tried grinding the peanuts on low, but they constantly lodged underneath the blades. After several tedious minutes, all we got was a finely ground paste.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, Cleanblend’s <i>five-year full warranty</i> is unusual for a low-end blender. The company offers a full refund within 30 days, and for five years after that, they will repair or replace the blender. No other low-end blender has this kind of warranty.</p>
<p>Priced at $179, the Cleanblend &#8211; 2001 is slightly more expensive than the KitchenAid and Ninja. But neither performed nearly as well, and it’s still a fraction of the cost of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blendtec-D725C3216A1A-AMAZON-Designer-Blender-Stainless/dp/B01FASW6OY/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blendtec</a>, which it also out-performed. Cleanblend may not be a household name yet, but the quality of its blender and its thoughtful additions, like a flexible silicone spatula and nut-milk bag, and the company’s ace customer service are giving its competitors a run for the money.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Cleanblend &#8211; 2001’s powerful 1800-watt motor makes short work of consistently blending fruits and hearty veggies into creamy smoothies.</li>
<li>Its interactive manual speed control can be easily adjusted to gradually increase from a true low speed to a pulverizing high speed.</li>
<li>The Cleanblend’s sturdy construction and unique five year-full warranty ensure the blender’s longevity far longer than the other low-end blenders we tested.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004UJKKI4/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Waring &#8211; MX1200XTX</a> physically resembles the Cleanblend. It has two switches, on/off and pulse/variable, and a dial for adjusting speed. The blender jar has a slight tapering, so the blades’ wingspan reaches a couple of millimeters shy of the jar’s interior.</p>
<p>The variable switch is the default position (held down it engages the pulse function), and we found it took a bit of practice to adjust the dial to the right speed level. The lowest speed was a true low, a nice steady blending motion. The higher speeds (7 to 10) were actually too high, and the vortex spewed ingredients to the top of the jar.</p>
<p>The Waring gave us decent results, however. There was a bit of unground seed in the fruit smoothie, but the green smoothie had the same silky consistency of the Vitamix. The Waring doesn’t have a soup function, and we needed to blend the soup a little longer to get it from a gazpacho to a pureed consistency.</p>
<p>The close positioning of the blades, however, produced a luscious and thick Hollandaise, one of the best of our testing. We had the usual problem with the peanut butter — the peanuts were ground to a paste and lodged beneath the blades. The Waring doesn’t have a separate clean function, but it did the job at the highest speed.</p>
<p>The Waring is certainly a good blender, but the similar and cheaper Cleanblend is better.</p>

<p>As noted earlier, Breville abruptly discontinued its mid-range blender BBL620XL during our testing period, and based on Breville’s recommendation, we tested its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BBL620SIL1AUS1-Furious-Blender-Silver/dp/B07GJ24VXV/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BBL620SIL1AUS1</a> “Fresh &amp; Furious blender.&#8221; We were assured by Breville’s customer service that the Fresh &amp; Furious was a suitable substitute for the BBL620XL and had all the same features.</p>
<p>It short, it didn’t, and the Fresh &amp; Furious did not perform nearly as well. The Fresh &amp; Furious has 1300 watts, which wasn’t quite enough power to pulverize the raspberry seeds and kale. It does have two separate settings for fruit and green smoothies, and although both smoothies were well blended, they were filled with seed bits and sludgy green sediment. A second blending did not improve their consistency.</p>
<p>The Fresh &amp; Furious blender jar isn’t tapered at the bottom, and so we had the usual problems with a non-tapered jar. There is a one-half inch gap between the jar and the blades, so ingredients got stuck underneath the blades and along the sides and bottom of the jar. The Fresh &amp; Furious has an auto-clean function, but it couldn’t reach the food particles trapped along the two ridges that run the length of the blender jar.</p>
<p>The Fresh &amp; Furious has five speeds with minimal differentiation between the lowest and highest. The low speed didn’t create much of a vortex when blending the eggs for the Hollandaise, so we increased the speed to medium, and we got a decent sauce.</p>
<p>The Fresh &amp; Furious achieved a smooth, creamy peanut butter after eight minutes on the highest speed. As a precaution to prevent motor burn-out, the high speed automatically shuts off after two minutes, a feature we found annoying.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BBL620SIL1AUS1-Furious-Blender-Silver/dp/B07GJ24VXV/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BBL620AIL1AUS1</a> is certainly well made, and it’s a good all-around moderately priced blender. But if you’re looking for a low-end blender for making smoothies on a daily basis, we recommend the slightly less expensive Cleanblend instead.</p>

<p>For such an expensive high-performance blender, we were surprised at how poorly Vitamix’s main competitor fared. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blendtec-D725C3216A1A-AMAZON-Designer-Blender-Stainless/dp/B01FASW6OY/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blendtec  &#8211; D725C321A1A</a>’s control panel is entirely LCD touch screen, including speed control, which needs to be swiped left or right. Each function has a cute little icon, and every time you blend something, a message — such as “Ta-Da!&#8221; or “You should tweet this blend&#8221; — flashes. Without doubt, we were charmed by these amusing techno touches, but it proved to be a case of style over substance.</p>
<p>Two design flaws impacted the Blendtec’s performance: its blade and its pre-programmed functions. The blade is flat with two prongs each with two “arms&#8221; abouta one-half inch tall. The jar has almost no tapering, so there is a half-inch gap between the blade arms and the inside of the jar. There is a one-inch gap between the arms and the corners of the jar.</p>
<p>Consequently, the blade could not reach and process the raspberry seeds, nor could it pulverize the apple skin and core. In both tests, the smoothies were grainy and not pleasant to drink. We had the same problem with the peanut butter and Hollandaise. The blade chopped and spun the nuts into a paste that got stuck beneath the blade, and the egg and butter splattered and never emulsified.</p>
<p>In all cases, the timing of the pre-programmed functions was too short, the briefest being the soup function at three minutes, which gave us a decently blended but lukewarm soup. Of course, it could be argued that you can achieve the same results as Vitamix if you used the manual function. We tried, and it didn’t. But since the Blendtec is as expensive as Vitamix, its pre-programmed functions should work the same.</p>
<p>This particular model of Blendtec comes with a mini jar for single servings, which worked better since the jar is about a third of the width and kept the ingredients closely contained.</p>
<p>Like Vitamix, there are a number of Blendtec models, and they might perform as well as Vitamix. But the model we tested, the Designer 725, did not live up to the Blendtec reputation.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Countertop-1100-Watt-Smoothies-BL660/dp/B00939FV8K/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ninja &#8211; BL660</a> has three blades affixed to a spindle that fits into the bottom of the jar. After many complaints of injuries from the previous model, Ninja redesigned the spindle so it could be removed for easier and safer cleaning. (We will note that despite our efforts to stay clear of these razor blades, we got nicked twice.)</p>
<p>The largest blade is set in the center of the spindle with the two smaller blades positioned below. Presumably, this design allows the blender to crush ice at the top and distribute it to the lower blades for finer processing. The Ninja did crush the ice to a powdery texture and the smoothies had a slushy consistency.</p>
<p>With both smoothies, the fruit and vegetables were crushed at the blender’s initial burst, but they were not pulverized enough. Each had sediment and a crunchy feel on the tongue. The soup ingredients were well-blended, but again, there was substantial substance to the soup, like a finely chopped salsa. It was pleasantly palatable but not smooth. Blitzing the smoothies and soup additional time did not further process them.</p>
<p>The tiny blade at the bottom of the spindle could barely whip the egg for the Hollandaise, and it couldn’t distribute the ground peanuts upward to the wider blade, neither of which emulsified.</p>
<p>Two single serving blending cups are included, one with a traditional, removable four-pronged blade. A single-serving function is separate from the three speed levels. It’s basically a pulse function that needs to be pressed until the ingredients are processed. The resulting smoothie had a better consistency and was easier to use than the main blender.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CXKTNDU/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KSB1575CU</a> Diamond Blender had the lowest wattage of any blender we tested. At only 550 watts, the Diamond Blender’s motor clearly struggled in all of our tests. Not only did it take longer to blend ingredients, but it also didn’t have enough power to pulverize them to the smooth consistency we achieved with the Cleanblend. Raspberry seeds were left whole, and the green smoothie had a sludgy sediment.</p>
<p>The KitchenAid has five speeds, but we found that the lowest wasn’t a true low and splattered the egg and butter to the top of the blender jar and out the pour spout. The highest speed finely chopped the peanuts, but it didn’t have enough speed to convert them to butter.</p>
<p>The power switch is a big problem, because there’s no indication that it’s on or off. Several times during our testing, we thought the power was off, but when we picked up the blender jar, the blades spun and we barely avoided injury.</p>
<p>The KitchenAid we tested is the company’s recent upgrade of its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/KitchenAid-KSB1570SL-5-Speed-56-Ounce-BPA-Free/dp/B00DBQ1AIG/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KSB1570</a> blender, but it did not perform better than Cleanblend or the Ninja.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The type of blender you might consider purchasing is linked to your lifestyle and diet. The eight blenders that we tested ran the gamut from occasional blending (a couple of times a month) to frequent blending (twice or more a week) to daily use.</p>
<p>Many people think spending $50 for a blender is too much, and if they’re just using it for whipping up frozen margaritas on Cinco de Mayo, they’re probably right.  In most cases the old adage “you get what you pay for&#8221; applies to blenders. A powerful motor — 1500 watts — doesn’t come cheap, but our testing showed that it takes more than a strong motor to make a good blender. The shape of the blender jar and the blade position in the jar are equally important.</p>
<p>We chose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X3N9O58/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; CBT-2000</a> as the best overall, mid-range blender for making smoothies on a frequent basis. Its five programmed functions and precise manual control make this blender exceptionally easy to use.</p>
<p>At a whopping $600, our high-end pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-A3500-Programmable-Connectivity-Professional-Grade/dp/B075713NNL/?tag-ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vitamix &#8211; A3500</a>, pulverizes virtually anything edible into silky smoothies and creamy soups in minutes. Even if you used it several times a day, the Vitamix &#8211; A3500 is built to last for years, and its 10-year warranty is the best you’ll find anywhere.</p>
<p>Our low-end choice, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0094B94BM/?tag=ybdblender-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cleanblend &#8211; 2001</a>, doesn’t have programmed functions and is manually controlled, but its powerful 1800-watt motor liquifies fruits, vegetables and seeds nearly as well as Vitamix. It’s a great, affordable blender for frequent or everyday use.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We filled, drained, cleaned, and tried to break 13 travel mugs over multiple weeks to find the CamelBak Forge to be the best travel mug that performed well in all the tests.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e&#8217;ve been using, cleaning and trying to destroy travel mugs over three years of testing. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a> is the best travel mug for maximum heat retention and easy clean-up. It also proved nearly invulnerable to the drop tests we put it through. If you&#8217;re looking for easy sipping without the risk of spills, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160LEYFY/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo &#8211; Auto-Seal Transit</a> is also a great pick, though it&#8217;s not very easy to clean.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected" class="collapse">How we selected mugs to test</h2>
<p>Our testers have used travel mugs daily for many years and while engaged in activities ranging from truck driving to theatrical stage management, so they had some long-standing demands and expectations. We sorted through countless published professional and consumer reviews and dove into enthusiast discussion boards to find our finalists. We’ve especially kept an eye out for online buzz about flaws and weaknesses, which we’ve tested for and noted. Value is an important consideration for items like this, and we’ve included mugs that ranged in price from $16 to $30 at the time we ordered them.</p>
<p>After our old top pick from Camelbak was discontinued, we started looking for replacements. The Burnout promised to solve all our problems with heat-retention tradeoffs, so we added it to the list. We&#8217;re watching for a new auto-seal design that&#8217;s as easy to clean as the Camelbak, but we haven&#8217;t found it yet.</p>

<h2 id="features-to-look-for" class="collapse">Features to look for</h2>
<p>There are a handful of usability factors that make the difference between your go-to travel mug companion and a dud you’d rather just leave at home. We’ve found the most important factors to be the following:</p>
<p><strong>Leak and spill protection:</strong> You should be able to use a travel mug without fear of spills on your lap or in your backpack.</p>
<p><strong>Ease of opening:</strong> If you want to enjoy a hot beverage while driving, one-handed operation is as much a safety feature as a convenience.</p>
<p><strong>Mess avoidance:</strong> All spouts and lids will collect some liquid while you’re drinking (flip-open lids tend to be the worst in this regard), so in our usability table we’ve rated how safe they are around white silk shirts.</p>
<p><strong>Ease of cleaning:</strong> Nobody wants to use a mug they can’t get clean.</p>
<p><strong>Heat retention:</strong> Hot drinks like your coffee or tea should stay pleasantly hot.</p>
<p><strong>Cup holder/single-brewer compatible:</strong> For those looking for compatibility with a single-cup coffee brewer, we’ve noted which mugs are seven inches or shorter (typical height for a single-cup brewer when the drip tray is removed; your machine may vary), and whether a “shorty” model (usually in 12 oz capacity) is available.</p>
<p><strong>Durability:</strong> Drops happen. A winning travel mug can survive the accidental fall from the top of your car as you absentmindedly back down the driveway on a hectic Monday morning.</p>
<h3>Notes for tea and pour-over brewing</h3>
<p>If you want a built-in loose-leaf-infuser option: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZI5XNO/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VG761C/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stanley</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HYOGTTG/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zojirushi</a> all sell tea-steeping versions of the mugs we tested here (or snap-in accessories) that might help you out, but we’ve been happy with the convenience of drop-in or basket infusers.</p>
<p>Both loose-leaf tea drinkers and pour-over coffee geeks should note mouth-width before they buy: we found the necks of the Klean Kanteen, Thermos Direct Drink and Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 were too small to take any but the narrowest tea infusers; the Hario V60 pour-over coffee brewer just fits the mouth of the Thermos.</p>
<h3>Why are they all stainless steel?</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5461" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors.jpg" alt="stainless steel cup interiors" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Most heat from your mug (once you put a lid on it) is lost through conduction, and the material that conducts the least is nothing at all — hard vacuum. Keeping a vacuum inside the wall of a mug requires a material that’s stiff and strong: steel is stiff, strong, easy to work, and economical. Most of the steel mugs tested specify “18/8 grade” steel or SAE/AISI “304 Stainless”, which contains approximately 18% chromium and 8% nickel. 304 is one of the most widely used alloys in the world (for everything from cookware to the DeLorean to the Gateway Arch) because of its versatility and stain resistance, so there’s a good chance the mugs that don’t specify an alloy are using it or something very similar.</p>
<p>In a strong bath of citric acid, 304 will release slightly more chromium than other alloys do, but for beverage use 304 stainless is as inert as any other stainless alloy, and none of us tasted any unusual metallic flavors in these mugs (even after we left hot orange juice in our top picks for a few hours). If you’re sensitive to trace amounts of nickel or chrome and you drink extra-acidic tea or coffee, consider the Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 (which was nearly our favorite and is “non-stick” lined).</p>
<p>It’s probably worth noting here: all these manufacturers specify that they use BPA-free plastics.</p>
<h3>Non-steel mugs</h3>

<p>We included one non-steel mug in our lineup, the Ello &#8211; Mesa double-wall ceramic mug. We looked at other popular ‘reusable to-go cup’ designs, but none of them had spill-proof lids or insulating properties that would make them competitive in this line-up. (Some issues, like reports of a smelly latex rubber lid on one popular brand, or lids that were difficult to snap on, made our choice not to test even easier.)</p>
<p>The Mesa does keep your drink hot three times longer than a conventional open-top single-wall ceramic mug (an hour above 140°F instead of 15 minutes), but the sliding closure on the lid did not prevent spills.</p>
<p>While some manufacturers of the stainless steel mugs say you can put them in the dishwasher, the microwave is territory held securely by mugs like the Mesa: we microwaved water to a piping-hot 186°F and were happy to find that the outside of the mug was only a pleasantly-warm 93°F, unlike some ceramic mugs that get insanely hot on the outside when nuked.</p>
<p>So, if you are simply looking for slightly better insulation in a ceramic tumbler that can go in the microwave and the dishwasher, the Mesa is worth considering; if you want to stop spills and keep your drink hot for a long commute, read on.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested" class="collapse">How we tested</h2>
<p>Well on our way to developing permanent caffeine dependence after our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-french-press/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">French Press</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-single-cup-coffee-maker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Single-Cup Coffee Maker</a> reviews, we indulged another caffeine binge as we filled, drained, cleaned and tried to break 13 travel mugs for multiple weeks.</p>
<h3>Leak test</h3>

<p>The ability to put a travel mug in your bag without fear of making book-and-computer soup separates the best of the travel mugs from the rest. It’s easy to say “this lid locks in the closed position so it won’t leak!” but some locks are easy to defeat accidentally (Contigo West Loop, we’re looking at you). To say without equivocation that the best mugs won’t leak, we put all the mugs in a duffle bag that spent half an hour inside an industrial dryer.</p>
<p>The mugs were filled, dried carefully, weighed, wrapped in a towel and sealed in an individual bag. Then the seals on each mug were double-checked by shaking (all passed) and dropping them before we put them in the dryer. We started the spin-cycle, checked once at ten minutes, then again at the 30-minute mark. All leaks were clearly visible, and we weighed the mugs again after taking them out of their bags to see how much water had leaked out.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HYOGTTG/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48</a>, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a>, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H4LUMUA/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klean Kanteen</a> leaked nothing in the half-hour they were tossed around inside the dryer. The Forge, without any lock or back-up mechanism to keep the seal from opening, only let out a single drop that we could see on its towel-wrap at the ten minute mark, and we didn’t see any more evidence of leaks at the end (nor could we measure the amount of water that had escaped.)</p>
<h3>Spill test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5464" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test.jpg" alt="ceramic Ello in a spill test" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Another important duty of a travel mug is stopping spills. Some of our testers have worked in locations where only spill-proof mugs are allowed, and far too many of us have experienced the tragic consequences of using unworthy mugs in moving vehicles or at desks covered with important documents.</p>
<p>We simulated a desk-spill by filling each mug halfway with a measured amount of water, then tipping it on its side (spout down). After 15 seconds, we picked up the mug and re-checked the amount of water to determine how much water spilled. We wanted to be sure we were simulating a real-world spill: a lid or seal you can manually close might be great for throwing in a bag, but the spills that matter are the ones that happen while the lid/lock isn’t closed. (Note: we tested the Ello &#8211; Mesa both opened and closed. It spilled so much while it was supposed to be “sealed” we included that number on the chart.)</p>
<p>The self-sealing mugs practically cheat on the spill test, and that’s why we like them. Of the mugs that spilled nothing when knocked over, also note that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EPGMZZS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Forge</a> has a lid design which prevents it from rolling off your desk.</p>
<h3>Clean-up test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5506 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results.png" alt="cleaning test results chart" width="900" height="942" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results.png 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-610x638.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-768x804.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-287x300.png 287w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-295x309.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-885x926.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-360x377.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-375x393.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-414x433.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cleaning-test-results-320x335.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Keeping a mug clean is one of those tasks that makes the difference between “buy it for life” and trashing an expensive mug in disgust. Our rating here is based on hand-washing with a sponge, scrubber or bottle-brush, but we’ve also noted if the manufacturer says you can put the whole mug in the dishwasher.</p>
<p>We tested how easy it is to effectively field-clean the mugs with a method similar to systems used by metallurgists looking for cracks in airframes: a (non-toxic, water-based) fluorescent paint was poured into the mugs and then out through the drinking spout. Next, the mugs were filled with soapy water, agitated, drained through the spout, and rinsed in the same way.</p>
<p>While the paint came out in our simple rinse procedure without any obvious dribbles or droplets remaining in most cases (there was a tiny drop left inside the Klean Kanteen’s three-piece seal), we did spot some residue left behind on all the mugs under a UV inspection light.</p>

<p>The Contigo Autoseal system is great for convenient spill-free sipping, but its springs and levers are immersed in your pumpkin-spice foam and nutmeg sprinkles.</p>
<p>The hinged-lid Thermos and Zojirushi mugs are pretty easy to clean, with the Thermos Direct Drink taking an edge here because of a vent design that&#8217;s a hole rather than a tube.</p>
<p><strong>Some notes on dishwasher compatibility</strong></p>
<p>All of the lids for these mugs (with the exception, inexplicably, of the OXO Good Grips) are guaranteed safe for top-rack dishwasher cleaning. Some also guarantee that the body of the mug will be okay on the top rack, but only if it’s an unpainted stainless steel body — a mark against the Auto-Seal Transit’s silicone grip design. Stanley and Bubba are both willing to back up their mugs in dishwasher use despite paint and plastic accessories; the hammertone paint looks OK, but the plastic rings on the Bubba seem destined to trap dishwater over time.</p>
<p>While we wouldn&#8217;t recommend daily dishwashing of these mugs (the extreme heat expands and contracts the steel along the seams that keep the vacuum in, which is why many manufacturers say it voids their warranty). If you want to be able to throw it in the top rack every once in awhile for a deep-cleaning, though, it&#8217;s encouraging to know that a company has your back even if the vacuum fails after ten or twenty years.</p>
<h3>Heat retention test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5465" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners.jpg" alt="top four heat test winners" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-300x200.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/heat-test-winners-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We ran two tests to measure how well these mugs retain heat. The first test gives a broad overview of mug performance when starting with water at typical restaurant serving temperature; the second test shows how our favorite mugs performed when starting with a lower temperature.</p>
<p><strong>High-temperature heat retention</strong></p>
<p>In the first test we poured very hot water (it was a lot of pouring, so starting temperature varied, but we’ve normalized the differences to show loss from a 185°F starting temperature) into all the mugs and checked the temperature after an hour. Results are in the main table above.</p>
<p>We found that all of the mugs, even the air-insulated Ello &#8211; Mesa, will keep your Starbucks coffee hot enough to be ‘drinkable’ after sitting around for an hour. Not only that, <strong>two of the mugs we tested kept beverages hot enough to burn you</strong>. We want to point out that this kind of test obscures some basic usability complaints that are frequently made in comments about award-winning mugs: they keep boiling-hot coffee so hot that you may need to take extra steps in order to drink it. Some mug-owners on Reddit suggest ice cubes — no, that’s not a joke, <em>ice cubes</em> — to get your fresh cup of hot coffee or tea down to a drinkable temperature.</p>

<p>The Redditors were absolutely right: when we made tea with freshly-boiled water in either of the top two insulation performers (the Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 or the Thermos Direct Drink Insulated Bottle) we found that it won’t be cool enough for most people to drink (below 155°F) until an hour later, even if you leave the lid off completely.</p>
<p>Mugs like these are great if you want to keep drinks hotter for longer. Just be sure you cool your coffee or tea before adding to the mug, or pour out your beverage to drink until temperatures inside the mug have reached a safe level.</p>
<p>Studies show that the severity of burns start getting significantly worse at temperatures above 175°F, so temperature curves between 200°F and 175°F aren’t showing anything but a danger zone. A study published in the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2002.tb08814.x/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Journal of Food Science</em></a> shows that most people will mix cream/milk (or colder coffee) into their hot coffee to bring it down to around 140°F if they’re going to drink it immediately. Further, the Specialty Coffee Association of America cupping and tasting protocols recommend that evaluation of flavor should not begin until coffee has cooled to between 160 &#8211; 140°F.</p>

<p>With that in mind, our second test used water heated to only 167°F. We filled five mugs: three top-ranked in our first heat test, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EPGMZZS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CamelBak &#8211; Forge</a>, and a heavy, 18 oz-capacity open-top ceramic mug as a control.</p>
<p>After 30 minutes, 50ml of water was decanted from each mug into a 100 ml pyrex beaker every 15 minutes. With a bench thermometer and K-type probe, we took eight samples from each mug, leaving a slightly larger sample at the end. This controls for the way most of us drink away the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water#Heat_capacity_and_heats_of_vaporization_and_fusion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specific heat capacity</a> of the water in our travel mugs if we sip periodically over the course of a commute or while working at a desk.</p>
<p>The best and worst performance in this test still correspond roughly to what we saw the first test we ran, but it does show that even in this less-generous scenario the Forge can keep coffee in the “comfortably hot” zone all the way up to two hours, though it’s 15°F cooler than the Thermos. That’s longer than any of us likes to keep the same mug of coffee around, so we’re more than satisfied. (Any insulated mug is also far, far better than a ceramic open-top mug, which lost the same amount of heat in less than 20 minutes.)</p>

<p>Other than falling off a desk, the most likely accident a mug will endure is falling off the roof of a car or truck. We subjected the mugs to a battery of drop tests to give a real-world worst-case assessment of what will happen when you forget which pocket your keys are in and set your mug on the car’s roof “just for a second.”</p>
<p>We included a drop onto a padded surface in our leak test earlier, and all of the mugs escaped that without damage (most didn&#8217;t even leak).</p>

<p>In the first part of our (more destructive) drop test, nearly all the mugs also survived falling from desk height onto concrete with only some road rash. The exception is the the Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48, which cracked badly enough that the lock is only barely holding together.</p>
<p>We carried on dropping the mugs from higher and still higher heights, eliminating mugs that were too broken to be usable. The eight-foot drop cracked five of the remaining eleven mugs. After the ten-foot drop, one more (the Thermos Direct Drink) was eliminated. We’ve separated those mugs still working into “indestructibles” which look the same as they did after the first drop, and “juggernauts” which still do their jobs perfectly, but bear cracks or other deformation beyond scuffs or scrapes. The Forge, for example, shows obvious signs of fracture on one arm of the carabiner loop — it doesn’t flex or bend, though, and the seal mechanism functions as before.</p>

<p>Two of the mugs we tested kept heat inside so well, they actually made it difficult to test what we considered “normal” use because we had to dump extra cold half-and-half or ice cubes in so that we could drink from them without suffering burns. Make no mistake, this almost-magical feat is surely appreciated by those who want to drink a hot cup of home-brewed coffee eight hours after they pour it.</p>
<p>We’ve picked the The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a> (sometimes called Direct Drink) bottle as our favourite for that kind of use, since it was slightly easier for us to clean and it didn’t rattle around in our cupholders as much as the skinny Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 did. Bloomberg called this &#8220;the best mug for heat freaks” and we concur with that assessment: this mug stayed 15°F hotter than lesser mugs even when we were pouring the heat away in our 165-minute “sipping test.”</p>

<p>The Thermos performed flawlessly in our leak test, sealing its lid tight and locking with a back-up mechanism. It doesn’t seal itself every time you set it down, the way our top pick does, so you have to either close the top every time you sip or invite spills — but if you do knock it over with the lid open, it won’t spill as much as most of the other mugs we tested.</p>
<p>The Thermos &#8211; Sipp started developing a crack in the eight-foot fall. While that’s not nearly as durable as the CamelBak &#8211; Forge, the Thermos is much tougher than the other best-insulating mug, the Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 (which probably won’t close anymore if you drop it onto concrete). The Thermos is also entirely dishwasher-safe and easy to hand-wash, and has a handy loop on the back of the lid that makes it easy to carry around.</p>
<p>Note: This is one of the more confusingly-named products we researched — it’s sometimes called things like “Sipp Stainless Insulated Drink Bottle” and is nearly identical to the “Commuter Bottle.” Whatever the name, we liked it.</p>

Contigo is now one of the most prolific brands in the travel mug market, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160LEYFY/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Auto-Seal Transit</a> is the best model in their line.</p>
<p>Auto-sealing mugs like the transit are perfect for use at your desk, around fussy librarians or while driving. It&#8217;s basically impossible to spill anything from this mug while you&#8217;re drinking from it, and the spout prevents drips from gathering the way they will in flip-top designs.</p>
<p>Contigo mugs represent what really has become the baseline for travel mug functionality: To beat Contigo at their own game, a mug must be easy to drink from with one hand while still preventing spills, must be easier to clean, stay hot for longer, and take more abuse. The now-discontinued Camelbak &#8211; Forge was the only model that was better overall (still losing in heat retention), while the Thermos &#8211; Sipp has much better heat retention but doesn&#8217;t stop spills.</p>
<p>The Transit survived our ten-foot drop test with only a superficial crack in the easily-removed spout-cover. That cover is an interesting perk; a quick turn covers up the drinking spout to keep dirt out. It&#8217;s a nice perk that doesn&#8217;t get in the way when you don&#8217;t need it.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160LEYFY/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Safe Sipping: Contigo - Transit</h3><p>A great mug from a trusted brand that's highly durable and spill resistant. A great choice if you don't mind sacrificing heat performance and if you're OK with hand-washing.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160LEYFY/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Auto-Seal mechanism is unmatched at stopping knock-down spills, but the Transit gave up a teaspoon worth of liquid in our 30-minute tumble test. That&#8217;s a good result, but not as good as the bank-vault seal on the Thermos &#8211; Sipp. If you want to stash a mug in your bag this is not a bad pick, but we wouldn&#8217;t take it on an all-day trip with a full load of coffee inside a backpack.</p>
<p>In our temperature test, the Transit only lost 34°F of heat in the first hour, while the base-model Contigo &#8211; West Loop lost 40, so the minimal price difference is far less significant than the performance gap. That&#8217;s still a major difference from the Thermos and Zojirushi mugs, which lost less than half as much heat in the same time. The Transit&#8217;s result is in line with other good wide-mouth mugs that you can fit a sponge into, but it&#8217;s not amazing.</p>
<p>One failing of Contigo&#8217;s design is the seal mechanism: it&#8217;s a pain to clean. If you have a dishwasher or only drink clear tea, you&#8217;ll probably never have a problem with this, but you&#8217;ll still want to double-check that nothing gets stuck in the springs and levers inside this lid. The Transit&#8217;s lid is the only part you should put in the dishwasher, but the body isn&#8217;t difficult to hand wash.</p>
<p>On the whole, this is a great mug with a long heritage of good design. The price is right at about $15, and if you ever need to drink your coffee in a place where spills would be a disaster this is an excellent choice.</p>

<li>The Contigo &#8211; Auto-Seal Transit is easy to use for one-hand-sipping without leaving you vulnerable to spills.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re looking for an affordable mug that won&#8217;t break quickly, the Transit is very good on both counts.</li>
<li>Clean-up is the only weakness in this design: The springs that seal the spout are immersed in your drink, and can&#8217;t be removed for washing.</li>
<li>For secure carry in a bag the Transit was better than most, but it did leak a teaspoon worth after half an hour in a spin-cycle.</li>

<p>From a startup company founded by rocket scientists, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DJS1LHN/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Burnout termperature regulating travel mug</a> is one of the few new products that&#8217;s trying something different. We bought this mug for our 2019 update.</p>
<p>Burnout pulls the heat out of your drink in the first minute after you pour. This neat trick is accomplished with a layer of wax that&#8217;s inside the mug&#8217;s stainless steel walls. Once the wax melts, it&#8217;ll help keep all of that heat inside the vacuum-insulated chamber, even as you drink your favorite hot beverage away.</p>
<div id="visualizer-19338-369741530" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-19338"></div>
<p>The problem with the heat-sucking material inside the Burnout is that it&#8217;s too good at its job.  If the mug starts at around room temperature, hot coffee (at just below an ideal brewing temperature of 190-200°F) will cool to 140 in fifteen minutes. If you like warm coffee instead of hot coffee, that&#8217;s probably ideal.</p>
<p>You can get a bump in heat if you take the time to boil some extra water and dump that in the Burnout for a few minutes before you add your beverage. (Pre-heating with 110°F tap water does basically nothing.)  Boiling extra water isn&#8217;t such an inconvenience for pour-over, french press and tea drinkers, but it&#8217;s a big hassle if you&#8217;re relying on a coffeemaker like <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-keurig/">our favorite Keurig</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, pre-heating with boiling water also cancels out the safety goal of this mug, since the temperature is still at a scalding 172 after thirty minutes and takes two hours to hit our preferred 155. Yes, you can pre-heat for a shorter time and add milk to fine-tune the temperature, but you can do the same with our top heat-retention pick, the Thermos &#8211; Sipp, by adding an ice cube when you pour your coffee.</p>
<p>Even if a hot-ish 135°F sound perfect to you, the biggest problem with the Burnout is the lid. This design uses an internal stopper that seals a sippy-cup spout (very much like the Contigo Autoseal designs) but with a sliding, locking toggle switch instead of a push-to-drink system. This means you don&#8217;t get automatic sealing when you stop drinking, but it&#8217;s still difficult to clean out all of the springs and levers on the inside. It can also spit out drips when you close it.</p>
<p>Worse still, even when the stopper is in the closed position, it leaks. It&#8217;ll keep dribbles from coming out if you turn it upside down, but as soon as you drop it on the floor or shake it around it&#8217;ll let drips out. The slider switch is fairly easy to use, but it&#8217;s also vulnerable to getting bumped open inside a bag; this mug did poorly in our tumble test.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s the price. If you&#8217;ve been waiting and waiting for a travel mug that would give four-hour warmth without burning your tongue, maybe $100 doesn&#8217;t sound like a lot. Compared to our other mugs, though, that&#8217;s a pretty crazy price.</p>
<p>We love the idea of this mug, but the concept just hasn&#8217;t been executed well enough to justify this price tag. If it were dishwasher safe and had a bomb-proof seal like the Thermos, maybe the price tag and fiddly work required to plan a perfect pre-heat routine would be worth it.</p>
<h3>Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 and YAE48</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5469 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles.jpg" alt="two Zojirushi travel mugs" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/two-zojirushi-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HYOGTTG/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48</a> has received so many accolades from reviewers, it’s hard to imagine a review that excludes it. This mug is the state of the art in vacuum insulation performance from a company with a long history of designing great food and drink containers. That said, the diminutive SA48 was so narrow and tall that it rattled around in our cupholders (and was hardest to clean inside, even with a bottle brush).</p>
<p>We also included the SA48’s sibling, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01077GFV8/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YAE48</a>, which is specifically marketed as a “Travel Mug” and seems designed to address concerns about cup holder size and the height restriction imposed by single-cup coffee machines. The wide mouth means that the YAE48 is easier to get a kitchen sponge into when cleaning, but it sacrifices insulation and leak-proof performance with that giant lid (which actually unscrewed from the body during our spin-cycle bag-leak test).</p>
<p>Neither mug is especially durable; the SA48’s lid shattered on a desk-height drop and the YAE48 wouldn’t stay closed after an eight-foot drop split it across the lock. The warranty on these mugs is also limited to insulation performance for five years, which is disappointing when the lids and locks have this many intricate parts.</p>
<h3>Contigo &#8211; Auto-Seal West Loop</h3>
<p>This is the third version of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZI5XNO/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Auto-Seal West Loop</a> design, now easier to clean than old models, and with a lock button. Sadly, the lock doesn&#8217;t prevent leaks and it&#8217;s still immersing springs in your drink.</p>
<p>The West Loop is a good mug, but the Transit is more durable and holds heat better. The only trade-off is that the Transit sacrifices dishwasher compatibility because of the silicone grip. The West Loop&#8217;s insulation is guaranteed to be safe in the dishwasher, but if you buy a painted model you can count on flaking and peeling of the finish after a few months cleaning it that way.</p>
<h3>Klean Kanteen &#8211; 16 oz. Wide-Mouth</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5470 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo.jpg" alt="Klean Kanteen mug on a white counter" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We included the winner from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/">insulated water bottle review</a>, the Klean Kanteen, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H4LUMUA/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">but in a 16 oz. size</a> to match the other mugs and with the manufacturer’s leak-proof “café cap.” (We did not include the Hydro Flask in our line-up; in our water-bottle test the 32 oz Hydro Flask didn’t insulate as well as a 20 oz Klean Kanteen, and while the flip-cap lid on the Hydro Flask is easier to use with one hand, it has all of the problems of the other drip-flip lids we tested).</p>
<p>The Klean Kanteen is still a drink container we like, but it’s not easy to open and close with one hand (and in fact took a fair bit of effort to open with two hands), and it has more parts to disassemble for cleaning than any of the other mugs.</p>
<h3>Thermos &#8211; Stainless King Travel Mug</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5471 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug.jpg" alt="solo of Thermos King stainless mug" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Thermos is the oldest and best-known name in insulated drink containers in the western world (“thermos” became such a prevalent word that US courts ruled it was legal to use as a generic term for insulated bottles in 1963). We tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DZQT0E2/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Stainless King Travel Mug</a> along with our runner-up, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a>.</p>
<p>The King is available with a handle, which may appeal to those who keep a mug in the cold and pick it up with bare hands, but we found that a trigger-action mug like our top pick was even better since we could carry it and take drinks from it even with gloves on. The twist-action closure on the Stainless King wasn’t really designed to open and close with one hand, and requires disassembly if you want to put it in the dishwasher.</p>
<h3>Stanley &#8211; Classic</h3>
<p>We’ve included this self-sealing mug, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VG761C/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stanley &#8211; Classic</a>, which only comes in their retro-lunchbox-style “hammertone” finish, as the only painted mug guaranteed dishwasher safe; the paint does seem thick and durable, and we haven&#8217;t seen reports of it chipping or peeling the way the Contigo paint does. The functionality is generally good, but it wasn’t even as leak-proof as the Contigo mugs were. The spring on the trigger-button of this mug was also much, much stronger than the other self-sealing designs, which was a big turn-off for some testers (and didn’t keep it from leaking at all). The design also had more parts to keep track of than the other self-sealing mechanisms.</p>
<h3>Bubba &#8211; Hero Elite</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0186EP0JW/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bubba</a> was included because it has the highest price to consumer rating ratio of any of the mugs we found, and the ceramic liner is a unique feature. While on the whole this mug seems a decent value, that liner didn’t prove to be an asset in any way we could find, and the way the lid collects drips and spreads them around is just annoying. The fact that the plastic ring which attaches the lid to the body just popped off in our eight-foot drop test makes us wonder how long it would take for grime and water to start collecting at that joint (even in normal use).</p>
<h3>Timolino &#8211; Icon</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0038XKF60/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Timolino &#8211; Icon</a> won top marks from <em>Cook’s Illustrated</em>, and it performed well in our cleaning and drop tests, but the drip-flip lid is a serious annoyance that was also noted by Amazon reviewers. While it didn’t break, this mug did leak around the seal every time we looked at it funny, so we wouldn’t put it anywhere near a computer bag.</p>
<h3>OXO Good Grips- SSDWTM</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-01/the-best-spill-proof-travel-mug-for-every-professional" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a> found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XF97OTI/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this OXO mug</a> quite difficult to destroy. Dropping it three times from ceiling height before giving up. We like its durability, but the push-button lid is the only one we tested that isn’t dishwasher safe, and it traps a good quantity of fluid in the spout even after it’s closed, which makes it messy to drink from.</p>
<h3>The discontinued champion: CamelBak &#8211; Forge</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5467 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge.jpg" alt="the CamelBak - Forge on a table" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><strong>Ed: the Camelbak &#8211; Forge was discontinued in 2018, and we&#8217;re sad to say that it hasn&#8217;t been replaced with an equivalent design. Our original review is preserved here for posterity.</strong><br />
The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EPGMZZS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CamelBak &#8211; Forge</a> is as smart as it is tough. The mechanism for opening and sealing the spout whenever you pull the “trigger” is simple and effective, and the Forge practically turns itself inside out for you when you need to clean it. (Even replacing the o-ring for the seal would be trivial.)</p>
<p>The Forge keeps your drink hot for a very long time; not as long as some of the mugs we tested, but well within the expected performance of a vacuum-insulated travel mug with a wide-mouth opening. Mugs with narrower openings (like our runner-up pick below) will keep the heat for longer, but that makes them harder to clean and fill.</p>
<p>In our leak test, the Forge did leave evidence that it had let out a single drop when we checked at 10 minutes into the half-hour spin-cycle test; no further leaks were found at the end of the test, and the amount lost didn’t register on our electronic kitchen scale.</p>
<p>The Forge doesn’t have a way to lock out its trigger the way Contigo’s latest designs do, but CamelBak has shaped a loop at the back of the lid that totally protects the trigger from basically anything other than your finger. It’s possible that some object of the right shape could press on it in just the right circumstances, but on the spin-cycle leak test the Forge was far more effective than the other self-sealing mugs (even the ones with locks).</p>
<p>What’s more, the loop is a convenient way to clip the Forge onto a backpack, bike bag, or just to hook a finger through, and it also prevents it from rolling if it’s knocked over. (That means it won’t just stop you from spilling coffee: it’ll also save you from that embarrassing conversation where you have to ask your coworkers if they’ve seen a mug rolling around on the floor.)</p>

<p>CamelBak has catered to the outdoor enthusiast crowd for decades, and has a great reputation for warranty work and customer service. They guarantee this mug for life against defects in the workmanship or materials, which doesn’t strictly cover things like worn rubber o-rings or driving over it with a cement truck, but when we looked for comments on repair services we found that CamelBak is often very generous.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line" class="collapse">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Caffeine keeps us alert, awake, and energized. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160LEYFY/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo &#8211; Transit</a> ensures that it will also go into your mouth, not onto your lap or computer. The easy-to-sip-from self-sealing design make it a clear winner for most uses, though it doesn&#8217;t have the best heat retention.</p>
<p>If you like your drinks at tongue-scalding temperatures, consider the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a>, which keeps boiling water too hot to drink for an hour, even with the lid off. The Thermos is also easier to clean than most mugs. It will spill if you knock it over with the lid flipped up, but when it’s locked you can rest assured it won’t come open in your bag.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We tested 22 different bottles over several weeks in order to determine the best pick in each frequently-used category.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent several weeks subjecting 22 water bottles to rigorous testing that included washing, carrying, performing leak and stress tests — and, of course, drinking. Of our five categories, we found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004PXWG4G/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klean Kanteen &#8211; 20-Ounce Insulated</a> is the best water bottle due to its wide mouth, performance, versatility and sleek design.</p>

<p>With all the different types of water bottles — plastic, metal, glass, insulated or not — it can be confusing to pick the best one for your needs. In addition to our top pick, we’ve identified four runner-up options to give you plenty of choices to pick from, including a collapsible version.</p>
<p>Each bottle material has its own strengths, and knowing the advantages of each will help you find a bottle you&#8217;ll be happiest with. The only type of bottle to keep drinks hot <em>or</em> cold are vacuum insulated bottles. Every other type does not, and these other ones all form condensation on the outside when you put cold water inside. Check out the breakdown below for more differences:</p>
<p><a href="#best-insulated-water-bottle">Vacuum insulated bottles</a> are the best way to keep your water super cold for an entire day, or to keep beverages hot for an impressive five hours. These insulated bottles have two inner chambers, one for the water and then one surrounding that with a vacuum channel. This proves to be a very effective method for insulation, but these weigh more because of it.</p>
<p><a href="#best-glass-water-bottle">Glass water bottles</a> eliminate plastic or metal tastes and chemicals / BPAs. Being able to see how much liquid is left without having to pick up or open the bottle is a nice perk. All were covered in a silicone sleeve for drop protection (no bottles cracked or shattered in our drop tests) but glass and silicone will not insulate your water. Condensation formed on all glass and silicone surfaces even though the silicone sleeves helped improve grip.</p>
<p><a href="#best-stainless-steel-water-bottle">Stainless steel bottles</a> are an effective, low-cost option. They’re non-reactive, BPA free, and lightweight compared to glass or their insulated stainless steel counterparts. You can&#8217;t put hot water in these as directed by the manufacturers (and you&#8217;ll burn your hands). But if you just need something for short amounts of time and don’t care about insulation, it’s tough to beat the value. Some folks prefer glass to avoid the metal smell or taste, but we found no issue with tastes on these bottles at all. We also tested one aluminum bottle, which is a bit lighter but otherwise similar.</p>
<p><a href="#best-plastic-bottle">Plastic water bottles</a> are geared towards sports and workouts. Even if you&#8217;re not using it for those purposes you can still benefit from their sporty design features. Three of the bottles we tested had a flip-top lid that lets you drink using one hand, which we loved. They&#8217;re also lightweight compared to glass and insulated bottles. Every bottle we tested was made of Tritan, a material claiming to be free of BPAs, estrogenic and androgenic activity. We still found these bottles to have the strongest smell though.</p>
<p><a href="#best-collapsible-water-bottle">Collapsible water bottles</a> are perfect if you&#8217;re traveling or hiking and space is very limited. They are incredibly thin and the lightest weight option by a large margin &#8212; collapsible bottles we tested weighed eight times less than insulated bottles, and four times less than our tested plastic bottles. These do have a smell but mostly go away after a few washes.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-chose">How we chose the best bottles to test</h2>
<p>There are a lot of water bottle options out there, so we started by narrowing our list of finalists by only selecting those that fit specific criteria. There are many materials and styles these bottles are made in, so we tested five of the most popular types.</p>
<p>We searched Amazon, Reddit, forums and other water bottle reviews to find the highest quality and most popular brands of water bottles.</p>
<p>A review on Outside Online cited a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GOF6TAU/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SIGG bottle</a> that outperformed anything we’ve heard of in terms of thermoregulation, so we had to add that to the test list as well.</p>
<p>Every bottle we chose fit these criteria:</p>
<p><strong>Water capacity:</strong> It held enough water to quench thirst, but it wasn&#8217;t too big that it would be cumbersome to lug around. Many brands have larger bottles at 32 and even 64 oz capacities.</p>
<p><strong>They&#8217;re well-reviewed:</strong> Other reviews that praised bottles, and bottles on Amazon&#8217;s best-sellers list were slightly favored.</p>
<p><strong>Fewer issues with quality:</strong> Any bottles that have a higher than average history of complaints on build quality, leaking or other functional qualities were omitted.</p>
<p><strong>They&#8217;re not too specialized:</strong> We avoided bottles that were designed for very specific tasks, such as cycling.</p>
<p><strong>They&#8217;re not knockoffs:</strong> Whether it&#8217;s a knockoff or rebrand, many of these are actually the same exact bottle so we didn&#8217;t test duplicates. See more detail below.</p>
<h3>Knock-off and rebranded water bottles</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2991" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles.jpg" alt="two different rebranded bottles side by side" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/knock-off-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>If you shop for water bottles online or in many retail stores, you&#8217;ll notice many brands with products that look identical. For example, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MIRA-Insulated-Double-Vacuum-Stainless/dp/B00XK4BCZ0/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mira</a> bottle we tested seems to have the same design as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Modern-Vacuum-Insulated-Bottle/dp/B01GKGEZUI/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Simple Modern</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ICONIQ-Stainless-Vacuum-Insulated-Bottle/dp/B01BFX24XG/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ICONIQ</a>, and the popular <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Swell-Womens-Teakwood-Water-Bottle/dp/B00M00OPZ4/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">S&#8217;well</a> to name a few.</p>
<p>The popular Hydro Flask looks to have the same design as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vacuum-Insulated-Mouth-Stainless-Bottle/dp/B0181FY83K/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">321 Strong</a>, Glacier Point, and Fifty Fifty.</p>
<p>Some Redditors explained the source of the many knock-offs of popular water bottle brands out there: most knock offs are just rebrands that come out of the same factory as the originals. So we assumed their performance to be the same and avoided testing any rebranded products.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more that goes into a great water bottle than meets the eye! We put our 22 finalists through an extensive series of tests to see which would come out on top. Those tests included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thermal insulation test</li>
<li>Hot water test</li>
<li>Leak and drop test</li>
<li>Condensation test</li>
<li>Usability test</li>
</ul>
<h3>Thermal insulation test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2835" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures.jpg" alt="testing water bottle temperatures with thermometer" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/testing-temperatures-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Since drinking room-temperature water isn&#8217;t something most people prefer, we tested every bottle for its ability to keep water cold. For the bottles that were designed for it, we tested their ability to keep water hot too.</p>
<p>We tested temperatures with an <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-digital-meat-thermometer/">instant-read thermometer</a> so the bottles only needed to be opened for a short amount of time during temperature testing.</p>
<p>Just for good measure, we tested the vacuum insulated bottles as well as the uninsulated bottles with cold water: glass bottles, plastic bottles, collapsible plastic bottles and stainless steel bottles. Starting with cold, 42°F water, we let the bottles duke it out in a temperature controlled room  and measured the temperatures along the way.</p>
<p>The cold water in uninsulated bottles rose a whopping 20°F in the first hour and coasted to room temperature after just five hours.</p>
<p>Insulated bottles, on the other hand, fared much better. It took about 20 hours for all of the bottles to reach near room temperature, which is very impressive! This means you can be sipping on ice-cold water throughout the course of a normal 8 or 10-hour day using an insulated bottle.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2976 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900.png" alt="water bottle cold water test chart" width="900" height="584" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900.png 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-610x396.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-885x574.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-360x234.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-375x243.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-414x269.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-295x191.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-180x117.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/water-bottle-graph-900-320x208.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
It&#8217;s clear from the poor rank of the 10-ounce Sigg in this test that a big factor in keeping your drink cold is how much water is inside. With cold water (or ice), the more you can keep inside, the better it will stay cold.</p>
<h3>Hot water test</h3>
<p>Four of our five vacuum insulated bottles were suitable for use with hot water. We tested the Klean Kanteen, SIGG, Hydro Flask, and the Mira bottles. We added boiling water to each bottle, and adjusted water levels until each reached 196°F, then checked on them in even intervals.</p>
<p>We removed the lids and tested temperatures with the same instant-read digital thermometer we used on the cold water test. Hot water returned to room temperature much faster than the cold water did, but these bottles performed according to manufacturer promises.</p>

<h3>2018 Updates: 32oz bottle test</h3>
<div id="visualizer-18685-313219126" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-18685"></div>
In 2018 we tested our new contenders in another heat retention test. This time, we picked a standard size (32 ounces) and tested with an uninsulated stainless steel bottle as a control. Water started at a rolling boil, but by the time we pre-filled and blended the water between the bottles to get a fair comparison the average temperature was 184.</p>
<p>In this test, it was once again the narrowest-neck bottle that took top position. Unlike the narrow mouth on the Mira bottle from our first lineup, Klean Kanteen&#8217;s Classic 1.7-inch opening is wide enough to fit full-size ice cubes, but it still gives an edge in insulation performance. 160 degrees after 12 hours is toasty, even on the edge of piping hot.</p>
<p>The other standout in this test is YETI, with the heavy (and expensive) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072BVN7JB/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rambler Bottle.</a> If you want top insulation with a wide-open mouth, YETI was only four degrees lower than the Klean Kanteen after a full twelve hours, compared to more than 20 degrees difference in the other wide-mouth bottles.</p>
<h3>Leak and drop test</h3>
<p>A bottle that leaks is not much more useful than a lidless cup, so we tested each bottle for leak potential. Thankfully, none of the bottles leaked with normal use and vigorous shaking or twisting, so we decided to do some drop tests to see how they stand up to some abuse.</p>
<p>We filled each bottle to 75% capacity, then dropped it from standing position three feet from the ground on its bottom, then once again on its top, and finally we pushed it off a table about three feet tall.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, all bottles remained leakproof after being dropped. All stainless steel bottles dented to some degree, and the uninsulated steel variety dented the worst, causing them to wobble when placed on a flat surface.</p>
<p>We expected the sport bottles with seemingly fragile flip caps &#8212; like the Embrava, Under Armour and the Thermos &#8212; to break or at least leak after they were dropped, but they did not. During one drop, the Embrava&#8217;s lid actually shifted off the cap threads a bit and took some force to unscrew &#8212; yet it still remained leakproof after being put back on.</p>
<p>While dropping the glass bottles, we were bracing ourselves for shattered glass everywhere with each drop, yet no bottles ever shattered. The silicone sleeves did a good job of absorbing the drop impact.</p>
<h3>Condensation test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2836" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles.jpg" alt="condensation buildup on bottles" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/condensation-on-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Condensation forms on the outside of cold water bottles because cooler air around the bottles can&#8217;t hold as much moisture as warmer air, causing the moisture to condense. This matters because it will affect grip on the bottle, as well as potential to damage electronics you&#8217;re storing in the same bag as your water bottle if enough moisture is formed.</p>
<p>Every uninsulated bottle had condensation form on the outside of the bottle when there was cold water inside. Even the glass bottles with silicone covers had condensation form on top of the covers.</p>
<p>The amount of moisture was consistent between the bottles, but varied by day, depending on the humidity. If you plan to transport bottles with laptops or other electronics, the safest option is to use a vacuum insulated bottle or room temperature water.</p>
<h3>Usability test</h3>

<p>Each bottle went through usability testing, to see how it stood up to regular use.</p>
<p><strong>Ice:</strong> We wanted to know if it was possible to add ice and how easy it was to add water. We used standard ice cubes from a freezer&#8217;s automatic ice machine. About five of the bottles we tested didn&#8217;t have mouths wide enough for ice or for cleaning with brush. Some could only fit one at a time, while many wider mouth bottles could be filled with multiple cubes at once.</p>
<p><strong>Loops and grip:</strong> We took bottles out on trips over the course of a few weeks to test how easy each was to carry. Loops in the lid made it much easier to hold a bottle at the same time as groceries, bags or keys, whereas bottles without any loops forced you to dedicate a hand to it. Loops and clips make it easy to hang bottles from a backpack too.</p>
<p><strong>Cupholders:</strong> Larger bottles and most collapsible bottles we tested were not made to fit in cupholders. Most fit fine, but some barely made the cut. We tested the bottles in our cars for fit.</p>
<p><strong>Cleaning:</strong> Before the first use and after multiple refills, we washed each bottle by hand with a bottle brushing, hot water and dish soap. This proved fairly easy for most bottles, but a few caused problems with a spout that was too small, or just because the bottle was too long.</p>
<h2 id="best-insulated-water-bottle">Best insulated: Klean Kanteen</h2>

<p>After testing a variety of sizes over the last three years, the best insulated bottle is from Klean Kanteen, either the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Klean-Kanteen-Insulated-Stainless-20-Ounce/dp/B004PXWG4G/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">20-ounce wide mouth</a> if you need a compact bottle or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SA2XNWW/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">32 ounce classic</a> if you want to keep beverages cold or hot all day long.</p>
<h3>A smaller insulated bottle</h3>
<p>The wide mouth of the 20-ounce made it easy to fill with ice and to drink out of, and its slim design made it easy to fit in cupholders and bottle compartments in most backpacks. The wider mouth is a slight compromise in insulation, but for a smaller bottle you might not notice the difference since you&#8217;ll be refilling long before your ice is gone.</p>

This rugged Kleen Kanteen also held up well when we subjected it to our drop test.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0093ISEPI/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>The big loop lid makes it easy to carry with a few fingers or loop onto bags with a carabiner. If you don&#8217;t care for this feature, wide mouth Klean Kanteen bottles can also take the totally leakproof <a href="http://www.kleankanteen.com/products/cafe-cap?variant=19736711878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cafe Cap 2.0</a> twist-open lid. We tested this design in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/#how-we-tested" rel="noopener">travel mug review</a>. We liked it better than cheap flip-up lids, though it&#8217;s not as good as other mugs for one-hand sipping and has a lot of parts to clean.</p>
<p>This bottle fared well in our drop tests with minimal damage to both the bottom and the lid. In the insulation tests it ranked 2nd for cold water, and 3rd for hot water. One downside of any steel bottle is that the mouth gets hot to the touch after letting it bake in the car on a hot day.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SA2XNWW?th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klean Kanteen-Classic 32-ounce</a> is a great water bottle for storing and sipping ice-cold water without as many refills. The opening is about half an inch narrower than the wide mouth on Klean Kanteen&#8217;s mug-size bottles, which means it&#8217;s a little more tricky to pack with ice, but still much easier than the wine-bottle shaped MIRA and S&#8217;WELL bottles.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re filling with ice water or some other beverage, this insulation will keep it cold (or hot) for longer than any wide-mouth bottle. Klean Kanteen also sells this same bottle design with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Klean-Kanteen-Insulated-Stainless-Growler/dp/B00X6ZNOAO" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">with a clamp-down growler lid</a> for filling up at your favorite micro-brewery. (The Growler model also works with the standard lid.)</p>

<h3>Hydro Flask vs. Klean Kanteen</h3>
<p>The 32 oz. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K5ZRUZ8/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hydro Flask</a> is a strong runner-up. Hydro Flask ranked 3rd in our cold water test and 4th in the original hot water test, but they&#8217;re a very close competitor for our top pick. The loop on the cap makes it easy to pick up with one finger if your hands are full carrying other things and the grip on the cap makes it easy to open and close the lid.</p>
<p>We interviewed loyalists for each brand, and they all have glowing accounts of how great the bottles are. They also rave about how easy it was to get a replacement cap or sometimes even a free replacement bottle after a dramatic accident.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between Klean Kanteen and Hydro Flask is in the availability of different neck shapes. Hydro Flask uses wide-mouth openings for sizes from 18 to 64 ounces, with the narrower &#8220;standard&#8221; mouth is only available in 18, 21 and 14 ounce bottles. Klean Kanteen has almost the opposite selection, with their &#8220;classic&#8221; narrow-mouth design available in sizes from 12 up to 64 ounces, with wide-mouth options in 12, 16 and 20 ounces.</p>
<p>Since the narrower mouth is better at insulating while still making ice fairly easy to add, and the 32 ounce Klean Kanteen is more affordable, we think Klean Kanteen has the edge overall. If you&#8217;re carrying a bottle packed with ice for sipping cold water on a hot day, the temperature difference is going to be less important and you should feel free to buy whichever bottle has the cap and styling you prefer.</p>
<p>Both of these brands also makes a spectrum of durable powder-coat colors that should satisfy anyone, but the availability of your favorite color might change from month to month. If you can&#8217;t find the color you like in stock, it&#8217;s probably worth checking the other brand.</p>

The 25 oz. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H9F72H1/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mira bottle</a> performed best in the cold water test. It likely gets a bump in performance due to its relatively small cap design &#8212; the main area where there isn&#8217;t vacuum insulation and where external temps would seep in.</p>
<p>The smaller opening of this bottle also comes with a downside though &#8212; it&#8217;s slightly awkward to drink out of since it&#8217;s sized perfectly to hit your nose with each sip. In the hot water test, it was not a surprise that the Mira ranked second. The 25 oz. bottle we tested was a bit on the larger side for cupholders, so if you opt for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0764P6DR2/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mira&#8217;s 17 oz. bottle</a> it would be a nicer fit.</p>

We also liked its latch mechanism, but unfortunately it's intended only for cold beverages (not hot liquids).</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E6O7CAC/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>As another great option geared for sports, we liked the 24 oz. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E6O7CAC/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Under Armour bottle</a>. It ranked fourth in our cold water test, but is by no means a poor performer given its other perks. This bottle features a spring-loaded flip cap and silicone grip makes it easy for one-handed operation while running or driving. It even has a latch to ensure the bottle stays locked during transport in your backpack or gym bag. One downside is the manufacturer says this bottle can&#8217;t be used with hot water, likely because of the plastic components in the lid.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GOF6TAU/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SIGG Thermo</a> performed best of the small bottles in our first hot water test, sadly, it&#8217;s becoming difficult to track down. Specifically designed for tea drinkers, the SIGG has a built in metal filter, if you won&#8217;t ever use that feature you can remove it for hot water or coffee. You have to separate the lid by unscrewing it which is not as simple as it should be, but it is an option. We looked at the larger versions in Sigg&#8217;s Classic series, but most owners agree they&#8217;re better as a thermos (using the cup that slides over the base of the bottle) than as a bottle to drink from.</p>

<p>Our top pick for glass bottles was the Takeya Classic 22 ounce. We loved the large cap threads around the top of the bottle, which makes it easy to open and close the cap without missing the threads.</p>
<p>This bold and simple design of the cap helps prevent it from damage when dropped too. In our drop tests there was minimal cap damage, and the silicone sleeve surprisingly prevented the bottle from shattering. The sleeve design on this bottle makes it easy to see the remaining water levels too.</p>

<p>Just like the other glass bottles we tested, there&#8217;s no insulation, but there&#8217;s also no lead or chemicals and it&#8217;s completely dishwasher safe. However, this bottle&#8217;s perfectly sized for easy holding and drinking, and the silicone grip makes it even more secure if you&#8217;re using it for sports.</p>

The silicone sleeve isn't just for looks — it also helped the Ello survive our impact tests.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BUUW476/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>We ranked the 20 oz. Ello bottle in a close second place, largely due to its simplicity. It gets the job done without features that are prone to issues. Like the Takeya, it has large threads in the cap for easy opening and closing of the lid. Its large loop on the cap lets you carry the bottle with multiple fingers, distributing the weight for comfortable carrying for longer periods of time.</p>
<p>This cap design also helped spread the impact nicely in our drop test that left no noticeable damage on the bottle. Like the other glass options, we have lots of options in silicone sleeve design and color too.</p>
<p>The little drinking spout on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B9DJWTM/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Life Factory</a> bottle might be convenient to some, but there was no other hole to let air in as you drink from it, so you basically have to waterfall from the little spout to take a sip. Although this bottle didn&#8217;t leak in our tests, the mini spout cap is very prone to popping off so you don&#8217;t want to throw this into a bag that you can&#8217;t keep an eye on.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007L6953Y/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CamelBak&#8217;</a> storable straw doesn&#8217;t have issues with potential leaks because it is easily folded back when not in use. The uncentered design of the cap loop can affect the outcome of a drop depending on how it happens to be dropped, but in our testing it fared well. The CamelBak is a well-designed bottle overall that&#8217;s easy to use, but the straw makes it pretty difficult to ensure a proper cleaning, putting it further down on our list.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard for the short <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PV9Y72W/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bKr bottle</a> to go unnoticed &#8212; it looks very well designed! This one&#8217;s basically famous for being used by celebrities and being covered in magazines. When we bought it, the price was $35; this is an astounding 2-3x the cost of the other glass options. The slanted cap made screwing the cap on particularly difficult, and the small spout makes it impossible to fit any ice or a bottle brush. The bKr bottle is definitely a design-centric purchase if you&#8217;re willing to put up with its issues and price tag.</p>
<h2 id="best-stainless-steel-water-bottle">Best Stainless Steel: Klean Kanteen &#8211; Classic</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3081 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen.jpg" alt="best stainless steel bottle" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/best-stainless-bottle-klean-kanteen-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The Klean Kanteen was an easy #1 pick out of the three finalists. The mouth was much bigger, easier to fill with ice and water and more pleasant to drink from. It also had a cap with bigger threads to more easily open and close the bottle.</p>
<p>Its lid was the best of the steel bottles we tested, but a bit squeaky sounding and not as smooth in opening and closing as the insulated or glass bottles. For those who want options, this brand has many cap options you can buy separately, like a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0083F0TQ4/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">sport cap</a> or a sippy cap.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079911D89/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kleankanteen-ss-CTA.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Stainless Steel: Kleen Kanteen - Classic</h3><p>Large cap threads, a mid-size and a polished design make the Kleen Kanteen - Classic a pleasure to drink from. This bottle also uses high-quality materials that make it seem more polished than our other contenders.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079911D89/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>You also can&#8217;t really appreciate the importance of the bottle&#8217;s mouth size until you&#8217;re trying to aim it under your fridge&#8217;s water dispenser. Klean Kanteen sells a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F3JJDBA/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">version of this bottle with a mouth that&#8217;s even wider</a>, but the classic is noticeably wider than the other two bottles we tested. It&#8217;s easy to sip from, but still easy for adding ice, too. All three stainless steel bottles are very basic products and similar in concept, but the Klean Kanteen is built with better materials and feels like a more polished product, making it our clear winner in this category.</p>
<h3>The other metal bottles we tested</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3119" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles.jpg" alt="two other stainless steel bottles we tested" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-stainless-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The bottom of all of these bottles were dented in our drop test, which caused a few to wobble on the table. However, all remained leakproof afterwards. None of these were made to insulate liquids, and all had condensation running down the outside. These are a good cheap route to go if you just need to keep water cold for shorts amount of time.</p>
<p>The aluminum <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006PTIVTW/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SIGG</a> bottle is lightweight, but it has a tiny cap and threads. This made for a slightly clumsy opening and closing, and was the only bottle in this category that couldn&#8217;t fit ice in the mouth unless it was crushed. The aluminum dented slightly on the bottom in our drop test but still sat perfectly flat on a table. Even though it can&#8217;t fit ice, this bottle felt a little more polished than the Cheeki bottle.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BYGAAUE/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cheeki</a> was the largest stainless steel bottle we tested, perhaps contributing to the amount it was dented in our drop test. This bottle was noticeably uneven and even wobbled on the table after this test. Its mouth was large enough to fit ice cubes in, but the usage of the flip top lid is a bit awkward because of its small size and poor design. In terms of quality of materials, this bottle was easily the worst when you examine the cap material, design, and loop material.</p>
<h2 id="best-plastic-bottle">Best plastic: Thermos &#8211; Intak</h2>

<p>We loved the Thermos &#8211; Intak, ranking it our top plastic water bottle. The flip top lid and single-handed use were pretty big factors that helped set this model apart. It&#8217;s tough to beat that convenience.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This bottle&#8217;s the only one that has a textured design built into the bottle to help improve grip &#8212; great for when you&#8217;re using this for sports since this bottle builds up condensation with cold water inside. </span></p>

<p>Although all of the plastic bottles we used had markings to measure liquids on the side, the Thermos has a unique ring built into the cap ranging from 1-5 so you can track how many times you&#8217;ve refilled or used the bottle throughout the day.</p>

<p>We loved the look of the plastic CamelBak bottle and it proved to be very durable and leakproof. The spout has a cap that locks into the lid, which is a bit difficult to snap in each time, but it works to keep it out of the way. This bottle features a loop that keeps the lid attached to the bottle when you remove the lid for refilling too, something not present on the Embrava or Contigo or Thermos.</p>
<p>Although the the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B011LC85PM/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Embrava</a> and the Contigo also had single-handed operation, the Embrava was slightly on the small side, with six ounces less capacity than the top ranking Thermos. Embrava&#8217;s next size up is a whopping 32 ounce bottle, which is a bit on the large side. However, we appreciated the spout&#8217;s added air vent in the cap for easier drinking. The flip cap was surprisingly strong in our drop test too. If you prefer a slightly smaller bottle than the Thermos and can get past Embrava&#8217;s design aesthetics, this was a close runner up.</p>
<p>Both the CamelBak and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NCDE8Y/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Nalgene</a> had large threads for an easy opening lid and a wide mouth for cleaning and adding ice. However, the Nalgene had pretty bad plastic smell, even after a few washes. It looks like many other owners of this bottle had this issue too, although many reported no smells. Perhaps they vary by bottle or manufacturing batch, but this factor, combined with a very cheap looking lid, pushed this bottle further down our list.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A74ZU18/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo Autoseal</a> has a unique button you hold on the back to open the drinking spout. This bottle was leakproof when the button isn&#8217;t held, but it&#8217;s far too easy for that button to be pressed when thrown into a bag. Having to put your mouth on the bottle proved to be a little weird, and almost like a toddler&#8217;s sippy cup, but it has an air valve so you can drink without having to waterfall.</p>
<p>These bottles are not for hot beverages. If you&#8217;re looking for a hot beverage bottle take a look at our vacuum insulated stainless steel pick above. All five bottles we tested were made of the copolyester, Tritan, which is a trademark of Eastman Chemical Company. This material is popular because it&#8217;s impact resistant, free of BPAs, as well as estrogenic and androgenic activity. However,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> every bottle we tested, including the collapsible plastic bottles, were made from BPA-free plastic.</span></p>

<p>Our top pick was the Vapur &#8211; Element bottle. This bottle has a flip-top cap for easy access, but it also closes securely with an audible click and will not pop off accidentally in your bag. The Vapur and the Tap were the only two we tested with mouths wide enough for ice cubes and for a brush to fit inside for thorough cleaning.</p>

It's durable and made with quality materials. We also like its vibrant color options.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007UU6JI0/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>This was a 0.7L model, and you can get the most of that capacity by first blowing up the bag to expand it before adding water. Materials and construction on this bottle are excellent and should last for many years of use. In addition, it&#8217;s light weight and easily folded, which makes it great for taking on runs, hikes, or stowing away into luggage or carryons when traveling.</p>
<h3>The other collapsible water bottles we tested</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3121" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles.jpg" alt="three other collapsible bottles we tested" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-180x119.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/other-collapsible-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Our second pick for collapsible bottles was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B575B96/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Tap</a>, which was sold in a pack of two. Like the Vapur, it has high quality construction and has a wide mouth for ice cubes and for cleaning with a bottle brush. Cleaning is much harder without a wide mouth since it wouldn&#8217;t clean well in a dishwasher. This bottle has a carabiner for convenience, but is only pushed to second place because lack of a convenient spout when compared to the Vapur.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012H5QDYW/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aquabod</a> is a unique bottle since you can roll it up, secure it, then stash in your gym bag or backpack until you&#8217;re ready to use it. It&#8217;s also the only collapsible one we tested made of silicone. The bottle has a neat spout designed to limit how much water comes out, but both the cap and the carabiner felt cheap compared to the others.</p>
<p>Although all these bottles have some flop to them when you drink, the Aquabod was extra floppy since there&#8217;s less structure to it, forcing you to use two hands to drink most of the time. The flop also makes it difficult (but not impossible) to put this bottle into a backpack&#8217;s bottle pocket, making clipping with the carabiner the way to go.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t need a carabiner, you might appreciate the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0076ZSR3Y/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Platypu</a>&#8216; more utilitarian design, and slim center for easier handling. Its mouth was too small for ice or a cleaning brush, so you might have to boil it or do lots of manual shaking to get it clean. The only reason to go with a Platypus is to utilize the push-pull cap option they have. For us, we would rather just go with the Tap bottle with a carabiner and wider mouth.</p>
<p>All bottles had a slight smell &#8212; plastic or otherwise, before the first wash. You might have to wash it a few times or soak it in vinegar and water to get rid of most of the smell and taste. If you&#8217;re very sensitive to smells, you may want to consider another bottle material altogether.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">The bottom line</h2>
<p>What better way to stay hydrated throughout the day and your workouts than by bringing along a bottle? There are so many <em>types</em> of water bottles and seemingly endless varieties within those that it helps to narrow down your search first.</p>
<p>We found it best to start your search by thinking about what you&#8217;ll be using the bottle for most.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ll be stowing a bottle in a bag which may contain electronics or other moisture-sensitive items you want to keep away from condensation, a vacuum insulated bottle is the best option for you. Specifically our top pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004PXWG4G/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klean Kanteen</a>. This is the only type of bottle suitable for hot beverages. This bottle is also our overall top pick too, because of its wide mouth design and easy usability and maintenance. This brand also has some well-loved lid options to fit your needs like the new <a href="http://www.kleankanteen.com/collections/accessories/products/cafe-cap?variant=19736711878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cafe Cap 2.0</a>, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0093IKZGY/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Flip D-Ring</a> lid.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re on the move or prefer something lighter, something made of plastic might be the best fit for you. For extreme portability at the cost of some utility, our top pick for collapsible bottles was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007UU6JI0/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vapur Element</a>. If you&#8217;re just hitting the gym or just want something lightweight and convenient to use at your desk, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002VJX4C4/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos Intak</a>.</p>
<p>Although all the plastic bottles we tested were BPA-free, some still had an odd smell. If you&#8217;re particularly sensitive to that kind of thing and don&#8217;t care about insulation, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EAIW5MY/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klean Kanteen &#8211; Classic stainless steel bottle</a> is a good option for you, thanks to its wider-than-normal mouth and easy-to-use loop cap.</p>
<p>And if you don&#8217;t mind a little weight and like the clear look and vibrant designs that come with glass bottles, then we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003DTLNY2/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Takeya Classic</a>. Glass is totally safe for the dishwasher, and is void of any smells or concerns about chemicals and tastes we have with the other bottles. Even if you&#8217;re a bit of a klutz, our tests showed these all are capable of surviving a few drops.</p>
