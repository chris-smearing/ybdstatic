								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>riginally used by therapists as a tool to soothe patients, weighted blankets have gone mainstream, used at home by the masses to calm anxiety and help insomnia. We bought four highly acclaimed weighted blankets to test, sleeping under each of them for multiple nights to judge their levels of comfort, breathability and soothing effect.</p>
<p>The best weighted blanket overall is the chemical-free <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N442PLC/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baloo &#8211; Weighted Blanket</a>, a luxurious, durable weighted duvet that felt cocoon-like yet breathable. With its cucumber-cool bamboo viscose outer shell, we felt cozy and comfortably cool all night under the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C193MKM/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YnM &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket</a>, making it our choice for the best cooling weighted blanket.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs a weighted blanket?</h2>
<p>One <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7b52/514a1b040f0b631168d98cfa9730cfc5a9dd.pdf" target="_blank" rel="&quot;noopener">study</a> that tracked the effects of weighted blankets on 30 participants aged 20 to 66 with chronic insomnia reported that the additional pressure from weighted blankets had a calming effect on the subjects. This, along with the secure “cocooned” feeling of being wrapped in a weighted blanket, decreased their muscle movement during sleep, resulting in better overall sleep quality.</p>
<p>Other <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20662681" target="_blank" rel="&quot;noopener">research</a> shows that weighted blankets shortens the time it takes for kids with ADHD to fall asleep, and also reduce middle-of-the-night wakeful periods. Weighted blankets have also been recommended for those on the autism spectrum and to help cope with anxiety, depression, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, sleepwalking and restless sleep in general.</p>
<p>The elderly and those with claustrophobia, breathing or circulation problems should consult with a health professional before using a weighted blanket. They are also not recommended for children under eight years old.</p>
<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>We first conducted an extensive online search to find which blankets had received high praise from trusted review sites, bloggers, YouTube reviewers and Reddit commenters. Since a weighted blanket can be a hefty investment, we wanted those in our testing lineup to be priced under $175 with good return policies, and also highly rated on Amazon.</p>
<p>Even though our review includes a separate category for the best cooling weighted blanket, we encountered so much online discussion about breathability that we decided to make it a key metric for all the blankets we tested. We also took note of other features that seemed to be especially important to buyers: whether the blanket is machine washable, comes with a duvet cover, etc.</p>
<p>Although the most well-known weighted blanket is arguably the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BNBFY52/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gravity Blanket</a> — the first weighted blanket brought to the mass market, via a 2017 Kickstarter campaign — we chose not to include it in our trials due to its weighty $249 price tag. (Affordability was a recurring theme in discussions online; we even came across Reddit threads discussing DIY weighted blanket projects.)</p>
<p>Instead, we selected the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N442PLC/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baloo &#8211; Weighted Blanket</a> — more reasonably priced (relatively) at about $149 — as a contender for the best weighted blanket overall. Known for its luxurious, long-lasting quality, breathability and excellent customer service, the Baloo brand promised to be worth the investment. For this category we also picked the Quility &#8211; Premium Adult Weighted Blanket, an Amazon customer favorite with a 4.8-star rating and nearly 9,000 reviews that comes with a fleece duvet.</p>
<p>For the best cooling weighted blanket category, the Zonli &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C193MKM/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YnM &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket</a> stood out as worthy contestants. Both made of breathable bamboo viscose, the blankets  received rave reviews from hot sleepers who were initially wary of feeling stifled under weighted blankets.</p>

[table id=309 /]
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Weight</h3>
<p>For adults, manufacturers generally recommend choosing a weighted blanket that’s about 10 percent of your body weight, give or take a few pounds. For children and those with mobility issues, the 10 percent rule still applies, but err on the side of a lighter blanket rather than a heavier one.</p>
<h3>Size</h3>
<p>Normally, the size of a blanket should match the size of your bed (i.e. a twin blanket for a twin bed, king for king, etc.). But because weighted blankets are heavy, if any excess material falls over the end or sides of the bed, it will either weigh too heavy on the sleeper, or drag the rest of the blanket onto the floor.</p>
<p>Weighted blankets are usually sized to keep this from happening; for example, if you buy a queen-size blanket, it should only reach the edges of a queen bed’s surface without any overhang. However, it’s a good idea to check the actual measurements of the blanket before ordering one.</p>
<h3>Glass beads vs. plastic pellets</h3>
<p>The weights inside a weighted blanket will come in one of two forms: glass microbeads or small plastic pellets. The only real difference between the two is that the glass beads are tiny and sand-like, whereas plastic pellets are a bit larger and less weighty. This means a glass-bead blanket will be thinner than a plastic-pellet one.</p>
<h3>Washability</h3>
<p>There will come a point when your weighted blanket will need a wash. Although many weighted blankets are advertised as machine washable,  the manufacturer will often recommend spot cleaning instead. In light of this (and because weighted blankets are so cumbersome), we urge you to buy a duvet cover for your blanket, which will allow you to wash the blanket itself as little as possible.</p>
<h2 id="how-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Our testers slept under each of the weighted blankets in our lineup for three nights, then rated them using the following metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>How well did you sleep under this blanket?</li>
<li>How comfortable and soothed did you feel?</li>
<li>Did you feel uncomfortably warm during the night?</li>
<li>How would you rate the feeling of the blanket’s exterior shell?</li>
<li>How well is the weight distributed throughout the blanket?</li>
<li>How would you rate the quality of the blanket’s construction?</li>
<li>How would you rate the aesthetic look of the blanket?</li>
<li>How easy is this blanket to wash/dry/care for?</li>
<li>Does the blanket come with a duvet cover?</li>
<li>Is this blanket worth the price?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Baloo</h2>

<p>Our top pick for best weighted blanket overall is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N442PLC/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baloo &#8211; Weighted Blanket</a>. Made with premium, chemical-free cotton and lead-free glass microbeads dispersed amongst polyester fill, the Baloo was luxurious and cozy to sleep under. It was also quite breathable; we didn’t feel too warm once throughout the testing period.</p>
<p>Right down to the ribbon-tied welcome note inside its blanket box, Baloo is all about the details, even offering three free downloadable tracks of soothing meditative music to fall asleep to. While the fill weights in many weighted blankets are contained by a grid of squares alone, the Baloo blanket features unique double-quilted stitching, creating channels of piping that run between the squares as well. This means more support for the heavy glass beads inside, as well as more evenly distributed weight throughout the blanket.</p>
<p>Baloo is a green company, meaning their blankets contain zero harmful chemicals and are certified vegan. The blankets also machine washable in cold water on the gentle cycle, and can be dried in the dryer on low heat. As far as return policies go, Baloo’s is one of the more lenient that we came across, encouraging customers to take some time to get used to the weight of the blanket. You have 30 days to initiate a return, as long as the blanket is sent back in its original condition.</p>

<p>Out of the four blankets we tested, the Baloo offers the least sizing and weight options; only two sizes (twin and queen) and three weights (12, 15 and 20 pounds) are available. The blanket also only comes in one color — Pebble White — and doesn’t include a duvet cover, though the company does sell them separately. Although the blanket itself is well-designed and has the look of a high-end duvet, we recommend protecting it with a cover so you won’t have to go to the trouble of washing it often.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Baloo &#8211; Weighted Blanket feels luxe and cocoon-like, without sacrificing breathability.</li>
<li>The blanket is certified vegan and contains no harmful chemicals.</li>
<li>With double-quilted stitching, the Baloo is well-constructed to distribute weight evenly and prevent seam breaks.</li>
<li>This blanket only comes in twin and queen sizes, offers 12, 15 and 20-pound options and doesn’t include a duvet cover.</li>
</ul>

<p>With a 300-thread-count bamboo viscose shell that’s cool to the touch, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C193MKM/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YnM &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket</a> gets our vote for the best cooling weighted blanket. Though certainly not light and airy, the blanket didn’t feel too dense, and we remained well-ventilated throughout the night. However, if you’re a hot sleeper, keep in mind that this is the only blanket you’ll need on your bed.</p>
<p>We were impressed with the YnM blanket’s construction, which is designed to prevent seam breaks and tearing. Underneath the bamboo outer layer, there’s an extra layer of cotton fabric to better contain the thin, breathable layer of polyfill and lead-free glass beads inside. The stitching is also clearly strong and high quality. Although the blanket is technically machine washable (on the delicate cycle), YnM recommends spot cleaning the blanket instead.</p>
<p>What really sold us on the YnM blanket was its three-year free mending guarantee. If any unexpected damage should come to your blanket within three years of purchase, YnM will repair it for you (though you will need to pay for shipping). They also offer a 30-day return policy on their blankets, as long as they are sent back with the original packaging.</p>

<p>The blanket itself does not come with a duvet cover, but YnM sells a variety of reasonably priced covers in three fabrics — cotton, bamboo and “minky” fleece — which come in tasteful solid colors and surprisingly chic patterns. If you need more warmth when the seasons change, the fleece duvet would be a great addition to take the cooling blanket from summer to winter use.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The YnM &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket’s high-thread-count bamboo viscose outer layer is silky soft and cool to the touch.</li>
<li>The blanket features high-quality stitching and construction that will stand the test of time.</li>
<li>YnM offers an unbeatable three-year mending guarantee on their weighted blanket (though customers must pay shipping).</li>
<li>No duvet cover is included.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="others">Other weighted blankets we tested</h2>
<p>Although the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DLHD2RX/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Quility &#8211; Premium Adult Weighted Blanket</a> was cozy to sleep under with well-distributed weight, we grew uncomfortably warm during the night under its minky duvet cover, which seems to only be usable in cold climates during the winter. Without the cover, the blanket’s cotton outer layer felt a bit rough against our skin, and was quite plain compared to its <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N442PLC/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baloo</a> competitor.</p>
<p>Like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C193MKM/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YnM</a> blanket, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075W9VSW7/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zonli &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket</a> remained comfortably cool during the night, but the company’s return policy concerned us — Zonli offers no refunds on used blankets, only those that are returned unopened in their original packaging. Since high prices showed up as a top concern for weighted blanket buyers online, this bumped the Zonli down to second place in our cooling weighted blanket category.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>With weighted blankets now being marketed to the masses to help improve sleep and soothe anxiety and depression, they’re worth a try — as long as they include a good return policy.</p>
<p>Made of breathable, chemical-free cotton and featuring strong double-quilted stitching and a generous 30-day return policy, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N442PLC/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baloo &#8211; Weighted Blanket</a> is a great choice for anyone in the market for a high-quality, luxurious weighted blanket.</p>
<p>For those who sleep hot, we recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C193MKM/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YnM &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket</a>, made with silky, cooling 300-thread-count bamboo viscose and featuring durable construction and a three-year mending guarantee.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ver the past several weeks, we researched, snoozed and snored our way through seven finalists to determine that the best pillow for neck pain is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0S6LBD/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coop Home Goods &#8211; Eden</a>. This gel-infused shredded memory foam pillow offers down-like comfort and had our testers waking up the next morning refreshed and pain-free.

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We began by reading up on causes of neck pain and the importance of sleep in general. Next, we explored pillow recommendations from a variety of blogs and articles written by sleep experts. We took into account our previous experience with pillows in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-pillow-for-side-sleepers/">review of the best pillow for side sleepers</a>. We also investigated pillow ratings and user reviews from major retailers like Amazon, Bed Bath and Beyond, Target and Walmart.</p>
<p>While keeping in mind that choosing the right pillow involves a certain amount of personal preference, we ultimately selected seven pillows noted for their ability to provide strong cervical spine support and therefore prevent and/or resolve neck pain. (The cervical spine refers to the seven vertebrae that form the neck.) Our selections are primarily designed for side and back sleepers —  side and back are usually the best sleeping positions for reducing neck pain — and represent a range of materials and price points.</p>

<h2 id="causes">What causes neck pain?</h2>
<p>Neck pain can be the result of <a href="https://www.spine-health.com/conditions/neck-pain/neck-pain-causes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a variety of causes</a>, but the most common one is injury. Neck strains and sprains can be caused by sports, repetitive motions, poor posture (particularly from time spent at the computer or looking down at a phone), whiplash or sleeping in the wrong position.</p>
<p>Age is another factor that can contribute to neck pain as joints become worn out over time. Certain diseases that we are more prone to in our elder years, like arthritis or cancer, can also be contributing factors.</p>
<p>Other causes include stress and anxiety, being overweight or obese and, unfortunately, lack of sleep.</p>
<p>Your favored sleep position also plays an important role. Of the three common sleep positions — back, side and stomach — back or side sleeping are most recommended to avoid neck pain.</p>
<p>Stomach sleeping is not advised because this position requires the head and neck to twist to the side, which places pressure on delicate nerves. Changing your sleep position to either your back or side, while challenging for habitual stomach sleepers, may help resolve chronic neck pain issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spine-health.com/wellness/sleep/pillows-neck-pain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spine Health</a> advises that sleeping with the right type of pillow for your sleeping position can help your neck pain. Sleep experts recommend choosing one that contours to the shape of your head and neck. Pillows that are malleable and/or adjustable can be helpful to achieve the desired contour. <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/say-good-night-to-neck-pain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard Health</a> advises that you avoid pillows which are too high or too stiff.</p>
<p>Back sleepers are usually better off with thinner pillows and side sleepers with something thicker — but the right pillow thickness also depends on the width of your shoulders, size of your head and firmness of your mattress.</p>
<p>Pillows are made from a wide variety of materials, including feathers, down, down alternatives, memory foam, latex, gel fibers and polyester. Pillows that maintain their loft and don’t collapse under the weight of your head are recommended to help alleviate neck pain.</p>
<p>Be sure to contact your doctor if neck pain is severe, lasts for several days without relief, spreads down arms or legs, or is accompanied by headache, numbness, weakness or tingling.</p>
<h2 id="health">How sleep affects your health</h2>
<p>Sleep, of course, impacts your overall health. Lack of sleep can negatively affect your physical health by causing weakened immunity, increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, weight gain and — we now know — neck pain. Cognitively, poor sleep can result in problems with concentration and memory. Emotionally, not getting enough sleep often leads to irritability, anxiety and even depression.</p>
<p>Tips for better sleep:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adults should aim for at least seven hours each night.</li>
<li>Always go to bed and get up around the same time.</li>
<li>Exercise regularly.</li>
<li>Avoid caffeine, alcohol, sugar, extra water and large meals before bed.</li>
<li>Manage stress.</li>
<li>Be wary of daylight-tinted blue light, especially from electronic screens. Read more about light and sleep in our review of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-night-light/">the best night lights</a>.</li>
<li>Keep your bedroom cool.</li>

<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Support</b> When it comes to addressing neck pain, your pillow’s primary job is to place your neck into a neutral position and hold it there while you sleep. Whether this support comes from contoured memory foam or a customizable water base, be sure that your pillow properly aligns your head, neck, shoulders and spine — in whatever your preferred sleeping position may be.</p>
<p><b>Adjustable loft</b> It is becoming increasingly common for pillow manufacturers to offer customization options that allow the user to add or remove filling at home. In some cases, pillow customization requires sending it back to the manufacturer. Water based pillows use varying amounts of water to adjust the pillow’s overall firmness and height.</p>
<p><b>Firmness/softness:</b> We recommend you choose a pillow that is firm enough to provide enough neck support, but soft enough that you enjoy the feeling of laying down to sleep. After all, you will (hopefully!) spend at least seven hours a night with your pillow. See “Materials” section below for more info.</p>
<p><b>Size:</b> Common sizes are standard, queen and king, which correspond to the size of the similarly named mattresses. Sheet sets often include pillowcases for corresponding pillows. Your preference will likely be affected by your own size, the size of your bed and how much you move around at night.</p>
<h3>Materials:</h3>
<p><b>Filling: </b>Some common pillow fills are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feathers and down &#8211; This fill is, warm, malleable, and breathable— but provides little neck support.</li>
<li>Memory foam &#8211; This man-made material will mold and contour around the head and neck. It offers good support and is durable. Memory foam retains heat and can have an unpleasant scent.</li>
<li>Shredded memory foam &#8211; Like standard memory foam pillows, these pillows are supportive and durable. They are also more moldable to contour around the head and neck.</li>
<li>Polyester gel fibers &#8211; A gel pillow is not actually filled with any liquid-like substance. Instead, the gel is infused into solid polyester fibers. The resulting fibers feel similar to down, but offer more support. This material is often used for its cooling properties.</li>
<li>Microfiber &#8211; This used to be the primary filling for pillows, but memory foam and latex pillows are now more popular since they tend to offer better support. Polyester is one common type of microfiber.</li>
<li>Latex &#8211; This material is breathable, soft to the touch and springs back quickly. It does not hold its loft as well as memory foam products do.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Covers: </b>A range of both natural and synthetic materials are used to cover pillows, including cotton, polyester and blends. Products derived from bamboo are popular recently and offer a soft, silky feel.</p>
<p>Consider whether the pillow cover is removable and machine-washable.</p>
<p><b>Allergies: </b>Many of the products we tested were hypoallergenic. Pillows containing materials like feathers or latex may cause issues for some sensitive individuals. People who are prone to dust allergies might also want to consider removable covers or machine-washable pillows for ease of laundering when making their decision.</p>
<p><b>Trial period: </b>Many pillow manufacturers offer trial periods. Some of these periods are advertised for as long as a year, but be sure to read the fine print. In some cases, the manufacturer only honors the trial period if you buy directly from them. Amazon typically offers a 30-day return policy.</p>
<h2 id="how-tested">How we tested</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pillow-testing.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Before testing, we unpacked our seven finalists and followed individual product instructions to prepare each pillow. Several came vacuum-compressed and needed time in the dryer to fluff up. The two water pillows required adding a measured amount of water via funnel and removing remaining air pockets. Others were ready to use right out of the box.</p>
<p>Next, we recruited three product testers to sleep with each of the pillows over a three week period On a scale of one to 10, they rated overall comfort levels each morning, and ranked pillow preferences based on how well they supported the neck region. All of our pillow testers identified as alternating between side and back sleeping positions and have experienced intermittent neck pain.</p>
<p>Finally, we closely inspected each pillow to assess its loft, overall support, lumpiness, thickness, softness, contour shape and any other features that caught our attention. We also explored customization options and overall ease of care.</p>

<p>All of our pillow testers agree that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0S6LBD/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coop Home Goods &#8211; Eden</a> is the best pillow for neck pain. This cross-cut, gel-infused memory foam and microfiber pillow is luxuriously comfortable, customizable and — most importantly — cradles your head and neck perfectly so that you remain pain-free and get a good night’s sleep. (Not surprisingly, Coop Home Goods was also picked as <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-pillow-for-side-sleepers/">the best pillow for side sleeping</a>!)</p>
<p>The opulent experience begins when the Eden arrives on your doorstep. It comes beautifully packaged in a custom box, with a slogan announcing “A pillow as unique as you are.&#8221; As instructed, we prepared our pillow by placing it in the dryer on low for 10 minutes. Although there was a very slight off-gassing odor from the foam when we first received the product, this dissipated quickly.</p>
<p>The pillow comes complete with an extra bag of filling, which was a nice touch for anyone desiring additional support. Coop Home Goods suggests that side sleepers try the pillow as-is before adding foam. Back sleepers are encouraged to remove about a quarter of the foam from their pillow, and stomach sleepers to remove a third of the foam. Free customization assistance is also offered via a phone support line. Our testers felt that the Eden came with the right amount of filling right out of the box.</p>
<p>The filling is made from a combination of 80-percent visco-elastic foam (memory foam) with infused gel beads and 20-percent polyester fiber, which sounds sort of goopy, but in actuality feels very soft and down-like. The combination of foam and fibers is designed to prevent clumping and promote airflow, which keeps you both cool and comfortable. This particular foam is cross cut into very small pieces, which also helped avoid lumps.</p>

This pillow provides excellent support for sore necks.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0S6LBD/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The soft outer cover has gusseted edges, which help distribute the filling evenly regardless of your sleeping position. You can opt to sleep directly on this cover or use a traditional pillow case on top. It is made from polyester and viscose (derived from bamboo) and is nicely breathable and soft to the touch. The pillow has a zippered polyester inner cover which holds the filling when washing the outer cover.</p>
<p>The pillow feels heavy and firmer than a traditional poly-fill or down pillow, but it is still soft enough to welcome you to bed. We liked that the Eden was more fluffy than runners-up from Nature’s Guest or Perform Pillow without compromising neck support.</p>
<p>The best thing about the Eden was how well it held its loft under the pressure of one’s head and neck. We were pleasantly surprised by how such a cuddly, cloudlike pillow could also provide such strong support to keep our heads, necks and spines in alignment throughout the night.</p>
<p>To maintain the pillow, instructions state to place it in the dryer on low for 10 minutes every six months. Both the pillow and cover are machine-washable, but the agitation isn&#8217;t good for the foam.</p>
<p>This product is made in the USA. The manufacturer offers a 100-night trial, satisfaction guarantee and a 5-year warranty.</p>

<p>Like the Coop Home Goods &#8211; Eden, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075312Y9Y/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Perform Pillow &#8211; CSP-03 Memory Foam</a> Neck Pillow managed to be both soft and welcoming while also supporting the neck in all the right places. While not technically customizable, this contoured memory foam pillow can be used in one of four positions to adjust to different sized individuals and/or a variety of sleeping positions.</p>
<p>This pillow offers a very different sleeping experience than Coop Home Goods. Unlike our shredded memory foam winner, Perform Pillow’s single piece of foam can’t be manipulated and shaped around your bumps and curves; instead, you need to rely on its pre-formed shape. We tried the medium profile option though it also comes in thick or thin variations. While we found the contours worked well for us, some people may find that it takes a little getting used to.</p>
<p>The product states that it can take up to 2 weeks for your neck to fully adjust. Our testers were pleased to enjoy comfortable, sound sleep from the first use.</p>

<p>Made from Certi-PUR certified polyurethane foam, Perform Pillow comes ready-to-use right out of the box. Unlike some of the other foam pillows tested, it didn’t put off any unpleasant odor. Both long sides of the pillow have a different shaped contour, so you can choose which way you place it for the best fit. Alternatively, you can turn the pillow upside down and use either edge for two more positioning options. Two of our testers preferred using the contoured side up, with the higher shaped contoured edge supporting the neck; the other preferred the lower contour shape.</p>
<p>Perform’s soft and removable zippered cover is made from Kool-Flow, a bamboo-and-polyester fabric with a &#8220;micro-vented&#8221; texture. The cover is machine-washable in cold water and can be dried with low heat. If you choose to use the pillow in the inverted position, we recommend replacing the outer cover with a standard pillow case, since the zipper runs along the middle of the back side and would be uncomfortable to sleep on.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Perform Pillow &#8211; CSP-03 Memory Foam Neck Pillow provides contoured support to prevent and alleviate neck pain.</li>
<li>The pre-molded foam design can be placed in a variety of positions for personal comfort.</li>
<li>Its’ bamboo-derived cover is soft, eco-friendly and washable.</li>
<li>Perform sells medium, thick or thin variations.</li>

<p>Like the Perform Pillow, this contoured, microfiber-filled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IWM6056/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nature&#8217;s Guest &#8211; Support Pillow</a> takes some getting used to, but is well worth any adjustment period for the excellent cervical support it offers. Unlike the Perform or Eden, the unique shape allows for a specific sweet spot in the middle of the pillow that gives Nature’s Guest a particularly high-level of support.</p>
<p>This unusually shaped pillow — which boasts a patent-pending doctor-recommended design — provides the perfect resting place for your weary neck and helps maintain proper head, neck and spinal alignment while you sleep. Nature’s Guest is notably heavier and firmer than our other finalists and as a result, we weren’t expecting to find it particularly comfortable. We were wrong!</p>
<p>We found this pillow particularly beneficial for sleepers who move around a lot, such as when shifting from a side to back position. We liked that we could rest our head either in the center indented portion of the pillow, or along one of the higher, outer edges. This gave some flexibility through the night as sleeping positions shifted.</p>

<p>The pillow arrives vacuum-packed. You can opt to either fluff it by hand or place in the dryer for five minutes to inflate to normal size. The Nature’s Guest, which uses polyester fill, can then be customized by either removing some filling or putting extra inside. Like Coop Home Goods, Nature&#8217;s Guest ships their pillow with a bag of extra filling so there’s no need to send it back for customization.</p>
<p>The cotton cover is satin-trimmed with gusseted sides, which are particularly helpful for side sleeper support.  Zippered openings on both ends make customization simple.</p>
<p>Perhaps our biggest complaint is that this pillow requires hand washing. A customer satisfaction guarantee allows returns within 30 days for a full refund, no questions asked.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Nature’s Guest &#8211; Support Pillow has a uniquely shaped, contoured design that provides excellent cervical support.</li>
<li>Although heavy and firm, the well-designed shape allows for an extremely comfortable night’s rest.</li>

<h3>Chiroflow &#8211; Water Pillow</h3>
<p>We were excited to try out the concept of an adjustable water pillow with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AHDIHSC/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chiroflow</a>. The experience was somewhat different than anticipated. While we found the pillow reasonably supportive of the head and neck, we didn’t have any obvious sensation of sleeping on water — other than a nagging fear that the pillow would leak in the middle of the night and we’d wake up in a puddle. (Don’t worry, that didn’t actually happen!)</p>
<p>The water bladder was located beneath a comfortably soft, thick layer of polyester fill and provided adjustable firmness. The water lent a hefty weight to the pillow, which helped keep it in place through the night.</p>
<p>We did notice a vague shifting sensation of the water redistributing when we moved around, but because it was below the padded layer, this sensation didn’t resemble anything like sleeping on a waterbed. So if you are prone to seasickness, don’t worry, we don’t think using this pillow will be a problem.</p>
<p>Initially customizing Chiroflow was a challenge. The detailed instructions recommended adding varying amounts of water based on your preferred sleeping position. A small plastic funnel is provided to assist this process and pouring in the water was simple. You can add any amount you like — the more water added, the firmer the pillow. Exact measurement recommendations are provided.</p>
<p>The challenging part was removing the remaining air pocket, which involved squeezing air out of the water bladder while simultaneously capping the opening and (hopefully) not getting water everywhere. If you don’t successfully remove the entire air pocket, you can hear (and feel) the water sloshing around, which interferes with a good night’s rest. Preparing the pillow properly required an extra set of hands.</p>
<p>Chiroflow, along with Mediflow — the other water pillow manufacturer whose pillow we tested — were the only finalists that proved their designs in clinical testing. An independent clinical study by Johns Hopkins ranked Mediflow &#8220;best&#8221; for how quickly subjects fell asleep, how few times subjects woke up, their perception of sleep compared to normal, overall quality of sleep and reduction of neck pain.</p>
<p>While Chiroflow wasn’t our top choice pillow for neck pain, the combination of comfortable fill and a responsive, supportive, adjustable water base make it a good option for neck support. Also, the entire pillow can be machine-washed and dried and comes with a 30-day satisfaction guarantee.</p>
<h3>Mediflow &#8211; Waterbase Pillow</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003J372NS/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mediflow &#8211; Waterbase Pillow</a> is almost indistinguishable from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AHDIHSC/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chiroflow &#8211; Water Pillow</a>. The only difference involves the material of the outer cover. Mediflow’s is made from 100-percent cotton as opposed to Chiroflow’s 65-percent polyester and 35-percent cotton.</p>
<p>Overall, we ranked the Chiroflow slightly higher than the Mediflow for its noticeably softer cover. Both pillows are the exact same design, involve the same customization set up and provide equally effective neck support.</p>
<h3>Snuggle-Pedic &#8211; Kool-Flow</h3>
<p>We don’t recommend purchasing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PBFP0S6/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Snuggle-Pedic &#8211; Kool-Flow</a> to avoid or alleviate neck pain. This pillow was too tall and stiff for comfortable neck support in any sleeping position. Instead, it placed the neck at an uncomfortable angle that resulted in all three of our testers abandoning it in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>We tried the queen size, though there are also king and standard size options.</p>
<p>Snuggle-Pedic is made from shredded polyurethane foam. Although it held its loft well, there was simply too much of it to sleep on comfortably and there is no zippered access to remove the excess. Beyond that, it felt lumpy and had a strong, unpleasant, chemical-like smell. The smell did not entirely dissipate even after airing out for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>The micro-vented cover, made from bamboo viscose, polyester and lycra, was soft and breathable — but not removable. This is a plus for anyone who wants to avoid zippers, but a negative for anyone who wants the ability to wash the cover solo. You can opt to wash the entire pillow in cold water either by hand or via machine with minimum agitation, then squeeze out excess water and dry with high heat.</p>
<p>Although the product states you can gather and reshape the pillow to allow it to contour to your head and neck, we did not find this to be the case. No matter how we tried to reshape it, in the end it simply wasn’t comfortable.</p>
<p>While the company claims free customizations during an 120-day sleep trial (which may have helped by removing some of the excess foam), the fine print states this benefit will only apply if you purchase the product directly from Relief-Mart, Inc. The same goes for the offer of free return shipping and their 20-year warranty.</p>
<p>Even if you did purchase direct, who wants to deal with shipping their entire brand new pillow back to the manufacturer for customization? Not us.</p>
<h3>Brooklyn Bedding &#8211; Talalay Latex</h3>
<p>We were not fans of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WJ0AHRK/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brooklyn Bedding &#8211; Talalay Latex</a> for proper neck support, either. We tried the plush version, which does not hold its loft at all. It was similar to sleeping on a giant sponge that compresses under the weight of your head and then quickly springs back to its original shape when you get up. This didn’t do our necks any favors.</p>
<p>Brooklyn Bedding is molded from 100-percent latex rubber foam and has a soft, zippered, removable and breathable cover which is machine washable. The cover is very nice.</p>
<p>Perhaps this pillow might be a better option for stomach sleepers who are not concerned with neck pain. It also comes in a firm variety which may offer better cervical support than this one did.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Overall, we believe that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0S6LBD/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coop Home Goods &#8211; Eden</a> is the best pillow option on the market for anyone experiencing, or who wants to avoid, neck pain. The cross-cut, gel-infused memory foam and microfiber fill is comfortable, adjustable and — most importantly — provides the perfect cushion to cradle your neck. It is designed to align your head, neck and shoulders into a neutral position for a pain-free, restful night’s sleep.</p>
<p>We also slept well with our two runners-up: the Perform Pillow and the Nature&#8217;s Guest.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075312Y9Y/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Perform Pillow &#8211; Memory Foam</a> was soft and welcoming, while supporting the neck in all the right places. The contoured memory foam can be used in one of four positions to adjust to different sizes and preferences. Because the pillow can’t be manipulated like the shredded memory foam of our winner, it might take users some adjustment to get used to it.</p>
<p>The fiber-filled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IWM6056/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nature&#8217;s Guest</a> also performed well in our product testing. This adjustable, firm and heavy microfiber pillow offered good neck support with its unusual contoured shape. Due to this unique design, we found this pillow especially beneficial for sleepers who frequently change positions during the night.</p>

<p>We began our research by exploring recommendations by medical experts, including podiatrists and physical therapists. First, we learned that the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) recognizes products, including insoles, that are found to be beneficial to foot health with a <a href="https://www.apma.org/Patients/content.cfm?ItemNumber=1108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seal of Acceptance</a>. Five of our six insole finalists have received this endorsement; the sixth received excellent user reviews at an economical price point.</p>
<p>Next, we contacted an experienced podiatrist, Dr. Benjamin Cullen of <a href="https://www.sandiegopodiatrygroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">San Diego Podiatry Group</a>, for his opinion on the best insole. Dr. Cullen explained that for an average person with mild heel pain, a pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033BPBD4/?tag=ybsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet &#8211; GREEN insoles</a> often resolves any issues. He suggests this type both for active exercisers and for people who are on their feet for long periods of time. These insoles, Dr. Cullen says, provide enough support for most individuals without being too rigid.</p>
<p>In general, Dr. Cullen recommends breaking in new shoe insoles first before wearing them for a full day. This involves wearing them for 1-2 hours per day and gradually increasing the time worn over several days. Most manufacturers of the insoles we chose make this same recommendation, particularly if you aren’t used to wearing shoe insoles or orthotics.</p>
<p><strong>Note that while insoles are heavily marketed for a range of different activities (from “running” to “work”), our podiatrist suggests that it is not necessary to have different insoles for each activity.</strong></p>
<p>We also discussed the benefits of using insoles with exercise enthusiast and physical therapist, <a href="https://www.uchealth.org/provider/christine-kittles-pt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christine Kittles</a>. She explained that putting your feet into proper alignment can relieve pain in your feet and lower body, plus improve overall mobility. Kittles has seen positive results with all types of Superfeet insoles, which mold to the shape of your feet over time.</p>
<p>Finally, we researched previous product testing by The Wirecutter, along with a variety of articles, expert advice and product information online from sources like Runner’s World, Orthotic Shop, REI Expert Advice and The Insole Store.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs an insole?</h2>
<p>Almost everyone who puts stress on their feet can benefit from a pair of quality insoles. This stress may come from high-impact physical activity such as running, fitness walking and intensive training. Or, it can come from long hours of standing on your feet in professions like nursing, food service or retail. If you stand in the same spot all day, consider using an <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-anti-fatigue-mat/" rel="noopener">anti-fatigue mat</a> too.</p>
<p>Whether you are currently experiencing foot, ankle, knee, hip or lower back pain, or simply want to avoid it in the future, a good pair of insoles may help. For the majority of people, putting feet into a neutral position — which is what most shoe insoles aim to do — helps solve and prevent related pain and discomfort.</p>
<p>Foot pain can be due to <a href="https://www.apma.org/Patients/FootHealth.cfm?ItemNumber=985" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plantar fasciitis</a>, flat feet, high arches, heel pain, <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/gear/a20795259/pronation-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overpronation</a> or repetitive stress. If you have a proper insole already and are still experiencing foot pain from repetitive stress, using a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/foot-massagers/">foot massager</a> may help relieve some pain. Shoe insoles provide both cushioning and overall support, thereby relieving pain not only in your feet, but often in other areas of your lower body as well. Shoe insoles can also help prevent blisters and even keep your feet warm.</p>
<p>Choosing a pair to try may seem overwhelming. As previously mentioned, insoles are marketed for many types of activities, such as standing all day, walking, running and hiking. Our experts, however, suggest that there are only two main types of insoles — support insoles and gel/cushioned ones.</p>
<p>Most people can benefit from better support, but some individuals may simply need extra padding. Although our testing focused on full-length support-style insoles (which generally provide the maximum level of support and, ultimately, comfort) the final six selections offer a range of cushioning levels.</p>
<p>Insoles can be used in various types of shoes, including athletic, casual, dress and work. Generally, they are meant to replace (as opposed to go on top of) the original shoe insoles.</p>
<p>Full-length insoles tend to be designed for sturdier, roomier athletic shoes, so there are certain styles of shoes that insoles won’t work for. This can be an issue particularly affecting women’s styles: sandals, high heels and very tight-fitting shoes. In these cases, other types of partial inserts/lifts/pads may be more appropriate.</p>
<p>If your shoes do not have removable insoles to start with, getting a pair of insoles to fit could be challenging.</p>
<p>When it comes to insoles, sometimes the “best” pair depends on the actual shape of your foot, any problems you are having and what activity you are doing.</p>
<p>Women, for example, tend to have issues with forefoot pain from wearing high heels; good arch padding can help divert the pressure from that area. Runners, on the other hand, often experience heel pain, so a deep, stable heel cup could help.</p>
<p>Our feet come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. As you explore the many insoles on the market, it is helpful to understand your foot type. Are you flat-footed or do you have unusually high arches? Take this test to find out. Are your feet wide or narrow? Do you over- or under-pronate? Finally, are you currently experiencing any pain? If you are having severe foot, ankle, knee, hip or back pain, consult your doctor before starting your search.</p>
<p>If chronic health problems, such as diabetes or circulation issues, are contributing factors to your foot, ankle or lower body pain, please consult your medical provider. Custom orthotics and/or additional treatment may be needed.</p>
<p>One important aspect that our testers noticed was that every single pair of insoles tested was a major improvement over the thin, floppy, formless insoles that come standard in shoes. Bottom line? Give shoe insoles a try! Your feet don’t need to hurt.</p>
<h2 id="store">Store-bought insoles vs prescription orthotics</h2>
<p>There are many reasons to try over-the-counter shoe insoles before rushing to the podiatrist for custom orthotics. The biggest reason, of course, is financial. The average cost of prescription orthotics is $400-600. Because this isn’t generally covered by insurance, podiatrists and physical therapists often suggest trying over-the-counter shoe insoles first, since they are generally priced at $10-100.</p>
<p>When making your decision, consider that because custom orthotics are costly, most people only purchase one pair and transfer them between various shoes. This isn’t as convenient as owning multiple pairs for all of your shoes. If store-bought insoles prove effective for you, their more affordable price point may allow you to purchase multiple pairs for this convenience.</p>
<p>Next, note that custom orthotics can also be more of a hassle to obtain, often requiring a referral from a primary care doctor to a podiatrist or orthopedic specialist. This can cause delays in treating foot discomfort. Quality over-the-counter insoles can be conveniently purchased at many stores selling footwear or online from various outlets.</p>
<p>Custom orthotics are customized to your feet, either to correct certain motions or to accommodate specific problems and relieve related pain. They can also be customized to particular shoes, including high heels.</p>
<p>Also, custom orthotics are made from top-quality materials and can last one to five years, depending on a variety of factors. Your podiatrist can help determine when it’s time to replace them. Store-bought insoles tend to wear out faster, though there is a wide range of durability between products. Superfeet, for example, can last up to a full year.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing any active foot pain, Dr. Cullen recommends giving it some time to resolve once you start wearing your new shoe insoles. After the initial break-in period of several days, wear them full-time for an additional two to four weeks. If there’s no improvement in your pain at that point, you may need custom orthotics.</p>
<p>Finally, if you are in doubt as to whether you should try over-the-counter or prescription orthotics, and/or your foot-related pain is severe, please consult your medical provider.</p>

<p><strong>Overall support:</strong> For proper foot health, good support is key. In our testing, we generally found that the more rigid pairs of insoles, particularly in the arch and heel areas, provided the best overall support. Again, a supportive pair of insoles will place the foot in a neutral position, minimizing foot pain and discomfort and/or avoiding future issues with these.</p>
<p><strong>Overall comfort:</strong> Comfort is also very important. The whole point of insoles, after all, is to make your feet happy! Of course, this measure is more subjective than others, since it depends on the needs of your feet, but the majority of our testers found Superfeet the most comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Arch support:</strong> Many individuals seeking insoles mention arch pain as a motivating factor. The arch area should be shaped appropriately for your foot and be strong enough to not collapse under your weight. Those with very flat feet may not find very high arch support as comfortable as those with naturally higher arches, but the exact shape of the arch curve can factor in as well.</p>
<p>Appropriate arch support can help divert pain from other areas, such as the forefoot or heel areas, so it is beneficial for the entire foot. We found that Superfeet offered a nicely shaped, moderate arch curve with strong support that did not collapse under weight. The SOLE, Powerstep, and Physix models had the highest arches; Spenco the most mild.</p>
<p><strong>Heel cup:</strong> The heel is another area of the foot where many people experience pain. Some insoles offer a cradling effect for the heel which can improve stability and comfort. Consider the width and depth of the heel cradle (if any) and how it fits your particular foot. We found that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033BPBD4/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00124J8JW/?tag=ybsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOLE</a> offered the most stable heel support.</p>

<p><strong>Cushioning:</strong> The level of padding varies significantly from insole to insole. Some offer a fairly uniform cushion while others focus the padding onto certain areas of the foot. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KVT3AW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spenco</a> insoles were by far the most cushioned of the ones we tested.</p>
<p><strong>Thickness:</strong> Shoe insoles are designed to replace the ones that come standard with a pair of shoes. Shoes with removable insoles are generally higher-volume, with some flexible space to accommodate a slightly larger insole. However, if you need to fit the insoles into a greater variety of shoes, look for a thinner design.</p>
<p><strong>Material:</strong> All of the insoles we tested are made from synthetic materials, primarily foam and plastics. However, there are shoe insoles on the market made from leather and natural materials.</p>
<p><strong>Odor and moisture control:</strong> Although we didn’t notice any particular odor or moisture issues with any of the insoles tested, we can certainly imagine this could become an issue over time. To avoid, remove the insoles entirely from the shoe after heavy use and let them air out overnight. Many insoles can be hand washed, but check care instructions for specifics.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Running-sm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We recruited two product testers, one male and one female, to spend some time wearing our six finalists. Both testers either walked or ran a regular route multiple times per week; both also spent a fair amount of time standing in place. Insole tests were conducted after an initial 3-day break-in period, as recommended by our medical experts and manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
<h3>Comfort ratings</h3>
<p>The first product test assigned comfort ratings —scale of one (poor) to 10 (excellent) — for each insole after being placed into a pair of athletic shoes. Each model was rated 1) after first putting them on, 2) after an hour of brisk walking and/or running, and 3) after an hour of standing. Care was taken to ensure comparable conditions such as speed, time of day, type of socks and length of route.</p>
<p>These tests were repeated for all of our insole finalists to ensure an accurate and consistent assessment. We then averaged all individual comfort scores to create an overall comfort score for each finalist. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033BPBD4/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet</a> insoles received the highest overall comfort ratings.</p>
<h3>Padding inspection</h3>
<p>Next, a visual and touch inspection on padding was completed. This took note of padding levels in the following areas: overall, heel, arch, toe and metatarsal. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KVT3AW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spenco</a> insoles offered the best overall padding and cushioning. SOLE and Powerstep also performed well.</p>
<h3>Shoe fit</h3>
<p>We placed the insoles into a variety of shoes to check fit: experimenting with men’s and women’s hiking shoes, running shoes, fashion sneakers, dress shoes and boots. It quickly became clear which insole was more difficult to put in, take out and move into another shoe.</p>
<p>For anyone wanting to transfer their insoles between shoes regularly, the flexible, floppy style of the Spenco insoles made them the most challenging to maneuver; the SOLE ones were next most challenging due to their slightly larger size, though we found the others fairly comparable.</p>
<p>This stage of testing was also designed to reveal which, if any, insoles slipped around within the shoe. We found that they all stayed in place quite well. We also discovered which ones were more likely to fit in lower-volume shoes.The thinner forefoot area of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078GSPH61/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Physix</a> made them the lowest profile insoles and most likely to fit into tighter dress shoes and boots or low-volume fashion sneakers.</p>
<h3>Stability measurements</h3>
<h4>Heel cup</h4>
<p>Heel pain is a big problem for many individuals and a major component of why people turn to insoles in the first place. Therefore, a key point of marketing for shoe insoles involves claims of a “deep heel cup.”</p>
<p>To attach some relative meaning to this claim, we investigated by assigning each insole one of three categories: strong, moderate or mild. Two of the insoles landed in the “strong” category and offered the best cradling of the heel area — the Superfeet and SOLE.</p>
<h4>Arch height</h4>
<p>Insole arches were compared to each other and rated high, moderate or mild. SOLE and Powerstep had the highest arches and strong arch support — but note that the arch curve could be too high for some individuals. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00124J8JW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078GSPH61/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Physix</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058YGR8W/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vionic</a> offered more moderate arch support; Spenco was the lowest.</p>
<h4>Rigidity of insole</h4>
<p>When it comes to insoles, there must be a balance of being rigid enough to offer good support while still flexible enough for the feet to comfortably bend and move. We rated each insole model in one of three categories: flexible, rigid or semi-rigid. Our top choice, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00124J8JW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet</a>, and runner-up, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00124J8JW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOLE</a>, both landed in the “rigid” category, although note that while the heel and arch areas are fairly rigid, both are still flexible in the forefoot area.</p>
<h3>Customization</h3>
<p>Most shoe insoles are designed to custom-mold to your foot over time. None of the insoles we tested require heat molding, though the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00124J8JW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOLE</a> model offered the option to heat mold, a simple process involving an oven at low heat before wearing to speed up the customization process.</p>
<p>With either heat or wear molding, our manufacturers’ recommendations consistently suggested breaking in new insoles over a several-day period, slowly increasing the time worn each day. We noticed that the Superfeet insoles showed visible shape changes as they molded to our feet.</p>
<h3>Odor and moisture</h3>
<p>We planned to take note of any unusual odor or moisture after wearing, but all insole models that we tested provided effective odor and moisture control.</p>
<h2 id="best">The best insole overall: Superfeet &#8211; GREEN</h2>

<p>After extensive online research to narrow down the field to six finalists, we conducted a variety of product tests that had us running for miles, walking briskly, standing in place and pulling out a variety of shoe styles from our closets. We explored insole support, stability, comfort, cushioning, shoe fit — and even potential issues with bad odors (yikes!). In the end, our feet are extremely grateful and the winner of best insole overall is abundantly clear: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033BPBD4/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet &#8211; GREEN</a>.</p>
<p>This product comes highly endorsed by medical experts. Along with our runner-up, SOLE &#8211; Softec Ultra-U, this one has received the APMA Seal of Acceptance — a distinction demonstrating that podiatrists agree these insoles add significant value to overall foot health.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Superfeet insoles are recommended by our expert podiatrist, Dr. Cullen, for the vast majority of people with mild foot pain. They are appropriate for high-impact activities, long periods of standing, and general daily wear. Dr. Cullen generally suggests that patients give these a try before spending hundreds of dollars on custom orthotics; however, if active foot pain has not improved within two to four weeks, custom orthotics may be necessary.</p>
<p>Exercise enthusiast and physical therapist Christine Kittles agrees that Superfeet makes the best insoles. She uses them personally and recommends them to help resolve or avoid both foot and lower body pain — thereby improving an individual’s overall mobility. Over time, Superfeet insoles visibly mold to your foot to provide a higher level of customization than many other store-bought insoles.</p>

<p>Superfeet insoles are highly reviewed by a number of product sites that we know and trust, including <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-insoles-for-running-and-walking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wirecutter</a>, <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/advanced/a20790036/a-guide-to-running-shoe-inserts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Runner’s World</a>, <a href="https://www.orthoticshop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orthotic Shop</a>, <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/insoles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REI Expert Advice</a> and <a href="https://www.theinsolestore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Insole Store</a>.</p>
<p>From our series of product tests, Superfeet &#8211; GREEN earned top comfort marks by all product testers, offering a combination of excellent arch and heel support. The arch support offers a moderate, nicely shaped curve that is appropriate for most foot types and a deep cradle provides excellent heel stability. SOLE also offers a nice heel cradle and good arch support, although the arches are a bit higher so they may not be appropriate for all foot shapes.</p>
<p>Superfeet has a fairly rigid structure to the heel and arch areas, similar to our runner-up, along with a flexible, moderately cushioned forefront. While SOLE offers more cushioning in the forefoot area, they are also higher-profile and thicker as a result, leading to more challenges with shoe fit. Superfeet allows for a nice trade-off between comfort and functionality.</p>
<p>The downside mostly comes with cost. Superfeet (and SOLE) are definitely on the pricier end of store-bought insoles. However, we believe that they will last much longer than less expensive options, which we could see visible wear and tear on after just a handful of wearings. Superfeet claims their insoles will last up to one year or 500 miles and they come with a 60-day satisfaction guarantee.</p>

<p>We also really like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SOLE-Softec-Ultra-U-Support-Inserts/dp/B01KT2XVLI/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOLE &#8211; Softec Ultra-U insoles</a>. Like Superfeet, they have the APMA Seal of Acceptance and performed well in all areas of our product testing. SOLE can be used for a variety of activities and work best in high-volume shoes.</p>
<p>SOLE performed especially well for overall support. The arch of the SOLE insoles provides high, fairly rigid support, making them a good option for individuals with high arches. Like all models tested, the forefoot area of the insole remains flexible. They have a very similar cradling heel cup to Superfeet &#8211; GREEN, which is part of their appeal and offers excellent heel support and stability.</p>
<p>For individuals with particularly high arches, SOLE is a good option. Even for those with more moderately arched feet, they might be still be comfortable due to the nicely shaped and cushioned arch curve. Alternatively, Superfeet offers more moderately raised arches.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole insole, the cushioning was noticeably thicker on SOLE than all the other finalists, with the exception of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KVT3AW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spenco</a>. This especially stood out in the forefoot area where other insoles tend to run much thinner.</p>
<p>While the padding is certainly nice to have, there is a trade off because it makes the size of the insoles slightly larger than the others, including Superfeet. This makes shoe fit more challenging, although there is still room in high-volume shoes for these to be comfortable.</p>

<p>To speed up the customization process, or make future adjustments, SOLE also gives the option of heat molding — a simple process that can be done in your home oven. If that doesn’t appeal to you, they can also be molded just by wearing them.</p>
<p>The main drawbacks are that they are higher in price and that there may be some shoe fit issues since they are also thicker than some of the others, as a result of more cushioning. We also found that they run a little longer than some of the others, so may require trimming. (Superfeet also required some trimming.)</p>
<p>If you’re looking for good support that also offers good cushioning, and plan to use them in high-volume shoes, SOLE might be a good option. They are extremely comfortable, supportive and padded, earning them best runner-up choice.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078GSPH61/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Physix &#8211; Gear Sport Soles</a> offer an ultra-thin design, leaving lots of toe space and also making them a good choice for tighter fitting shoes. The trade-off is that the forefoot cushioning is quite mild. They have a moderately cradling heel cup and moderate/high arch support.</p>
<p>As one of the least expensive options, they are easy on the budget and come with a 100% money-back guarantee if you’re not satisfied. One area of concern is that they do not have the APMA Seal of Acceptance. However, they tested higher than some of the other insoles that do. Like all of our insole finalists, they are generally highly reviewed by previous customers.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KVT3AW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spenco &#8211; Polysorb Cross Trainer</a> is another budget-friendly option that is almost exclusively focused on cushioning and shock absorption, though there is also a soft, moderate arch support that is designed for low- to medium-arched feet.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the foam under the metatarsal area already showed some signs of wear and tear after just a couple wearings, so the low price point suggests a trade off with long-term durability, but they also come with a one-year unconditional guarantee.</p>
<p>They are comfortable and cushioned and accepted by the APMA, but may not be right for everyone due to fewer stability features.</p>

<p>Designed by podiatrists, Powerstep offers a full range of insoles, with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001BVHS1Q/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Powerstep Pinnacle</a> being an “Amazon choice” and APMA-accepted. These have high firm and flexible arch support and a moderate/high cradling heel cup designed for mild to moderate pronation.</p>
<p>The heel is raised slightly higher than some of the other products, taking up somewhat more space in the shoe. The insole’s texture caused some friction for one of our testers on the bottom of the foot and the high heel cup caused heel blistering (due to shoe fit issues) for our other tester.</p>
<p>Powerstep offers a moderate amount of cushioning and is also priced in the middle of the range. Insoles come with a lifetime guarantee against breakage of the plastic foot support.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058YGR8W/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vionic &#8211; Orthaheel Active</a> insoles are designed by podiatrists and have a moderately sloped, fairly rigid arch support with mild overall cushioning and a moderately cradling heel cup. There is visible targeted padding in the metatarsal and heel strike areas.</p>
<p>Vionic offers a 30-day guarantee and has the APMA Seal of Acceptance. While there was nothing specific wrong with them, testers just generally didn’t find them as comfortable as the top choices.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>We believe that our top-rated shoe insoles, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033BPBD4/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet &#8211; GREEN</a>, will help you say goodbye to sore feet. These insoles scored well on all aspects of our product testing including overall comfort, arch and heel support, padding, rigidity, shoe fit and functionality — and were clear favorites among our product testers.</p>
<p>They are appropriate for all levels of activity. The combination of cradling heel support, well-shaped and rigid arches, and overall comfort made them winners for best insole.</p>
<p>Our runner-up, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SOLE-Softec-Ultra-U-Support-Inserts/dp/B01KT2XVLI/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOLE &#8211; Softec Ultra-U insoles</a>, is another great option for sore feet.

				<description><![CDATA[After over a month of research and testing, we found Stillpoint Aromatics to be the best essential oils based on factors such as scent, farming and production, and storage practices.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ur writer and researcher for this article is a holistic health practitioner studying nutrition, human anatomy, physiology, spirituality, as well as aromatherapy. After over a month of research and evaluation, we determined <a href="https://stillpointaromatics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stillpoint Aromatics</a> offers the best essential oils. They source the finest plants and make the greatest effort to preserve the oils’ pristine quality by keeping them in cold storage, capped with nitrogen. Running a close second — and for half the price — <a href="http://www.floracopeia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Floracopeia&#8217;s</a> essential oils smelled very fresh and quite similar to Stillpoint’s, but lacked the energetic quality from our top pick.</p>

<h2 class="collapse" id="how-we-found">How we found the best essential oils</h2>
<p>After several weeks of exhaustive research, we sifted the Internet to find as many essential oil brands as possible that were available in America. We searched through web retailers, scoured essential oil and natural health blogs, online forums and reviews, along with searching through Subreddits like /r/essentialoils and /r/aromatherapy.</p>
<p>We then spoke with professionals in the business including a Clinical Registered Aromatherapist, several massage therapists and a Holistic Health Coach. In addition we read through scientific research studies, and numerous essential oil, natural health and aromatherapy books — both historical and modern.</p>
<p>Finally, with a clear understanding of exactly what makes a great essential oil, we combed through our large list of candidates — plus found a few more companies of high integrity — to see if they truly met the demanding criteria for quality.</p>
<p>With this knowledge we selected a total of seven different brands to test in-house:</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="the-seven-best">Compare the best essential oil companies</h2>
[table id=34 /]
<h2 class="collapse">What are essential oils?</h2>
<p>The term, “essential oil” is actually the shortening of a historical term: “quintessential oil,” alluding to the oils as the spirit or life force of the plant. Of course the oils are a physical substance, not supernatural; however, their ethereal aromas and therapeutic talents can have a spiritual, as well as a mental/emotional effect on us.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.naturalhealthyconcepts.com/2014/12/04/essential-oils-fda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Essential oils are in fact NOT oils at all</a>, they’ve simply acquired that name because they do not mix with water, just like regular oils. They are a vital liquid present inside living plants — a natural solution of various complex chemical constituents. <strong>Scientifically, essential oils are concentrated aromatic volatile plant compounds</strong> <strong>(‘volatile’ meaning they can change state or evaporate very easily).</strong> They are mostly derived from the flowers, leaves, stems and fruits of plants, while some are extracted from the bark and even the sap of trees.</p>
<p>Inside the living plant, essential oils serve several purposes, one of which is defense. Acting like the plant’s immune system, the oils help it fight off fungus or bacterial infection, and protect it from insects and animals. Another purpose is reproduction; the pleasing aromas attract pollinating insects like bees and butterflies. We’re not the only animals who like the smell of flowers.</p>
<h2 class="collapse">How are essential oils produced?</h2>
<p>The most common processes for extracting the essential oils from the plant material after harvesting are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distillation &#8211; steam from boiling water passes through plants drawing out the oils, then the oils are separated from the cooled, re-condensed water</li>
<li>Expression &#8211; (also called cold pressing) heavy pressure squeezes the oils from the materials; used mainly with citrus fruit peels<br />
Maceration/Distillation &#8211; the plant material is softened in warm water to release the oils</li>
<li>The amount of essential oil present within the plant material is scarce, more so for some plants than others. <strong>It can take up to 60 roses to produce one single drop of rose essential oil.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="collapse" id="essential-oils-vs">Essential oils vs. absolutes vs. hydrosols</h2>
<p>When searching for and purchasing essential oils from reputable companies you might come across the terms “absolute” and “hydrosol” often right next to the essential oils of the same plant. Be aware, these are not the same as essential oils.</p>
<p>An absolute is a fragrant liquid that is extracted from the plants using chemical solvents, like alcohol. Though the solvents are removed after the extraction process, there still remains a tiny amount of the chemical in the final product. Absolutes are much thicker and more concentrated than essential oils, and because of this they are often used in skin care products and lotions.</p>
<p>A hydrosol is simply the aromatic water that is left over from the steam distillation process. Hydrosols are basically just scented H2O and are generally used as perfume, cologne, air or fabric freshener, or they can be added to a soothing bath.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="benefits">Benefits of essential oils and aromatherapy</h2>
<p>Aromatherapy is an ancient practice of natural healing and plant medicine that has been documented in human civilizations around the world for over 6,000 years. The use of prescribing aromatic plant extracts for massage, for bathing and for mental, emotional and spiritual imbalances has proven benefits through both practical and scientific evidence.</p>
<p>The scents and the therapeutic capacities of each essential oil are unique to each plant and can have many physiological and psychological benefits. The oils have the ability to calm and release stress, to uplift depression, to stimulate and awaken the body and mind, to relieve sore muscles, or even loosen a cough if used correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Aromatherapy does not literally take away stress or depression, but rather it balances the disturbances within your body and mind, and fortifies your weaknesses, allowing your body to heal itself.</strong></p>
<p>And since the oils have anti-viral, anti-fungal and antibacterial qualities within the plants, we as humans can also make use of these benefits for our own health. Again, of course, when used properly.</p>
<p>It’s very important to keep in mind that the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates essential oils mainly as cosmetics, NOT as therapeutic supplements, herbs or medications. So if you come across an essential oil company or salesperson who claims their oils can cure certain diseases or mental illnesses, they are violating federal law and can be prosecuted and fined by the US government.</p>
<p>One very public example of this came in September of 2014 when <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2014/ucm415809.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FDA cited both dōTERRA</a> and <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2014/ucm416023.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Young Living</a>, multi-level marketing essential oil companies. FDA agents found clear evidence that some of Young Living and dōTERRA reps were making claims that their oils could prevent and cure Ebola and many other illnesses! The situation was quickly remedied.</p>
<p>Such bold claims should raise red flags for wise buyers. Be a smart consumer.</p>
<p>This brings us to some extremely important information for your own health…</p>

<p>Essential oils can be considered, fundamentally, as medication. Although derived from plants and natural resources they are still used as a treatment for health ailments. The oil’s high concentration makes them very powerful and potentially dangerous substances if used incorrectly. It is imperative that you do thorough research before using any essential oil because if used improperly they can cause serious health issues like allergic reactions, rashes, burns and long-term internal damage. The temptation to self-diagnose and self-prescribe can be a great influence in using essential oils, but without professional diagnosis and supervision, you run a risk of causing yourself harm. With that in mind here are some very important guidelines to follow:</p>
<p><strong>Avoid use of essential oils (unless under medical supervision) if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You are pregnant</li>
<li>You have a skin condition</li>
<li>You have asthma</li>
<li>You have severe allergies</li>
<li>You have epilepsy or are prone to seizures</li>
<li>You have heart disease</li>
<li>You have high blood pressure</li>
<li>You are on a course of treatment with prescribed medication</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rules for safe usage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many essential oils are too powerful to be applied directly to the skin undiluted (also known as “neat”), they must be diluted with a neutral carrier oil, such as jojoba oil, to avoid irritation.</li>
<li>Never use essential oils on or around the eyes or mucous membranes.</li>
<li>Several oils, like bergamot and other citrus, can cause allergic sensitivity to the sun and should be used with caution.</li>
<li>Children and the elderly can be extra sensitive to the effects of essential oils.</li>
<li>Essential oils are flammable, so keep them away from open flames.</li>
<li>Never ingest essential oils unless it is under the close supervision and prescription of a clinically-trained medical or aromatherapeutic professional. Some oils can be toxic, and if taken internally may be fatal. If you don’t know the specific chemistry of the oil, do not take it internally.</li>
</ul>
<p>We here at Your Best Digs take your health and safety very seriously, that’s why we spend so much time and effort researching products for you.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve laid out some ground rules for essential oils, let’s see what you can do with these little gifts from nature.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="uses">Uses for essential oils</h2>
<p>Of course essential oils smell great, but there’s much more to them than just a pretty scent. There are three main techniques to make use of essential oils: aromatic, topical and internal.</p>
<h3>Aromatic</h3>

<p><strong>Diffusion:</strong> This is the healthiest, safest and most effective method of use. The fragrances from essential oils that are detected through your sense of smell actually have profound effects on your body, mood and behavior. When the oils are diffused into the air the healing properties of the essences enter your body through your nose while you appreciate the pleasant smell. The best way to achieve these benefits is by using an essential oil diffuser. We <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-essential-oil-diffuser/" rel="noopener">reviewed these diffusers in-depth</a> and found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MPV473S/?tag=ybdoils-20" rel="nofollow">Smiley Daisy</a> to be the best.</p>
<p>As the vaporized microscopic particles come into contact with the soft and moist tissue inside your nose and sinuses their beneficial properties enter directly into your bloodstream and get dispersed throughout your body. At the same time they travel up the olfactory nerve (the one that operates your sense of smell) to the limbic region of your brain where you process feelings and emotions. This is also an important area of the brain involved in memory. Smell and memory are processed through the same part of the brain; that’s why when you smell cookies baking in the oven you may have flashbacks of childhood.</p>

<p>As you smell the beautiful aromas this triggers your brain and the cells of your body, affecting your mood to uplift or calm you, affecting your behavior to slow you down or excite you, affecting your thinking to help you clear your mind and think sharper while remembering important things.</p>
<p>And since the essential oil particles are entering your bloodstream, you are also getting the physical benefits they may offer like muscle relaxation, pain relief, improved digestion and more.</p>
<p>Another added benefit of diffusion is its ability to clean the air. When the air in a space is stagnant, smelly and unclean — like in the winter when your home is closed up — there can be infectious airborne bacteria, viruses and spores floating about ready to make you sick. But when the right essential oil is diffused, in the correct amount, you can actually kill those little buggers in the air before they get to you.</p>
<p>In a quote from aromatherapy expert, David Crow, he writes, “[T]he antimicrobial effects of essential oils are most potent not when the oil is used in liquid form… but when pathogens are exposed to the vapors of the oils.” Not only do the oils clean the air and get into your nose, but they are also penetrating your skin, getting into your bloodstream, protecting and healing you.</p>
<p>Don’t overdo it though. Remember, these oils are extremely concentrated. Prolonged exposure to essential oils can cause ill effects like headaches, nausea or other unpleasant symptoms. Vary your use with different oils of different chemical compounds so that they don’t build up in your system. And avoid letting your diffuser run all day, every day; there is such a thing as too much of a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>Inhalation:</strong> With oils that are safe to use on the skin (know before you try), you can also take a single drop into one of your hands and rub your hands together to warm them up and spread the oil. Then cup your hands around your nose and take in a deep breath. Doing this, you can achieve the same mood and emotional benefits as with diffusion. A little goes a long way.</p>
<p>It’s good to note that most essential oils can lose their healthy powers when heated, so it’s best to avoid heat-based diffusions like candles and incense burners; stick with a good diffuser.</p>
<h3>Topical</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5375" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage.jpg" alt="eye dropper using essential oil on hand" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>For cautionary reasons, it is safest to assume that all essential oils should not be applied to the skin undiluted. Some are safe to use ‘neat’ right out of the bottle, while others can cause you great pain or irritation. Again, know all about your oil before you use it!</p>
<p>A typical dilution is around 2%, which means adding about 12 drops of essential oil to every one ounce of carrier oil. A carrier oil is a neutral nut or vegetable oil you use for dilution. Jojoba and Argan oils are the most common and beneficial, but almond, grapeseed, olive, coconut, sunflower, avocado or kukui oils will work just fine.</p>
<p><strong>Massage:</strong> Place several drops of your diluted oil mixture into your hand and rub them together. Then spread that oil onto your skin — or your partner’s skin — with long strokes. The warmth and friction of your hands will dispense the oil directly into the skin, muscles and bloodstream. Using the right essential oils can relax tension, relieve sore muscles and even improve your skin. Plus it just feels so darn good to get a massage.</p>
<p><strong>Compress:</strong> For localized issues like aches or bruises, place about ten drops of essential oil into a bowl of hot water. Soak a clean cloth in this water solution, then place the cloth on the troubled area for about 10-20 minutes. Repeat if necessary. As before, make sure you know if the oil you use is safe.</p>

<p><strong>Bath:</strong> Avoid dripping your essential oil directly into the bath water; you always want to mix it first with a natural emulsifier like honey, milk, a carrier oil, or even sea salt. Doing this will help emulsify and disperse the essential oils into the water. If you don’t do this, the oils will simply sit on the surface of the water and come into direct contact with your skin, possibly causing burns and dermal toxicity.</p>
<p>Try 5-10 drops of essential oil into ½-1 cup of emulsifier or salt, then stir that mixture into your warm bath water. Soak and relax for as long or as short as you wish as the oils penetrate your skin and stimulate your senses. Be aware that the overuse of essential oils in the bath can cause irritation, so choose only the mild and soothing extracts, and be smart.</p>
<h3>Internal / Ingestion</h3>
<p>Ingesting essential oils for health benefits has been prescribed for centuries by experienced professionals. This process, when administered safely and correctly under supervision, can have profound healing effects on your body with issues like digestion, immune defense and hormonal imbalances. However, ingesting the wrong oils — or even the right oils in the wrong portions — can have disastrous and permanent effects on your internal tissues and overall health, and worst of all, you may not even realize any damage has been done until decades later in your life.</p>
<p>In short: <strong>DO NOT TAKE ESSENTIAL OILS INTERNALLY unless they have been prescribed to you individually by a qualified and clinically-trained medical professional or Clinical Registered Aromatherapist.</strong> When working with essential oils you are ultimately playing with chemistry; if you do not know the specific chemistry of the specific oils, and what that specific collection of chemical constituents in that oil can do to your body, then avoid internal administration and stick with the aromatic processes.</p>
<p>The practice of taking essential oils internally, by mouth, has been a heated debate within the essential oil community. Since the recent rise of the multi-level-marketing essential oil companies, and other brands claiming that their oils are pure enough to eat, the idea of freely ingesting essential oils has plagued the minds of the average consumer.</p>
<p>In our research, we came across a number of ill-informed consumers who readily believe that any essential oil, from any company, is safe to consume. Sadly, the exact opposite is true: ANY essential oil can be harmful if ingested improperly and without professional supervision.</p>
<p>Clinically trained professionals have spent years learning the delicate and complicated chemistry of essential oils and how they relate to the sensitive tissues of the human body, inside and out. Please, seek the guidance of a knowledgeable professional before putting any essential oil into your mouth.</p>
<p>We’ve learned how to safely use essential oils, now it’s time to go shopping.</p>

<p>When we set out to find the best essential oils available in America we thought it would be a straightforward matter of finding the companies with the best ratings and reviews, buying some oils and testing them for smell and feel. We never expected to find it such a difficult task.</p>
<p>In the world of essential oils there is an enormous amount of controversy and competition, with some companies accusing other companies of being less pure, while others claim trademarks and exclusivity on their products. All of this noise creates plenty of confusion for the average consumer to sift through, especially since there is no official regulation or oversight on the essential oil industry, federal or otherwise.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, the FDA generally classifies essential oils as cosmetics, but they can also <em>sometimes</em> be considered drugs. In a quote direct from <a href="https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductsIngredients/Products/ucm127054.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the US Food and Drug Administration website</a>, “The law doesn’t require cosmetics to have FDA approval before they go on the market.” In addition, if a product claims to affect the health and function of the body, such as relieving anxiety, aiding digestion or calming sore muscles, the product must be approved by the FDA as a drug, which is a very long and costly process.</p>
<p>Most private and holistic essential oil companies simply can’t afford to go through that process, so they instead opt to comply with the FDA’s much more lax regulations regarding cosmetics; no approval required. So this leaves the real regulation up to you, the consumer.</p>
<p>To help us get a more clear understanding of what to look for in essential oils we spoke with Clinical Registered Aromatherapist, Anna Doxie. She is the founder of the <a href="http://authenticaromatherapyeducation.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Institute of Holistic Phyto-Aromatherapy</a> and Director Coordinator and Director of the Southern California Region of the <a href="https://naha.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy</a> (NAHA) and an esteemed Aromatherapy instructor. We’ve also combed through NAHA’s educational materials, consulted the prolific writings of Dr. Robert Pappas — a highly respected name in essential oil testing and education — and sought many other independent sources of information to present to you some guidelines for finding the best essential oil:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cultivation of the plants</li>
<li>Distillation and Extraction</li>
<li>Testing and Purity</li>
<li>Storage</li>
<li>Labeling and Information</li>
<li>Price</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cultivation and farming</h3>
<p><strong>The most important terms to look for regarding the way the plants are grown and harvested are Certified Organic, Wild Harvested, or unofficially organic</strong> <strong>(sometimes called “unsprayed”).</strong> A reputable essential oil company will freely disclose all information about where and how their source plants are grown, and they’ll be proud of their organic choices.</p>
<p>More importantly, the founders and owners of the companies will have personal relationships with the farmers so they can be certain of what they are getting. There are many tiny, locally operated farms around the world who can’t afford the extremely high costs of organic certification, yet they still practice organic farming which includes: no use of chemical pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers, no genetically modified seeds, and healthy crop rotation to protect the soils. That is what is meant by Unsprayed.</p>
<p>Wild harvested is just that, the plants are cut from their natural, indigenous location; no farming, totally wild.</p>
<p>Another important factor to know about the oil is the geographical location each plant was grown. Plants grow naturally and thrive in climates and conditions suitable for their health. Plants farmed in locations outside of their natural habitats will be less effective when distilled. The climate, the soil, the time of year (and sometimes even the time of day) have great effects on the quality of the essential oils and good companies know this.</p>
<h3>Distillation and extraction</h3>
<p>Distilleries can be certified organic also, but as with the small farms, small distilleries can’t afford the certification, yet they practice organic methods.</p>
<p>It is important to know exactly how the oils were extracted. As we discussed earlier with how essential oils are produced, specific methods are required for specific plants. A good essential oil company will declare the method used for each individual oil. If you don’t see any method of extraction, or you find a blanket statement saying that all their oils are steam distilled, be wary, they could be fake.</p>
<h3>Purity</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5378" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label.jpg" alt="label stating 100% pure oil" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>This is the biggest and most hotly argued aspect of the unregulated essential oil market. Be aware, there are no official legal bindings to the terms, “Pure”, “100% Pure”, “Natural”, and “Therapeutic Grade”; in fact there are no grades at all regarding essential oils. If you see any of these, or similar terms on essential oils, they are completely meaningless marketing slogans.</p>
<p>For effective therapeutic uses, it is imperative that only the purest of essential oils are used. What we mean by ‘pure’ is that the only thing inside that tiny bottle is the essential oil from the specific plant on the label, no additives, no other chemicals, no synthetic fragrances or diluents, and no other kind of oil — natural or otherwise.</p>
<p>To cut costs many low-quality companies will fill their bottles with mostly vegetable oil or water and only add a small percentage of real essential oil. Others will put in cheaper essential oils that smell similar to the real plant and label it as the real thing. An example is using litsea oil in place of lemongrass. This is called adulteration.</p>
<p>The worst deception is when poor companies use synthetic fragrances mixed into vegetable oil and pass it off as true essential oil. This is where the real danger to your health can come: the National Academy of Sciences reported that the 95 percent of synthetic fragrances come from petroleum and have the potential to cause cancer, birth defects, central nervous system disorders and allergic reactions.</p>
<p>So how do you know if the oils are real?</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>In order to know if an essential oil is pure and true it must be tested in a chemistry lab. The Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) test is a standard in the industry. This test separates and analyzes the chemical compounds while confirming the elemental composition within a sample, helping chemists to determine whether or not the essential oil has been tainted. Good companies will have third-party GC/MS reports for every batch of oil available for you to read.</p>

<p><a href="https://essentialoils.org/news/eo_myths" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Robert Pappas says</a>, &#8220;There are a lot of companies out there selling essential oils and most of them have no ability (or in many cases no desire) to do the necessary quality control to verify what they are getting from their supplier before they pass it on to their customers.” The GC/MS test determines the quality and can show evidence of adulteration, although it is not perfect. Good companies will employ other tests as well like, Organoleptic (sensory tests), or FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy).</p>
<p>There are many companies out there, even popular, big name essential oil companies, whose oils have been independently tested by consumers with GC/MS and other processes, and have been found to include synthetic and other ingredients within their apparently “pure” essential oils. That is why it is so important to have batch-specific tests for every oil, and to buy from a company you really know and trust.</p>
<h3>Storage</h3>

<p>As mentioned earlier, essential oils are volatile which means they can degrade quickly under poor conditions, especially with exposure to light, heat or oxygen. To protect the integrity of the oils it is best to keep them in dark glass containers in a cool location in your home — refrigeration is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Every essential oil has a unique shelf life and the good companies will tell you how many years the oil will keep its potency. It’s a good practice to write the date on the bottle when you first open it so you know exactly how old it is years later.</p>
<p>There are few companies who take storage to the highest regard by keeping their oils refrigerated in bottles with nitrogen pumped in to prevent exposure to oxygen. You don’t need to go that far at home, but just don’t leave them in the sun.</p>
<h3>Labeling</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5380" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats.jpg" alt="product details on a label" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Very simply, you want to read on the label — or information page for every oil — the true Latin name of the plant from which the oil was extracted, as well as the country from which the plant was harvested. Some companies will go further and tell you the method of extraction, the farming quality and also the chemical family of the oil. Plus seeing the batch number on the bottle helps you match it with its testing.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>The old adage, “you get what you pay for” is generally quite true when it comes to essential oils. Producing and distributing high-quality essential oils is a time consuming and expensive process. If you find an essential oil at a price significantly lower than most major brands, you’re not getting a good deal, you’re probably getting a fake product.</p>
<p>The most expensive oils will usually offer you the highest purity, quality and integrity. What you’re paying for is the care and great attention to quality. The last thing you want to save a couple of bucks on is your own health or the health of your family.</p>
<p>Knowing the average cost of a good quality oil needs to be taken into consideration when purchasing from large companies with large marketing agendas. Marketing costs a lot of money, as do quality essential oils, so be certain that every dollar of your hard-earned money is going fully into the quality of the essential oil rather than its promotion, advertising and salespeople.</p>

<h3>Scent</h3>
<p>Very simply, the essential oil must smell like it’s supposed to, and that’s where knowing the aromas comes in handy. If your bottle of eucalyptus smells more like mint, then you probably don’t have eucalyptus in your hands.</p>
<p>Of course, you won’t know this until you actually buy and open the oil yourself, so we took care of that for you.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Since we are not chemists, nor do we have the resources or equipment to evaluate the chemical purity of the essential oils, we stuck with methods of evaluation available to the average consumer. Out of the nearly 40 different essential oil companies researched we were able to narrow down the list to a total of seven reputable companies by using the parameters listed above in our section ‘<a href="#what-to-look-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What to look for when purchasing essential oils</a>.’</p>
<p>Then we purchased bottles of Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), and Lemon (Citrus limon) from each of the seven companies we selected to perform our in-house testing. We gathered a group of four people from our office and administered a formal blind smell test to evaluate which oils smelled the best and which smelled the worst out of the selections.</p>
<p>Disguising the names of the companies we placed two drops of each oil on a strip of white card paper marked with a single letter for reference. We had each test participant smell a strip of lavender, one at a time, from each company rating it for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Freshness</li>
<li>Strength</li>
<li>Familiarity</li>
<li>Purity (smelling something in the background besides the lavender)</li>
<li>Richness (fully rounded smell, or incomplete and empty)</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, once each brand of lavender was evaluated individually we asked them to compare all of the different lavender scents to judge their personal preference and to rate which ones gave the highest sense of quality.</p>
<p>We then did the whole thing over again with the lemon essential oils. Here are the cumulative rankings from the testing:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5372" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings.png" alt="blind scent ranking data chart" width="901" height="645" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings.png 901w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-610x437.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-768x550.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-300x215.png 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-295x211.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-885x634.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-360x258.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-375x268.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-414x296.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-320x229.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Finally, we performed a common and simple test for purity. Since essential oils are not truly oils they respond differently when they come into contact with blotting paper. When pure essential oils are dropped onto a piece of blotting paper they will impregnate the paper and then evaporate leaving no obvious trace. However, if you place a drop of diluted essential oil on blotting paper, the vegetable oil used to stretch the original will leave an oily stain on the paper.</p>
<p>We placed a single drop from each bottle onto individual pieces of blotting paper and watched with fascination as the spots disappeared with every sample. No dilutions. No carrier oils. All pure. We expected that, but it’s nice to see it in person.</p>

They have excellent oil scents, along with the highest standards for farming, production and storage practices.</p><a href="http://www.stillpointaromatics.com/essential-oils" target="_blank"><button>See Price at StillpointAromatics.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>In 2010 they started Stillpoint to offer over 200 of “the purest therapeutic quality essential oils that we have ever experienced.” Additionally, they offer true Aromatherapy Certification programs that are accredited with both the National Association of Holistic Aromatherapy (NAHA) and the Alliance of International Aromatherapists (AIA).</p>
<p>Here’s what makes their essential oils so great:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cultivation and distillation: All of their oils are either Certified Organic, Wild Harvested, or Unsprayed (organically grown without certification)</li>
<li>Testing and purity: Every single batch of every single oil they sell is GC/MS tested by an independent laboratory in France. Then the chemical family of the oils is printed directly on the bottle’s label to assist experienced Aromatherapists.</li>
<li>Storage: Once they receive their shipments directly from the distiller (no middlemen) they immediately pour them into amber-colored bottles, then they remove the oxygen by filling the remaining space in the bottles with nitrogen before placing them in cold storage; this drastically reduces oxidation and greatly enhances the shelf-life and vibrancy of the oils. And if that weren’t special enough, Joy and Cynthia literally hand-pour every bottle to order. What this means is, the essential oil stays in cold storage, with nitrogen, until you place your order, only then will the oil be poured custom into the tiny 15mL amber bottle, just for you! No one else takes such pride and care.</li>
<li>Labeling and information: Each hand-poured bottle displays:<br />
-the Latin name<br />
-the source country<br />
-the quality of farming (organic, etc.)<br />
-the part of the plant this oil came from<br />
-how it was extracted<br />
-the chemical family of this oil<br />
-the batch number, so you can see the GC/MS test for that specific oil</li>
<li>Price: Yes, these oils are pricy. At $23.00 for a tiny 5mL bottle of wild lavender, it’s the second most expensive oil, with Oshadhi coming in first at $36.30 for 10mL. But the price is well worth it for the enormous quality you are getting with these oils.</li>
<li>Love: Every order shipped comes with a custom, handwritten note from Joy and Cynthia thanking you for choosing them.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our scent tests the Stillpoint’s oils started off smelling mild and fresh, but then after a minute or two they magically blossomed and became very rich, deep, vibrant, stronger and more clear; almost like a fine wine opens up after being uncorked for some time. And for those who may be sensitive to subtle energies, these oils possessed a very clean and high vibration, which is an enormous benefit when using the oils for spiritual practice. No other oils we tested performed this way.</p>
<p>Our testers rated Stillpoint tops in all tests. With their impeccable standards for quality and preservation, there is no question that Stillpoint Aromatics has the best essential oils.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.floracopeia.com/Essential-Oils/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Floracopeia</a> is another small, independently-owned company with very ethical roots. Started in 2004 in Grass Valley, CA by David and Sara Crow, Floracopeia is our second-best essential oil company. Like Stillpoint, they have strong personal relationships with their distillers; they will even get their hands dirty as they help harvest the plants for extraction when they visit.</p>
<p>Floracopeia’s goal is not only to offer great essential oils but also to help create sustainable ecological, environmental and economic situations that support the small, rural farmers and distillers, as well as the planet. Their Eco-Projects, like the wild agarwood trees in Thailand, reduce illegal harvesting and help create a sustainable forestry system while supporting the livelihoods of the local villagers. And just like Stillpoint, David and Sara offer training and certifications in Aromatherapy.</p>

<p>All of their essential oils are either organic or wild harvested, and while they do not do their own testing, they rely on trusted and vetted relationships with their distillers who provide them with GC/MS tests.</p>
<p>The labels on the Floracopeia bottles offer all the important information you need from a trustworthy brand, including Latin names, organic quality, country of origin and batch number. Not as information-rich as Stillpoint’s bottles, but they still give you all the significant facts for quality oil.</p>
<p>Floracopeia’s very delicate and pure scent comes at almost half the cost of Stillpoint Aromatics’ oils. Priced at $25.00 for a 15mL bottle of organic lavender, that’s about $1.67 per mL, compared to Stillpoint’s $3.17 per mL for wild lavender.</p>
<p>Although Floracopeia doesn’t provide the extensive storage and preservation practices like Stillpoint, their pure and authentic essential oils, with ethical and sustainable practices, as well as a good price, make them an easy pick for our runner up.</p>

<h3>From Nature With Love</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5408 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love.jpg" alt="From Nature With Love bottles" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Our third choice was a company called <a href="https://www.fromnaturewithlove.com/soap/EssentialOils.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">From Nature With Love</a> in Oxford, CT. In our scent tests they actually scored in second place overall however there were a few other issues that dropped them below Floracopeia.</p>
<p>First, their bottles didn’t come with the little plastic dripper caps that cover the mouth of the bottle (aka. orifice reducer), they just had a simple screw cap. Without the orifice reducers, you either have to pour the oil out and make a mess or dip an eye dropper into the oil which can potentially contaminate the product if you’re not careful. Plus if oil gets into the little rubber bulb of the eyedropper it can get stuck in there and go bad, further contaminating the oil.</p>
<p>Second, From Nature With Love is a wholesaler which means they offer products like cosmetics bases and other ingredients for making your own lotions, creams, soaps and more. So their primary focus is not top quality essential oils, but instead, being a one-stop shop for natural body care cosmetics makers.</p>
<p>Third, even though they are a member of NAHA, only some of their essential oils are organic — the lemon was not — and they do not perform GC/MS testing. However, they do fill the amber bottles with nitrogen just like Stillpoint, but that’s the extent of their preservation.</p>
<p>From Nature With Love has some very nice oils, and if you’re planning on making your own lotions they’re a good buy. But for everyday uses, we’d recommend sticking with Stillpoint Aromatics or Floracopeia.</p>
<h3>Mountain Rose Herbs</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5385 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mountain-rose-herbs-bottles.jpg" alt="Mountain Rose Herbs bottles" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mountain-rose-herbs-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mountain-rose-herbs-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mountain-rose-herbs-bottles-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mountain-rose-herbs-bottles-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mountain-rose-herbs-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mountain-rose-herbs-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mountain-rose-herbs-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mountain-rose-herbs-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mountain-rose-herbs-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mountain-rose-herbs-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Based in Eugene, OR, <a href="https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/catalog/aromatherapy/essential-oils" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mountain Rose Herbs</a> offers USDA Organic essential oils, in addition to a variety of other products like teas, spices, bath and body items, and kitchen tools. They are a very eco-conscious and sustainable company, but in the scent tests we tried, they seemed to lack the aromatic quality of the top choices.</p>
<p>The prices were about average at $12.75 for 15mL of lavender, but with so many alternate products they offer, their full attention to quality in the essential oils becomes spread a little thin.</p>
<h3>Plant Therapy</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5384 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles.jpg" alt="plant therapy bottles" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.planttherapy.com/essential-oils" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plant Therapy</a> essential oils is a family owned company in Twin Falls, ID, and they’ve teamed up with world-renowned Aromatherapy expert, Robert Tisserand to help them ensure their oil’s quality and purity. They offer both USDA Organic and conventionally farmed essential oils in all the popular scents, and they test each batch with GC/MS.</p>
<p>With all those glowing statistics it came as a surprise that our testers gave very mixed reviews with these oils. Some thought they were strong and clear, while others noticed strange undertones and even artificial, candy-like qualities. Because of this, they ranked number five overall in our smell test.</p>
<p>Plant Therapy’s labels are a bit scarce in their information. They display the proper Latin names and the USDA Organic logo, but that’s it. Instead of including the country of origin and other important notes — which can be found on the website — they have a long description of what the oils could be used for and how to use it, followed by an FDA disclaimer so they won’t get in trouble.</p>
<h3>Oshadhi</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.oshadhiusa.com/essential-oil-singles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5390 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles.jpg" alt="Oshadhi bottles closeup" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.oshadhiusa.com/essential-oil-singles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oshadhi</a> is a German company imported to America and it was the most expensive oil at $36.30 for 10mL of lavender; that’s more than Stillpoint. But even with that high price these oils got some pretty low ratings with our test group. They noticed sourness in the lavender, hints of chemical flavor in the lemon and weakness in all the scents.</p>
<p>They do sell only organic and wild harvested oils and have been in the essential oil business since 1990. Their labels have everything you need to know, including the chemical family of the oils and very clear batch numbers, but that just wasn’t enough to convince us to like the the way they smelled.</p>
<h3>Rocky Mountain Oils</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.oshadhiusa.com/essential-oil-singles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5392 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils.jpg" alt="Rocky Mountain Oils" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></a></p>
<p>This brand got the worst test scores of all. <a href="https://www.rockymountainoils.com/shoprmo/essential-oils/shop-singles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rocky Mountain Oils</a> from Orem, UT smelled weak and medicinal; someone even said it smelled like a laundry detergent. This was our only brand that did not offer organic oils of any kind, and perhaps that lower quality of farming was what gave them such strange aromas.</p>
<p>RMO, as they brand themselves, tests every batch with GC/MS analysis which you can easily view on their website, but their labels are inconsistent. All of them show the Latin name, but only some offer you the country from which the plants were sourced, but like the other companies, all useful information can be found on the website.</p>
<h3>Other companies</h3>
<p>The popular multi-level marketing companies, dōTERRA and Young Living didn’t make our top picks for several important reasons: their high retail prices, their lack of organic certification for all of their oils, and their insistence that most of their essential oils are safe to take internally not giving any regard to the potential health hazards of self-prescribing without professional clinical supervision.</p>
<p>We want you to be safe and we don’t want abundant marketing to convince you that you can be your own chemist without the necessary training. For all of these reasons, we have chosen not to include these companies in our testing.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Every one of the oils we tested offered their own unique signatures of aroma, and with this very subjective task we have undertaken, it made finding the best essential oils an extremely difficult project. Our criteria was strict and our noses were ready for the challenge. When it comes to your health we didn’t want to let money be a deterrent for finding you the truly best.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stillpointaromatics.com/essential-oils" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stillpoint Aromatics</a>, with their vibrant, rich scents, plus their devotion to the utmost of quality in sourcing, storage and preservation made them stand out high above the crowd. You can sense the life and the energy in these oils, and no other brand can compare to that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.floracopeia.com/Essential-Oils/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Floracopeia</a> has a passionate dedication for the health of the planet and the farmers who work upon it, while providing pure and authentic essential oils. Their freshness and integrity is present in every bottle of oil they offer, and at nearly half the price of our top pick they earn a deserving and proud second place.</p>
<p>Everyone has their own preferences in scents, brands and quality, so your personal opinions on what you like best may differ from ours. With a respectful, neutral perspective and a fresh experience on essential oils we are confident that you will get the most exceptional products from these companies.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter more than 30 hours of initial testing and over six months of long-term testing, extensive discussions with our 10-person focus group and several conversations with nationally recognized research doctors like Dr. Rapaport, we determined that the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X8ZVY62/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Brookstone &#8211; Shiatsu Neck Massager</a> is the best neck massager on the market. Its premium build quality, simple operation and effective pain relief make it a strong winner.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-chose">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>While researching neck massagers, we discovered that <strong>there isn’t a defining industry leader</strong> or even a group of brand names that are strongly associated with the category. On top of that, there are literally hundreds of options available on Amazon and other stores. For someone with lots of muscle aches and pains, the selection can be overwhelming.</p>
<p>In order to narrow the list down, the first thing we did was eliminate any massagers that didn’t have at least a four-star rating on Amazon. We also looked for massagers that were positively reviewed by at least a few websites, including Consumer Reports and others.</p>
<p>Another decision we had to make was whether to limit the finalists to electric massagers or include one of the many “manual” massagers available as well. After speaking to several doctors, including Dr. Rapaport of Emory University, we decided to stick with electric massagers only.</p>
<p>There were a few reasons that led us to this decision. <strong>Ultimately, it was the fact that</strong> <strong>high-quality electric massagers will produce the therapeutic and medical benefits of a neck massage more consistently</strong>. Manual massagers, on the other hand, require the user to have strength, flexibility and at least some knowledge of technique.</p>
<p>Plus, having an electric massager is just more relaxing in general.</p>

<p>Any time we test a product that has one primary purpose, the most important metric is, of course, how well it performs that task. While that was also true for neck massagers, measuring “pain relief” can be difficult to quantify. One person&#8217;s rating of a muscle ache or pain could be completely different than the next person&#8217;s.</p>
<p>In order to make our data more qualitative and to control for the variety of ways that people rank muscle aches and pains, we gathered a group of 10 different people, with a range of ages and other demographics, as an ad-hoc focus group.</p>
<p>Along with the focus group we looked at the functionality of each massager, how easy they were to set up and transport, as well as the materials used and overall build quality of each massager.</p>
<h2 id="focus-group">Using a focus group to gain insight</h2>
<p>We took an in-depth look into each of our five finalists. However, determining a “best” neck massager can be subjective, since everyone’s opinion on what constitutes a “good” neck massage can differ.</p>
<p>We used the feedback from our focus group participants alongside our own analysis and testing of the products to determine the best option available.</p>
<p>One of the primary benefits of using a neck massager is the fact that, unlike a professional massage therapist, it can be used any time. <strong>Daily or weekly use of a neck massager is key to maximizing the health benefits of neck massage in general, so our focus group questions were oriented around metrics that would indicate (and encourage) regular use of the product.</strong></p>
<p>We wanted to know how much better (or worse) their muscles felt before and after using each massager and whether their overall pain level was reduced in a significant way.</p>
<p>These are the results of our focus group:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3933 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/focus-group-scores.png" alt="focus group results chart" width="880" height="540" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/focus-group-scores.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/focus-group-scores-610x374.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/focus-group-scores-360x221.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/focus-group-scores-375x230.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/focus-group-scores-414x254.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/focus-group-scores-295x181.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/focus-group-scores-180x110.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/focus-group-scores-320x196.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Aesthetics and style</h3>
<p>While the appearance of each neck massager is certainly not the most important measurement used when picking a product, it still makes a difference in the purchasing process.</p>
<p>If the product owner thinks the item looks tacky, more often than not it’ll end up in the closet or a drawer somewhere and will probably be used less often. If, on the other hand, a massager is well-designed, it’ll be more likely to stay in the bedroom or living room, where it will probably be used more often to reduce muscle aches and pains.</p>
<p>Our top pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X8ZVY62/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brookstone</a>, slightly edged out our top portable pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZDOAVHA/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gideon</a>, with respective scores of 7.1 and seven.</p>
<h3>User friendliness</h3>
<p>When we selected our five neck &amp; shoulder massager finalists, we made a point of selecting products that were simple and straightforward to operate to help relieve some pain without causing operation pains.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3936 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brookstone-buttons.jpg" alt="brookstone buttons" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brookstone-buttons.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brookstone-buttons-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brookstone-buttons-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brookstone-buttons-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brookstone-buttons-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brookstone-buttons-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brookstone-buttons-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brookstone-buttons-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brookstone-buttons-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brookstone-buttons-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The only exception, the PurePulse, is still fairly simple to operate once you&#8217;ve read the instructions. However, it is certainly more complicated to operate than the other finalists. This was ultimately reflected in the score the PurePulse received amongst our focus group participants.</p>
<p>In this category, our top portable pick, the Gideon, slightly beat out the Brookstone with scores of nine and 8.9.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>We asked each of our focus group participants to rate the overall design of each massager. Unlike the “aesthetics and style” question, design is more closely linked to general usability, as well as the ergonomics and layout of the neck massager itself. In this category, the Brookstone was far ahead of the pack with a score of 8.5. The PurePulse, on the other hand, only achieved a score of 3.8.</p>
<h3>Pain relief</h3>
<p>Pain relief is, of course, the most important measurement when rating neck massagers. For the purposes of our focus group, we asked our participants to group anything that could be considered “pain relief” — including relaxation, muscle ache reduction, decreases in muscle tension, improved blood circulation, sense of well-being and reduction in any pain they had before using the massager — into this category.</p>
<p>All of our finalists fared reasonably well in this category, but our top pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X8ZVY62/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brookstone</a>, was hands-down the standout.</p>
<h3>Would you use it again?</h3>
<p>This question is somewhat redundant to the rest of the questions we asked, but we really wanted to drive home the point that a neck massager is only beneficial if it is actually used. Once again, the Brookstone led with a score of 8.5. In comparison, the PurePulse only earned a score of 5.6.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-know">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>Neck massagers can be used simply as a basic relaxation tool. If you aren’t looking for specific health benefits, you can choose any high-quality option and likely be satisfied with a pain and stress-relieving neck massage.</p>
<p>However, if you are interested specifically in the health benefits of neck massage or have other health issues that may limit which massagers you’re able to use effectively, it’s important to choose a product that is suitable for you.</p>
<p>One of the most important considerations when choosing a neck and shoulder massager is deciding how you want the pressure applied to the muscles themselves. Among our finalists, there were three different methods: arm strength, body weight and electrical power.</p>
<p>Both the Brookstone and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0754MVRXN/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LiBa</a> use arm strength to generate pressure. While each of these massagers has rotating shiatsu-style nodes, the majority of the pressure is generated by pulling down on the massager using your arms.</p>
<p>For those who are able to properly utilize this design, it offers significant flexibility, both in the amount and the specific location that pressure is applied. However, individuals who don’t have the necessary arm strength or dexterity or who simply don’t want to have to pull while receiving a massage, should probably consider a different option.</p>
<p>The second method of generating pressure is body weight. Both the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZDOAVHA/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gideon</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BOYA2M2/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zyllion</a> use this method.</p>
<p>Another important consideration is portability. If product use will be limited to the home, then any of our finalists are viable options. If you plan on using the neck massager at work or in the car, portability becomes a more important factor.</p>
<p>If you work at a desk, you probably won’t be able to use the Brookstone, since it requires your arms to be used to apply pressure on your neck. While you could certainly take a break from work to use the Brookstone, using the Gideon (which is our top portable massager) is easier and will allow you to continue working at the same time.</p>
<h2 id="health-benefits">The significant health benefits of massage</h2>
<p>There is a growing body of research on the many benefits of massages and the latest research indicates that there are substantial benefits directly associated with massages — neck massages in particular.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone has the means or time, to visit a massage therapist one or more times each week. Fortunately, according to the doctors we spoke to, neck massagers (such as the ones we are reviewing here) provide many of the same benefits.</p>
<p>The reason for this is fairly straightforward: Within the neck, there is something known as the “neurovascular bundle”. Stimulating this bundle, for example with a shiatsu-style neck massager, leads to reduced stress levels, increased relaxation and decreases in inflammation, among other benefits.</p>
<h2 id="massage-benefits">Massage benefits for specific health conditions</h2>
<p>We spoke with several medical experts. Most notable was our conversation with Dr. Mark Rapaport, a <a href="http://www.psychiatry.emory.edu/faculty/rapaport_mark.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chairman at the Emory University School of Medicine</a> who has published more than 180 peer-reviewed studies for a variety of prominent publications. Our conversation with Dr. Rapaport was also instrumental in conducting our review of the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/foot-massagers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best foot massagers</a> as well.</p>
<p>In addition to providing health benefits to generally healthy individuals, neck massages also provide significant health benefits for a wide variety of health conditions.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><div class="ybd-expert"><div class="ybd-expert-outer"><img class="  ybd-expert-headshot" data-src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/avatar-nophoto.png" /><div class="ybd-expert-inner"><h4 class="ybd-expert-title">Expert Consulted:</h4><h5 class="ybd-expert-person">Dr. Mark Rapaport</h5><p class="ybd-expert-person-title">Chairman - Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Emory University School of Medicine</p></div></div></div></span></p>
<p>Our conversation with Dr. Rapaport educated us to the fact that individuals with a generalized anxiety disorder were recorded to have dramatically lower cortisol and stress levels, with increases in oxytocin levels and a general sense of well-being, after receiving a neck massage.</p>
<p>Another excellent example of how neck massages can provide health benefits comes from the studies which indicate that massages lead to decreased stress levels in women who have recently undergone a C-section. The corresponding decrease in cortisol levels and increased levels of oxytocin are excellent both for the mother and her newborn child.</p>
<p>There is also a growing body of research indicating that massages can have a significant impact on inflammatory markers. This helps reduce the time needed to heal from injuries or surgery and could potentially have dramatic benefits for individuals suffering from autoimmune disorders such as arthritis, Crohn’s disease and even allergies. Dr. Thomas Best of Ohio State University is one of the leading researchers in this field.</p>
<p>While the specific benefits are still being researched, one thing is clear: Neck massages offer significant benefits both for healthy individuals and those suffering from a wide range of medical conditions.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brookstone-Shiatsu-Neck-Massager-Pound/dp/B06X8ZVY62?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brookstone &#8211; Shiatsu Neck Massager</a> was our top pick overall for a variety of reasons. In addition to feeling like the most “premium” product among the finalists, the versatility of the massager alongside the simplicity of operating it made the Brookstone an approachable and effective tool.</p>
<p>One of the things we liked most about the Brookstone was the ability to directly control where the massager was working and the precise intensity at any given moment on your muscles. While massagers like the Gideon and the Zyllion can technically be placed anywhere along the neck, shoulder or back, the Brookstone allowed for much more precise and fluid control.</p>
<p>That added control means we could also target very specific muscles on our neck and back. This was ideal for focusing on tough knots that would otherwise be difficult — if not impossible — to reach.</p>
<p>This was also the case with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0754MVRXN/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LiBa neck massager</a>. However, there were other issues with the LiBa that took it out of contention for the best choice overall. <strong>Most notable and significant was the fact that</strong> <strong>the material on the Liba started to wear down after just a few weeks of testing</strong>. Compared to the Brookstone, we predict that the Liba would last far less time with regular use.</p>
<p>Another thing we particularly liked about the Brookstone was the visual and physical aesthetics. In addition to looking and feeling like a high-quality product, the material itself was sturdy and stable, while also having just enough “give” to make the product flexible and easy to use.</p>

<p>The controls of the Brookstone were very simple as well. After putting your arms through their respective openings, there are three buttons on the left side: one to turn the massager on and off, one to turn the heat on and off and one to reverse (or lock) the direction of the shiatsu nodes. That being said, it’s worth noting that all of our finalists were essentially as easy to operate.</p>

<h3>Things we didn’t like</h3>
<p>While the Brookstone was hands-down the best product we tested, there were a couple of things we didn’t like.</p>
<p><strong>First and most significant for those who are elderly or have a medical condition, the Brookstone massager requires moderate arm mobility and strength</strong>. While a healthy 30-year-old will have no problem in this regard, it could potentially be an issue for others.</p>
<p>If you’re concerned about the strength and mobility needed to use the Brookstone, here’s a good rule of thumb: if you can easily put on a heavy sweater, you should have no problem using the Brookstone.</p>
<p>The other issue we had with the Brookstone was the lack of portability. In addition to requiring a wall outlet to operate, we would have liked the cord itself to be a little longer. We found that using a surge strip or extension cord in conjunction with massager made things much easier.</p>
<p>If portability is a major concern for you, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XJTVPXU/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brookstone does offer a wireless version of their massager</a>, which can usually be purchased for about $30 more on Amazon.</p>
<h3>Findings from the focus group</h3>

<p>Our focus group largely matched our own analysis and testing of the Brookstone. The most notable numbers in the focus group were the “user-friendly” and “pain relief” scores, which were 8.9 and 8.7 out of 10, respectively.</p>
<p>On the user-friendly metric, individuals in our focus group liked that there weren’t lots of buttons or settings and no one needed to read the instruction manual that came with the massager. The three icons are self-explanatory and universal as well.</p>
<p>For pain relief, which is, of course, the single most important metric, users in our focus group thought the kneading shiatsu-style massage did a particularly great job of loosening and relaxing the shoulder and neck muscles.</p>
<p>The Brookstone also did a solid job in the mid and lower back area, however, both our focus group and our own testing indicated that the massager performed best in the neck and shoulder area.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Brookstone is the most effective massager we tested.</li>
<li>The build quality of the Brookstone exceeded the other massagers, particularly the LiBa, which looks very similar.</li>
<li>This model requires a wall outlet. If you want a portable model, try the Brookstone Cordless.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZDOAVHA/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gideon neck massager</a> is another strong choice and may even be better for those who have medical conditions or are otherwise unable to exert the arm strength and mobility that the Brookstone massager requires.</p>
<p>The Gideon is controlled with a simple switch located about halfway down the power cord. Controlling the Gideon is easy as well, with only three options to choose from.</p>
<p>One of the biggest downsides to our top pick, the Brookstone, is the fact that it needs to be plugged into the wall (or any AC outlet) and that the included power cord is only about three feet long. The Gideon massager, on the other hand, has a much longer power cord (about seven feet long) and also comes with a car charging adapter.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZDOAVHA/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gideon-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gideon-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gideon-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gideon-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gideon-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gideon-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gideon-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gideon-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gideon.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Most Portable: Gideon - Massage Pillow</h3><p>The Gideon has simple controls and can be easily used on the couch, in the car, and in an office chair.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZDOAVHA/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>This, along with the Gideon’s smaller size, makes the Gideon far more portable in practice. The Gideon is best for those who want to have a neck massager outside of the home — particularly in the car and office. The Gideon, with its “pillow” shape, is also well-suited for use while laying down.</p>
<h3>Things we didn’t like about the Gideon</h3>
<p>The Gideon neck massager is a strong product and is probably the best option for some people. However, there were a few things we didn’t like about the Gideon that prevented it from being our top pick overall.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the Gideon simply isn’t as effective at relieving pain. While the Gideon certainly works well, particularly in office chairs and while laying down, it wasn’t able to penetrate as deeply or precisely as the Brookstone. If you’re looking for the most accurate and powerful neck massage, the Brookstone is the way to go.</p>
<p>We also found that while that Gideon certainly does work for the neck, it stands out the most on lower parts of the back. <strong>In other words,</strong> <strong>the Gideon is better suited for those who want to use it in their car, bed or office chair</strong>.</p>
<h3>Findings from the focus group</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3942 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gideon-use-on-back.jpg" alt="gideon use on back" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gideon-use-on-back.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gideon-use-on-back-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gideon-use-on-back-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gideon-use-on-back-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gideon-use-on-back-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gideon-use-on-back-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gideon-use-on-back-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gideon-use-on-back-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gideon-use-on-back-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gideon-use-on-back-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The Gideon’s focus group scores were strong but not outstanding across the board, with all scores but one somewhere in the seven to eight — the one exception being user-friendliness. This is particularly noteworthy for those who are less technologically-savvy and also makes the Gideon a great gift for a grandfather or grandmother who prefers simple electronics.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Gideon massager works in both the home, car and office.</li>
<li>The Gideon is less precise but easier to use for those with reduced arm strength and mobility.</li>
<li>The Gideon has the highest user-friendliness score among our finalists, with a score of nine out of 10.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-others">Other finalists we tested</h2>
<p>The other neck massagers we tested all had their strengths and weaknesses. While any of them are viable options, we determined that both the Brookstone and the Gideon offer a better value overall.</p>
<h3>PurePulse</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3945 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pure-pulse.jpg" alt="pure pulse" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pure-pulse.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pure-pulse-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pure-pulse-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pure-pulse-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pure-pulse-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pure-pulse-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pure-pulse-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pure-pulse-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pure-pulse-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pure-pulse-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LOUW1WU/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PurePulse</a> was the most unique product we tested and most people probably won’t be comfortable using a product like this in the home.</p>
<p>Unlike the other neck massagers we tested, the PurePulse massager uses electrical pulses to stimulate the muscles, which in turn essentially “resets” the muscle, allowing them to relax. <strong>The PurePulse is FDA-approved and in fact, many massage therapists and chiropractors frequently use them on their patients</strong>.</p>
<p>The Pure Pulse is fairly inexpensive when compared to the other massagers on our list and is also the most portable — the four AA batteries the massager uses lasted several hours during our testing.</p>
<p>There are three major downsides that prevented the PurePulse from being one of our recommended products.</p>
<p>First, the adhesive pads will need to be replaced from time to time and most people will want to have their own pads for sanitary reasons. <strong>Second,</strong> <strong>our focus group indicated that this was the least user-friendly massager, with multiple settings available.</strong> Finally, the massage itself is also somewhat disconcerting for some people, since electrical pulses cause muscles to tense and loosen without conscious control from the person using the massager.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the PurePulse does work well and is utilized by healthcare professionals all over the world. It’s worth giving a try if you’re willing to experiment.</p>
<h3>Zyllion</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3946 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zyllion.jpg" alt="zyllion" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zyllion.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zyllion-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zyllion-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zyllion-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zyllion-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zyllion-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zyllion-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zyllion-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zyllion-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/zyllion-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BOYA2M2/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zyllion</a> was similar in many ways to the Gideon massager. However, both in our own testing as well as the feedback from our focus groups, we found that the Zyllion didn’t perform as well as the Gideon across the board.</p>
<p>If you’re trying to decide between the Zyllion and the Gideon, we think you’re better off with the Gideon (it’s usually a few dollars cheaper <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZDOAVHA/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">on Amazon</a> as well).</p>
<h3>LiBa</h3>
<p>Those looking for a budget option may appreciate the value offered by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0754MVRXN/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LiBa neck massager</a>. The LiBa looks similar in many ways to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X8ZVY62/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brookstone</a>. However, the LiBa costs anywhere from one-third to one-half the cost of the Brookstone.</p>
<p>When the pressure was applied using the arm straps, the massage rollers would often get stuck. This was definitely not meant to do while sitting at a chair or couch. When sitting and using the massager on your back, the rollers sometimes moved the actual leather casing, causing the rollers to get stuck and twist the leather. You would have to manually move realign the rollers back to the mesh portion that they belonged in.</p>
<p>While the LiBa is worth considering at that price point, it’s important to remember that there are significant differences between the two. Most important is the diminished build quality we found when testing the LiBa massager. <strong>By the end of our testing period, the LiBa was already starting to look somewhat worn and we doubted it would last more than a year or two with regular use.</strong></p>
<p>After about eight months of testing this item, a wire came loose and it hung within the right roller portion. The rollers broke the wire causing the red lights to go out. Shortly after the Liba stopped working altogether.</p>
<p>The shiatsu nodes in the LiBa also aren’t as effective as they are on the Brookstone. As a result, putting significant amounts of pressure on the LiBa causes the nodes to slow down significantly, particularly when compared to the Brookstone.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The benefits of a neck massager are numerous and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X8ZVY62/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brookstone massager</a> offers the best combination of pain relief, blood circulation, relaxed muscles, ease of use and value from the five finalists we tested. If you want a high-quality product that will last for years to come, the Brookstone is a strong choice.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more portable massager that is easier for those with limited arm strength and mobility to use, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZDOAVHA/?tag=ybdnck-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Gideon</a> is a strong option as well. Ultimately, the key is to find a product that you&#8217;ll actually use so that you can maximize the numerous health benefits associated with regular massages.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we picked our test products</h2>
<p>When we first started researching the electric foot massagers market, we discovered that there were lots of products available, but relatively few that were highly-regarded. This meant that the first step was eliminating products that had significantly negative reviews on Amazon.</p>
<p>We also limited our focus to foot massagers that were mentioned positively on forums, professional reviews, and Reddit threads. Finally, we spoke with <a href="http://www.psychiatry.emory.edu/faculty/rapaport_mark.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Rapaport</a> &#8212; a nationally-recognized doctor with experience in psychology, behaviorial science, and the benefits of massage therapy &#8212; as well as other doctors who helped us determine which electric foot massagers (as well as which <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-neck-and-shoulder-massager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neck massagers</a>) were best suited to have a positive impact on health.</p>
<p>We also strongly prioritized massagers with heating functionality &#8212; however we did make an exception for the MedMassager, both because of the significant number of positive reviews it had as well as the fact that it is designed to work differently than Shiatsu and heat-based foot massagers.</p>
<p>Once we narrowed the list, we looked for massagers that had the best combination of features and specs, and ordered the five products from that curated list to test in our office.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Once we had our list of five finalists, we assessed each of them individually based on a number of criteria, including ease of use, effectiveness, and features offered. We also took weight, portability, and power usage into account.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3957 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart.png" alt="feature comparison chart" width="880" height="561" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart-610x389.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart-360x230.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart-375x239.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart-414x264.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart-295x188.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart-180x115.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/massager-feature-comparison-chart-320x204.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>In general, we were looking for foot massagers that were easy to operate, comfortable on our feet, and had a substantially positive impact on how our feet felt after five to 10 minutes in the massager.</p>
<p>Secondary metrics we looked included the power usage of each foot massager while in use, the weight of each massager, whether the massagers had a handle for easier portability, and whether there was an automatic shutoff built in.</p>
<p>While these features did have an impact on our selection of finalists as well as our top picks, they were secondary to the actual operation and benefits of each electric foot massager.</p>
<h3>Foot massage focus group</h3>
<p>During testing, we realized that massaging preferences can be fairly subjective. Some people prefer intense ones that really get the knots out, while others prefer a more gentle and soothing massage; possibly with some heat to relax their muscles.</p>
<p>While we did our best to assess each machine as objectively as possible, ultimately we realized that having a larger sample size, which included a wider range of people, would help us find the best possible product.</p>
<p>We came up with five different metrics and asked 10 people to rate each of the electric foot massagers on a scale of one to 10 using those metrics. We also made sure each person had walked a lot that day, and felt like they could really use a foot massage.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3958 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results.png" alt="focus group reults" width="880" height="608" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results.png 880w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results-610x421.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results-360x249.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results-375x259.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results-414x286.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results-295x204.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results-180x124.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/focus-group-results-320x221.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Aesthetics</h3>
<p>For this category, we asked each member of the focus group to rate the appearance of the foot massager. If they were to own the massager in question, would they put it somewhere easily visible in a living room or bedroom, or hide it away when not in use?</p>
<h3>User Friendliness</h3>
<p>For the user friendliness rating, we asked each member of the focus group to describe how easy it was for them to figure out how to use the massager. This included both turning the massagers on and off as well as adjusting the massager to their desired settings.</p>
<h3>Comfort</h3>
<p>We distinguished “comfort” from the “pain relief” metric. For comfort, we asked our focus group to limit the rating to their comfort without the massagers turned on.</p>
<h3>Pain Relief</h3>
<p>This is the key measurement, and was used to compare how each person felt before and after they used the foot massager.</p>
<h3>Want to use it again?</h3>
<p>We used this metric as a way to gauge the “overall” score each member of our focus gave to the massagers. We specifically asked them not to consider the cost when providing this rating.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the survey made it clear that the </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JKS3HXS?th=1/?tag=ybdftm-20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RENPHO – Shiatsu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the favorite when taking into account all categories. Our testers found it to be the most attractive looking massager, the most comfortable and very user friendly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Relaxzen was a close runner up, ranking as well as the RENPHO in terms of aesthetics and pain relief. It ranked highest of our finalists in terms of being user friendly. However, our testers found it less comfortable than our top choice and were less likely to use it again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MedMassager also stood out for the significant pain relief it offered — even if the aesthetics were rated lower than average by our panel of testers.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 update</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We originally chose the Brookstone as our top pick, but it has been discontinued since we first published this article. For our update, we once again read through professional reviews, Reddit threads and Amazon reviews to find an additional three products to test in our office.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A focus group of four testers of varying ages (one of whom had completed a 5k the same day) provided us with their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">impressions and numerical rankings of the additional products. We compared these with the scores of our original models to determine our top choice.</span></p>
<h2 id="what-to-think-about">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>If you decide to purchase a foot massager, the first step is to determine what the primary purpose of the massager will be. If you’re getting one for a specific medical condition &#8212; such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or an inflammatory disease like arthritis &#8212; there are certain features you’ll want to make sure your choice includes.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you simply want a foot massager as a way to relax after a long day, you can be a bit more flexible about which massager you choose. You may want to consider an <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-anti-fatigue-mat/">anti-fatigue mat</a> for all-day standing relief. Insoles may help relieve the source of your pain too. See our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-insoles/">insoles review</a> to see if its something else you should add.</p>
<p>Once you know the primary purpose of what you&#8217;re looking for, the next step is to find the one that offers the features you want. Some of the features you should think about include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the massager heat up?</li>
<li>Are there intensity settings?</li>
<li>Is the massager easy to carry?</li>
<li>How noisy is the massager?</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll also want to decide whether you want a foot massager that is designed to improve circulation in your foot, or more of an “all-purpose” option. If your top priority is improving circulation, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IF89MY/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MedMassager</a> is hands-down the best massager on the market. This one uses a design that oscillates a platform to massage instead of Shiatsu style rollers.</p>
<p>If you want more of an all-purpose massager, it’s worth looking into the specific features and settings of each machine. In general, a product that provides heating, variable levels of pressure, and a shiatsu-style massage will be effective for general wellness.</p>
<p>It’s also worth considering the weight and portability of the foot massager as well &#8212; particularly for the elderly or those with health conditions. Having a handle can make a massager significantly easier to move around, and of course the lighter a product is, the easier it is to move around when needed.</p>

<p>One interesting consideration that we didn’t realize until we started testing was the challenge of using MedMassager in an apartment, hotel, or anywhere else that your floor is someone else’s ceiling. That’s because the MedMassager works by creating fairly strong vibrations &#8212; which can potentially be felt, and heard, from the floor below.</p>
<h2 id="health-benefits">The health benefits of massage</h2>
<p>In order to learn more about the benefits of massage, we spoke with Dr. Mark Rapaport of the Emory University School of Medicine. Dr. Rapaport has an extensive history of studying how massage helps, and is the Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Emory University.</p>
<p>Dr. Rapaport also has more than 180 articles published in peer-reviewed publications and has received grants from nationally recognized organizations, including the National Institute of Mental Health.</p>
<p>We spoke with Dr. Rapaport on the phone, and got some great insight into the significant and wide-ranging impact of massages on the mental, physical, and psychological health.</p>
<h3>General benefits</h3>
<p>According to Dr. Rapaport and the research studies he has published, massages have a number of substantial health benefits. These range from reductions in anxiety and irritability to a decrease in unhealthy levels of cortisol. Massage can also modulate immune function and increase levels of the “feel-good” hormone oxytocin.</p>
<p>Massage therapy is increasingly recognized as a powerful medical treatment, with benefits for everyone from cancer patients to reducing post-pregnancy discomfort. Even if you’re in great health, massage can significantly increase your quality of life.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Rapaport, massage in healthy individuals can decrease allergic responses and potentially harmful inflammation in the body, and can even improve temporary bouts of depression in otherwise healthy individuals.</p>
<h3>Medical benefits</h3>
<p>For individuals who have particular medical needs, massage can have an even more profound impact. For example, women who have recently given birth via “Cesarean section” (otherwise known as a C-section), can experience <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27502807" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly lowered levels of anxiety and pain</a>.</p>
<p>Individuals with severe flus and other systemic infections benefit from massages due to an increase in lymphatic flow, which helps to flush out the disease more quickly. This is also the case for terminally-ill individuals who are receiving palliative care.</p>
<p>Perhaps most interesting impact massage has on individuals suffering from one of the many forms of cancer. According to the doctors we spoke to and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26991721" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several peer-reviewed studies</a>, massage has a statistically significant impact on the vital signs of cancer patients.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Rapaport, a NIH study studying fatigue in cancer survivors also indicated a marked decrease in fatigue and other symptoms. Those studies are being followed up with a more detailed look into inflammatory markers, and how massage might improve those as well.</p>
<p>The bottom line is this: massage has been unequivocally proven to have substantial health benefits both for healthy individuals, as well as those with a wide range of medical conditions.</p>
<h2 id="health-benefits-foot-massagers">The health benefits of foot massage</h2>
<p>One concern that people considering a foot massager bring up is whether a mechanical option can effectively do the job of an actual massage therapist.</p>
<p>While there are certainly benefits associated with having an actual person performing the massage, the doctors we spoke to said that many of those translate to mechanical foot massagers as well.</p>
<p><strong>In fact, since the specific massages are complex, and the shiatsu/oscillation is so well programmed in certain mechanical massagers, in some cases individuals can be even better off with a mechanical option.</strong></p>
<p>That being said, a highly-trained massage therapist will always be better than a mechanical massager. But when comparing the one-time cost of a foot massager to a massage therapist, it is certainly more cost-effective to have a mechanical foomassager &#8212; if nothing else than to supplement relatively infrequent massages from a licensed therapist.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best overall: RENPHO &#8211; Shiatsu</span> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23199" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu.jpg" alt="Renpho - Shiatsu massager" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Renpho-Shiatsu-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When choosing products to test for our 2019 update, we knew we wanted at least one finalist with features similar to our original top pick (which has since been discontinued). Just like our original choice, the </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JKS3HXS?th=1/?tag=ybdftm-20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RENPHO – Shiatsu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> effectively combines Shiatsu-style rollers with air compression and heat to relax the muscles in your feet and remove tension that built up during the day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RENPHO ranked nearly equal in comparison to the Brookstone by our panel of testers. Even before we tallied the final scores, the impression this model left on our testers made us fairly certain it would earn the highest ranking. They liked the way it looked and the customizable experience meant that each of our testers found their own “sweet spot” after playing with the varying modes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The touch buttons are large enough and spaced far enough apart that you can easily control them with your feet. However, our testers preferred the remote control. The programmable settings &#8211;low, medium and high&#8211;are straightforward and easy to understand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you combine the variables of kneading intensity and air compression, the RENPHO caters to all users. Those who prefer a strong massage might combine a high intensity with high air compression, while those who are more sensitive might prefer low or medium settings.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JKS3HXS?th=1/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="" data-srcset="" width="" height="" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Top Pick: RENPHO - Shiatsu</h3><p>Ranked highest by our focus group, the varying selections in terms of kneading intensity, air compression and heat gives the user a customizable massage experience.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At only eight pounds, the RENPO is easy to move from room to room. Our testers liked the aesthetics, saying they would be willing to leave it out in the living room if they were having company over. It’s easy to clean, with a hard plastic shell that can be wiped down.  The cloth cover (where you insert your feet) is detachable and machine washable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing to note is that while it can accommodate different size feet with no adjustments needed, it reaches its limit at a men’s size 12. Two of our testers who wear a men’s size 12 reported that the space was just big enough to fit their feet, and was a little tight getting inside.</span></p>
<h3>Aesthetics</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RENPHO is priced moderately compared to our other finalists, and consistently scored high across the board in our focus group. In fact, the average score of 8 was far ahead of the rest of the pack, with Relaxzen coming in second place with an average score of 7.8, and the overall average for the seven massagers coming in at 6.9. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our testers agreed that while the size might necessitate putting the RENPHO away before guests arrive, the design was attractive enough to leave it out and the massager could seamlessly integrate into any room. </span></p>
<h3><b>User friendliness</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When researching products, we found that some had needlessly complicated controls and functionality. While customizability and flexibility are valuable, overdoing it on something relatively simple like a electric foot massager adds more difficulty than benefit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operating this machine was fairly straightforward, with clearly marked low, medium and high settings for knead and air intensity. Heat is as simple as turning on and off, and the time setting is color coded to easily determine which setting (15 or 30 minutes) is on. The remote control corresponded exactly to the settings on the massager, with LED lights to see which setting is active.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone in our focus group had an easy time using this foot massager, which is why it had the second-best score among our finalists </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(behind only the Relaxzen and tied with the</span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IF89MY/?tag=ybdftm-20"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">MedMassager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<h3><b>Comfort</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lining is fairly comfortable, although the polyester fabric isn’t as plush as the Relaxzen. You can feel the massagers underneath your feet before you turn it on, but they aren’t knobby. Our testers used it without socks for a fair comparison with other finalists; however, the manual recommends wearing socks (which does make it more comfortable).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The massager as a whole received a score of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">8.1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of 10 for comfort. While that seems slightly low for a top pick, it was the best scoring massager overall, and was well-above the average of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">7.0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>Pain relief</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pain relief is one area where this machine particularly shined, and was one of the primary factors in our naming it our winner. After all, the purpose of a foot massage is to make your feet feel better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we used the foot massager, the consensus was that the air compression and the Shiatsu-style kneading massage worked particularly well to improve blood flow and relax the muscles. After about 5 minutes using this machine, we felt pretty great.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our impressions were backed up by the focus group as well. This massager earned a score of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">8.9</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of 10 from our 10-person focus group, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which was the highest rating of all the remaining finalists</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>Want to use it again?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all four of the other metrics ranking so high, it came as no surprise that our everyone in our focus group was interested in trying it again in the future &#8212; leading to a score of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">9.6</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of 10.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before conducting the focus group, we already had this foot massager marked as our likely top pick based on our own testing and assessment. However, </span><b>with a total score of </b><b>43.7</b><b> out of 50 in our focus group, the </b><b>RENPHO’s</b><b> place as our top pick was solidified.</b></p>
<h3><b>Things we didn’t like</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, we found this massager to be the best option available. While it was relaxing, there were a couple of issues we noticed while testing that are worth mentioning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most significant issue is that it takes a while for the heat to fully activate. During our testing, we noticed that it took about 30 seconds to start heating up, and another minute and a half (for a total of two minutes) before the heat was significant enough to have a positive impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a foot massage that might only be five to 10 minutes, this is somewhat of an issue. Our solution was to let the massager heat up for about a minute before putting our feet in, which was an effective workaround.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we would have preferred that the massager heat up more quickly, it is reasonable to expect heat to take some time to turn on, and none of the other massagers we tested were any better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, those with big feet might not be comfortable with this machine. The massager itself is rated to fit individuals with shoe sizes up to 12</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.5</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, however </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">two</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the people in our focus group had a shoe size of 12 and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mentioned that it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> felt a little too “snug”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This massager is an excellent choice, and is easily the best foot massager we tested thanks to its effective foot massage technique, attention to style and aesthetics, and comfort and usability.</span></p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JKS3HXS?th=1/?tag=ybdftm-20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RENPHO – Shiatsu</span></a> foot massager was our top pick thanks to its effective foot massage technique.</li>
<li>The massager is easy to use, with clearly marked buttons.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only significant downside is the size limit, fitting only up to a men’s size 12.</span></li>

<h2 id="best-for-circulation">Best for circulation: MedMassager &#8211; 11 Speed</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3272 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/med-massager-1.jpg" alt="MedMassager massager" width="900" height="596" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IF89MY/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MedMassager</a> is very popular online and is frequently recommended by doctors as a way to improve circulation in the feet.</p>
<p>Unlike the other massagers we tested, this device uses oscillations to stimulate the skin and muscles to improve circulation instead of Shiatsu-style kneading massage with rollers. This results in a distinctly different foot massage experience.</p>
<p>This device has 12 settings, one through 11 and an “off”, which makes operation fairly straightforward. Operating the massager is as simple as twisting the knob to the desired intensity and putting your feet on the rubber pad. This machine has many intensity levels but it only has one oscillating motion, and no heat function.</p>
<p>According to the company that makes the MedMassager, the massager’s lowest setting operates at 1,000 RPM and the highest operates at 4,000 RPM. This means there is significant variance between each of the settings, making it easy for anyone to choose one that is right for them.</p>
<p>When first using this, we found that the oscillations were a little intense and took some getting used to. However, once we got past the initial surprise, there was no question this massager was relaxing the muscles not only in our feet, but in our lower legs as well.</p>
<p>One feature that is often overlooked is the “Arch Bar” located across the top of the massager. According to the doctors we spoke to, this bar is used to directly stimulate the tendon in the arch of the foot &#8212; known as the plantar tendon.</p>
<p>For individuals that have periodic or frequent foot and leg cramps, the stimulation of this tendon can provide significant relief. Even if you don’t have cramps or another medical condition (such as in our case) using the bar felt great.</p>
<p>One other minor detail that we appreciated was the fact the company has their website and phone number printed on the top of the massager.</p>

<p>While they won’t be earning any style points for that one &#8212; especially when compared to the Brookstone &#8212; it is useful to have that information available for those who have questions or problems with their massager. For the elderly or sick, this can be a particularly significant convenience.</p>
<p>Finally, this device has excellent build quality, which means it will last for many years. In fact, the it comes with a one-year warranty, with an option to purchase a three-year warranty for $29.99, or a lifetime warranty for $39.99.</p>
<p>Even if you choose not to purchase the extended warranty, the fact that such a robust one-year warranty is included speaks volumes about the quality of the MedMassager.</p>
<p>While this machine isn’t as relaxing or “therapeutic” as our top pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EP5EC2I/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brookstone</a> foot massager, we felt quite relaxed once we were done with our 10 minute session.</p>
<h3>Things we didn’t like</h3>
<p>While there are plenty of positive things to say about the MedMassager, there are a few negatives that stood out to us during our testing and focus group.</p>
<p>The first, and perhaps most significant issue is primarily limited to individuals that live in apartments (or anywhere else that your floor is someone else’s ceiling).</p>
<p>Since the this deviceworks by oscillating at a very rapid rate, vibrations are also transferred to the floor. What was surprising was just how significant those vibrations could be, to the point that we could feel them even when standing 15 feet away.</p>
<p>If you live in an upstairs apartment, the oscillations could be prohibitively loud and irritating for your downstairs neighbors &#8212; particularly if the floors aren’t that thick. If you do decide to get one of these and you live in an apartment, make sure you ask your downstairs neighbor if they can hear when the massager is being used.</p>
<p>Another design feature we would have liked to see was a handle. Unlike the Brookstone electric foot massager, the MedMassager doesn’t have an easy way to carry it. That, in conjunction with its 11 pound weight, could pose a problem for some users.</p>
<p>Finally, the it&#8217;s a specialized product. That has several implications, such as a lack of a heat function and just a general inability to be an all-purpose foot massager. This device is great for those who are looking for exactly this type of product, but others might find it lacking in certain respects.</p>
<h3>Focus group results for MedMassager</h3>
<p>This one came in second place, with a final score of 38.5 out of 50. The areas where the it was weakest were in aesthetics and comfort, with a score of 6.8 and 6.1 respectively.</p>
<h3>Aesthetics</h3>
<p>With its utilitarian appearance and somewhat-tacky large-font phone number printed on top, looks like it would be better suited for a doctor’s office instead of a living room. That’s because for most of the product’s history it was used in a doctor’s office.</p>
<p>The MedMassager has been used by doctors, physical therapists, and other medical professionals for years. It’s only relatively recently that this device has been marketed directly to consumers.</p>
<p>While this led to a somewhat weak “aesthetics” score, it’s worth noting this device&#8217;s appearance is also a reflection of the trust medical professionals have placed in it over the years.</p>
<h3>Comfort</h3>
<p>Compared to the Brookstone, as well as the other foot massagers we tested, the MedMassager is not as comfortable. This is largely due to the fact that the other foot massagers we tested allow you to sit back with your feet flat, whereas this one is set up on an angle.</p>
<p>Again, this is a reflection of the MedMassager’s primary role as a medical device in the past, so it’s worth taking the 6.1 comfort score with a grain of salt. That being said, if you’re looking for a purely relaxing, “spa-like” foot massager, the MedMassager might not be the way to go.</p>
<h3>User friendly</h3>
<p>One area where the this device particularly stood out in our focus group was it’s user friendliness score At 9.1 out of 10, this was the highest user friendly rating of all the massagers we tested &#8212; including out top pick, the Brookstone.</p>
<p>This rating matches our own assessment of the MedMassager. Operation is extremely straightforward, with a single knob turning anywhere from off to 11 for varying degrees of intensity.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3273 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/med-buttons-1.jpg" alt="MedMassager controls" width="900" height="596" /></p>
<h3>Pain relief</h3>
<p>Despite its simple operation, the MedMassager proved to be effective at pain relief; as reflected in its 8.2 out of 10 score. Once again, the MedMassager was second only to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EP5EC2I/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brookstone</a> (9.2).</p>
<p>One frequent comment from our focus group was that the pain relief from the MedMassager was mostly noticed after the massager was over. This stands in contrast to the other massagers, which provided pain relief right from the beginning.</p>
<p>The MedMassager is an excellent &#8212; if somewhat specialized &#8212; foot massager. If you’re looking for a foot massager that improves circulation, this one should be at the top of your list.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IF89MY/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MedMassager</a> is the best for improving circulation</li>
<li>The massager doesn’t have certain important features, such as a carrying handle, a heat function, or kneading massage capabilities.</li>
<li>This device is the most specialized of the massagers we tested, which means it is ideal for those who need its specific features, but won’t be right for everyone.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-foot-massagers">The other products we tested</h2>
<p>The remaining three foot massagers we tested all had one thing in common: they were decent, but not outstanding, products. There wasn’t anything glaringly wrong with them, but they didn’t excel neither.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relaxzen</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23198" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2.jpg" alt="Relax Zen " width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RelaxZen2-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Relaxzen was our second-highest rated massager in the aesthetics category; it looks like a pair of soft slippers and all our testers agreed they would feel comfortable leaving it out in a living room or bedroom. If you’re looking for a foot massager on a budget, this would be our recommendation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mechanics are more simplistic than our other finalists. The only variables it offers are a change of direction and the choice of adding heat. Our focus group gave it only a 6.75 rating for comfort, but it rated slightly above average with a score of 8 for pain relief. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best Choice Products</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23197" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu.jpg" alt="Best Choice Products - Shiatsu" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Best-choice-products-shiatsu-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our focus group testers jokingly referred to the </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0170XC7XM?th=1/?tag=ybdftm-20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best Choice Products – Shiatsu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as “Darth Vader” due to its sleek black appearance. Its heavy weight and large size made it less aesthetically appealing than our top pick, although one tester pointed out that it would fit right in with a modern design nail salon. It rated average for all categories, with mostly scores of 7 across the board. It has an open toe design, meaning that you don’t have to place your toe in an enclosed space as with some of our other finalists.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One issue we noted was that the remote control needed to be held very close to the panel in order to change the settings. The terms on the remote control and the device control panel don’t align; it took some deduction to figure out that “personality” on the remote control was the “custom” setting on the device. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the Best Choice offers a decent massage and is easy enough to use but our focus group were relatively lukewarm about this model.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3959 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runners-up-1.jpg" alt="foot massager runners up units" width="900" height="600" /></p>
<h3>uComfy</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DSICT1Y/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">uComfy</a> did an all-around decent job. Its appearance is fine, but feels somewhat dated, and the foot massage itself was close in quality to the Brookstone. However, the controls on this device didn’t work great, and there wasn’t much variation between the settings.</p>
<p>In our focus group, the user friendliness score was 6.8, which was towards the bottom of the list. It performed in the mid-seven range for the rest of the metrics, and was the closest of the remaining three to be considered an “honorable mention”.</p>
<h3>Homedics Deep Kneading</h3>
<p>We were disappointed by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DPMDWAA/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Homedics massager</a> because there were several very positive reviews. It is the simplest and most straightforward device we tested featuring Shiatsu style kneading massager rollers. However, we found the quality of the massage to be underwhelming.</p>
<p>The underwhelming foot massage was also supported by our focus group, which gave the Homedics massager a comfort and pain relief rating of 5.1 and 5.5 respectively.</p>
<h3>3Q</h3>
<p>The 3Q was similar to the uComfy in the sense that the controls don’t offer much variation. Features are basically limited to turning kneading, air pressure, and heating on or off without any variation in intensity. There are also two programs to choose from, without any description about how they differ.</p>
<p>In the focus group, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H8Z7DIM/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">3Q</a> received a score of 6.5 out of 10; the lowest of all our finalists. We think this score matches with our own experience as well.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discontinued products</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brookstone &#8211; Shiatsu</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We originally named the </span><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EP5EC2I/?tag=ybdftm-20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brookstone &#8211; Shiatsu </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">our top pick, but it is no longer available. In addition to looking the best, it was easy and straightforward to operate and provided the right amount of pressure and intensity on pressure points on our feet. Shiatsu-style rollers, air compression and heat work together to knead out muscle tightness in the feet and promote overall relaxation. Unsurprisingly, our top pick for the 2019 update possesses similar features.</span></p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The health impact of foot massagers are significant and scientifically proven. Whether you are an average healthy adult or you’re recovering from a pregnancy or even a chronic illness, foot massagers can improve your blood pressure and circulation, reduce unhealthy levels of cortisol from your body, and provide you with a general sense of well-being.</p>
<p>The other three products we tested did an acceptable job. However, if you’re going to spend $100 or more on a foot massager, we think its worth getting a product that will perform well for many years.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of publishing this article, the </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JKS3HXS?th=1/?tag=ybdftm-20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RENPHO – Shiatsu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> falls in the middle price range of the massagers we tested. Given its higher ratings in terms of above average ratings in every category we considered, we think it is more than worth it. This is especially true given the adjustable settings and strong ability to personalize the experience, more so than our other finalists.</span></p>
<p>If you want a more medically-focused product and aren’t as concerned about getting the “spa treatment”, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IF89MY/?tag=ybdftm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MedMassager</a> is a proven product that has been used by doctors and physical therapists for years to improve circulation.</p>
<p>If you enjoy relaxing to massages from time to time, or have a medical condition which requires regular massages, foot massagers can be a valuable and cost-effective supplementary device.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ith more than 50 hours spent researching and testing top products on the market, we concluded that the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MPV473S/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Smiley Daisy &#8211; Hibiscus</a> is the best essential oil diffuser available. Three years after we first tested it, it&#8217;s still the best on the market. From the new crop of diffusers in 2019, we also like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075V1R8LT/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InnoGear</a> diffuser. This one in particular is great for larger spaces.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-found">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We spent more than 40 hours researching essential oil diffusers in order to find the best products to test. We started by looking at the biggest brands in the category (such as dōTERRA), then expanded our search through subreddits like r/aromatherapy and r/essentialoils.</p>
<p>We also read through several essential oil and aromatherapy internet forums, read studies and articles about the benefits of essential oils and diffusing those oils, and read about the diffusers that industry experts recommended.</p>
<p>Once we knew what to look for, we narrowed our search with a few more criteria. Each diffuser needed to meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have an automatic shutoff feature</li>
<li>Operate for<i> at least</i> 4 hours</li>
<li>Have a water capacity of 120ml or more</li>
<li>Come with a trustworthy manufacturer’s warranty</li>
</ul>
<p>From there, we factored in positive reviews on Amazon and by professional reviewers as well as several interviews with brand representatives to determine which products we should test in-house.</p>
<p>In 2019, we looked for updated products that would fill a larger room and run for a longer time. We&#8217;re still happy with our 2016 top pick for most situations, but we found a new runner-up that will run even longer and added some style options for people who don&#8217;t like fake woodgrain.</p>
<h2 id="the-seven-best">Compare the best essential oil diffusers</h2>
[table id=258 /]
<h2 id="what-is">What exactly is an essential oil diffuser?</h2>
<p>There are several different types of essential oil diffusers on the market. For this article, we focused on ultrasonic diffusers. Ultrasonic diffusers are best for diffusing essential oils because they do not utilize heat in the production of vapor. Since heat can have a negative effect on essential oils, ultrasonic diffusers are the best way to get the full benefit of diffusing essential oils.</p>
<p>Ultrasonic diffusers work by vibrating the water in such a way that it vaporizes into the air. Since the essential oils are mixed into the water, they are carried along with the water. Ultrasonic diffusers generate the vapor without any heat, which best preserves the integrity of the essential oil.</p>
<p>Diffusers are better than any scented candle, because you can put more than 100 different essential oils into them. You can even combine two or more essential oils to create a unique blend.</p>
<h3>The difference between a diffuser and a humidifier</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21400" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/diffuser-vs-humidifier.jpg" alt="essential oil diffuser next to a humidifier" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/diffuser-vs-humidifier-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/diffuser-vs-humidifier-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/diffuser-vs-humidifier-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/diffuser-vs-humidifier-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/diffuser-vs-humidifier-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/diffuser-vs-humidifier-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/diffuser-vs-humidifier-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/diffuser-vs-humidifier-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/diffuser-vs-humidifier-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/diffuser-vs-humidifier-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/diffuser-vs-humidifier-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/diffuser-vs-humidifier-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/diffuser-vs-humidifier-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/diffuser-vs-humidifier-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/diffuser-vs-humidifier-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/diffuser-vs-humidifier-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/diffuser-vs-humidifier-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/diffuser-vs-humidifier-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>While a diffuser uses the same mechanism and adds a small amount of humidity into the air, the design of an ultrasonic humidifier is different.</p>
<p>An essential oil diffuser has a much smaller tank of water, usually somewhere between 80ml to 500ml. This means that the humidifying effects of a diffuser are relatively minimal when compared to a humidifier.</p>
<p>Unlike a humidifier, a diffuser is made from materials designed to hold essential oils. Crystal-clear acrylic water tanks let you see how clean the water is in your humidifier, but discoloration and cracking are common results of experimentation with essential oils. It&#8217;s possible to make a humidifier with a tank that can stand up to the organic compounds in common essential oils, but none of the models we tested in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-humidifier/">humidifier review</a> are designed to do so.</p>
<p>We did test some humidifiers that use a small heated pad to release the volatile compounds of an essential oil into the air without adding it to your water tank. Many essential oils change when heated, though. For those who want aromatherapy benefits and humidity, it is best to use an ultrasonic essential oil diffuser <i>and</i> a humidifier.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-essential-oil">Benefits of essential oils</h2>
<p>Essential oils have been <a href="http://www.utne.com/mind-and-body/history-of-herbal-medicine-ze0z1404zcov.aspx?PageId=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">used for thousands of years</a>, from cultures as far-reaching as Ancient Egypt and India. These oils have been used for a variety of purposes, from spiritual to medicinal, and there are a significant number of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0032645/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modern scientific studies</a> that support the theory that essential oils can be beneficial in a number of very real and quantifiable ways.</p>
<p>The following are just a few examples of the types of benefits that essential oils can provide:</p>
<h3>Eucalyptus</h3>
<p>Eucalyptus has been used across many cultures and is often used in over-the-counter medications. When placed near the sinuses or on the chest it helps with congestion and sore muscles. Eucalyptus is particularly useful for diffusers like the ones we are testing — especially when used for congestion.</p>
<h3>Lavender</h3>
<p>Lavender is typically used for bruises, cuts, and skin irritation. Studies also show that the scent can reduce levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Application on the skin has its uses, however lavender is popular for diffusers because it can create a soothing, relaxing scent in a room.</p>
<h3>Peppermint</h3>
<p>Used in many OTC remedies, peppermint can be added to beverages and soothe the stomach. Studies show that peppermint increases oxygen levels in the blood, and can help a person be more aware.</p>
<h3>Tea Tree</h3>
<p>Tea tree oil is commonly used directly on the skin, and can be used for everything from acne to fungal infections.</p>
<h3>Lots of others</h3>
<p>There are literally hundreds of essential oils to choose from, some more useful than others. We recommend you do some research to find a few essential oils that will work best for you. When researching and testing the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-essential-oils/">best essential oils</a>, we discovered that quality can greatly vary by brands. Proper use and selection are required to maintain safety and to properly enjoy the benefits of these oils.</p>

<h2 id="do-you-need">Do you need an essential oil diffuser?</h2>
<p>A surprisingly small number of people actually know what an essential oil diffuser is. When we conducted a poll, only about half knew what an essential oil diffuser was.</p>
<p>That said, diffusers are gaining popularity due to a growing interest in the health benefits of essential oils, as well as the fact that scented candles are not as safe as many once thought.</p>
<h3>The health benefits of essential oil diffusers</h3>
<p>For many essential oils, there are different benefits attributed to applying them directly on the skin, versus diffusing them into the air. Some essential oils shouldn’t be placed directly on the skin at all.</p>
<p>Essential oils serve a number of purposes, including the following:</p>
<h3>Aromatherapy</h3>
<p>Essential oils are used for everything from relaxation (lavender) to pain relief (rosemary) to decongestants (peppermint and eucalyptus). By diffusing these oils into the air, you can gain the benefits for hours without needing to reapply the oils onto your skin.</p>
<h3>Ambiance</h3>
<p>There’s a reason why many spas have a distinctive smell — they’re using essential oils! Oils such as tea tree oil have been used for centuries to create the ambiance of a calm, safe place.</p>
<h3>Insect repellant</h3>
<p>Many people are already familiar with the fact that citronella is a useful mosquito repellant. However, there are lots of other essential oils that work as well — which is a good thing if you’re not a fan of the citronella scent!</p>
<p>Essential oils that act as insect repellants include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cedarwood and eucalyptus for fleas</li>
<li>Thyme, juniper, and rose geranium for ticks</li>
<li>Citronella and peppermint for mosquitos</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, it’s worth mentioning that while there are candles that can perform many of the same functions as the oils listed, essential oils (especially 100% pure oils) contain none of the harmful chemicals found in many scented candles currently on the market.</p>
<h2 id="math">Essential oils vs. scented candles</h2>

<p>Some people think that essential oils are out of their price range. After all, when people think “essential oils” they often image an expensive day spa. <strong>However</strong>, <b>essential oils are in fact significantly less expensive than scented candles</b>.</p>
<p>For the math enthusiasts, here’s a breakdown:</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JDGC78/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">22-Ounce Yankee Candle</a> costs about $27 on Amazon, and is guaranteed to burn for somewhere between 110 and 150 hours. If we take the high end (150), and divide by the cost ($27), we get a cost of <b>18 cents per hour</b>.</p>
<p>The essential oil math is a little bit more complicated.</p>
<p>There are approximately 20 drops in a milliliter of Lavender essential oil, and 29.574 milliliters in an ounce. This comes out to about 591 drops per ounce.</p>
<p>A four ounce bottle of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TSTZQEY/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">Lavender essential oil</a> costs about $10.50 on Amazon, which means you can purchase 2,364 drops of Lavender essential oil for $10.50, at a cost of $0.0044 per drop.</p>
<p>Smiley Daisy recommends that we use about 3 drops of oil per 100ml, which means in the 350ml Hibiscus tank, we would need 10.5 drops, which we will round up to 11 drops. At $0.0044 per drop, those 11 drops cost $0.0484.</p>
<p>A 350ml tank lasts somewhere between 6 and 7 hours. If we estimate conservatively, that means the 11 drops will last 6 hours. Since the cost of the 11 drops is $0.0484, then the cost per hour is $0.0081 cents.</p>
<p>This means that the product cost for an essential oil diffuser is 4.5% of what it would be for a scented candle. When put into the context that essential oils have health benefits and scented candles have potential health risks, the choice is easy — even when we account for the electricity costs of a diffuser.</p>
<h3>Research on the dangers of scented candles</h3>
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/16/scented-candles-toxic-safer-options_n_7536410.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growing body of research</a> which indicates that scented candles are not as safe as many think. It&#8217;s not just soot: many candles release harmful metals and compounds into the air — including lead, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde.</p>
<p>While there are scented candles that do not release these harmful chemicals, a <a href="http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/P1009BZL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">significant number do</a>. This issue has underscored the value and importance of finding alternatives to candles.</p>
<p>If you currently use scented candles for anything from aromatherapy to ambiance, research your brand of candle to ensure it does not contain chemicals that could be harmful to you or your family.</p>
<p>A better option would be to switch over to an essential oil diffuser, which provides many of the same benefits as a scented candle. If you strongly prefer the ambiance of a flame to the swirling mist of a diffuser, think about putting an <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-air-purifier/">air purifier</a> in the same room to give your lungs a break.</p>

<p>There are a lot of essential oil diffusers available online. In fact, there are more than 32,000 essential oil diffusers available on Amazon alone. With so many products to choose from, narrowing the field to a few finalists can feel overwhelming. That’s why it’s important to filter for only the best quality <i>and</i> best value diffusers.</p>
<p>First, determine the size of the room you want your diffuser to cover. Most (high-quality) diffusers list the size of a room in which they can effectively diffuse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too much” diffusing is not a common problem with essential oil diffusers, especially since many offer a way to reduce output if necessary.</p>
<p>It’s also important to look at the water capacity of a diffuser, along with the estimated operating time. The operating time informs you of how long you can expect the essential oil scent to last in the room, while you can estimate the amount of water (and oil) diffused by taking the water capacity and dividing it by the operating time (e.g. 100ml and 2 hours would mean 50ml diffused per hour).</p>
<p>It’s also important to take into consideration the build quality of the diffuser you buy. Essential oils can be corrosive to some plastics, which means that a cheaply-made diffuser might break down after only a few months of use. All high-quality diffusers use polypropylene, or another strengthened polymer or material, to ensure the longevity of the product.</p>
<p>Ease of use is another important consideration. This includes both setup (which should involve little more than putting water and your preferred essential oil into the diffuser) and clean up.</p>
<p>The size, or dimensions of a diffuser might not matter to everyone. However, for those with limited space, it might be worth looking into a diffuser with a smaller footprint. Similarly, a noisy diffuser can be distracting in an otherwise-quiet setting — such as a yoga studio or even your bedroom.</p>
<p>Features such as a timer and ambient lighting can be a nice touch, and are worth taking into consideration when comparing one diffuser to another.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>In order to determine the best aromatherapy diffuser on the market, we ordered our seven finalists and put them through a series of tests in our San Diego office.</p>
<p>The first thing we did was open the box and read the instruction manual.</p>
<p>Next, we looked at the pieces and assessed how easy it would be to set up the diffuser. We also took into consideration the build quality of the diffuser.</p>
<p>After that, we looked at the settings and options available on the diffuser, including auto-off, lighting, timers, etc. We also took note of how intuitive the controls were, and whether we needed to actually refer to the instruction manual more than once.</p>
<p>We also checked to confirm that the specs and features listed on each diffuser’s product page matched the product itself. Specifically, we checked ambient lighting, operating time, water capacity, timers, and automatic shutoff when the water reservoir is depleted. Fortunately, all seven finalists held up to expectations, so we moved on to differentiating between their diffusing performance.</p>
<h3>Diffuser performance metrics</h3>
[table id=259 /]
<p>To test each of the diffusers, we closed the doors and windows in our conference room, which measures 21 by 10 by 12 feet, for a total of 2520 cubic feet and 210 square feet.</p>
<p>We then filled the first diffuser with water and the recommended number of drops of essential oil (we used sweet orange oil for our testing because it has a distinct and easily-detectable scent), making sure to use the same ratio of water to oil for each diffuser.</p>
<p>With the conference room closed off, we put the first diffuser at one end of our 8-foot conference table and calculated how long it took for the scent of the sweet orange oil to reach the other side of the table — with three judges to ensure as accurate a measurement as possible.</p>
<p>The notable performers in this test were the dōTERRA and PureSpa &#8211; Deluxe, both moving the scent quickly through the room. This doesn&#8217;t seem correlated to having a more diffuse plume of vapor or a faster (and thus louder) fan.</p>

Like the Innogear, This is a diffuser that really lives up to its room-size rating of 300 square feet.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NZFGLHS/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>On the other end of the scale, PureSpa&#8217;s Compact model put out so little vapor that it took eight minutes to reach the other side of the room.</p>
[table id=260 /]
<p>After measuring how long it took for the scent to reach the other side of the conference table, we left the room and let the diffuser run for 30 minutes with the doors and windows closed. We went into the room and touched the diffuser to determine if any parts were warm, and also used a decibel meter to measure the noise level from an inch away.</p>
<p>Note that the main sound coming from a diffuser is, in most cases, bubbling water. The models with the loudest noise level, like the Greenair and InnoGear, also have a small fan to help the vapor spread through your room.</p>
<h2 id="best-pick">Best overall: Smiley Daisy &#8211; Hibiscus</h2>

<p>While all seven of the diffusers we tested do a good job of releasing essential oils into the air, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MPV473S/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">Smiley Daisy &#8211; Hibiscus</a> was easily the best of the pack. The diffuser’s short stature, coupled with strong build quality and four sturdy rubber feet means that this diffuser won’t get knocked over very easily.</p>
<p>What makes the Hibiscus really stand out is the vapor output it produces, as well as the quality of that output. The water capacity of the Hibiscus diffuser is 350ml, which is more than double the capacity of most other diffusers we tested. With a maximum run time of between 6 and 7 hours, this translates to approximately 55ml of vapor per hour.</p>
<p>The diffuser also produced a strong stream of vapor, which could be seen as much as 20 inches from the table, or about 16 inches above the spout on the diffuser. It&#8217;s</p>
<p>The large capacity and strong vapor stream of the Hibiscus made a noticeable difference during our testing. We found that there was a strong scent — about as strong as when the diffuser was on — for about 15 minutes after we turned the diffuser off. The scent remained quite noticeable until the 30 minute mark, and a lingering scent remained until almost an hour after turning the diffuser off.</p>

<p>Operation of the Hibiscus is simple as well. The instruction manual has very straightforward instructions, and using the product feels intuitive right away. There are two separate buttons on the front of the diffuser — one for turning the diffuser on or off (including a setting for a 2 hour timer), and a separate button for turning on and off the light.</p>
<p>The light itself offers seven different color options, which can either cycle or be locked onto one color. The light itself isn’t particularly bright, so it could serve as an effective night light without disrupting sleep. (Especially if you choose the red light, as we found out in <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-night-light/#really-matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our night-light research</a>.)</p>
<p>Finally, the Hibiscus essential oil diffuser is quiet. In our office, which measures about 40 decibels with the doors and windows closed, the diffuser only generated 46.5 decibels of noise.</p>
<p>Smiley Daisy also offers a 180 day warranty, which ensures that, if you’re one of the unlucky few that get a defective product, you’ll be able to get a replacement at no cost and with no hassle.</p>
<p>Overall, the Smiley Daisy Hibiscus Essential Oil Diffuser offers impressive build quality and the best overall performance of the essential oil diffusers we tested. At a price point below $40, the diffuser is a great value as well.</p>
<h3>What we didn’t like about the Hibiscus</h3>
<p>While the Hibiscus was our best pick, there were a couple of negatives about the product. The biggest potential problem is the large footprint of the diffuser. Unlike most diffusers, which utilize vertical space in their design (and particularly for their water reservoirs), the Hibiscus is short and wide, measuring 8.3 by 6.6 inches (and only 3.2 inches of vertical height).</p>
<p>In addition, the light generated is minimal, functioning more as a design element than an actual source of light.</p>
<p>All that said, these negatives are very minor when compared to the overall package. We&#8217;ve been using the Hibiscus for three years now, and it&#8217;s still humming along cheerfully.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways: </strong></p>

<p>After three years of great performance from our top pick, we set out to find a diffuser that would fill a different role, but with similar strengths. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075V1R8LT/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InnoGear &#8211; Premium 500ml Diffuser</a> isn&#8217;t just great at spreading your favorite essence across a large space: It can also do so for up to 12 hours of run-time.</p>
<p>Our previous endurance pick, the PureSpa &#8211; Deluxe, relied on a low output rate to get long run times from its 120ml tank. The InnoGear makes no such compromises.</p>
<p>The InnoGear diffuser also has a distinctive look. Unlike the faux-wood or white plastic shells that are so common, this model features a metal screen that adds some contrast to the colored lighting options.</p>

This diffuser is a unique new look from a company with a great track record.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075V1R8LT/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>This design doesn&#8217;t solve all of our reservations about the Smiley Daisy. If you&#8217;re looking for a compact diffuser to keep at a desk or on a small side-table, this is even less ideal than our top pick.</p>
<p>One other tiny flaw is noise: this is on the louder end of the lineup we&#8217;ve tested. There&#8217;s a small fan inside helping spread your favorite scent to all corners of a room, and that makes it just a hair louder than ultra-quiet models like the dōTERRA &#8211; Petal. It&#8217;s not going to be distracting during the day in a large room, but if you can&#8217;t sleep next to devices that make quiet, constant sounds this isn&#8217;t the best choice.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The InnoGear is a large diffuser that will run for a very long time.</li>
<li>You still get a good, strong output from this design for the whole time it&#8217;s running.</li>
<li>A unique look sets this model apart.</li>
<li>The plume of vapor from the InnoGear is the tallest, but the most diffuse.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-others">Other finalists we tested</h2>
<h3 id="second-best-doterra-petal">dōTERRA &#8211; Petal Diffuser</h3>
<p><img class="full-width alignnone size-full wp-image-19569" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/doTERRA_Petal-Diffuser_web.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NZFGLHS/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">dōTERRA &#8211; Petal Diffuser</a> is another very strong option from our list of finalists. The materials feel strong and sturdy, and we expect that the Petal diffuser will stand the test of time.</p>
<p>During our testing, we also found that the Petal diffuser was able to reach the other side of our 8-foot conference table very quickly — the average our testers agreed upon was just 35 seconds. This is less than half the time that the Hibiscus diffused, and while not a particularly scientific testing method, it does say something significant about the dōTERRA diffuser’s ability to permeate a room quickly.</p>
<p>The light produced by the diffuser is a pleasant, soft white, and provides notably more light than the Hibiscus. However, the Petal diffuser is limited to only white light, as opposed to the wide range of color options offered by our top picks.</p>
<p>The Petal diffuser is very quiet as well. In our conference room, where ambient noise registered at 40 decibels, the Petal diffuser only generated 46 decibels when our noise meter was less than an inch away — comparable to the Hibiscus.</p>
<p>Similarly, the scent was quite noticeable for nearly 30 minutes after shutting off the diffuser (just like the Hibiscus), and the essential oil could still be smelled for about one hour after the diffuser was shut off.</p>
<p>Operation of the diffuser is simple. There are two buttons on the front, one for the light and the other for turning the diffuser on or off. One interesting feature we noticed was that the Petal Diffuser must have water in it before being turned on — however we consider this a safety feature that we are better off having.</p>
<p>Another strange feature we noticed was that the diffuser defaults to a 2 hour timer, and hitting the button again then cycles through the 1 and 4-hour settings before shutting off again. This is a minor quirk, but it did stand out to us during testing.</p>
<p>There were a few areas in which it fell short of our top pick<span style="font-size: 16px;">. </span>First off, the Petal diffuser produces less vapor and has a smaller capacity than our top picks. The Hibiscus runs for around seven hours, and the InnoGear can pump out approximately 45 ml per hour for ten hours. The Petal&#8217;s four-hour maximum runtime and its high price make it harder to recommend when you look at the competition.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the dōTERRA &#8211; Petal is a great product, and is more compact than the Hibiscus. However, in an apples-to-apples comparison, the Hibiscus is a better buy.</p>
<h3 id="all-day-all-night-diffuser">PureSpa &#8211; Deluxe</h3>
<p><img class="full-width" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PureSpa_Deluxe_web-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VKER63E/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pure Enrichment &#8211; PureSpa Deluxe</a> is a great product, and if we hadn’t also tested so many other great diffusers, we would have been confident recommending it as our best pick.</p>
<p>The PureSpa Deluxe has a 2-year manufacturer warranty provides peace of mind, and we like the clean and polished design (despite the overly-loud logo).</p>
<p>What makes the PureSpa Deluxe really stand out is its 8 to 10 hour running time, one of the longest we found<strong>.</strong> This means you can turn the diffuser on at the beginning of your workday (or before going to sleep) and it will run consistently throughout the entire day (or night) without a second thought.</p>
<p>The lighting is also well-executed, with the option to cycle through blue, green, red, yellow, and purple — however there is <i>not</i> a setting to stay locked onto one color. Also, much like our top picks, the PureSpa Deluxe did not become hot anywhere, even after running continuously for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Despite the positive features of the PureSpa Deluxe, there are a few problems that we couldn’t overlook, particularly when compared to the Smiley Daisy &#8211; Hibiscus and the dōTERRA Petal Diffuser:</p>
<p>First off, the water capacity of the PureSpa Deluxe is just 120ml, less than both the Hibiscus (350ml) and the Petal (150ml). That, coupled with the extended runtime of the PureSpa Deluxe means that the amount of vapor produced per hour is significantly lower than either of our top picks.</p>
<p>We calculated the vapor diffused by the PureSpa Deluxe per hour was around 12ml to 15ml. This stands in stark contrast to the Hibiscus (55ml per hour) and the Petal (37.5ml per hour).</p>
<p>This difference was noticeable in our testing as well. After 30 minutes with the PureSpa Deluxe on, we found that the scent in the room was certainly present, but notably weaker than it was with either the Hibiscus or the Petal diffusers. Furthermore, the scent was all but gone 15 minutes after turning the diffuser off.</p>
<p>Finally, the PureSpa Deluxe is notably louder than both the Hibiscus and the Petal diffusers. Our noise meter detected 51 decibels, which is about 5 decibels louder than both of our top picks.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the PureSpa Deluxe is worth considering if you want a diffuser that can run all day without needing to be refilled, and if you are more interested in having a subtle scent of essential oil in a particular room.</p>
<h3>ZAQ Allay LiteMist Diffuser</h3>
<p><img class="full-width alignnone size-full wp-image-19569" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ZAQ-Allay_web.jpg" alt="ZAQ Allay_web" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0161ZYOA4/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">ZAQ Allay diffuser</a> has one of the more creative designs of the diffusers we came across. The LED lighting looks great emanating from the long cap (which itself is available in multiple colors).</p>
<p>However, the diffuser itself only has a water capacity of 80ml, which with a maximum 4 hour runtime means that this diffuser only produces about 20ml of vapor per hour.</p>
<p>In addition, we noticed that the mist fell to the table — which indicates that this particular diffuser does not break the water into small enough particles to float through the room. This observation was supported by the fact that the it took 2 minutes and 15 seconds for the scent of the essential oil to reach the other side of our 8-foot conference table.</p>
<p>Finally, the build quality of this diffuser, while not terrible, can’t really compete with several of the other products we tested. For the $40 price point, there are simply better options available.</p>
<h3>Nestar</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22557" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml.jpg" alt="Nestar - 120ml" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We picked up the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JFPTSP9/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Nestar ceramic essential oil diffuser</strong></a> because of its compact size, clean lines, and affordable price. The tank is slightly larger than the similar Smiley Daisy &#8211; Love in a Mist diffuser below, and the rated maximum room size is bigger. The light only shines white.</p>
<p>While we like the look and the features on offer with this model, it just didn&#8217;t quite live up to the performance expectations we had after testing larger diffusers. It&#8217;s quicker to diffuse scents in an eight-foot-long room than many of the smaller models we tested, but it&#8217;s no competition for the dōTERRA.</p>
<p>This is smaller than our top pick, but it&#8217;s also a little bit more wobbly. For some people, that might be fine; it&#8217;s not going to fall over by itself. But for cramped quarters like a college dorm room or an essential-oil-friendly workplace, we&#8217;d prefer to give up a few square inches of desk space in return for certainty that you&#8217;re not going to spill scented water everywhere.</p>
<h3>Smiley Daisy &#8211; Love in a Mist</h3>
<p><img class="full-width alignnone size-full wp-image-19569" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SmileyDaisy_Love-in-a-Mist_web.jpg" alt="SmileyDaisy - Love in a Mist" /></p>
<p>The intricate shapes etched into the porcelain make the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SDM5XXG/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">Love in a Mist diffuser</a> arguably the prettiest product we tested. The build quality of this diffuser is fantastic inside and out, with high-quality plastic for the interior reservoir. The Love in a Mist diffuser also has several lighting color options, which can cycle or remain locked.</p>
<p>However, during our testing it took 3 minutes and 15 seconds for the scent of the essential oil to reach the other side of the table — significantly longer than our best picks. Unfortunately, we detected 52 decibels of noise next to the diffuser, notably louder than our best picks.</p>
<p>While this is a beautiful diffuser, it is more expensive than the other products we tested (around $60) with less impressive results. However, if you are more concerned with beauty rather than peak performance, this is a compelling (and reasonably functional) option.</p>
<h3>PureSpa Compact Diffuser</h3>
<p><img class="full-width alignnone size-full wp-image-19569" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PureSpa_color-change_web.jpg" alt="PureSpa_color-change_web" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VKEEY8E/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">PureSpa Compact diffuser</a> is one of the most popular options on the market, with thousands of Amazon reviews averaging 4.6 stars. This diffuser is simple, easy to operate, and provides 7 hours of diffusing with 100ml of water. This diffuser also has ambient LED lighting, and is made from cheap, but durable materials.</p>
<p>The most significant downside to this diffuser is the 100ml tank and 7 hour run time — which translates to a paltry 14.3ml of vapor per hour. This deficiency presented itself in the 2 minute and 30 seconds it took for the scent of the essential oil to reach the other side of the table.</p>
<h3>Greenair Spa Vapor+</h3>
<p><img class="full-width alignnone size-full wp-image-19569" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/greenair_Spa-Vapor_web.jpg" alt="PureSpa_color-change_web" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00889F0ZK/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">Greenair Spa Vapor+</a> was the last diffuser we tested, and overall it is a decent product. With a 150ml tank and a 4 hour run time, this diffuser generates an impressive 37.5ml of vapor per hour.</p>
<p>However, this diffuser is on the noisier side, registering 52 decibels, and the scent of the essential oil disappeared soon after we turned off the diffuser (within 10 to 15 minutes). This fact, in conjunction with the considerable vapor production, signifies that the Spa Vapor+ is simply unable to produce vapor particles small enough to remain suspended in the air for extended periods of time.</p>
<h2>Long-term testing notes</h2>
<p>After years of almost-daily use, both the Smiley Daisy Hibiscus and the dōTERRA Petal diffusers are still working very well. One thing we noticed with the Hibiscus in particular was that the residual smell of essential oils builds up in the reservoir over time. This doesn&#8217;t have a huge impact, but can have an undesirable effect on some scents.</p>
<p>We were able to successfully remove the residual scents by cleaning the reservoir with a little dish soap, some warm water, and <em>very</em> light scrubbing with a paper tower. We don&#8217;t recommend using any cleaning products beyond dish soap or vinegar, and make sure you triple-rinse the diffuser before using it after cleaning. Remember that everything that&#8217;s in the tank will go into your room air and lungs.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>All of the diffusers we tested can generate enough vapor to make a small to mid-sized room smell like the essential oil of your choice. However, some did better than others, especially when price is taken into account.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MPV473S/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smiley Daisy &#8211; Hibiscus</a> stole the show, generating lots of vapor and producing a long-lasting scent in our conference room. The Hibiscus also has excellent build quality, and its low center of gravity makes it a sturdy fixture on any flat surface.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075V1R8LT/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InnoGear &#8211; Premium 500ml</a> is a new model for 2019 that gets our pick for large spaces, with a 12-hour reservoir capacity and steady output. It&#8217;s also a unique style option that some of our testers loved.</p>
<p>The rest of the options all have their pros and cons, but for the money the Smiley Daisy &#8211; Hibiscus provides the best value <i>and</i> the best performance across all the metrics we tested.</p>
