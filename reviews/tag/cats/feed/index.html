<h2 id="cats-need">What do cats need in their diet?</h2>
<p>Cats are obligate carnivores, which means that they are sustained solely on the nutrients found in animal meat. Cats evolved as hunters and consumed prey animals that provide a high level of protein, low to medium level of fat, high moisture (from the meat itself) and very little to almost no carbohydrates. In fact, there is <a href="https://feline-nutrition.org/nutrition/your-cats-nutritional-needs-the-basics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no known dietary carbohydrate requirement for a cat</a>. The only grains a cat in the wild might eat would be the remnants in a prey animal’s digestive tract.</p>
<p>Indoor cats, however, do not get their daily necessary nutrients from prey. Their diet needs supplements of minerals, fatty acids and amino acids. Two amino acids — taurine and argenine — are vital to a cat’s overall health.</p>
<p>Argenine helps a cat’s body process ammonia that is created during digestion. Taurine is vital for development of a cat’s eyes, heart, muscles and immune system. Both amino acids are naturally occurring in prey meat. Many cat food companies add taurine to dry cat food to compensate for the lack of meat in the food. It’s essential, however, that a cat eats meat every day to get the amino acids he/she requires to live a long and healthy life.</p>
<p>Renowned veterinarian Dr. Karen Becker promotes a &#8220;<a href="https://youtu.be/v0lFwdNm_Go" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biologically appropriate diet</a>&#8221; to help your cat thrive. Your cat’s genetic makeup and internal workings are essentially the same as a wild carnivorous ancestor&#8217;s. A biologically appropriate (also called species appropriate) diet mimics a wild cat’s diet, which means high protein, high moisture, low fat and very low carbohydrates, all of which points to feeding your cat meat.</p>
<p>Dr. Becker also believes that many nutritional deficiencies and degenerative diseases in cats and dogs are directly linked to commercially processed pet foods. For decades, pet foods have been marketed as conveniences for pet owners. Many are cheaply made and loaded with corn (indigestible for both cats and dogs), soy, wheat gluten and other non-meat ingredients.</p>
<p>Cats are prone to potentially life-threatening illnesses resulting from carb overload. Indoor cats in particular are susceptible to obesity, type 2 diabetes, urinary tract issues and kidney disease. Several cat food manufacturers have upgraded their products. But many companies still make a product that provides little nutrition or benefit to your cat’s overall health.</p>
<h2 id="how-made">How is cat food made?</h2>
<h3>Canned</h3>
<p>The primary ingredients of canned cat food are fresh meat and meat by-products, which includes the cleaned carcass and internal organs of the slaughtered animal. The meat is frozen and either cut into chunks or ground. It is then steamed in water or broth, and the cooked meat is then combined with other ingredients, such as vegetables, grains, along with added vitamins and minerals. A starch or thickener is added to gel the mixture together. The mixture is packed into individual cans, <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-vacuum-sealer/">vacuum-sealed</a> and sterilized in a heating chamber.</p>
<h3>Dry food</h3>
<p>Fresh or frozen meat and meat by-products are combined with ground grains, fats, vitamins, minerals and meals derived from ground bone or ground dehydrated meat or meat by-products. This mixture, resembling bread dough, is forced through an extruder, which cooks and cuts it into shapes. The pieces are then oven-dried, cooled and sprayed with flavor enhancers and preservatives.</p>
<h3>Freeze-dried</h3>
<p>Cut raw meat is placed inside a vacuum chamber, which freezes the meat solid. The chamber’s temperature is gradually increased and pressurized. The meat’s frozen internal liquid converts to vapor and is extracted. Freeze-dried food may be fed as-is or rehydrated.</p>
<h3>Dehydrated</h3>
<p>Conversely, dehydration involves a heat process of removing moisture from meat. Low heat is slowly applied to the raw product until it is completely dried. <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-food-dehydrator/">Dehydrated foods</a> must be rehydrated before feeding.</p>
<h2 id="standards">AAFCO standards for cat food</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.aafco.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Association of American Feed Control Officials</a> (AAFCO) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulate pet food standards. The AAFCO is made up of scientists, veterinarians and animal nutritionists who have devised industry-wide standards for what ingredients can be used in manufacturing pet foods.  For any pet food to be deemed certified by the AAFCO, ingredients must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Species appropriate</li>
<li>Proven safe</li>
<li>Nutritionally adequate</li>
</ul>
<h3>AAFCO labeling rules</h3>
<p>Although neither the AAFCO nor FDA can enforce truth in advertising, cat food manufacturers must follow the AAFCO’s rules for the precise wording on the product label of how much and what kind of meat is in the food.</p>
<p><b>95-percent rule: </b>The named ingredient — for example, tuna or chicken — must weigh at least 95 percent of the total weight. If two ingredients are named on the label — tuna <i>and</i> chicken — then <i>together</i> they must weigh at least 95 percent of the total weight.</p>
<p><b>25-percent or “dinner” rule: </b>Cat food labeled as “dinner” must contain at least 25 percent of the named ingredient in the total weight. Other words you’ll see on the label that fall under the 25-percent rule are “entree,” “platter” and “formula.” If a second ingredient is listed — like “Tuna and Chicken Dinner” — then the second ingredient must weigh at least 3 percent of the total weight.</p>
<p><b>3-percent or “with” rule: </b>The AAFCO originally created this rule for pet foods that advertised a minor ingredient in the food. It’s been modified so the word <b>“with”</b> — as in “Cat Food With Tuna” — means that at least 3 percent of the total weight is actually tuna.</p>
<p><b>Flavor: </b>“Tuna Flavor Cat Food” means that tuna is an ingredient, but it only needs to be detectable. Many cat-food companies use “digest,” which is a flavor enhancer made out of the liquid of boiled meats (usually poultry or beef), to be in accordance with this labeling rule.</p>
<p><b>Natural: </b>“Natural” means ingredients made from animals, plants or minerals that have not been chemically processed except for standard preparation procedures. “100-percent natural” or “all-natural” means that there are no synthetic ingredients in the food.</p>
<p><b>Organic: </b>The <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/about-ams/programs-offices/national-organic-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Department of Agriculture </a>(USDA) has the same requirements for cat food as it does for food consumed by people. For ingredients to be labeled as organic, they must be produced without synthetic fertilizers, irradiation or genetic engineering. The USDA does not take an official position as to whether organic foods are healthier or more nutritious than non-organic foods.</p>
<h3>AAFCO definitions of ingredients</h3>
<p>The AAFCO is very specific about the proper naming of ingredients. The majority of pet food companies do not use ingredients intended for human consumption.  When you read the label of canned or dry cat food, make sure that the meat or fish used is actually identified.</p>
<p>A major controversy in the pet-food industry is a manufacturer using what is known as 4-D —  diseased, dying, down or dead — animal meat that is deemed by the FDA as unfit for human consumption. Although the FDA has “<a href="https://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074712.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compliance guidelines</a>” that forbid using 4-D meat as a potential health hazard, many veterinarians and pet nutritionists believe the FDA is unable to regulate all suppliers of meat for pet food.</p>
<p>So if a cat food label doesn’t state what species of animal was used to harvest its meat, you have no idea what you’re feeding your beloved tabby. The worst cat foods we analyzed listed only “animal” or a body part, such as liver, of an unidentified animal in the ingredients. We can&#8217;t surmise why, but we found more unidentified animal meat in cat food than we did when <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-dog-food/">dog food review</a>.</p>
<p>All ingredients are required to be listed in order by weight. Primary ingredients — those with the most weight — will be the first four or five listed. Meat or fish should always be the first ingredient. Water or broth is needed to cook the meat in canned food, so it will usually be the second or third ingredient.</p>
<p>The same rule applies to dry food before processing. Chicken could be listed as the first ingredient, but once that chicken’s been cooked and dehydrated, nearly 75 percent of its original weight is lost.</p>
<p>The following three AAFCO definitions apply to all meat processed in pet food.</p>
<p><b>Meat</b> is defined as “the clean flesh of slaughtered mammals and is limited to muscle tissue attached to the skeleton by tendons with or without the accompanying and overlying fat and the portions of the skin, sinew, nerve and blood vessels which normally accompany the flesh.”</p>
<p><b>Meat by-products</b> are rendered animal parts deemed not suitable for human consumption. They include internal organs, heads, feet, hair and unhatched eggs. Although by-products are not considered esthetically pleasing by many people, they are safe and nutritious for cats.</p>
<p><b>Meat meal and by-product meal </b>are meat and meat by-products, including bone, from which fat and moisture have been removed. Bone meal is similar to meat and by-product meals, but it can include entire carcasses. Unlike meat and meat by-products, animals other than cattle, sheep and goats may be used without identification on the label.</p>

<p>First, read the label. The FDA and AAFCO together enforce the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/Products/AnimalFoodFeeds/IngredientsAdditives/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">required labeling of pet foods</a>. All pet foods must be labeled with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ingredients</li>
<li>Manufacturer’s name and address</li>
<li>Feeding directions</li>
<li>Calorie statement</li>
<li>Guaranteed analysis</li>
<li>Nutritional adequacy statement</li>
</ul>
<p>All manufacturers of cat food must comply with the FDA’s regulations to sell their product. As long as the manufacturer follows the rules for labeling, they are free to add virtually any ingredient to their cat food.</p>
<h3>Guaranteed analysis</h3>
<p>Guaranteed analysis lists the percentages of minimum crude protein and crude fat, moisture and maximum crude fiber. “Crude,” however, does not refer to the quality of the nutrient but to the method of estimating the quantity of the nutrient.</p>
<p>This is where it gets confusing. If you see 10-percent minimum crude protein listed on a can of wet cat food, it’s not the actual amount of protein. The only way to determine the nutritional value of a dry or wet cat food is to calculate what’s called the “dry matter basis.” At first glance, it may seem overly complex to figure out, but it’s quite easy.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Step 1:</b> Subtract the percentage of moisture listed on the canned food’s label from 100. As an example, the label on the canned food lists moisture as 78 percent. Subtract 78 from 100, leaving you with 22 percent of dry matter.</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> Divide the percentage of protein listed on the label — in our example, 10 percent — by the dry matter 22 percent, equaling .45.</p>
<p><b>Step 3:</b> Multiply that result by 100, and this will now give you the actual percentage of protein in the canned food, which, in our example, is 45 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Repeat the calculation with the percentage of fat listed on the label, and you’ll get an accurate representation of how much fat is in the food. The dry matter basis works for dry food as well. Compare them, and you’ll understand how much protein and fat each actually has.</p>
<h3>Nutritional adequacy statement</h3>
<p>Any cat food manufacturer that claims its product is “complete and balanced” must be labeled with the AAFCO nutritional adequacy statement. The food has been tested using AAFCO Feeding Trial Protocols under strict guidelines. Look for this statement on the packaging, usually near the ingredient list:</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO Cat Food Nutrition Profiles for all life stages.”</i></p>
<p>If you don’t see the AAFCO’s nutritional adequacy statement, the product has not met the AAFCO’s stringent standards.</p>
<h3>“Made in the USA”</h3>

<p>By the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)’s definition, “made in the USA” means that all or virtually all of a product has been made in the U.S. The FTC is less strict, however, about pet foods. A manufacturer of cat food may indeed process its product in the U.S., but it may source lower-grade ingredients <em>outside</em> of the U.S.</p>
<p>The best you can do to ensure that the cat food you buy is made with U.S.-sourced ingredients is checking whether the company has taken the <a href="https://associationfortruthinpetfood.com/the-pledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Association for Truth in Pet Food’s Pledge to Quality and Origin of Ingredients</a>.</p>
<h3>Ingredients to avoid</h3>
<p>The following ingredients should not be in any cat food that you buy. Most will be found in cheaper brands as alternatives to higher-grade ingredients.</p>
<p><b>BHT or BHA: </b>Chemical preservatives added to fats to prevent spoilage. Banned in most countries for potential links to cancer, these chemical preservatives are still added to certain cat foods in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p><b>Beef tallow: </b>A low-cost fat that’s added as a flavor enhancer.</p>
<p><b>Carrageenan: </b>A thickener used in cat food with a gravy. Some research shows that certain by-products of carrageenan could induce gastric inflammation in both humans and animals, though <a href="https://medium.com/@edithmcamellia/what-youre-getting-wrong-about-carrageenan-e9f56e3ed1c5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the debate is raging on what to do about the additive itself</a>.</p>
<p><b>Corn syrup, fructose and sucrose:  </b>These sugars and other sweeteners are added to make lower-grade ingredients taste better.</p>
<p><b>Corn: </b>Often found as the first ingredient in cheaper brands of dry cat food, corn has little nutritional benefit for cats and adds unnecessary sugar and carbohydrates to their diet.</p>
<p><b>Ethoxyquin: </b>First created as a pesticide and a food preservative, ethoxyquin has been linked to cancer. It’s banned from human food, but it’s used in cat food as a preservative for fish and fish meal. A cat food manufacturer is not required to list ethoxyquin on the label if fish or fish meal was purchased from a supplier outside of the U.S.</p>
<p><b>Food dyes: </b>Often used in cat kibble, Blue 2, Red 40 and Yellow 5 and 6 have been linked to cancer in test animals. The dyes are added to appeal to your eyes, not your cat’s digestive system.</p>
<p><b>Generic animal fat: </b>If the animal fat isn’t identified on the label, you’ll have no idea from what species of animal the fat has been trimmed.</p>
<p><b>Sodium tripolyphosphate:</b> This FDA-approved salt is used as a preservative in meats to retain moisture so they weigh more and appear to be fresher. In Europe, it is an allowed additive listed as E451. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (a division of the CDC) suspects sodium tripolyphosphate may be a neurotoxin.</p>
<p><b>Wheat gluten: </b>Added as a filler to replace higher-grade proteins. Like humans, some cats cannot process gluten and may suffer gastric distress when eating it.</p>

<h3>Canned</h3>
<p><b>The primary ingredients are an identified whole meat:</b> The first ingredient should be an identified whole meat. Water or broth for processing will be second. The third and fourth ingredients should also be other identified whole meats.  If you see brown rice or corn or barley as the third or fourth ingredients, that’s too much filler and will add carbohydrates.</p>
<p><b>Whole unprocessed vegetables: </b>The nutrients, vitamins and antioxidants of whole foods will survive processing better than ground vegetables. For example, “peas” are more nutritious than “pea flour.”</p>
<p><b>Limited carbohydrates: </b>Don’t assume that if a food is grain-free that it has less carbohydrates. Many grain-free cat foods have starchy vegetables, like potatoes or sweet potatoes, which add unnecessary carbohydrates.</p>
<p><b>High protein, low fat, high moisture:</b> The AAFCO recommends a minimum daily consumption of 30 percent protein and 9 percent fat for kittens, and 26 percent protein and 9 percent fat for adult cats. These guidelines are simply for a cat’s survival. For a healthy adult cat, pet nutritionists recommend approximately 40 percent protein and 20-25 percent fat. All of the canned foods we analyzed had 78 percent moisture.</p>
<p><b>AAFCO nutritional statement: </b>Look for a statement on the can’s label that the food “provides complete and balanced nutrition for all life stages.”</p>
<h3>Dry</h3>
<p><b>The first three ingredients are an identified whole meat: </b>If you see salmon listed first, that’s great. But remember that salmon loses up to 75 percent of its weight during processing. So to make up for that loss, the second and third ingredients should be other identified whole meats (or fish) or meat (or fish) meal.</p>
<p><b>Whole vegetables and limited whole grains: </b>Whole vegetables and grains will retain more nutritional value than vegetable or grain flours during processing. Grains add carbohydrates, so look for dry foods that have grains lower on the list of ingredients.</p>
<p><b>Appropriate protein-to-fat ratio: </b>Using the dry method basis, the best dry foods we analyzed averaged between 38-44 percent protein and 17-22 percent fat, which is considered appropriate for healthy adult cats.</p>
<p><b>AAFCO nutritional statement: </b>“Provides complete and balanced nutrition for all life stages” should be on the food’s label.</p>

<p>Our recommendations are based on research and the analysis of fifty products that can be purchased at grocery stores, pet supply stores, supermarkets and online. We’ve consulted veterinarians and pet food nutrition experts for their opinions about what criteria cat food should meet to be considered exceptional.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-dog-food/">our review of dog foods</a>, we recommended Orijen &#8211; Original as the best grain-free dry food. We now recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I3IBQG2/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Orijen &#8211; Cat &amp; Kitten</a> as the best dry food for cats. All Orijen products are biologically appropriate, which translates to grain-free, high in protein and low in carbs. Orijen is a Canadian company that takes pride in using whole meats and fish in their foods. (Recently, Orijen began manufacturing in Kentucky as well.)</p>
<p>The ingredient list for the Cat &amp; Kitten formula is impressive. The first ten ingredients are deboned chicken and deboned turkey, whole eggs, whole fish and whole chicken and turkey organs, such as heart and liver. Because so much moisture is lost during processing, and the whole meats and fish lose 75 percent of their weight, Orijen makes up for the loss by adding dehydrated meats and fish. Other pet food companies we analyzed add filler, such as rice or potatoes, to compensate for the loss in weight.</p>
<p>The added greens are also unique. Mustard greens, collard greens, kale and spinach are often called &#8220;power greens,&#8221; nutrient-dense and loaded with Vitamins A and C.</p>
<p>There are several legumes in the mixture — pinto, lentils and peas — these are controversial ingredients in cat food, since cats wouldn’t eat them in the wild. However, legumes are considered to be a healthy carbohydrate: High in fiber and protein, low in fat and vitamin rich. Protein-to-fat ratio is an appropriate two-to-one with 44 percent protein and 22 percent fat.</p>

No other dry cat food compares to Orijen’s high-quality ingredients.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I3IBQG2/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Orijen has several other recipes that are marketed as “Whole Prey” to cat owners who want to feed their cat a more wild diet. The Tundra recipe, for example, has goat and wild boar, and the Regional Red has angus beef, wild boar, goat and Yorkshire pork. These recipes seem a bit rich, but surprisingly, they all have the same appropriate protein-to-fat ratio.</p>
<p>Champion Pet Foods manufactures Orijen and Acana, another high-end dry cat food. Acana&#8217;s four recipes also feature locally sourced meats, fish and game meats. Their website states that Acana&#8217;s dry foods contain 75 percent meat and fish and are biologically appropriate. There is certainly a lot of meat and meat meals in the Acana recipes, but with the added filler of several legumes, which cats don&#8217;t eat in the wild, we&#8217;re not recommending Acana. It&#8217;s a very good dry cat food, but Orijen is better.</p>
<p>All Orijen products are more expensive than other dry foods, but no other dry cat food we found can beat the amount of quality meat that Orijen puts into its food.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Orijen combines fresh and raw meats and fish with dehydrated for a dry food that is unparalleled in the amount of meat as primary and secondary ingredients.</li>
<li>With 90 percent meat, other ingredients are vitamin-packed power greens and several legumes as healthy carbohydrates.</li>
<li>Orijen has several other high-protein recipes with rich and lean wild game meats.</li>
</ul>

<p>New Zealand-based Ziwi Peak is one of the few pet food companies that only uses locally sourced and free-range meats and poultry. Ziwi Peak has developed their cat food recipes specifically for a cat’s biological needs: rich with lots of meat and very low in carbohydrates.</p>
<p>Understanding that not every cat’s digestive system can tolerate chicken or beef, Ziwi Peak also makes recipes with game meats (like rabbit and venison) which, for some cats, are more digestible. The company also has a few recipes with mackerel and hoki, a New Zealand white fish.</p>
<p>All of the Ziwi Peak foods are excellent and are packed with 92 percent meat (or meat and fish). There are a few complaints online that Ziwi Peak used to boast 93 percent, but we think that’s quibbling. One glance at the ingredients list, and you’ll see why Ziwi Peak is the best canned cat food you can buy.</p>
<p>The recipe we recommend is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MUXQ6IW/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">mackerel and lamb</a>. The primary ingredients are mackerel, water (for processing) and lamb, including lamb organs and chickpeas (which are actually pretty far down on the list). Essential minerals and vitamins are added, including taurine, but there are no grains, starches, preservatives or additives that have known harmful effects.</p>
<p>We should also note that Ziwi Peak is one of the few companies that adds green-lipped mussels to their pet foods. Green-lipped mussels are native to New Zealand and have <a href="http://lyprinoluk.com/pdf/halpern.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proven anti-inflammatory properties</a> for humans and pets.</p>

Adding to this protein mix are New Zealand green-lipped mussels, which help strengthen and support muscles and joints.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MUXQ6IW/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The mackerel and lamb recipe has a two-to-one protein-to-fat ratio with 40 percent protein and 20 percent fat. The rabbit and lamb recipe is substantially higher in protein (50 percent) and not surprisingly, since rabbit is a lean meat, only 15 percent fat.</p>
<p>A drawback for some people might be that all Ziwi Peak products are expensive, running about $3.50 per 6.5 ounce can with a recommended feeding portion of one can per day. Ziwi Peak can be purchased online by the case, and it’s definitely cheaper per can than purchasing a couple cans at a time. The quality of the ingredients is undeniable, however, and from our analysis, we believe improving your cat&#8217;s diet is worth this canned food&#8217;s higher price.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>All of Ziwi Peak’s cat foods contain 92 percent locally sourced meats and fish.</li>
<li>Their recipes were designed specifically for a cat’s biological needs and are high in protein, moderate-to-low fat and very low in carbohydrates.</li>
<li>A few recipes use game meats, like venison and rabbit, which for some cats are easier to digest.</li>
<li>Ziwi Peak products are more expensive than other brands, but the quality of the ingredients is worth the cost.</li>

<p>Instinct Raw Boost combines a grain-free kibble with freeze-dried raw chicken, duck or rabbit, depending on the recipe. The chicken recipe and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XDL6SMQ/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">duck recipe</a> are recommended for outdoor/indoor cats, and because rabbit is lower in fat, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XDF6CT8/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">rabbit recipe</a> is recommended for indoor cats, who are less active. There’s also a weight-control formula, but it’s only 1 percent lower in fat than the rabbit recipe (14 percent).</p>
<p>Both the duck and rabbit recipes start out with whole meat, followed by four meat meals, which is exceptional. Like many other kibbles, one of the primary ingredients is peas, tapioca and/or chickpeas. But Instinct throws in the freeze-dried meat cubes as a bonus, boosting up the protein and providing another excellent source of raw meat.</p>
<p>Also added to the ingredients are small amounts of freeze-dried rabbit heart, lung and kidney, so it’s not surprising that Instinct Raw Boost has one of the higher percentages of protein (43 percent) among the dry foods we analyzed.</p>
<h3>Rachel Ray Nutrish &#8211; Zero Grain</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21984" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nutrish-zero-grain.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nutrish-zero-grain-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nutrish-zero-grain-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nutrish-zero-grain-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nutrish-zero-grain-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nutrish-zero-grain-810x540.jpg 810w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nutrish-zero-grain-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nutrish-zero-grain-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nutrish-zero-grain-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nutrish-zero-grain-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nutrish-zero-grain-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nutrish-zero-grain-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nutrish-zero-grain-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nutrish-zero-grain-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nutrish-zero-grain-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nutrish-zero-grain-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nutrish-zero-grain-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nutrish-zero-grain-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nutrish-zero-grain-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Rachel Ray certainly isn’t the first chef to create a line of pet foods inspired by chef recipes. We admit we were skeptical, until we took a closer look. Rachel Ray Nutrish has three varieties on the market: the original brand, called Nutrish, and two specialty brands, Nutrish &#8211; Peak and Nutrish &#8211; Zero Grain. We examined all three, and Zero Grain has a lot more meat and a lot less filler than Nutrish and Peak.</p>
<p>There are two recipes for Zero Grain: chicken and potato or whitefish and potato. (Maybe somebody needs to tell Rachel to lay off the carbs.) However, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YXSQEOG/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the whitefish and potato recipe</a> is actually very good. Yes, it has potato, but it’s not in the primary ingredients. The first four ingredients are whitefish, salmon meal, menhaden fish meal and turkey meal. So, there’s more protein than filler in this formula.</p>
<p>Zero Grain has an appropriate two-to-one protein-to-fat ratio, but it is slightly lower in both than other dry foods we analyzed (38 percent protein and 17 percent fat). Nutrish &#8211; Zero Grain is modestly priced, and for a food that doesn’t have by-products, it’s a good value.</p>
<h3>Castor &amp; Pollux &#8211; Pristine</h3>
<p>The Pristine line of Castor &amp; Pollux’s excellent pet foods promises that their meats are harvested from animals who lived happy, healthy, free-roaming lives, and their fish are wild-caught.</p>
<p>There’s little doubt that the quality of the ingredients in the grain-free Pristine recipes are top-notch. But of the four varieties, we recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076JDTC5T/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">wild-caught tuna</a>. (It’s also the most popular of the Pristine line with cat owners.) The other three products have dried egg and organic peas in their primary ingredients. The tuna recipe also has the egg and peas, but the big difference is that organic chicken and chicken liver are in the top five.</p>
<p>With these meat additions, the Pristine tuna has an above average three-to-one protein-to-fat ratio with protein at 40 percent and fat at a low 13 percent, which makes this canned food great for indoor cats.</p>
<h3>Applaws</h3>
<p>MPM (Making Pet Food Matter) is a fairly new pet food company. Incorporated in 2002 and based in the United Kingdom, MPM produces and distributes Applaws around the world. The company is very strict about where and from whom they source meats, and you can tell with one look at their high-end product that they use human-grade meats and fish.</p>
<p>There are seven varieties of canned food, each with three or four ingredients; for example, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DBUKXJ4/z/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">tuna, seaweed, fish broth and rice</a> or chicken breast with cheese. Applaws sells the same food in pouches, which have windows, and you can see for yourself just how appetizing they are.</p>
<p>Each recipe is high in protein and very low in fat; in fact, they’re too low in fat for a healthy cat. Applaws knows they’ve made an exceptional food, but because of the very low fat, they cannot recommend it as a stand-alone meal. It’s very clearly stated on the cans, pouches and website that their food is supplemental and will not provide all the necessary daily nutrients.</p>
<p>However, if you’re looking to add a tasty topper to your cat’s regular (and hopefully, balanced nutritionally) food, then consider Applaws.</p>

<p>We understand that some pet foods are too expensive for people living on a limited budget. But we believe that there are products you can buy in any supermarket that are better made and healthier for your cat than those with familiar brand names. Your cat may enjoy the taste, but only because these low-grade foods have been treated with additives and flavor enhancers.</p>
[table id=246 /]
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B000R4CJQ2/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Meow Mix &#8211; Original</a>: This long-time favorite is an example of what pet food should not be. Its number-one ingredient is ground yellow corn, which, as we’ve pointed out, has almost no nutritional benefits for cats. The second ingredient is corn gluten meal; again, more corn and empty calories. Chicken by-product meal provides the meat source. Other primary ingredients are beef tallow (fat) and “animal digest,” which is nothing more than the boiled down juices of some unidentified animal. It’s cheap, and there’s a reason for that.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0040PYRZU/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Purina Deli-Cat</a>: This popular dry food is another cheap brand you should avoid. As with many Purina products for both cats and dogs, ground yellow corn is the primary ingredient. As if soybean meal and corn gluten meal (ingredients two and three) weren’t bad enough, other primary ingredients are “meat and bone meal” and “animal fat.” Both of these ingredients are low-quality, and because the species of animal isn&#8217;t stated, the meat and fat could have been harvested from any animal? Lastly, two carcinogenic food colorings, Red 40 and Yellow 5, give this kibble its unnatural hues.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002CJAOPI/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Purina Friskies &#8211; Mixed Grill</a>: Friskies is another popular brand with an array of canned foods labeled with appetizing names. Look at the label, and you’ll realize it’s junk food. For the mixed grill recipe, the first ingredient is meat by-products. So straight off, your cat will be nibbling on the carcass of an unidentified animal. The other primary ingredients are poultry by-products (could be any bird’s carcass), liver (could be any animal’s liver) and rice. Friskies is also one of the few products we examined that had carrageenan, which some say induces gastric inflammation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005DL797S/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Whiskas &#8211; Choice Cuts</a>: Whiskas is one of the largest manufacturers of cat food, and we analyzed several of their products. They all had the same problem: water for processing is their number one — meaning, the heaviest — ingredient. In this variety pack, all four have chicken, unidentified meat by-products and wheat gluten. Whiskas adds an infinitesimal amount of beef or tuna to their basic chicken recipe. As long as the cat can detect it, Whiskas has followed the AAFCO rule about what defines “flavor.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003MWERTS/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hill’s Science Diet &#8211; Indoor</a>: You might be surprised to see the much-hyped Hill’s Science Diet on this list. Hill’s has done a brilliant job at marketing. Their prescription diets are excellent and can only be purchased from a veterinarian. Their supermarket brand, however, is much lower quality. For this kibble, the first ingredient is chicken. It goes downhill from there. Whole grain wheat, corn gluten meal, wheat gluten and brewers rice pack this food with carbs. Way down on the list, a little chicken liver flavor is thrown in. Don’t be fooled by the advertising; the supermarket line is based on poor science.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Your cat’s age, weight and activity level will determine what’s the best cat food for him/her, and you should consult with your veterinarian if you’re considering switching foods. During our analysis of ingredients and nutritional statements of 50 dry and canned cat foods, we found many examples of products you should never feed your cat.</p>
<p>However, there were several stand-outs that upheld the standards of AAFCO’s regulations for “complete and balanced nutrition at all life stages.”</p>
<p>We recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I3IUWHQ/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Orijen &#8211; Cat &amp; Kitten</a> as the best dry food. This biologically appropriate food is a high-protein smorgasbord of ten whole meats and fish, whole eggs and dehydrated meats. It’s more expensive than other dry foods, but it’s certainly one of the best you could feed your kitty.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MUXQ6IW/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ziwi Peak</a> is an excellent example of what all canned cat foods should be. Each can has 92 percent locally sourced meat and/or fish from New Zealand. Ziwi Peak also uses lower-fat game meats and New Zealand green-lipped mussels, a unique protein source that has proven anti-inflammatory properties. It&#8217;s also more expensive than other brands of wet cat food, but you will be feeding your cat the best.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter 10 weeks of research and extensive in-home testing with our top five products, we found the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MA2T9BC/?tag=ybdlttr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Pet Zone &#8211; Smart Scoop</a> to be the best automatic litter box. In addition to being automatic, it’s brilliant at the basics: you can use regular litter, it has a familiar open litter box shape and is not disruptive with its quiet cleaning. Our test cats, Kit Kat and Jelly Bean, preferred its familiar, open design and we appreciated its low maintenance and efficient cleaning. Coming in as our runner-up, the highly regarded<a href="http://share.litter-robot.com/lS7vb" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Litter-Robot III &#8211; Open Air</a> litter box offers impressive design, but at a higher cost.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>The promise of having to scoop even one less clump of litter is enticing to any cat owner. However, these products can feel like an expensive gamble as they can be ten times more expensive than a manual litter box and have less-than-stellar reviews.</p>
<p>Our research brought us to many articles that only ranked the automatic litter boxes by their advertised features and consumer reviews. Unfortunately, we didn’t come across articles with any real in-home testing, so we took this opportunity to do our own discovery.</p>
<p>We also combed through the /r/Pets subreddit, where it seemed like many cat owners resorted to their own hacks for manual litter box clean-up since automatic litter boxes can be tricky. Finally, we read through hundreds of Amazon reviews on various automatic litter boxes to help us identify what users look for in the perfect automatic litter box.</p>
<p>With our hours of research and personal experience in caring for two cats, we honed in on the most important features for a good automatic litter box:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost</li>
<li>Effectiveness in cleaning</li>
<li>Impact on cat’s usage</li>
<li>Setup and programmable features</li>
<li>Environmental presence</li>
<li>Odor control</li>
<li>Frequency of maintenance</li>
</ul>

<p>With over three million Google search results for “how often do I have to clean my cat’s litter?” you can easily surmise it’s an unpleasant chore that is often delayed. While it may stink that you need to clean it, it’s never good for your cat to have a filthy, full litter box. This could lead to a number of issues, ranging from negative association with the litter box (causing accidents around the house) to more serious health issues like urinary tract diseases. An automatic litter box can easily aid in maintaining a clean and approachable bathroom area for your cat by taking care of the cleaning process and removing waste from the litter for you.</p>
<p>The health benefits for your cat mostly depend on a litter box that’s clean, so let’s face it, this is just as much about what <b><i>you</i></b> need. A self-cleaning litter box is valuable to any cat owner wanting to add convenience to their daily routine unless you have one of those magical felines who will participate in toilet-training. The automatic box can make an even bigger difference if you have multiple cats. If you’re tired of scooping out your cat’s litter box daily, then an automatic litter box is probably something you’ve considered more than once already.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Cost:</b> The price tag for an automatic litter box can range from a minimum of $100 to $450. This doesn’t include the cost of litter and the accessories the box may require. Also, a good rule of thumb for the number of litter boxes in your house is one per cat, plus an additional one.</p>
<p><b>Effectiveness in cleaning:</b> The whole purpose of buying a self-cleaning/automatic litter box is in its name. You want a product that fulfills its claims. It’s important to consider what type of mechanism the litter box uses to clean the waste. Does it rake? Does it scoop? Does it sift? We found that sifting did much better than raking, with scoops performing somewhere in between.</p>
<p><b>Impact on cat’s usage:</b> Transitioning any cat to change can be a difficult undertaking. You have to be careful in not disrupting your cat’s habitat too much, regardless of how convenient it is to your lifestyle. If the design is very different than what your cat is used to, consider keeping their regular litter box around to ease the transition (and your ability to return the new box to the manufacturer if the cat won’t touch it.)</p>
<p><b>Setup and programmable features:</b> Nobody likes reading through long pages of manuals to set up a new product. It’s also important to note what features are available with your litter box. Can it be programmed to clean at certain times? Is there an indicator for how many times your cat has used it?</p>
<p><b>Environmental presence:</b> Your cat’s bathroom area shouldn’t be a statement piece in your home. It should be able to coexist with your living space and not be so loud that it frequently annoys you.</p>
<p><strong>Frequency of maintenance and odor control:</strong> Again, automatic litter boxes should turn the litter box maintenance from a daily process to a weekly one, keeping your cat’s litter area tidy enough between maintenance sessions and controlling the smell that comes from a filthy litter box.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>When you’re trying to choose the right product, online searches can lead you down a rabbit hole of reviews and lead to reservations about spending so much on a design you’re not confident in. While the existing reviews we found only rank litter boxes by comparing features, we did the real dirty work for you.</p>
<h3>Comfort for your cats and for you</h3>

<p>If you’ve ever turned a printer on around a cat, you know firsthand how intrigued and surprised a cat can be about an inanimate object moving. <strong>Now imagine how they feel when their litter box comes to life.</strong></p>
<p>It was a careful and calculated process transitioning Kit Kat and Jelly Bean to test out the efficacy of these litter boxes. As cats are creatures of habits, it is recommended that you keep their existing litter boxes next to or near their new ones to help ease the transition. This is a bit of an issue for the CatGenie, which had to be placed next to a toilet. Then, slowly phase their old litter boxes out once they get adjusted to the new one.</p>
<p>With this in mind, and our five self-cleaning litter boxes ready, we set up their new automatic litter boxes in their existing bathroom area. We kept their old litter box nearby, too. With the litter boxes that used regular litter, we stuck with our tried and true, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003LPSIO6/?tag=ybdlttr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fresh Step &#8211; Ultra Unscented.</a> With the litter boxes that required specialized litter, we used their respective branded products.</p>
<p>We observed how they reacted to the cleaning mechanisms in action and whether that scared them away from using some boxes. We also noted how easy (or difficult) it was for the cats to get in and out of the boxes.</p>
<p>Of course, despite our planning and adhering to litter box transition guidelines, cats aren’t robots: we had two accidents. We know that this was not an easy adjustment for them, either, so we added an <i>additional </i>manual litter box nearby to help them transition. Overall, it’s important when changing anything with your pet’s surroundings to be attentive, and react when you see that they need help.</p>
<p>The litter box room-presence was another important aspect of <i>human</i> comfort we considered. Our cats use the litter box quite often, so it was imperative that the automatic litter box wasn’t loud, as it would be running often. We also noted how each litter box looked in our living space.</p>
<h3>Automatic cleaning mechanism</h3>
<p>We never knew there was so much to learn about litter boxes. However, after testing out five litter boxes with particular cleaning mechanisms, we discovered the pros and cons of each method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scoops did a good job cleaning waste but sometimes left crumbs around the litter box.</li>
<li>Rakes did not leave a mess but were sometimes loud and would often get waste stuck on the teeth, requiring additional maintenance.</li>
<li>The toilet system cleaned very thoroughly but was hot and loud</li>
<li>The sifting system also cleaned well but the turning dome could be intimidating to cats.</li>
</ul>
<p>We rated the effectiveness of each cleaning mechanism by comparing to our usual method of manually cleaning with a scooper by hand.</p>
<p>It was important that the automatic litter boxes sifted through the litter, removed the waste completely and reset the litter so it was smoothed out. We also observed how each mechanism disposed of the waste and whether it controlled the odor. Odor control really depended on how well the litter type covered the smell and how each receptacle kept smells in.</p>
<h3>Setup and additional features</h3>
<p>We determined if the setup was easy or difficult by timing how long each litter box took to set up, whether it required additional tools, and if it required a specific location. Manuals that were simple and easy to follow also made a difference in setup time.</p>
<p>The setup also revealed whether there were additional things to program and what the buttons on the litter box did. It was significant for us that the litter box could sense the cat’s presence, which they all were able to do. All of the litter boxes included a safeguard to stop the litter box from running if a cat is detected in the box. Additional features were a bonus and not necessary in the effectiveness of cleaning and convenience of use.</p>

<h3>Maintenance and cost of ownership</h3>
<p>We noted how frequently we had to monitor the litter box for any clogs or clumps that were stuck. It was imperative the cleaning mechanism worked effectively as this influenced the maintenance of the litter box. We also observed the size of the waste receptacle and how often we had to replace or clean it out.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the litter boxes required additional accessories or specialized brand litter, adding extra costs for the usage of the litter box.</strong> It also was relevant how much the litter box itself costs, as they vary greatly in price. So when you take into consideration wanting multiple automatic litter boxes, it can add up even more quickly.</p>

<p>This was a clear win. Even though the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MA2T9BC/?tag=ybdlttr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Pet Zone &#8211; SmartScoop</b></a> did not have the flashy features of other models, it simply worked well. It can be difficult to determine what the best automatic litter box is when they all tout special features like the best cleaning mechanism or appealing design. However, the most important aspects were not whether you could flush your cat’s waste through a toilet or a counter that tracks the frequency of your cat’s litter box usage to help monitor their health: the simple and thorough cleaning mechanism wins.</p>

This no-frills automatic litter box is easy to adapt to and cleans up consistently. Our cats preferred its open, familiar design and we appreciated its low maintenance.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MA2T9BC/?tag=ybdlttr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Pet Zone provided convenience with its ease of handling and simple, functional features. It can sense when a cat enters the litter box and stays for a period of time. It cleans up after the cat leaves, preventing any odor from lingering too long.</p>
<p>There’s enough room for even the twenty-pound Kit Kat, with a considerable litter area and without the closed space that might cause problems for bigger cats. It was not obtrusive in our room; it looks like a regular litter box and is low to the ground. The noise level is minimal, with a low whirring sound as it runs through its cleaning cycle.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is designed to be simple and easy for both cats and humans to use. It is a straightforward, open top litter box. Unlike some competitors, it provides a recognizable rectangular shape and allows for the regular litter your cats are accustomed to using.</p>
<p>The uncovered design allows for an easy entrance for any sized cat. All together, Pet Zone provided a familiar bathroom environment, so both our cats adjusted to using it quickly. It raked and scooped fairly quickly, so the noise didn’t last too long either. This was important since it never bothered or intimidated the cats from using it.</p>

<p>Pet Zone’s raking and scooping deflector has a pretty thorough method of cleaning. The dual system uses regular litter and ensures the clumps of litter gets raked clean to one side, which then gathers it all so it can be swept up in a scooping motion and deposited into the waste drawer. Although some clumps got stuck, it didn’t happen frequently, and only with larger blocks of waste. It came with a tool designed for the very purpose of removing clumps, so it was a painless task to just tap the scooper to unblock it.</p>
<p>There are no bells and whistles with the Pet Zone. It has a simple AC adaptor that you plug into an outlet, and an on/off switch. It doesn’t need to programmed since the cleaning timer was already excellent. We never had issues with either cat being in contact with the rake. The Pet Zone only needs to be plugged in, no extra setup requirements. It did its job well and thoroughly and cut back on a lot of manual cleaning.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Pet Zone &#8211; Smart Scoop’s open top and large rectangular shape allows for any size cat to use and adapt to it quickly</li>
<li>It allows you to use regular litter so it’s familiar for your cats</li>
<li>Pet Zone’s cleaning system ensures it is thoroughly cleaned. The waste gets deposited into a receptacle with good odor control</li>
<li>It ran quietly and quickly and did not bother the cats</li>

<p>High-end and high-tech aren’t words we would use to describe the typical litter box. However, those two qualities are found in our runner up, the <a href="http://share.litter-robot.com/lS7vb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Litter-Robot III</a>. From the smooth round design and sturdy build to the impressive rotating dome sifter, this is a remarkable litter box. It even lights up inside and emits a blue glow when it’s dark.</p>
<p>Litter-Robot’s patented rotating and sifting system was one of the most thorough cleaning mechanisms we observed. <strong>It uses regular litter and does the most effective job in completely cleaning clumps of waste, as this method leaves no litter unturned (litter-ally).</strong> The detached globe slowly rotates to sift the clumps through to a waste drawer, then rotates back to settle the litter.</p>
<p>The Litter-Robot includes more settings than many of the other litter boxes, which is helpful for pet owners who want more customization. You can adjust its timer to decide how long after a cat uses the litter box to activate cleaning mode. This box comes with a programmable sleep mode as well.</p>

It enables you to use regular litter, and it boasts one of the more advanced cleaning methods with its unique rotating sifting system.</p><a href="http://share.litter-robot.com/lS7vb" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Litter-Robot.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The setup and waste removal were the easiest among its competitors. Like our top pick, it only needs to be plugged into an outlet to work. When it came time to remove the collected waste, you simply pulled out the waste tray underneath and dumped it out. Additionally, the waste tray is large, which cuts back on the frequency of maintaining its cleanliness to every two weeks. When it ran through its clean cycle, the noise was never an issue. That being said, it was a bit slower than the other models we tested.</p>
<p>A few areas in which the Litter-Robot fell short were its entrance and imposing size. While the design is remarkable, almost like a mini rocket ship, it doesn’t blend discreetly into your home decor and takes up a lot of space. The entry to the litter box was also a hindrance to our larger and older cat, Kit Kat, and made it difficult for him to use.</p>
<p>While Kit Kat never quite got accustomed to using the steeper vertical entrance, Jelly Bean eventually became less daunted by the entryway and used it quite frequently. However, she is a smaller and more active cat. So keep in mind, it would be less convenient for older cats. Litter-Robot does sell a separate <a href="https://www.litter-robot.com/accessories/lr3-ramp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ramp</a> that you can place in front of the entrance to help out older cats.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Litter-Robot is a premium product with a premium price — more than double the cost of our top pick. It is not a cost-effective solution, especially if you want more than one automatic litter box in your home. We also would need to purchase a ramp to make the entry more accessible, which adds another $50 to the cost. That being said, if you’re able to foot the bill and can make room for it in your home, the Litter-Robot is an exceptional automatic litter box that lives up to expectations.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Litter-Robot’s impressive patented rotating and sifting cleaning system did the most thorough job of cleaning the litter</li>
<li>It also allows you to use the clay litter your cat is used to</li>
<li>The Litter-Robot has a remarkably easy setup, waste removal, and maintenance</li>
<li>Its large size might be too imposing for some homes, and its entryway is difficult for older/less active cats</li>
<li>Its price tag is highest among automatic litter box competitors</li>
</ul>

<p>The PetSafe was unique in that it used specialized crystal litter. Instead of clumping, the litter absorbs urine. Unfortunately, it doesn’t do nearly as well at covering the smell of feces. Moreover, bits would often get stuck on the rake. This was one of the quietest among its competitors, but that’s because the motor that pushed the rake was not as powerful.</p>
<p>It also comes with a hood that can help with its odor issues but may make the opening too small for larger cats to enter.</p>
<p><strong>That being said, the PetSafe was one of the easiest boxes to clean.</strong> With its disposable litter trays, all you had to do was lift the plastic top off, remove the cardboard litter tray, throw it out and install a new one. Some nice-to-have features that add to the litter box’s value are a health counter (which tracks how many times your cat uses the box) and an adjustable timer.</p>

<p>The LitterMaid was a pretty standard self-cleaning litter box. It uses normal clumping litter and a rake to push clumps into the waste receptacle. Carbon filters included with each of the waste receptacles kept odor under control. Clean up was as easy as throwing away the waste receptacle and replacing it with a new one.</p>
<p>The carpeted ramp was nice since it made it easier for cats to get in the litter box and also helped prevent litter from tracking outside of it. It also has an optional sleep timer to deactivate it at night.</p>
<p>However, a big issue was that feces would get stuck fairly often on the rake, although there was a scooper included that made it easy to remove. <strong>Since the track for the rake is on the inside of the litter box, sometimes litter (or even worse, feces) would get on the track.</strong> When that happened, the rake would grind very loudly as it ran, like someone sharpening a pencil. This means extra maintenance was required, which detracted from how convenient using this litter box was otherwise.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://share.litter-robot.com/lS7vb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CatGenie</a> was the most unique and complex litter box. It uses biodegradable plastic granules instead of regular litter and is connected to your toilet/water line. The system rotates the granules into the scooper and emulsifies the solid waste by adding water to it. It then flushes the granules with water in its “SaniSolution,” and finally blows warm air to heat and dry the granules. The benefit of it being connected to your toilet/water line is that there is no manual disposal of waste required.</p>
<p>The cleaning cycle is very loud. Since it blows warm air during the drying cycle, it heats the area around it as well. <strong>The 30-minute cleaning cycle is quite long and also sounds like an open dishwasher running through a wash cycle.</strong></p>
<p>In addition, the plastic granules are unfamiliar to a cat used to clumping litter.  With all these factors in play, it was one of the most intimidating litter boxes for our cats to use. Due to the way it cleans, we were unable to add clumping litter to at least give it a recognizable scent. Jelly Bean used it to pee once and Kit Kat would not go near it at all.</p>
<p>The lack of familiar design, loud cleaning cycle and foreign litter can be a deterrent for an easy litter box transition. It also took up a substantial amount of space and its required hook-up to a water line made for an inconvenient setup and location.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Sometimes simple is best. <strong>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MA2T9BC/?tag=ybdlttr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pet Zone &#8211; SmartScoop</a> did exactly what it was supposed to do.

<p>If you have a shredder at home, you can easily make your own cat litter with three ingredients: newspaper and paper scraps, baking soda and water. Simply use your shredder to shred any scrap paper from around the house such as old newspapers, junk mail or documents you plan to recycle. Place the shredded paper in a deep bucket, and pour water over it letting it soak for around 5 minutes. Then, grab the shredded paper by hand and squeeze out all of the water, but avoid doing it over the sink as it could clog your drains. Once you make sure the shredded paper is as dry as possible, mix in baking soda — we prefer to use 1 cup of baking soda per 5 cups of wet paper shreds. Place the mixture in a single layer at the bottom of a container, allowing to to dry, in the sun if possible.</p>
<p>When it comes time to use your homemade cat litter, add more baking soda to the bottom of your litter box prior to using the mixture each time you replace it to keep your litter box smelling fresh.</p>

<p>Did you know that chicken feed is a common alternative to store-bought cat litter?</p>
<p>It’s much less expensive and is a great alternative to cat litter due to its texture. It’s recommended to use a chicken feed that doesn’t have any antibiotics or medication in it to ensure your cat’s safety. Note that chicken feed can attract bugs, so make sure you are storing it in an airtight container and change our the litter box regularly.</p>
<p>If the smell becomes too potent, add baking soda to the mixture to help cover up the scent.</p>
<h3>Cedar Shavings</h3>

<p>Although only one ingredient, we couldn’t go without mentioning the use of cedar shavings as cat litter. Not only is the material budget-friendly, but it’s known for covering up odor with a natural wood scent. There are brands that market cedar cat litter, but you can also purchase cedar chips from a local hardware store to save some money. It’s also worth noting that cedar is known to repel insects, but it’s still recommended to change it out regularly.</p>
<h3>Essential Oil Refresher</h3>

<p>Sometimes it’s difficult to avoid the smell of cat litter even if you change it out regularly. Although this deodorizer can’t be used as cat litter itself, it’s a great way to add a refreshing scent to your cat litter. Simply add baking soda to a jar or bag, then drop a couple drops of essential oils to it — our favorite scent to use is lavender. Shake up the mixture and let it sit overnight. Then, sprinkle it over your cat litter whenever you need a refresher.</p>
<p>Cats can be picky when it comes to their cat litter — something we found with our own kitties, Jelly Bean and Kit Kat. If you’re planning to transition your adult cats to a new cat litter, make sure you do so slowly. You may want to consider mixing their accustomed cat litter with your homemade version to make the transition comfortable and familiar to them. Remember that you may need to try a few formulas before you find one that sticks.</p>
<p>Once your homemade cat litter is ready, print out one of our cat litter labels and adhere it to the container!</p>
