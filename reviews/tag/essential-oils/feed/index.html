								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ur writer and researcher for this article is a holistic health practitioner studying nutrition, human anatomy, physiology, spirituality, as well as aromatherapy. After over a month of research and evaluation, we determined <a href="https://stillpointaromatics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stillpoint Aromatics</a> offers the best essential oils. They source the finest plants and make the greatest effort to preserve the oils’ pristine quality by keeping them in cold storage, capped with nitrogen. Running a close second — and for half the price — <a href="http://www.floracopeia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Floracopeia&#8217;s</a> essential oils smelled very fresh and quite similar to Stillpoint’s, but lacked the energetic quality from our top pick.</p>

<h2 class="collapse" id="how-we-found">How we found the best essential oils</h2>
<p>After several weeks of exhaustive research, we sifted the Internet to find as many essential oil brands as possible that were available in America. We searched through web retailers, scoured essential oil and natural health blogs, online forums and reviews, along with searching through Subreddits like /r/essentialoils and /r/aromatherapy.</p>
<p>We then spoke with professionals in the business including a Clinical Registered Aromatherapist, several massage therapists and a Holistic Health Coach. In addition we read through scientific research studies, and numerous essential oil, natural health and aromatherapy books — both historical and modern.</p>
<p>Finally, with a clear understanding of exactly what makes a great essential oil, we combed through our large list of candidates — plus found a few more companies of high integrity — to see if they truly met the demanding criteria for quality.</p>
<p>With this knowledge we selected a total of seven different brands to test in-house:</p>

<h2 class="collapse">What are essential oils?</h2>
<p>The term, “essential oil” is actually the shortening of a historical term: “quintessential oil,” alluding to the oils as the spirit or life force of the plant. Of course the oils are a physical substance, not supernatural; however, their ethereal aromas and therapeutic talents can have a spiritual, as well as a mental/emotional effect on us.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.naturalhealthyconcepts.com/2014/12/04/essential-oils-fda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Essential oils are in fact NOT oils at all</a>, they’ve simply acquired that name because they do not mix with water, just like regular oils. They are a vital liquid present inside living plants — a natural solution of various complex chemical constituents. <strong>Scientifically, essential oils are concentrated aromatic volatile plant compounds</strong> <strong>(‘volatile’ meaning they can change state or evaporate very easily).</strong> They are mostly derived from the flowers, leaves, stems and fruits of plants, while some are extracted from the bark and even the sap of trees.</p>
<p>Inside the living plant, essential oils serve several purposes, one of which is defense. Acting like the plant’s immune system, the oils help it fight off fungus or bacterial infection, and protect it from insects and animals. Another purpose is reproduction; the pleasing aromas attract pollinating insects like bees and butterflies. We’re not the only animals who like the smell of flowers.</p>
<h2 class="collapse">How are essential oils produced?</h2>
<p>The most common processes for extracting the essential oils from the plant material after harvesting are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distillation &#8211; steam from boiling water passes through plants drawing out the oils, then the oils are separated from the cooled, re-condensed water</li>
<li>Expression &#8211; (also called cold pressing) heavy pressure squeezes the oils from the materials; used mainly with citrus fruit peels<br />
Maceration/Distillation &#8211; the plant material is softened in warm water to release the oils</li>
<li>The amount of essential oil present within the plant material is scarce, more so for some plants than others. <strong>It can take up to 60 roses to produce one single drop of rose essential oil.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="collapse" id="essential-oils-vs">Essential oils vs. absolutes vs. hydrosols</h2>
<p>When searching for and purchasing essential oils from reputable companies you might come across the terms “absolute” and “hydrosol” often right next to the essential oils of the same plant. Be aware, these are not the same as essential oils.</p>
<p>An absolute is a fragrant liquid that is extracted from the plants using chemical solvents, like alcohol. Though the solvents are removed after the extraction process, there still remains a tiny amount of the chemical in the final product. Absolutes are much thicker and more concentrated than essential oils, and because of this they are often used in skin care products and lotions.</p>
<p>A hydrosol is simply the aromatic water that is left over from the steam distillation process. Hydrosols are basically just scented H2O and are generally used as perfume, cologne, air or fabric freshener, or they can be added to a soothing bath.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="benefits">Benefits of essential oils and aromatherapy</h2>
<p>Aromatherapy is an ancient practice of natural healing and plant medicine that has been documented in human civilizations around the world for over 6,000 years. The use of prescribing aromatic plant extracts for massage, for bathing and for mental, emotional and spiritual imbalances has proven benefits through both practical and scientific evidence.</p>
<p>The scents and the therapeutic capacities of each essential oil are unique to each plant and can have many physiological and psychological benefits. The oils have the ability to calm and release stress, to uplift depression, to stimulate and awaken the body and mind, to relieve sore muscles, or even loosen a cough if used correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Aromatherapy does not literally take away stress or depression, but rather it balances the disturbances within your body and mind, and fortifies your weaknesses, allowing your body to heal itself.</strong></p>
<p>And since the oils have anti-viral, anti-fungal and antibacterial qualities within the plants, we as humans can also make use of these benefits for our own health. Again, of course, when used properly.</p>
<p>It’s very important to keep in mind that the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates essential oils mainly as cosmetics, NOT as therapeutic supplements, herbs or medications. So if you come across an essential oil company or salesperson who claims their oils can cure certain diseases or mental illnesses, they are violating federal law and can be prosecuted and fined by the US government.</p>
<p>One very public example of this came in September of 2014 when <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2014/ucm415809.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FDA cited both dōTERRA</a> and <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2014/ucm416023.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Young Living</a>, multi-level marketing essential oil companies. FDA agents found clear evidence that some of Young Living and dōTERRA reps were making claims that their oils could prevent and cure Ebola and many other illnesses! The situation was quickly remedied.</p>
<p>Such bold claims should raise red flags for wise buyers. Be a smart consumer.</p>
<p>This brings us to some extremely important information for your own health…</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="safety">Safety when using essential oils</h2>

<p>Essential oils can be considered, fundamentally, as medication. Although derived from plants and natural resources they are still used as a treatment for health ailments. The oil’s high concentration makes them very powerful and potentially dangerous substances if used incorrectly. It is imperative that you do thorough research before using any essential oil because if used improperly they can cause serious health issues like allergic reactions, rashes, burns and long-term internal damage. The temptation to self-diagnose and self-prescribe can be a great influence in using essential oils, but without professional diagnosis and supervision, you run a risk of causing yourself harm. With that in mind here are some very important guidelines to follow:</p>
<p><strong>Avoid use of essential oils (unless under medical supervision) if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You are pregnant</li>
<li>You have a skin condition</li>
<li>You have asthma</li>
<li>You have severe allergies</li>
<li>You have epilepsy or are prone to seizures</li>
<li>You have heart disease</li>
<li>You have high blood pressure</li>
<li>You are on a course of treatment with prescribed medication</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rules for safe usage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many essential oils are too powerful to be applied directly to the skin undiluted (also known as “neat”), they must be diluted with a neutral carrier oil, such as jojoba oil, to avoid irritation.</li>
<li>Never use essential oils on or around the eyes or mucous membranes.</li>
<li>Several oils, like bergamot and other citrus, can cause allergic sensitivity to the sun and should be used with caution.</li>
<li>Children and the elderly can be extra sensitive to the effects of essential oils.</li>
<li>Essential oils are flammable, so keep them away from open flames.</li>
<li>Never ingest essential oils unless it is under the close supervision and prescription of a clinically-trained medical or aromatherapeutic professional. Some oils can be toxic, and if taken internally may be fatal. If you don’t know the specific chemistry of the oil, do not take it internally.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we’ve laid out some ground rules for essential oils, let’s see what you can do with these little gifts from nature.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="uses">Uses for essential oils</h2>
<p>Of course essential oils smell great, but there’s much more to them than just a pretty scent. There are three main techniques to make use of essential oils: aromatic, topical and internal.</p>
<h3>Aromatic</h3>

<p><strong>Diffusion:</strong> This is the healthiest, safest and most effective method of use. The fragrances from essential oils that are detected through your sense of smell actually have profound effects on your body, mood and behavior. When the oils are diffused into the air the healing properties of the essences enter your body through your nose while you appreciate the pleasant smell. The best way to achieve these benefits is by using an essential oil diffuser. We <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-essential-oil-diffuser/" rel="noopener">reviewed these diffusers in-depth</a> and found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MPV473S/?tag=ybdoils-20" rel="nofollow">Smiley Daisy</a> to be the best.</p>
<p>As the vaporized microscopic particles come into contact with the soft and moist tissue inside your nose and sinuses their beneficial properties enter directly into your bloodstream and get dispersed throughout your body. At the same time they travel up the olfactory nerve (the one that operates your sense of smell) to the limbic region of your brain where you process feelings and emotions. This is also an important area of the brain involved in memory. Smell and memory are processed through the same part of the brain; that’s why when you smell cookies baking in the oven you may have flashbacks of childhood.</p>

<p>As you smell the beautiful aromas this triggers your brain and the cells of your body, affecting your mood to uplift or calm you, affecting your behavior to slow you down or excite you, affecting your thinking to help you clear your mind and think sharper while remembering important things.</p>
<p>And since the essential oil particles are entering your bloodstream, you are also getting the physical benefits they may offer like muscle relaxation, pain relief, improved digestion and more.</p>
<p>Another added benefit of diffusion is its ability to clean the air. When the air in a space is stagnant, smelly and unclean — like in the winter when your home is closed up — there can be infectious airborne bacteria, viruses and spores floating about ready to make you sick. But when the right essential oil is diffused, in the correct amount, you can actually kill those little buggers in the air before they get to you.</p>
<p>In a quote from aromatherapy expert, David Crow, he writes, “[T]he antimicrobial effects of essential oils are most potent not when the oil is used in liquid form… but when pathogens are exposed to the vapors of the oils.” Not only do the oils clean the air and get into your nose, but they are also penetrating your skin, getting into your bloodstream, protecting and healing you.</p>
<p>Don’t overdo it though. Remember, these oils are extremely concentrated. Prolonged exposure to essential oils can cause ill effects like headaches, nausea or other unpleasant symptoms. Vary your use with different oils of different chemical compounds so that they don’t build up in your system. And avoid letting your diffuser run all day, every day; there is such a thing as too much of a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>Inhalation:</strong> With oils that are safe to use on the skin (know before you try), you can also take a single drop into one of your hands and rub your hands together to warm them up and spread the oil. Then cup your hands around your nose and take in a deep breath. Doing this, you can achieve the same mood and emotional benefits as with diffusion. A little goes a long way.</p>
<p>It’s good to note that most essential oils can lose their healthy powers when heated, so it’s best to avoid heat-based diffusions like candles and incense burners; stick with a good diffuser.</p>
<h3>Topical</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5375" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage.jpg" alt="eye dropper using essential oil on hand" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>For cautionary reasons, it is safest to assume that all essential oils should not be applied to the skin undiluted. Some are safe to use ‘neat’ right out of the bottle, while others can cause you great pain or irritation. Again, know all about your oil before you use it!</p>
<p>A typical dilution is around 2%, which means adding about 12 drops of essential oil to every one ounce of carrier oil. A carrier oil is a neutral nut or vegetable oil you use for dilution. Jojoba and Argan oils are the most common and beneficial, but almond, grapeseed, olive, coconut, sunflower, avocado or kukui oils will work just fine.</p>
<p><strong>Massage:</strong> Place several drops of your diluted oil mixture into your hand and rub them together. Then spread that oil onto your skin — or your partner’s skin — with long strokes. The warmth and friction of your hands will dispense the oil directly into the skin, muscles and bloodstream. Using the right essential oils can relax tension, relieve sore muscles and even improve your skin. Plus it just feels so darn good to get a massage.</p>
<p><strong>Compress:</strong> For localized issues like aches or bruises, place about ten drops of essential oil into a bowl of hot water. Soak a clean cloth in this water solution, then place the cloth on the troubled area for about 10-20 minutes. Repeat if necessary. As before, make sure you know if the oil you use is safe.</p>

<p><strong>Bath:</strong> Avoid dripping your essential oil directly into the bath water; you always want to mix it first with a natural emulsifier like honey, milk, a carrier oil, or even sea salt. Doing this will help emulsify and disperse the essential oils into the water. If you don’t do this, the oils will simply sit on the surface of the water and come into direct contact with your skin, possibly causing burns and dermal toxicity.</p>
<p>Try 5-10 drops of essential oil into ½-1 cup of emulsifier or salt, then stir that mixture into your warm bath water. Soak and relax for as long or as short as you wish as the oils penetrate your skin and stimulate your senses. Be aware that the overuse of essential oils in the bath can cause irritation, so choose only the mild and soothing extracts, and be smart.</p>
<h3>Internal / Ingestion</h3>
<p>Ingesting essential oils for health benefits has been prescribed for centuries by experienced professionals. This process, when administered safely and correctly under supervision, can have profound healing effects on your body with issues like digestion, immune defense and hormonal imbalances. However, ingesting the wrong oils — or even the right oils in the wrong portions — can have disastrous and permanent effects on your internal tissues and overall health, and worst of all, you may not even realize any damage has been done until decades later in your life.</p>
<p>In short: <strong>DO NOT TAKE ESSENTIAL OILS INTERNALLY unless they have been prescribed to you individually by a qualified and clinically-trained medical professional or Clinical Registered Aromatherapist.</strong> When working with essential oils you are ultimately playing with chemistry; if you do not know the specific chemistry of the specific oils, and what that specific collection of chemical constituents in that oil can do to your body, then avoid internal administration and stick with the aromatic processes.</p>
<p>The practice of taking essential oils internally, by mouth, has been a heated debate within the essential oil community. Since the recent rise of the multi-level-marketing essential oil companies, and other brands claiming that their oils are pure enough to eat, the idea of freely ingesting essential oils has plagued the minds of the average consumer.</p>
<p>In our research, we came across a number of ill-informed consumers who readily believe that any essential oil, from any company, is safe to consume. Sadly, the exact opposite is true: ANY essential oil can be harmful if ingested improperly and without professional supervision.</p>
<p>Clinically trained professionals have spent years learning the delicate and complicated chemistry of essential oils and how they relate to the sensitive tissues of the human body, inside and out. Please, seek the guidance of a knowledgeable professional before putting any essential oil into your mouth.</p>
<p>We’ve learned how to safely use essential oils, now it’s time to go shopping.</p>

<p>When we set out to find the best essential oils available in America we thought it would be a straightforward matter of finding the companies with the best ratings and reviews, buying some oils and testing them for smell and feel. We never expected to find it such a difficult task.</p>
<p>In the world of essential oils there is an enormous amount of controversy and competition, with some companies accusing other companies of being less pure, while others claim trademarks and exclusivity on their products. All of this noise creates plenty of confusion for the average consumer to sift through, especially since there is no official regulation or oversight on the essential oil industry, federal or otherwise.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, the FDA generally classifies essential oils as cosmetics, but they can also <em>sometimes</em> be considered drugs. In a quote direct from <a href="https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductsIngredients/Products/ucm127054.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the US Food and Drug Administration website</a>, “The law doesn’t require cosmetics to have FDA approval before they go on the market.” In addition, if a product claims to affect the health and function of the body, such as relieving anxiety, aiding digestion or calming sore muscles, the product must be approved by the FDA as a drug, which is a very long and costly process.</p>
<p>Most private and holistic essential oil companies simply can’t afford to go through that process, so they instead opt to comply with the FDA’s much more lax regulations regarding cosmetics; no approval required. So this leaves the real regulation up to you, the consumer.</p>
<p>To help us get a more clear understanding of what to look for in essential oils we spoke with Clinical Registered Aromatherapist, Anna Doxie. She is the founder of the <a href="http://authenticaromatherapyeducation.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Institute of Holistic Phyto-Aromatherapy</a> and Director Coordinator and Director of the Southern California Region of the <a href="https://naha.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy</a> (NAHA) and an esteemed Aromatherapy instructor. We’ve also combed through NAHA’s educational materials, consulted the prolific writings of Dr. Robert Pappas — a highly respected name in essential oil testing and education — and sought many other independent sources of information to present to you some guidelines for finding the best essential oil:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cultivation of the plants</li>
<li>Distillation and Extraction</li>
<li>Testing and Purity</li>
<li>Storage</li>
<li>Labeling and Information</li>
<li>Price</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cultivation and farming</h3>
<p><strong>The most important terms to look for regarding the way the plants are grown and harvested are Certified Organic, Wild Harvested, or unofficially organic</strong> <strong>(sometimes called “unsprayed”).</strong> A reputable essential oil company will freely disclose all information about where and how their source plants are grown, and they’ll be proud of their organic choices.</p>
<p>More importantly, the founders and owners of the companies will have personal relationships with the farmers so they can be certain of what they are getting. There are many tiny, locally operated farms around the world who can’t afford the extremely high costs of organic certification, yet they still practice organic farming which includes: no use of chemical pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers, no genetically modified seeds, and healthy crop rotation to protect the soils. That is what is meant by Unsprayed.</p>
<p>Wild harvested is just that, the plants are cut from their natural, indigenous location; no farming, totally wild.</p>
<p>Another important factor to know about the oil is the geographical location each plant was grown. Plants grow naturally and thrive in climates and conditions suitable for their health. Plants farmed in locations outside of their natural habitats will be less effective when distilled. The climate, the soil, the time of year (and sometimes even the time of day) have great effects on the quality of the essential oils and good companies know this.</p>
<h3>Distillation and extraction</h3>
<p>Distilleries can be certified organic also, but as with the small farms, small distilleries can’t afford the certification, yet they practice organic methods.</p>
<p>It is important to know exactly how the oils were extracted. As we discussed earlier with how essential oils are produced, specific methods are required for specific plants. A good essential oil company will declare the method used for each individual oil. If you don’t see any method of extraction, or you find a blanket statement saying that all their oils are steam distilled, be wary, they could be fake.</p>
<h3>Purity</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5378" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label.jpg" alt="label stating 100% pure oil" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100-percent-pure-label-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>This is the biggest and most hotly argued aspect of the unregulated essential oil market. Be aware, there are no official legal bindings to the terms, “Pure”, “100% Pure”, “Natural”, and “Therapeutic Grade”; in fact there are no grades at all regarding essential oils. If you see any of these, or similar terms on essential oils, they are completely meaningless marketing slogans.</p>
<p>For effective therapeutic uses, it is imperative that only the purest of essential oils are used. What we mean by ‘pure’ is that the only thing inside that tiny bottle is the essential oil from the specific plant on the label, no additives, no other chemicals, no synthetic fragrances or diluents, and no other kind of oil — natural or otherwise.</p>
<p>To cut costs many low-quality companies will fill their bottles with mostly vegetable oil or water and only add a small percentage of real essential oil. Others will put in cheaper essential oils that smell similar to the real plant and label it as the real thing. An example is using litsea oil in place of lemongrass. This is called adulteration.</p>
<p>The worst deception is when poor companies use synthetic fragrances mixed into vegetable oil and pass it off as true essential oil. This is where the real danger to your health can come: the National Academy of Sciences reported that the 95 percent of synthetic fragrances come from petroleum and have the potential to cause cancer, birth defects, central nervous system disorders and allergic reactions.</p>
<p>So how do you know if the oils are real?</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>In order to know if an essential oil is pure and true it must be tested in a chemistry lab. The Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) test is a standard in the industry. This test separates and analyzes the chemical compounds while confirming the elemental composition within a sample, helping chemists to determine whether or not the essential oil has been tainted. Good companies will have third-party GC/MS reports for every batch of oil available for you to read.</p>

<p><a href="https://essentialoils.org/news/eo_myths" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Robert Pappas says</a>, &#8220;There are a lot of companies out there selling essential oils and most of them have no ability (or in many cases no desire) to do the necessary quality control to verify what they are getting from their supplier before they pass it on to their customers.” The GC/MS test determines the quality and can show evidence of adulteration, although it is not perfect. Good companies will employ other tests as well like, Organoleptic (sensory tests), or FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy).</p>
<p>There are many companies out there, even popular, big name essential oil companies, whose oils have been independently tested by consumers with GC/MS and other processes, and have been found to include synthetic and other ingredients within their apparently “pure” essential oils. That is why it is so important to have batch-specific tests for every oil, and to buy from a company you really know and trust.</p>
<h3>Storage</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5379" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cool-storage-cabinet.jpg" alt="storing bottles in a cool cabinet" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cool-storage-cabinet.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cool-storage-cabinet-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cool-storage-cabinet-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cool-storage-cabinet-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cool-storage-cabinet-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cool-storage-cabinet-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cool-storage-cabinet-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cool-storage-cabinet-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cool-storage-cabinet-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cool-storage-cabinet-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, essential oils are volatile which means they can degrade quickly under poor conditions, especially with exposure to light, heat or oxygen. To protect the integrity of the oils it is best to keep them in dark glass containers in a cool location in your home — refrigeration is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Every essential oil has a unique shelf life and the good companies will tell you how many years the oil will keep its potency. It’s a good practice to write the date on the bottle when you first open it so you know exactly how old it is years later.</p>
<p>There are few companies who take storage to the highest regard by keeping their oils refrigerated in bottles with nitrogen pumped in to prevent exposure to oxygen. You don’t need to go that far at home, but just don’t leave them in the sun.</p>
<h3>Labeling</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5380" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats.jpg" alt="product details on a label" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Very simply, you want to read on the label — or information page for every oil — the true Latin name of the plant from which the oil was extracted, as well as the country from which the plant was harvested. Some companies will go further and tell you the method of extraction, the farming quality and also the chemical family of the oil. Plus seeing the batch number on the bottle helps you match it with its testing.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>The old adage, “you get what you pay for” is generally quite true when it comes to essential oils. Producing and distributing high-quality essential oils is a time consuming and expensive process. If you find an essential oil at a price significantly lower than most major brands, you’re not getting a good deal, you’re probably getting a fake product.</p>
<p>The most expensive oils will usually offer you the highest purity, quality and integrity. What you’re paying for is the care and great attention to quality. The last thing you want to save a couple of bucks on is your own health or the health of your family.</p>
<p>Knowing the average cost of a good quality oil needs to be taken into consideration when purchasing from large companies with large marketing agendas. Marketing costs a lot of money, as do quality essential oils, so be certain that every dollar of your hard-earned money is going fully into the quality of the essential oil rather than its promotion, advertising and salespeople.</p>

<h3>Scent</h3>
<p>Very simply, the essential oil must smell like it’s supposed to, and that’s where knowing the aromas comes in handy. If your bottle of eucalyptus smells more like mint, then you probably don’t have eucalyptus in your hands.</p>
<p>Of course, you won’t know this until you actually buy and open the oil yourself, so we took care of that for you.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Since we are not chemists, nor do we have the resources or equipment to evaluate the chemical purity of the essential oils, we stuck with methods of evaluation available to the average consumer. Out of the nearly 40 different essential oil companies researched we were able to narrow down the list to a total of seven reputable companies by using the parameters listed above in our section ‘<a href="#what-to-look-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What to look for when purchasing essential oils</a>.’</p>
<p>Then we purchased bottles of Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), and Lemon (Citrus limon) from each of the seven companies we selected to perform our in-house testing. We gathered a group of four people from our office and administered a formal blind smell test to evaluate which oils smelled the best and which smelled the worst out of the selections.</p>
<p>Disguising the names of the companies we placed two drops of each oil on a strip of white card paper marked with a single letter for reference. We had each test participant smell a strip of lavender, one at a time, from each company rating it for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Freshness</li>
<li>Strength</li>

<p>Then, once each brand of lavender was evaluated individually we asked them to compare all of the different lavender scents to judge their personal preference and to rate which ones gave the highest sense of quality.</p>
<p>We then did the whole thing over again with the lemon essential oils. Here are the cumulative rankings from the testing:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5372" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings.png" alt="blind scent ranking data chart" width="901" height="645" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings.png 901w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-610x437.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-768x550.png 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-300x215.png 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-295x211.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-885x634.png 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-360x258.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-375x268.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-414x296.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-320x229.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Finally, we performed a common and simple test for purity. Since essential oils are not truly oils they respond differently when they come into contact with blotting paper. When pure essential oils are dropped onto a piece of blotting paper they will impregnate the paper and then evaporate leaving no obvious trace. However, if you place a drop of diluted essential oil on blotting paper, the vegetable oil used to stretch the original will leave an oily stain on the paper.</p>
<p>We placed a single drop from each bottle onto individual pieces of blotting paper and watched with fascination as the spots disappeared with every sample. No dilutions. No carrier oils. All pure. We expected that, but it’s nice to see it in person.</p>

<p>After hours and hours of research, testing and evaluation, with heads full of lavender and lemon, we found it quite easy to determine that <a href="http://www.stillpointaromatics.com/essential-oils" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stillpoint Aromatics</a> is our top pick for the best essential oils.</p>
<p>Based in Sedona, Arizona, Stillpoint Aromatics was the passionate creation of Joy Musacchio and Cynthia Brownley, two highly educated women who have been working with essential oils since 1990. In seeking the world’s best sources these very resourceful women have cultivated first-name-basis, personal relationships with farmers and distillers around the planet.</p>

They have excellent oil scents, along with the highest standards for farming, production and storage practices.</p><a href="http://www.stillpointaromatics.com/essential-oils" target="_blank"><button>See Price at StillpointAromatics.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>In 2010 they started Stillpoint to offer over 200 of “the purest therapeutic quality essential oils that we have ever experienced.” Additionally, they offer true Aromatherapy Certification programs that are accredited with both the National Association of Holistic Aromatherapy (NAHA) and the Alliance of International Aromatherapists (AIA).</p>
<p>Here’s what makes their essential oils so great:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cultivation and distillation: All of their oils are either Certified Organic, Wild Harvested, or Unsprayed (organically grown without certification)</li>
<li>Testing and purity: Every single batch of every single oil they sell is GC/MS tested by an independent laboratory in France. Then the chemical family of the oils is printed directly on the bottle’s label to assist experienced Aromatherapists.</li>
<li>Storage: Once they receive their shipments directly from the distiller (no middlemen) they immediately pour them into amber-colored bottles, then they remove the oxygen by filling the remaining space in the bottles with nitrogen before placing them in cold storage; this drastically reduces oxidation and greatly enhances the shelf-life and vibrancy of the oils. And if that weren’t special enough, Joy and Cynthia literally hand-pour every bottle to order. What this means is, the essential oil stays in cold storage, with nitrogen, until you place your order, only then will the oil be poured custom into the tiny 15mL amber bottle, just for you! No one else takes such pride and care.</li>
<li>Labeling and information: Each hand-poured bottle displays:<br />
-the Latin name<br />
-the source country<br />
-the quality of farming (organic, etc.)<br />
-the part of the plant this oil came from<br />
-how it was extracted<br />
-the chemical family of this oil<br />
-the batch number, so you can see the GC/MS test for that specific oil</li>
<li>Price: Yes, these oils are pricy. At $23.00 for a tiny 5mL bottle of wild lavender, it’s the second most expensive oil, with Oshadhi coming in first at $36.30 for 10mL. But the price is well worth it for the enormous quality you are getting with these oils.</li>
<li>Love: Every order shipped comes with a custom, handwritten note from Joy and Cynthia thanking you for choosing them.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our scent tests the Stillpoint’s oils started off smelling mild and fresh, but then after a minute or two they magically blossomed and became very rich, deep, vibrant, stronger and more clear; almost like a fine wine opens up after being uncorked for some time. And for those who may be sensitive to subtle energies, these oils possessed a very clean and high vibration, which is an enormous benefit when using the oils for spiritual practice. No other oils we tested performed this way.</p>
<p>Our testers rated Stillpoint tops in all tests. With their impeccable standards for quality and preservation, there is no question that Stillpoint Aromatics has the best essential oils.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.floracopeia.com/Essential-Oils/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Floracopeia</a> is another small, independently-owned company with very ethical roots. Started in 2004 in Grass Valley, CA by David and Sara Crow, Floracopeia is our second-best essential oil company. Like Stillpoint, they have strong personal relationships with their distillers; they will even get their hands dirty as they help harvest the plants for extraction when they visit.</p>
<p>Floracopeia’s goal is not only to offer great essential oils but also to help create sustainable ecological, environmental and economic situations that support the small, rural farmers and distillers, as well as the planet. Their Eco-Projects, like the wild agarwood trees in Thailand, reduce illegal harvesting and help create a sustainable forestry system while supporting the livelihoods of the local villagers. And just like Stillpoint, David and Sara offer training and certifications in Aromatherapy.</p>

<p>All of their essential oils are either organic or wild harvested, and while they do not do their own testing, they rely on trusted and vetted relationships with their distillers who provide them with GC/MS tests.</p>
<p>The labels on the Floracopeia bottles offer all the important information you need from a trustworthy brand, including Latin names, organic quality, country of origin and batch number. Not as information-rich as Stillpoint’s bottles, but they still give you all the significant facts for quality oil.</p>
<p>Floracopeia’s very delicate and pure scent comes at almost half the cost of Stillpoint Aromatics’ oils. Priced at $25.00 for a 15mL bottle of organic lavender, that’s about $1.67 per mL, compared to Stillpoint’s $3.17 per mL for wild lavender.</p>
<p>Although Floracopeia doesn’t provide the extensive storage and preservation practices like Stillpoint, their pure and authentic essential oils, with ethical and sustainable practices, as well as a good price, make them an easy pick for our runner up.</p>

<h3>From Nature With Love</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5408 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love.jpg" alt="From Nature With Love bottles" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/from-nature-with-love-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Our third choice was a company called <a href="https://www.fromnaturewithlove.com/soap/EssentialOils.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">From Nature With Love</a> in Oxford, CT. In our scent tests they actually scored in second place overall however there were a few other issues that dropped them below Floracopeia.</p>
<p>First, their bottles didn’t come with the little plastic dripper caps that cover the mouth of the bottle (aka. orifice reducer), they just had a simple screw cap. Without the orifice reducers, you either have to pour the oil out and make a mess or dip an eye dropper into the oil which can potentially contaminate the product if you’re not careful. Plus if oil gets into the little rubber bulb of the eyedropper it can get stuck in there and go bad, further contaminating the oil.</p>
<p>Second, From Nature With Love is a wholesaler which means they offer products like cosmetics bases and other ingredients for making your own lotions, creams, soaps and more. So their primary focus is not top quality essential oils, but instead, being a one-stop shop for natural body care cosmetics makers.</p>
<p>Third, even though they are a member of NAHA, only some of their essential oils are organic — the lemon was not — and they do not perform GC/MS testing. However, they do fill the amber bottles with nitrogen just like Stillpoint, but that’s the extent of their preservation.</p>
<p>From Nature With Love has some very nice oils, and if you’re planning on making your own lotions they’re a good buy. But for everyday uses, we’d recommend sticking with Stillpoint Aromatics or Floracopeia.</p>

<p>Based in Eugene, OR, <a href="https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/catalog/aromatherapy/essential-oils" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mountain Rose Herbs</a> offers USDA Organic essential oils, in addition to a variety of other products like teas, spices, bath and body items, and kitchen tools. They are a very eco-conscious and sustainable company, but in the scent tests we tried, they seemed to lack the aromatic quality of the top choices.</p>
<p>The prices were about average at $12.75 for 15mL of lavender, but with so many alternate products they offer, their full attention to quality in the essential oils becomes spread a little thin.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.planttherapy.com/essential-oils" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plant Therapy</a> essential oils is a family owned company in Twin Falls, ID, and they’ve teamed up with world-renowned Aromatherapy expert, Robert Tisserand to help them ensure their oil’s quality and purity. They offer both USDA Organic and conventionally farmed essential oils in all the popular scents, and they test each batch with GC/MS.</p>
<p>With all those glowing statistics it came as a surprise that our testers gave very mixed reviews with these oils. Some thought they were strong and clear, while others noticed strange undertones and even artificial, candy-like qualities. Because of this, they ranked number five overall in our smell test.</p>
<p>Plant Therapy’s labels are a bit scarce in their information. They display the proper Latin names and the USDA Organic logo, but that’s it. Instead of including the country of origin and other important notes — which can be found on the website — they have a long description of what the oils could be used for and how to use it, followed by an FDA disclaimer so they won’t get in trouble.</p>
<h3>Oshadhi</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.oshadhiusa.com/essential-oil-singles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5390 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles.jpg" alt="Oshadhi bottles closeup" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oshadhi-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.oshadhiusa.com/essential-oil-singles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oshadhi</a> is a German company imported to America and it was the most expensive oil at $36.30 for 10mL of lavender; that’s more than Stillpoint. But even with that high price these oils got some pretty low ratings with our test group. They noticed sourness in the lavender, hints of chemical flavor in the lemon and weakness in all the scents.</p>
<p>They do sell only organic and wild harvested oils and have been in the essential oil business since 1990. Their labels have everything you need to know, including the chemical family of the oils and very clear batch numbers, but that just wasn’t enough to convince us to like the the way they smelled.</p>
<h3>Rocky Mountain Oils</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.oshadhiusa.com/essential-oil-singles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5392 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils.jpg" alt="Rocky Mountain Oils" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rocky-mountain-oils-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></a></p>
<p>This brand got the worst test scores of all. <a href="https://www.rockymountainoils.com/shoprmo/essential-oils/shop-singles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rocky Mountain Oils</a> from Orem, UT smelled weak and medicinal; someone even said it smelled like a laundry detergent. This was our only brand that did not offer organic oils of any kind, and perhaps that lower quality of farming was what gave them such strange aromas.</p>
<p>RMO, as they brand themselves, tests every batch with GC/MS analysis which you can easily view on their website, but their labels are inconsistent. All of them show the Latin name, but only some offer you the country from which the plants were sourced, but like the other companies, all useful information can be found on the website.</p>
<h3>Other companies</h3>
<p>The popular multi-level marketing companies, dōTERRA and Young Living didn’t make our top picks for several important reasons: their high retail prices, their lack of organic certification for all of their oils, and their insistence that most of their essential oils are safe to take internally not giving any regard to the potential health hazards of self-prescribing without professional clinical supervision.</p>
<p>We want you to be safe and we don’t want abundant marketing to convince you that you can be your own chemist without the necessary training. For all of these reasons, we have chosen not to include these companies in our testing.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Every one of the oils we tested offered their own unique signatures of aroma, and with this very subjective task we have undertaken, it made finding the best essential oils an extremely difficult project. Our criteria was strict and our noses were ready for the challenge. When it comes to your health we didn’t want to let money be a deterrent for finding you the truly best.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stillpointaromatics.com/essential-oils" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stillpoint Aromatics</a>, with their vibrant, rich scents, plus their devotion to the utmost of quality in sourcing, storage and preservation made them stand out high above the crowd. You can sense the life and the energy in these oils, and no other brand can compare to that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.floracopeia.com/Essential-Oils/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Floracopeia</a> has a passionate dedication for the health of the planet and the farmers who work upon it, while providing pure and authentic essential oils. Their freshness and integrity is present in every bottle of oil they offer, and at nearly half the price of our top pick they earn a deserving and proud second place.</p>
<p>Everyone has their own preferences in scents, brands and quality, so your personal opinions on what you like best may differ from ours. With a respectful, neutral perspective and a fresh experience on essential oils we are confident that you will get the most exceptional products from these companies.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ith more than 50 hours spent researching and testing top products on the market, we concluded that the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MPV473S/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Smiley Daisy &#8211; Hibiscus</a> is the best essential oil diffuser available. Three years after we first tested it, it&#8217;s still the best on the market. From the new crop of diffusers in 2019, we also like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075V1R8LT/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InnoGear</a> diffuser. This one in particular is great for larger spaces.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-found">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We spent more than 40 hours researching essential oil diffusers in order to find the best products to test. We started by looking at the biggest brands in the category (such as dōTERRA), then expanded our search through subreddits like r/aromatherapy and r/essentialoils.</p>
<p>We also read through several essential oil and aromatherapy internet forums, read studies and articles about the benefits of essential oils and diffusing those oils, and read about the diffusers that industry experts recommended.</p>
<p>Once we knew what to look for, we narrowed our search with a few more criteria. Each diffuser needed to meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have an automatic shutoff feature</li>
<li>Operate for<i> at least</i> 4 hours</li>
<li>Have a water capacity of 120ml or more</li>
<li>Come with a trustworthy manufacturer’s warranty</li>
</ul>
<p>From there, we factored in positive reviews on Amazon and by professional reviewers as well as several interviews with brand representatives to determine which products we should test in-house.</p>
<p>In 2019, we looked for updated products that would fill a larger room and run for a longer time. We&#8217;re still happy with our 2016 top pick for most situations, but we found a new runner-up that will run even longer and added some style options for people who don&#8217;t like fake woodgrain.</p>
<h2 id="the-seven-best">Compare the best essential oil diffusers</h2>
[table id=258 /]
<h2 id="what-is">What exactly is an essential oil diffuser?</h2>
<p>There are several different types of essential oil diffusers on the market. For this article, we focused on ultrasonic diffusers. Ultrasonic diffusers are best for diffusing essential oils because they do not utilize heat in the production of vapor. Since heat can have a negative effect on essential oils, ultrasonic diffusers are the best way to get the full benefit of diffusing essential oils.</p>
<p>Ultrasonic diffusers work by vibrating the water in such a way that it vaporizes into the air. Since the essential oils are mixed into the water, they are carried along with the water. Ultrasonic diffusers generate the vapor without any heat, which best preserves the integrity of the essential oil.</p>
<p>Diffusers are better than any scented candle, because you can put more than 100 different essential oils into them. You can even combine two or more essential oils to create a unique blend.</p>
<h3>The difference between a diffuser and a humidifier</h3>

<p>While a diffuser uses the same mechanism and adds a small amount of humidity into the air, the design of an ultrasonic humidifier is different.</p>
<p>An essential oil diffuser has a much smaller tank of water, usually somewhere between 80ml to 500ml. This means that the humidifying effects of a diffuser are relatively minimal when compared to a humidifier.</p>
<p>Unlike a humidifier, a diffuser is made from materials designed to hold essential oils. Crystal-clear acrylic water tanks let you see how clean the water is in your humidifier, but discoloration and cracking are common results of experimentation with essential oils. It&#8217;s possible to make a humidifier with a tank that can stand up to the organic compounds in common essential oils, but none of the models we tested in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-humidifier/">humidifier review</a> are designed to do so.</p>
<p>We did test some humidifiers that use a small heated pad to release the volatile compounds of an essential oil into the air without adding it to your water tank. Many essential oils change when heated, though. For those who want aromatherapy benefits and humidity, it is best to use an ultrasonic essential oil diffuser <i>and</i> a humidifier.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-essential-oil">Benefits of essential oils</h2>
<p>Essential oils have been <a href="http://www.utne.com/mind-and-body/history-of-herbal-medicine-ze0z1404zcov.aspx?PageId=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">used for thousands of years</a>, from cultures as far-reaching as Ancient Egypt and India. These oils have been used for a variety of purposes, from spiritual to medicinal, and there are a significant number of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0032645/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modern scientific studies</a> that support the theory that essential oils can be beneficial in a number of very real and quantifiable ways.</p>
<p>The following are just a few examples of the types of benefits that essential oils can provide:</p>
<h3>Eucalyptus</h3>
<p>Eucalyptus has been used across many cultures and is often used in over-the-counter medications. When placed near the sinuses or on the chest it helps with congestion and sore muscles. Eucalyptus is particularly useful for diffusers like the ones we are testing — especially when used for congestion.</p>
<h3>Lavender</h3>
<p>Lavender is typically used for bruises, cuts, and skin irritation. Studies also show that the scent can reduce levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Application on the skin has its uses, however lavender is popular for diffusers because it can create a soothing, relaxing scent in a room.</p>
<h3>Peppermint</h3>
<p>Used in many OTC remedies, peppermint can be added to beverages and soothe the stomach. Studies show that peppermint increases oxygen levels in the blood, and can help a person be more aware.</p>
<h3>Tea Tree</h3>
<p>Tea tree oil is commonly used directly on the skin, and can be used for everything from acne to fungal infections.</p>
<h3>Lots of others</h3>
<p>There are literally hundreds of essential oils to choose from, some more useful than others. We recommend you do some research to find a few essential oils that will work best for you. When researching and testing the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-essential-oils/">best essential oils</a>, we discovered that quality can greatly vary by brands. Proper use and selection are required to maintain safety and to properly enjoy the benefits of these oils.</p>

<h2 id="do-you-need">Do you need an essential oil diffuser?</h2>
<p>A surprisingly small number of people actually know what an essential oil diffuser is. When we conducted a poll, only about half knew what an essential oil diffuser was.</p>
<p>That said, diffusers are gaining popularity due to a growing interest in the health benefits of essential oils, as well as the fact that scented candles are not as safe as many once thought.</p>
<h3>The health benefits of essential oil diffusers</h3>
<p>For many essential oils, there are different benefits attributed to applying them directly on the skin, versus diffusing them into the air. Some essential oils shouldn’t be placed directly on the skin at all.</p>
<p>Essential oils serve a number of purposes, including the following:</p>
<h3>Aromatherapy</h3>
<p>Essential oils are used for everything from relaxation (lavender) to pain relief (rosemary) to decongestants (peppermint and eucalyptus). By diffusing these oils into the air, you can gain the benefits for hours without needing to reapply the oils onto your skin.</p>
<h3>Ambiance</h3>
<p>There’s a reason why many spas have a distinctive smell — they’re using essential oils! Oils such as tea tree oil have been used for centuries to create the ambiance of a calm, safe place.</p>
<h3>Insect repellant</h3>
<p>Many people are already familiar with the fact that citronella is a useful mosquito repellant. However, there are lots of other essential oils that work as well — which is a good thing if you’re not a fan of the citronella scent!</p>
<p>Essential oils that act as insect repellants include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cedarwood and eucalyptus for fleas</li>
<li>Thyme, juniper, and rose geranium for ticks</li>
<li>Citronella and peppermint for mosquitos</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, it’s worth mentioning that while there are candles that can perform many of the same functions as the oils listed, essential oils (especially 100% pure oils) contain none of the harmful chemicals found in many scented candles currently on the market.</p>

<p>Some people think that essential oils are out of their price range. After all, when people think “essential oils” they often image an expensive day spa. <strong>However</strong>, <b>essential oils are in fact significantly less expensive than scented candles</b>.</p>
<p>For the math enthusiasts, here’s a breakdown:</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JDGC78/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">22-Ounce Yankee Candle</a> costs about $27 on Amazon, and is guaranteed to burn for somewhere between 110 and 150 hours. If we take the high end (150), and divide by the cost ($27), we get a cost of <b>18 cents per hour</b>.</p>
<p>The essential oil math is a little bit more complicated.</p>
<p>There are approximately 20 drops in a milliliter of Lavender essential oil, and 29.574 milliliters in an ounce. This comes out to about 591 drops per ounce.</p>
<p>A four ounce bottle of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TSTZQEY/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">Lavender essential oil</a> costs about $10.50 on Amazon, which means you can purchase 2,364 drops of Lavender essential oil for $10.50, at a cost of $0.0044 per drop.</p>
<p>Smiley Daisy recommends that we use about 3 drops of oil per 100ml, which means in the 350ml Hibiscus tank, we would need 10.5 drops, which we will round up to 11 drops. At $0.0044 per drop, those 11 drops cost $0.0484.</p>
<p>A 350ml tank lasts somewhere between 6 and 7 hours. If we estimate conservatively, that means the 11 drops will last 6 hours. Since the cost of the 11 drops is $0.0484, then the cost per hour is $0.0081 cents.</p>
<p>This means that the product cost for an essential oil diffuser is 4.5% of what it would be for a scented candle. When put into the context that essential oils have health benefits and scented candles have potential health risks, the choice is easy — even when we account for the electricity costs of a diffuser.</p>
<h3>Research on the dangers of scented candles</h3>
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/16/scented-candles-toxic-safer-options_n_7536410.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growing body of research</a> which indicates that scented candles are not as safe as many think. It&#8217;s not just soot: many candles release harmful metals and compounds into the air — including lead, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde.</p>
<p>While there are scented candles that do not release these harmful chemicals, a <a href="http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/P1009BZL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">significant number do</a>. This issue has underscored the value and importance of finding alternatives to candles.</p>
<p>If you currently use scented candles for anything from aromatherapy to ambiance, research your brand of candle to ensure it does not contain chemicals that could be harmful to you or your family.</p>
<p>A better option would be to switch over to an essential oil diffuser, which provides many of the same benefits as a scented candle. If you strongly prefer the ambiance of a flame to the swirling mist of a diffuser, think about putting an <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-air-purifier/">air purifier</a> in the same room to give your lungs a break.</p>

<p>There are a lot of essential oil diffusers available online. In fact, there are more than 32,000 essential oil diffusers available on Amazon alone. With so many products to choose from, narrowing the field to a few finalists can feel overwhelming. That’s why it’s important to filter for only the best quality <i>and</i> best value diffusers.</p>
<p>First, determine the size of the room you want your diffuser to cover. Most (high-quality) diffusers list the size of a room in which they can effectively diffuse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too much” diffusing is not a common problem with essential oil diffusers, especially since many offer a way to reduce output if necessary.</p>
<p>It’s also important to look at the water capacity of a diffuser, along with the estimated operating time. The operating time informs you of how long you can expect the essential oil scent to last in the room, while you can estimate the amount of water (and oil) diffused by taking the water capacity and dividing it by the operating time (e.g. 100ml and 2 hours would mean 50ml diffused per hour).</p>
<p>It’s also important to take into consideration the build quality of the diffuser you buy. Essential oils can be corrosive to some plastics, which means that a cheaply-made diffuser might break down after only a few months of use. All high-quality diffusers use polypropylene, or another strengthened polymer or material, to ensure the longevity of the product.</p>
<p>Ease of use is another important consideration. This includes both setup (which should involve little more than putting water and your preferred essential oil into the diffuser) and clean up.</p>
<p>The size, or dimensions of a diffuser might not matter to everyone. However, for those with limited space, it might be worth looking into a diffuser with a smaller footprint. Similarly, a noisy diffuser can be distracting in an otherwise-quiet setting — such as a yoga studio or even your bedroom.</p>
<p>Features such as a timer and ambient lighting can be a nice touch, and are worth taking into consideration when comparing one diffuser to another.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>In order to determine the best aromatherapy diffuser on the market, we ordered our seven finalists and put them through a series of tests in our San Diego office.</p>
<p>The first thing we did was open the box and read the instruction manual.</p>
<p>Next, we looked at the pieces and assessed how easy it would be to set up the diffuser. We also took into consideration the build quality of the diffuser.</p>
<p>After that, we looked at the settings and options available on the diffuser, including auto-off, lighting, timers, etc. We also took note of how intuitive the controls were, and whether we needed to actually refer to the instruction manual more than once.</p>
<p>We also checked to confirm that the specs and features listed on each diffuser’s product page matched the product itself. Specifically, we checked ambient lighting, operating time, water capacity, timers, and automatic shutoff when the water reservoir is depleted. Fortunately, all seven finalists held up to expectations, so we moved on to differentiating between their diffusing performance.</p>
<h3>Diffuser performance metrics</h3>
[table id=259 /]
<p>To test each of the diffusers, we closed the doors and windows in our conference room, which measures 21 by 10 by 12 feet, for a total of 2520 cubic feet and 210 square feet.</p>
<p>We then filled the first diffuser with water and the recommended number of drops of essential oil (we used sweet orange oil for our testing because it has a distinct and easily-detectable scent), making sure to use the same ratio of water to oil for each diffuser.</p>
<p>With the conference room closed off, we put the first diffuser at one end of our 8-foot conference table and calculated how long it took for the scent of the sweet orange oil to reach the other side of the table — with three judges to ensure as accurate a measurement as possible.</p>
<p>The notable performers in this test were the dōTERRA and PureSpa &#8211; Deluxe, both moving the scent quickly through the room. This doesn&#8217;t seem correlated to having a more diffuse plume of vapor or a faster (and thus louder) fan.</p>

Like the Innogear, This is a diffuser that really lives up to its room-size rating of 300 square feet.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NZFGLHS/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>On the other end of the scale, PureSpa&#8217;s Compact model put out so little vapor that it took eight minutes to reach the other side of the room.</p>
[table id=260 /]
<p>After measuring how long it took for the scent to reach the other side of the conference table, we left the room and let the diffuser run for 30 minutes with the doors and windows closed. We went into the room and touched the diffuser to determine if any parts were warm, and also used a decibel meter to measure the noise level from an inch away.</p>
<p>Note that the main sound coming from a diffuser is, in most cases, bubbling water. The models with the loudest noise level, like the Greenair and InnoGear, also have a small fan to help the vapor spread through your room.</p>
<h2 id="best-pick">Best overall: Smiley Daisy &#8211; Hibiscus</h2>

<p>While all seven of the diffusers we tested do a good job of releasing essential oils into the air, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MPV473S/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">Smiley Daisy &#8211; Hibiscus</a> was easily the best of the pack. The diffuser’s short stature, coupled with strong build quality and four sturdy rubber feet means that this diffuser won’t get knocked over very easily.</p>
<p>What makes the Hibiscus really stand out is the vapor output it produces, as well as the quality of that output. The water capacity of the Hibiscus diffuser is 350ml, which is more than double the capacity of most other diffusers we tested. With a maximum run time of between 6 and 7 hours, this translates to approximately 55ml of vapor per hour.</p>
<p>The diffuser also produced a strong stream of vapor, which could be seen as much as 20 inches from the table, or about 16 inches above the spout on the diffuser. It&#8217;s</p>
<p>The large capacity and strong vapor stream of the Hibiscus made a noticeable difference during our testing. We found that there was a strong scent — about as strong as when the diffuser was on — for about 15 minutes after we turned the diffuser off. The scent remained quite noticeable until the 30 minute mark, and a lingering scent remained until almost an hour after turning the diffuser off.</p>

<p>Operation of the Hibiscus is simple as well. The instruction manual has very straightforward instructions, and using the product feels intuitive right away. There are two separate buttons on the front of the diffuser — one for turning the diffuser on or off (including a setting for a 2 hour timer), and a separate button for turning on and off the light.</p>
<p>The light itself offers seven different color options, which can either cycle or be locked onto one color. The light itself isn’t particularly bright, so it could serve as an effective night light without disrupting sleep. (Especially if you choose the red light, as we found out in <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-night-light/#really-matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our night-light research</a>.)</p>
<p>Finally, the Hibiscus essential oil diffuser is quiet. In our office, which measures about 40 decibels with the doors and windows closed, the diffuser only generated 46.5 decibels of noise.</p>
<p>Smiley Daisy also offers a 180 day warranty, which ensures that, if you’re one of the unlucky few that get a defective product, you’ll be able to get a replacement at no cost and with no hassle.</p>
<p>Overall, the Smiley Daisy Hibiscus Essential Oil Diffuser offers impressive build quality and the best overall performance of the essential oil diffusers we tested. At a price point below $40, the diffuser is a great value as well.</p>
<h3>What we didn’t like about the Hibiscus</h3>
<p>While the Hibiscus was our best pick, there were a couple of negatives about the product. The biggest potential problem is the large footprint of the diffuser. Unlike most diffusers, which utilize vertical space in their design (and particularly for their water reservoirs), the Hibiscus is short and wide, measuring 8.3 by 6.6 inches (and only 3.2 inches of vertical height).</p>
<p>In addition, the light generated is minimal, functioning more as a design element than an actual source of light.</p>
<p>All that said, these negatives are very minor when compared to the overall package. We&#8217;ve been using the Hibiscus for three years now, and it&#8217;s still humming along cheerfully.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MPV473S/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smiley Daisy &#8211; Hibiscus</a> has a strong build quality with sturdy rubber feet.</li>
<li>It has double the water capacity of most other diffusers, which means less refilling.</li>
<li>Smiley Daisy achieved the strongest vapor release rate in our tests.</li>
<li>With cycling seven colored light options, this is a worthy mood-light.</li>
</ul>

<p>After three years of great performance from our top pick, we set out to find a diffuser that would fill a different role, but with similar strengths. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075V1R8LT/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InnoGear &#8211; Premium 500ml Diffuser</a> isn&#8217;t just great at spreading your favorite essence across a large space: It can also do so for up to 12 hours of run-time.</p>
<p>Our previous endurance pick, the PureSpa &#8211; Deluxe, relied on a low output rate to get long run times from its 120ml tank. The InnoGear makes no such compromises.</p>
<p>The InnoGear diffuser also has a distinctive look. Unlike the faux-wood or white plastic shells that are so common, this model features a metal screen that adds some contrast to the colored lighting options.</p>

<p>This design doesn&#8217;t solve all of our reservations about the Smiley Daisy. If you&#8217;re looking for a compact diffuser to keep at a desk or on a small side-table, this is even less ideal than our top pick.</p>
<p>One other tiny flaw is noise: this is on the louder end of the lineup we&#8217;ve tested. There&#8217;s a small fan inside helping spread your favorite scent to all corners of a room, and that makes it just a hair louder than ultra-quiet models like the dōTERRA &#8211; Petal. It&#8217;s not going to be distracting during the day in a large room, but if you can&#8217;t sleep next to devices that make quiet, constant sounds this isn&#8217;t the best choice.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The InnoGear is a large diffuser that will run for a very long time.</li>
<li>You still get a good, strong output from this design for the whole time it&#8217;s running.</li>
<li>A unique look sets this model apart.</li>
<li>The plume of vapor from the InnoGear is the tallest, but the most diffuse.</li>

<h2 id="the-others">Other finalists we tested</h2>
<h3 id="second-best-doterra-petal">dōTERRA &#8211; Petal Diffuser</h3>
<p><img class="full-width alignnone size-full wp-image-19569" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/doTERRA_Petal-Diffuser_web.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NZFGLHS/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">dōTERRA &#8211; Petal Diffuser</a> is another very strong option from our list of finalists. The materials feel strong and sturdy, and we expect that the Petal diffuser will stand the test of time.</p>
<p>During our testing, we also found that the Petal diffuser was able to reach the other side of our 8-foot conference table very quickly — the average our testers agreed upon was just 35 seconds. This is less than half the time that the Hibiscus diffused, and while not a particularly scientific testing method, it does say something significant about the dōTERRA diffuser’s ability to permeate a room quickly.</p>
<p>The light produced by the diffuser is a pleasant, soft white, and provides notably more light than the Hibiscus. However, the Petal diffuser is limited to only white light, as opposed to the wide range of color options offered by our top picks.</p>
<p>The Petal diffuser is very quiet as well. In our conference room, where ambient noise registered at 40 decibels, the Petal diffuser only generated 46 decibels when our noise meter was less than an inch away — comparable to the Hibiscus.</p>
<p>Similarly, the scent was quite noticeable for nearly 30 minutes after shutting off the diffuser (just like the Hibiscus), and the essential oil could still be smelled for about one hour after the diffuser was shut off.</p>
<p>Operation of the diffuser is simple. There are two buttons on the front, one for the light and the other for turning the diffuser on or off. One interesting feature we noticed was that the Petal Diffuser must have water in it before being turned on — however we consider this a safety feature that we are better off having.</p>
<p>Another strange feature we noticed was that the diffuser defaults to a 2 hour timer, and hitting the button again then cycles through the 1 and 4-hour settings before shutting off again. This is a minor quirk, but it did stand out to us during testing.</p>
<p>There were a few areas in which it fell short of our top pick<span style="font-size: 16px;">. </span>First off, the Petal diffuser produces less vapor and has a smaller capacity than our top picks. The Hibiscus runs for around seven hours, and the InnoGear can pump out approximately 45 ml per hour for ten hours. The Petal&#8217;s four-hour maximum runtime and its high price make it harder to recommend when you look at the competition.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the dōTERRA &#8211; Petal is a great product, and is more compact than the Hibiscus. However, in an apples-to-apples comparison, the Hibiscus is a better buy.</p>
<h3 id="all-day-all-night-diffuser">PureSpa &#8211; Deluxe</h3>
<p><img class="full-width" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PureSpa_Deluxe_web-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VKER63E/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pure Enrichment &#8211; PureSpa Deluxe</a> is a great product, and if we hadn’t also tested so many other great diffusers, we would have been confident recommending it as our best pick.</p>
<p>The PureSpa Deluxe has a 2-year manufacturer warranty provides peace of mind, and we like the clean and polished design (despite the overly-loud logo).</p>
<p>What makes the PureSpa Deluxe really stand out is its 8 to 10 hour running time, one of the longest we found<strong>.</strong> This means you can turn the diffuser on at the beginning of your workday (or before going to sleep) and it will run consistently throughout the entire day (or night) without a second thought.</p>
<p>The lighting is also well-executed, with the option to cycle through blue, green, red, yellow, and purple — however there is <i>not</i> a setting to stay locked onto one color. Also, much like our top picks, the PureSpa Deluxe did not become hot anywhere, even after running continuously for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Despite the positive features of the PureSpa Deluxe, there are a few problems that we couldn’t overlook, particularly when compared to the Smiley Daisy &#8211; Hibiscus and the dōTERRA Petal Diffuser:</p>
<p>First off, the water capacity of the PureSpa Deluxe is just 120ml, less than both the Hibiscus (350ml) and the Petal (150ml). That, coupled with the extended runtime of the PureSpa Deluxe means that the amount of vapor produced per hour is significantly lower than either of our top picks.</p>
<p>We calculated the vapor diffused by the PureSpa Deluxe per hour was around 12ml to 15ml. This stands in stark contrast to the Hibiscus (55ml per hour) and the Petal (37.5ml per hour).</p>
<p>This difference was noticeable in our testing as well. After 30 minutes with the PureSpa Deluxe on, we found that the scent in the room was certainly present, but notably weaker than it was with either the Hibiscus or the Petal diffusers. Furthermore, the scent was all but gone 15 minutes after turning the diffuser off.</p>
<p>Finally, the PureSpa Deluxe is notably louder than both the Hibiscus and the Petal diffusers. Our noise meter detected 51 decibels, which is about 5 decibels louder than both of our top picks.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the PureSpa Deluxe is worth considering if you want a diffuser that can run all day without needing to be refilled, and if you are more interested in having a subtle scent of essential oil in a particular room.</p>
<h3>ZAQ Allay LiteMist Diffuser</h3>
<p><img class="full-width alignnone size-full wp-image-19569" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ZAQ-Allay_web.jpg" alt="ZAQ Allay_web" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0161ZYOA4/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">ZAQ Allay diffuser</a> has one of the more creative designs of the diffusers we came across. The LED lighting looks great emanating from the long cap (which itself is available in multiple colors).</p>
<p>However, the diffuser itself only has a water capacity of 80ml, which with a maximum 4 hour runtime means that this diffuser only produces about 20ml of vapor per hour.</p>
<p>In addition, we noticed that the mist fell to the table — which indicates that this particular diffuser does not break the water into small enough particles to float through the room. This observation was supported by the fact that the it took 2 minutes and 15 seconds for the scent of the essential oil to reach the other side of our 8-foot conference table.</p>
<p>Finally, the build quality of this diffuser, while not terrible, can’t really compete with several of the other products we tested. For the $40 price point, there are simply better options available.</p>
<h3>Nestar</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22557" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml.jpg" alt="Nestar - 120ml" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-810x540.jpg 810w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nestar-120ml-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We picked up the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JFPTSP9/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Nestar ceramic essential oil diffuser</strong></a> because of its compact size, clean lines, and affordable price. The tank is slightly larger than the similar Smiley Daisy &#8211; Love in a Mist diffuser below, and the rated maximum room size is bigger. The light only shines white.</p>
<p>While we like the look and the features on offer with this model, it just didn&#8217;t quite live up to the performance expectations we had after testing larger diffusers. It&#8217;s quicker to diffuse scents in an eight-foot-long room than many of the smaller models we tested, but it&#8217;s no competition for the dōTERRA.</p>
<p>This is smaller than our top pick, but it&#8217;s also a little bit more wobbly. For some people, that might be fine; it&#8217;s not going to fall over by itself. But for cramped quarters like a college dorm room or an essential-oil-friendly workplace, we&#8217;d prefer to give up a few square inches of desk space in return for certainty that you&#8217;re not going to spill scented water everywhere.</p>
<h3>Smiley Daisy &#8211; Love in a Mist</h3>
<p><img class="full-width alignnone size-full wp-image-19569" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SmileyDaisy_Love-in-a-Mist_web.jpg" alt="SmileyDaisy - Love in a Mist" /></p>
<p>The intricate shapes etched into the porcelain make the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SDM5XXG/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">Love in a Mist diffuser</a> arguably the prettiest product we tested. The build quality of this diffuser is fantastic inside and out, with high-quality plastic for the interior reservoir. The Love in a Mist diffuser also has several lighting color options, which can cycle or remain locked.</p>
<p>However, during our testing it took 3 minutes and 15 seconds for the scent of the essential oil to reach the other side of the table — significantly longer than our best picks. Unfortunately, we detected 52 decibels of noise next to the diffuser, notably louder than our best picks.</p>
<p>While this is a beautiful diffuser, it is more expensive than the other products we tested (around $60) with less impressive results. However, if you are more concerned with beauty rather than peak performance, this is a compelling (and reasonably functional) option.</p>
<h3>PureSpa Compact Diffuser</h3>
<p><img class="full-width alignnone size-full wp-image-19569" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PureSpa_color-change_web.jpg" alt="PureSpa_color-change_web" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VKEEY8E/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">PureSpa Compact diffuser</a> is one of the most popular options on the market, with thousands of Amazon reviews averaging 4.6 stars. This diffuser is simple, easy to operate, and provides 7 hours of diffusing with 100ml of water. This diffuser also has ambient LED lighting, and is made from cheap, but durable materials.</p>
<p>The most significant downside to this diffuser is the 100ml tank and 7 hour run time — which translates to a paltry 14.3ml of vapor per hour. This deficiency presented itself in the 2 minute and 30 seconds it took for the scent of the essential oil to reach the other side of the table.</p>
<h3>Greenair Spa Vapor+</h3>
<p><img class="full-width alignnone size-full wp-image-19569" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/greenair_Spa-Vapor_web.jpg" alt="PureSpa_color-change_web" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00889F0ZK/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" noreferrer">Greenair Spa Vapor+</a> was the last diffuser we tested, and overall it is a decent product. With a 150ml tank and a 4 hour run time, this diffuser generates an impressive 37.5ml of vapor per hour.</p>
<p>However, this diffuser is on the noisier side, registering 52 decibels, and the scent of the essential oil disappeared soon after we turned off the diffuser (within 10 to 15 minutes). This fact, in conjunction with the considerable vapor production, signifies that the Spa Vapor+ is simply unable to produce vapor particles small enough to remain suspended in the air for extended periods of time.</p>
<h2>Long-term testing notes</h2>
<p>After years of almost-daily use, both the Smiley Daisy Hibiscus and the dōTERRA Petal diffusers are still working very well. One thing we noticed with the Hibiscus in particular was that the residual smell of essential oils builds up in the reservoir over time. This doesn&#8217;t have a huge impact, but can have an undesirable effect on some scents.</p>
<p>We were able to successfully remove the residual scents by cleaning the reservoir with a little dish soap, some warm water, and <em>very</em> light scrubbing with a paper tower. We don&#8217;t recommend using any cleaning products beyond dish soap or vinegar, and make sure you triple-rinse the diffuser before using it after cleaning. Remember that everything that&#8217;s in the tank will go into your room air and lungs.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>All of the diffusers we tested can generate enough vapor to make a small to mid-sized room smell like the essential oil of your choice. However, some did better than others, especially when price is taken into account.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MPV473S/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smiley Daisy &#8211; Hibiscus</a> stole the show, generating lots of vapor and producing a long-lasting scent in our conference room. The Hibiscus also has excellent build quality, and its low center of gravity makes it a sturdy fixture on any flat surface.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075V1R8LT/?tag=ybddff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InnoGear &#8211; Premium 500ml</a> is a new model for 2019 that gets our pick for large spaces, with a 12-hour reservoir capacity and steady output. It&#8217;s also a unique style option that some of our testers loved.</p>
<p>The rest of the options all have their pros and cons, but for the money the Smiley Daisy &#8211; Hibiscus provides the best value <i>and</i> the best performance across all the metrics we tested.</p>
