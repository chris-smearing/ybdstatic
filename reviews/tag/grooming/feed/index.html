								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>f you don a suit for work everyday, it’s likely you have a dresser drawer stuffed with black, navy and gray dress socks. These conservative hues were once the norm for office and formal dress, but men’s dress socks don’t have to be just in 50 shades of the same. Bold colors and patterns can express your personality while also being sartorially smart. We’ve selected some of the best men’s dress socks that will upgrade your wardrobe. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B9FD9H5/?tag=ybdsocks-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Easton Marlowe</a> appeals to both conservative and wild tastes, and the best dress socks for the value are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0194E63NU/?tag=ybdsocks-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alpine Swiss</a>.</p>
<h2>Features to Consider</h2>
<p>Men’s dress socks are typically made of blends of varying percentages of cotton, polyester, nylon, wool and spandex. A cotton-polyester or cotton-nylon blend is usually advertised as “moisture wicking,” which refers to the fiber’s ability to move perspiration to the surface so it can evaporate.</p>
<p>Cotton is comfortable and absorbent but keeps moisture trapped in the fibers. Polyester, nylon and other synthetic materials repel moisture and excel at moisture wicking. Many dress socks are made of cotton woven with some sort of synthetic to help with moisture wicking and an elastic to keep the sock from slipping down to your ankles.</p>
<p>Sizing can be tricky, especially if you want socks that are predominantly made of cotton (80% and higher), which shrink when washed. Most socks are available in men’s shoe sizes 8–12, so if you have a larger foot and want the socks to fit after washing them, look for dress socks that are also available in sizes 13–15.</p>
<p>Polyester and cotton blends don’t shrink much after repeated washings, so you can buy them in your regular shoe size. Socks that are predominantly cotton will often shrink after the first wash, so it’s best to buy them (if available) the next size up.</p>

We selected Johnny B - Mode as the best men's hair gel for versatility in styling and Gentlemen Republic - Refined as the best value for men's hair gel.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e tested some of the best men’s hair gel on thick, straight hair and thin, fine hair to find out which ones have the most flexibility and holding power but also don&#8217;t make your head look like it’s been shellacked. The best men’s hair gel for all hair types is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009G7Z3XM/?tag=ybdhrgel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Johnny B &#8211; Mode</a>, and the men’s hair gel that gets you more gel for your buck is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PTB4CM2/?tag=ybdhrgel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gentlemen Republic &#8211; Refined Molding Gel</a>.</p>
<p>A primary ingredient in all hair gel is water, and combined with thickeners and emulsifiers, it creates a substance that’s easy to apply and makes your hair look well-groomed. Many gels also have alcohol in the top three ingredients, and with daily use, they’ll dry out your hair. A few gels, like our top picks Johnny B &#8211; Mode and Gentlemen Republic &#8211; Refined, are alcohol free, and these can be used frequently without damaging your hair.</p>
<p>Hair gel might not give you the textured, natural look for your expensive haircut, so we’ve also reviewed other <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-mens-hair-product/">men’s hair products</a> you might want to try instead.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>here’s a dizzying array of men’s hair products on the market, but finding the one that works best for you can be a frustrating and expensive trial-and-error experience. We experimented with a wide range of men’s hair products and determined that <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/American-Crew-Defining-Medium-Hold-Paste-3-oz/14662890" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">American Crew &#8211; Defining Paste</a> is the best product overall for grooming all hair types. If you have thick hair, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007CXWC4/?tag=ybdhairp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">American Crew &#8211; Fiber</a> will give your hair body and control with a salon finish.</p>
<h2>Important Features to Consider</h2>
<p>Our tester has thick, straight hair that’s been cut to lengths varying from one-half inch at its shortest to eight inches at its longest. This cut allows him to style his hair for an upswept formal look or a finger-combed casual look, which both need different hair products to achieve. The tested products can be grouped into the following categories:</p>
<p><strong>Pomade:</strong> Traditionally an oil-based product, most pomades are now water-based and have a gel-like consistency. Pomade can be applied to wet or towel-dried hair and usually has a high shine and strong hold. Generally, pomade is used on hair styles that are combed. Think Mad Men.</p>
<p><strong>Fiber:</strong> There’s actually no fiber in hair-styling fiber. It’s a blend of beeswax, lanolin, oils and other ingredients in the form of a hard paste. Fiber needs to be warmed between your hands before applying and is most effective on dry, short or medium-length hair. Fiber has a matte (no shine) finish and adds texture to hair so it can be molded into shape.</p>
<p><strong>Paste:</strong> Hair paste is the most versatile of men’s hair products. True to its name, it has a thick, paste-like consistency that can be applied to all types of hair and lengths. Once the paste is worked through, hair can be styled in any manner repeatedly after one application. Hair paste has a firm hold with a matte finish and no shine.</p>
<p><strong>Cream:</strong> This is one of the easiest hair products to apply and is often combined with pomade and fiber. Hair cream is lightweight and doesn’t have a strong hold, so dry or barely damp hair can be styled loosely for a more casual look with a matte finish. Creams work on almost any hair length, but because they don’t have a strong hold, they’re not ideal for a spiked-up hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>Spray:</strong> We’re not referring to hairspray, but to products that are marketed equally to men and women: sea-salt sprays. The salt in these light sprays absorbs oils and adds texture and body, giving medium-length or long hair a tousled, surfer look.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for hair gel, we&#8217;ve reviewed the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-mens-hair-gel/">best hair gel</a> in a separate article.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Our team tested eight highly rated bikini trimmers and bikini razors and selected the Philips Norelco - GoStyler, a men’s body trimmer with an easy-to-maneuver body and small trimmer head, the Veet - Sensitive Precision Beauty Styler and the Gillette - Mach3 Men’s Razor as the best bikini razor.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen it comes to trimming and shaving the delicate bikini area, gentle grooming tools are key — especially for those with sensitive skin. With the help of tender-skinned, irritation-prone testers, we tried out eight of the highest-rated bikini trimmers and bikini razors on the market and selected three standout performers.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QYOSKFS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips Norelco &#8211; GoStyler</a>, a men’s body trimmer with an easy-to-maneuver body and small trimmer head, turned out to be ideal for the bikini area. Our runner-up was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079C81WDS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veet &#8211; Sensitive Precision Beauty Styler</a>, a women’s trimmer that cuts hair effortlessly and also wins points for its light, ergonomic design. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0092K7C1O/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gillette &#8211; Mach3 Men’s Razor</a>, another men’s tool, won in the best bikini razor category for its narrow head and extra-close yet gentle shave.</p>

<li><a href="#bottom">The bottom line</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>We kicked off our research with a visit to Amazon to find out which bikini trimmers and razors were rated the highest by users and why. Then we compiled a list of the features most sought after by women in a trimmer or razor.</p>
<p>Reading through subreddits, trusted product review sites and Amazon customer reviews helped pinpoint the problems faced by users with sensitive skin, as well as the tools they’d personally tried that had provided the smoothest trim or shave with the least irritation.</p>
<p>Given the volume of discussion surrounding how to minimize irritation while trimming and shaving sensitive skin, we decided to dedicate a separate category to the best bikini trimmers and razors for sensitive skin. We also consulted with cosmetologist and skincare expert <a href="https://www.facebook.com/brushedbysabrina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sabrina Orchid</a> about her trimming and shaving best practices, and how to avoid irritation.</p>
<p>Once we were fully educated and up to speed on bikini hair removal, we selected five trimmers (three of them designed especially for sensitive skin) and three razors that boasted high customer ratings on Amazon and checked the boxes of our desired features: affordable tools that were easy to hold and maneuver and delivered a quick, close yet gentle shave or trim with minimal nicks or irritation.</p>
<h2 id="pink-tax">Are men’s grooming products better?</h2>
<p>While researching women’s bikini trimmers and razors, it was impossible to ignore the number of men’s grooming tools that had received high ratings from women for delivering a smooth, nick-free trim or shave specifically in the bikini area. These products often outranked women’s trimmers and razors designed especially for the pubic area.</p>
<p>This observation begged the inevitable question: Do men’s grooming products deliver a higher quality trim/shave than women’s products? (Spoiler: The answer is <b>yes</b>, according to our tests. Scroll down to see our testing results.) Consumer Reports even <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/electric-razors/buying-guide/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> in their Electric Razor Buying Guide that they’ve chosen not to test any women’s models because they had performed relatively poorly in trials — but that there was no reason why women couldn’t use men’s shavers (insert side-eye here).</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dca/downloads/pdf/partners/Study-of-Gender-Pricing-in-NYC.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> published in 2015 by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, women pay an average of 13 percent more than men for equivalent personal care products and an average of 11 percent more for women’s razor cartridges than men’s cartridges. This phenomenon, dubbed the Pink Tax, has stirred up a good amount of outrage.</p>
<p>A quick search online unearthed long and heated subreddit discussions regarding the superiority of men’s grooming products over women’s — often for a fraction of the price. This was also a recurring theme in Amazon customer reviews of men’s body hair trimmers and razors, in which women often raved about how much better the product in question had performed in comparison to those specifically designed for women.</p>
<p>Women’s brands clearly have some catching up to do when it comes to bikini trimmers and razors. In the meantime, we decided to include three highly rated men’s trimmers and razors (which also passed our testing criteria with flying colors) in our pool of contenders.</p>

<h3>Bikini trimmers</h3>
[table id=307 /]
<h3>Bikini razors</h3>
[table id=308 /]
<h2 id="versus">Bikini trimmers vs. bikini razors</h2>
<h3>Bikini trimmers</h3>
<p>Because trimmers cut hair <i>above</i> the skin, without the blade actually coming in contact with the skin, they’re a great choice for women with sensitive skin. There’s no razor burn to worry about, a smaller chance of irritation or ingrown hairs and virtually zero chance of cutting yourself. With trimmers, women can keep the bikini region neat and groomed without shaving everything off. However, though you can usually choose a hair length setting, you’ll never be able to cut your hair as close as you can with a razor.</p>
<h3>Bikini razors</h3>
<p>For the purpose of this article, we’re going to focus on the two types of razors best suited for the sensitive bikini area: cartridge razors and electric foil shavers.</p>
<p>Cartridge razors come in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0092K7C1O/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">3-blade</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SMIIR0W/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">5-blade</a> and even 7-blade varieties, and the number of blades you choose comes down to personal preference. Some razor users claim that less blades scraping the skin equals less irritation; others say that razors with more blades reduce the number of swipes required for a smooth, irritation-free shave. Cartridge razors are a good choice for women who want a close, baby-smooth shave.</p>
<p>The “foil” in the head of an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01APRR4ME/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">electric foil shaver</a> is a thin, perforated sheet of metal covering the razor itself where hairs enter the shaver and are cut by the oscillating blades underneath. Because only the foil comes in contact with the skin — never the actual blades — electric foil shavers tend to cause less irritation than cartridge razors.</p>
<p>Some electric razors are wet/dry, which means you can either use them on dry skin or wet with shaving cream, which typically gives a closer shave. Electric foil razors are convenient and great for traveling (or anytime you don’t have access to a shower); however, they usually don’t deliver as close of a shave as cartridge razors.</p>
<p>Whether you choose to use trimmers or a razor for your bikini area, when you’re just starting out, it&#8217;s a good idea to trim hair down with scissors to about a quarter of an inch, which prevents your trimmers or razor from getting clogged.</p>
<h2 id="tips">Trimming and shaving tips for sensitive skin</h2>
<p>Our bikini-area skincare expert, Sabrina, recommends dedicating one razor to the bikini area only, rather than using the same tool for bikini, legs and underarms. In her own experience, she has also had better luck using a shaving cream instead of a gel.</p>
<p>“My two go-to shave creams are Coochy Oh So Smooth Shave Cream and Cremo,” says Sabrina. “Apply the cream first thing when you get in the shower, wait to shave last in your routine, apply the cream again and shave. Doing this will help make sure the hair is as soft as possible and the skin is prepped.”</p>
<p>Sabrina also points out that tending to your skin outside of the shower pays off in a big way when grooming the bikini area. “Dry brushing can help beforehand, as well as using witch hazel after to help calm skin. To prevent ingrowns, I use PFB Vanish + Chromabright. If you have extra sensitive skin, make sure to toss or change out your razor blades weekly, and store your razor outside of the shower.”</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Wet vs. dry</h3>
<p>When choosing the best bikini line trimmer for you, it’s important to note that many electric trimmers and razors advertised as “waterproof” are not actually impervious to water. Even if the product box is plastered with terms like “water-resistant,” “shower-ready” and “waterproof,” we recommend reading the manufacturer’s instructions or even contacting customer service before taking your trimmer or shaver into the shower with you.</p>
<p>While some electric trimmers and razors are truly waterproof, be forewarned that the majority are only intended for dry trimming and shaving, sometimes with the option to detach and rinse the head under running water.</p>
<h3>Trimmer skin guards/combs and hair-length settings</h3>
<p>To achieve your desired hair length and keep your tool’s blade from touching skin, bikini trimmers will either feature a built-in skin guard/comb that can be clicked into various hair length settings or include separate, manually attachable combs of different lengths. Some skin guards/combs feature rounded tips for an extra-gentle glide — a bonus for those with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>When selecting your trimmer, consider how closely you want to trim your hair down there. Are you aiming for a super close trim? Happy to keep things neat and tidy, but not super short? Or do you want the option of achieving different lengths, depending on the season?</p>
<h3>Blade type</h3>
<p>The best bikini trimmer for sensitive skin will have hypoallergenic, stainless steel blades and foils, to avoid redness and irritation. Bikini razor blades generally fall into two categories: stainless steel and carbon steel, which should be avoided since it tends to rust. Many razors also feature lubricating strips, which are intended to keep skin moisturized as you shave.</p>
<h3>Size and maneuverability</h3>
<p>The bikini zone is one area where an easily maneuverable razor or trimmer is vital. We recommend using slim, compact, lightweight grooming tools and razors with heads that aren’t too wide (no more than 3 centimeters, including attachments) so you can access hard-to-reach spots.</p>
<h3>Ease of cleaning</h3>
<p>As we noted above, some water-resistant bikini razors and trimmers require you to detach the head to rinse them under water, while others are watertight and can just be rinsed off quickly while still intact. Most come with a cleaning brush to help remove tiny hairs from the head. Razors with moisturizing strips can be tougher to clean, since they often end up with more gunk to remove from the blades.</p>
<h2 id="how-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>To test our lineup of eight bikini trimmers and razors, we recruited female testers with especially sensitive skin who had been through the gamut of ingrown hairs, red bumps and general irritation. Our sensitive-skin warriors rated the trimmers and razors on a scale of 1 to 10, using the following metrics.</p>
<h3>Hair-cutting performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>How well does this trimmer/razor groom your bikini area to your liking?</li>
<li>How close of a shave does this razor deliver? Any irritation or nicks?</li>
<li>How well do the skin guards/combs perform?</li>
<li>How effective is this tool’s blade? Do you only need to go over an area once, twice or several times?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Effect on skin</h3>
<ul>
<li>How gentle is the blade on skin? Any irritation, bumps or redness?</li>
<li>What is the effect of this tool’s skin guard/comb on your skin? Any irritation?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Maneuverability and ease of use</h3>
<ul>
<li>How easy is it to grip this tool while shaving?</li>
<li>How would you rate the tool’s size, in terms of ease of use?</li>
<li>Does it reach the areas you want to shave or trim?</li>
<li>How easy is it to clean this tool after use?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Noise level</h3>
<ul>
<li>How would you rate this tool’s noise level? Was it quiet or obnoxiously loud?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Price</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do you think this tool is worth its listed price?</li>
<li>Would you buy this tool yourself, based on its performance and listed price?</li>
</ul>

<p>After mowing our way through eight contenders for the best women’s bikini trimmer, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QYOSKFS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Norelco GoStyler</a> — a grooming tool marketed specifically toward men — was the standout performer, checking off all of our testing criteria and then some.</p>
<p>Although it was neck and neck with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079C81WDS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veet &#8211; Sensitive Precision Beauty Styler</a>, the GoStyler’s winning feature was its capacity to trim all the way down to 1 millimeter — shorter than any lengths offered by the other trimmers. Offering interchangeable 3-millimeter and 5-millimeter combs as well, the GoStyler caters equally to those who want the closest trim possible without shaving, as well as users who prefer a longer, more natural groom.</p>
<p>The GoStyler features stainless steel blades that cut easily and efficiently, requiring only one or two swipes over an area to trim hair to the desired length. Although the GoStyler’s advertising specifically touts its “DualCut” technology (basically, two blades in the head that move speedily from side to side to trim hair), most of the trimmers we tested also featured a two-bladed design.</p>
<p>We experienced zero pulling or irritation during our trimming sessions with the GoStyler, with no nicks to speak of. The buzzing noise produced by this trimmer is not ideal; however, all of the trimmers we tested left something to be desired, decibel-wise.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QYOSKFS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/philips-cta_-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/philips-cta_-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/philips-cta_-180x180@2x.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/philips-cta_-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/philips-cta_-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/philips-cta_-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/philips-cta_-180x180.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/philips-cta_-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/philips-cta_-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/philips-cta_.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best for Sensitive Skin: Philips Norelco - GoStyler</h3><p>Our top trimmer pick won us over with its narrow trimmer head, easily maneuverable lightweight body and smooth, efficient trim, cutting down to 1 millimeter and up to 5 millimeters.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QYOSKFS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>In a sea of glossy pink, white and lavender women’s trimmers, the GoStyler’s matte black-and-red color scheme is certainly more subdued. Its lightweight, slender body (about 17 centimeters long, with the circumference of an electric toothbrush) fit effortlessly in our hand and was easy to maneuver; the handle’s textured, rubberized surface also provided good grip.</p>
<p>With the comb attached, the end of the GoStyler’s trimmer head was one of two tools we tested that were only 27 millimeters wide (the other was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079C81WDS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veet</a> model). Whereas some of the other trimmers were much too wide for the bikini area, the head of the GoStyler felt appropriately narrow, giving us the option to do more detailed trimming.</p>
<p>According to the manufacturer, the GoStyler is watertight; however, Philips advises against using it under wet conditions because “wet hairs cannot be lifted by the comb properly.” In any case, the trimmer can be rinsed under water and used in the shower if you choose to risk wetting your hairs.</p>
<p>Though this review is focused on its trimming capabilities, it’s worth noting that the GoStyler also comes with a “detail shaver” head — a floating foil-style electric razor head that could be handy for cleaning up the bikini line (though you won’t get as close a shave as you will with a cartridge razor like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0092K7C1O/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gillette Mach3</a>).</p>
<p>The trimmer also comes with a cleaning brush and AA battery, and Philips offers a 45-day money-back guarantee and full 2-year warranty. With its sleek shape, efficient blade and superb maneuverability, the GoStyler feels high-end and expensive for its $19.95 price tag.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Though it’s designed for men’s use, the Philips Norelco &#8211; GoStyler is our top trimmer choice for the women’s bikini area, delivering a smooth, effortless trim that can be adjusted down to 1 millimeter.</li>
<li>With 3- and 5-millimeter hair-length options as well, the GoStyler is a good choice for a variety of trimming preferences.</li>
<li>The GoStyler is truly watertight; it can be used in the shower and rinsed with water.</li>

<p>Our runner-up for best trimmer is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079C81WDS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veet &#8211; Sensitive Precision Beauty Styler</a>. In many aspects, the Veet trimmer is like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QYOSKFS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips Norelco &#8211; GoStyler</a>’s fraternal twin, delivering the same excellent performance in a glossy pink-and-white package.</p>
<p>Like the GoStyler, the Veet model includes interchangeable combs, though with two length options instead of three: 2 millimeters and 4 millimeters. While the GoStyler features a fully rubberized, textured surface for grip, the Veet model is only partially covered with textured rubber, making it slightly tougher to hang on to. However, it did feel slightly more lightweight in our hand than the GoStyler.</p>
<p>The Veet tool trimmed our bikini area smoothly, requiring only a couple of passes down each “trimming path” to groom the hair to our liking. We didn’t experience any tugging or nicks, and our skin wasn’t irritated or red afterward.</p>
<p>According to the manufacturer, the Veet is a truly wet/dry trimmer. The buzz that emanates from the trimmer is on par with the GoStyler — it’s not obnoxiously loud, but it will make its presence known in your bathroom. In an ironic twist, the femininely designed Veet model’s whine is lower-pitched than the masculine GoStyler.</p>

<p>Like the GoStyler, the Veet feels like a petite, lightweight electric toothbrush in the hand and is easy to hold and maneuver. Its front is coated with rubber for grip, and we wish the back was as well; the shiny white plastic is pretty to look at, but counterintuitive for a non-slip tool. However, the Veet makes up for it with a slightly flatter and wider body, which feels more ergonomic to hold than the GoStyler. With its 27-millimeter head width (with comb attached), this trimmer is narrow enough to maneuver the difficult curves of the bikini area.</p>
<p>Like the GoStyler, the Veet trimmer kit includes an additional head option — a two-sided eyebrow trimmer with 16-millimeter and 6-millimeter hair length options, as well as an attachable eyebrow comb that shortens the length to 2 or 4 millimeters. An AA battery is also included, as well as a cleaning brush. The whole set comes in a clear pink zippered pouch, which is handy for travel. At around $20, the Veet trimmer kit is well-priced for its value, though it doesn’t come with a warranty.</p>

<p>Another men’s grooming tool, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0092K7C1O/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gillette &#8211; Mach3 Men&#8217;s Razor</a>, is our pick for the best bikini line razor. The Mach 3 has received many endorsements from women for its efficient, gentle, top-notch shave.</p>
<p>The Mach3’s three stainless-steel blades glide effortlessly over the skin of the bikini area, with no roughness or feeling of “catching” on the hairs. After passing the razor over each area once or twice, our skin was literally as smooth as a baby’s bottom. We only nicked ourselves once when, accustomed to shaving with less capable razors, we pressed down too hard mid-swipe. Clearly, the Mach3 requires zero pressure to produce a super-close shave.</p>
<p>Besides that hiccup, we found this men’s razor to be very gentle on the bikini area. Our tester, who has extremely sensitive skin and is prone to red bumps and ingrown hairs, saw no signs of irritation other than three minor bumps the day after she shaved.</p>

<p>In a world of bulky cartridge mega-razors loaded with up to seven blades, the Mach3’s slender, lightweight handle and narrow three-bladed head are ideal for hard-to-reach parts of the bikini area. The rubberized grips on its 14-centimeter chrome handle make it easy to hold on to in the shower, and because its pivoting head measures just 4 centimeters across, we were able to access all the areas we wanted to shave.</p>
<p>Bonus: Since the Mach3 only has three blades, with more space between them than what you’d find in a 5 or 7-blade razor, it rinsed easily after shaving. The Mach3 is priced at around $8 with cartridges running about $2 a pop.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike some bulky bikini razors that were supposedly designed for the difficult-to-navigate pubic area, the Gillette &#8211; Mach3 Men&#8217;s Razor has a compact, narrow head and slim body that make it easy to reach tough spots.</li>
<li>The Mach3’s three stainless-steel blades gave us an incredibly close shave.</li>
<li>Our sensitive-skinned testers experienced minimal irritation after shaving with the Mach3.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After testing a lineup of both women’s and men’s trimmers and razors on the bikini zone, we were most impressed with the men’s tools for grooming the area gently yet effectively. The narrow and efficient <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QYOSKFS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips Norelco &#8211; GoStyler</a> gave us a fast and tidy trim, cutting our hair all the way down to 1, 3 or 5 millimeters with no irritation. Simple to hold and maneuver, the GoStyler won us over with its easy to grip, rubberized body and the closest trim of all the tools we tried.</p>
<p>Our second choice, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079C81WDS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veet &#8211; Sensitive Precision Beauty Styler</a>, performed as well as the GoStyler, with the option to trim hair down to 2 or 4 millimeters. While its body was only partially covered with rubber, we liked its lightweight feel and ergonomic shape.</p>
<p>Out of the razors we tested, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0092K7C1O/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gillette &#8211; Mach3 Men&#8217;s Razor</a>, turned out to be the best shaver for the bikini area. With a narrow, pivoting head and three stainless-steel blades, the Mach3 gave us butter-smooth skin and minimal irritation, even for our sensitive-skinned testers.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>or nine weeks, we tested seven beard trimmers on beards of all lengths. We washed the trimmers, tested battery life and compared their attachments. Ultimately, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006NXRD58/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wahl &#8211; PowerPro 9686</a> earned our pick for best beard trimmer. It’s a corded trimmer with great blades and uses clip-on attachments just like your barber&#8217;s. If you don’t mind recharging, our top cordless pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M24BKOZ/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; ER-GB370K</a>, has an adjustable comb guide that replaces a mountain of clip-on attachments.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>To track down a lineup of worthy candidates, we checked out reviews from solid publications like Wirecutter. We were disappointed with most of the info we found, most of the content from magazines and style websites seemed more like promotional info.</p>
<p>Youtube reviews of clippers wound up being some of the most solid info we found, though most of the great in-depth reviews are from a barbershop perspective, so not many gave in-depth info about attachments useful for self-trimming.</p>
<p>We filtered retailers ratings and user reviews extensively, ruling out models with poor review scores on Amazon. We looked for the most popular models from established manufacturers, and selected models that were new or recent updates if a popular brand had multiple offerings.</p>
<p>Consulting with barbers at <a href="https://www.thestatesmangrooming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Statesman in Anaheim</a> and <a href="https://www.floydsbarbershop.com/tustin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Floyd&#8217;s in Tustin</a> gave us some assurance that we were looking at solid brands and useful features.</p>
<p>We only selected one corded trimmer for review. Compact corded trimmers (which are mostly tools for barbers and stylists doing detail work) tend not to include the attachments you&#8217;d want to have for beard-keeping. You could buy a hair clipper set, like the Wahl &#8211; Super Taper with eight attachments, but those clippers are just too big to be convenient.</p>
<p>If you do need a corded trimmer with more oomph to cut through your super-hard alpha-hairs, the Wahl &#8211; 5 Star Detailer or Andis &#8211; T-Outliner are barbershop-grade trimmers with adjustable blades. They don&#8217;t come with many attachments, though, and most beards won&#8217;t require the extra power.</p>
<p>Our top cordless pick from Panasonic also has a pro-grade bigger brother: the ER-GP80 is a top-class cordless hair trimmer with a fancy linear motor. But it&#8217;ll set you back about $180, and that&#8217;s just too much for most of us to spend on a beard trimmer. Likewise for the new Bevel Trimmer, which looks great for edging and stubble but doesn&#8217;t have any attachments for maintaining beard length.</p>
<p>We also dismissed gimmicky features like vacuums and digital speed controllers. If we got those features for free in a proven product we wouldn&#8217;t turn them down, but the core features need to be the priority.</p>

[table id=153 /]
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Battery or plug-in power:</strong> Cordless trimmers are significantly more popular than their corded predecessors, and it&#8217;s easy to make a case for the convenience. How much motor speed you give up going cordless depends on the model, but all batteries will die eventually.</p>
<p><strong>Size of blade:</strong> Wider blades make for quick work and straight edges, while narrower trimmers can be easier to work with around the chin and nose.</p>
<p><strong>Waterproof operation:</strong> If you have a shower mirror, waterproof cordless trimmers are great way to avoid leaving tiny hairs all over your bathroom. They&#8217;re also easy to clean, just soap and rinse the head under running water! You might also want to apply some clipper lube when you&#8217;re done, just to keep rust at bay.</p>
<p><strong>Stands and travel cases:</strong> The most sophisticated kits in this lineup included a pouch to store accessories or a stand for convenient countertop charging, but we didn&#8217;t find any models with both. Good travel cases are pretty easy to find, charging stands not so much.</p>
<p><strong>Attachment guides:</strong> The comb-toothed attachments on a trimmer will keep it at a consistent distance from your face, which makes it easy to keep your beard at a consistent length. Which attachment works best depends on what kinds of trimming you do most, and how you like to shape your beard.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories:</strong> A few of these kits include accessories like nose hair trimmers, narrow-blade detail trimmers or even foil shavers. We think the nose hair trimmer attachments are a nice bonus, but the shavers were basically junk.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>After leading a team of testers in our nine-week <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-beard-oil/">beard oil review</a>, our &#8220;bearditor&#8221; took his six-month beard progressively down to nothing with each of these trimmers.</p>
<h3>Trimming long beards</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/longbeard.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Using a comb, freehand trimming and the longest of the included guide attachments, we tested which trimmer works best for maintenance of a beard longer than one-half inch.</p>
<p>The difficulty of freehand trimming made this the trickiest category to judge. Using a guide like the No. 8 clip-on attachments for the Wahl trimmers means you won&#8217;t have to worry as much about taking a random chunk out of your beard. But, in the era of &#8220;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/yeard/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yeards</a>&#8221; an inch barely counts as &#8220;long.&#8221; If you want to join that club and keep your beard looking neat, you&#8217;ll need to learn how to shape a beard with a comb and the bare trimmer blade.</p>
<p>We gave this test to the Wahl trimmers simply because of the versatility of these kits for shaping and blending, especially as you&#8217;re figuring out how long your mustache can get before it starts stealing your beverages.</p>
<p>The Wahl T-shaped blades were great for freehand shaping, though the wide Panasonic blade is stiff competition if you don&#8217;t need the longer attachments anyway.</p>
<h3>Trimming with a shorter attachment</h3>
<p>For short beards, a guard or comb attachment make it much easier to maintain a consistent length. All of the trimmers except the OneBlade included at least a ⅜&#8221; comb, and even this is longer than what was once considered &#8220;groomed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every attachment we tested is very capable of helping you keep your beard at a consistent length, but we noticed that most adjustable guides were only adjusting the height of the blade, with no protection from the tips.</p>
<p>Except for the Panasonic with its longer teeth, the adjustable combs won&#8217;t keep you from &#8220;dipping&#8221; the teeth into your beard as you run it over tricky areas. We also preferred the Panasonic&#8217;s wider blade for quicker twice-weekly trimming; it&#8217;s tricky to use around the nose at first, but we think it&#8217;s worth the learning curve.</p>
<p>For most beards, we also think a built-in adjustable guide makes more sense than the various clip-on guides than barbers use on their trimmers. The Andis and Wahl trimmers perform very well and are great to use, but if the attachment pops off and falls behind something when you&#8217;re travelling, your trimmer basically becomes worthless until you can replace it.</p>
<h3>Stubble maintenance</h3>
<p>Using the shortest guide combs and the bare trimmer edge, we tried to maintain perfect groomed stubble with each model.nThe ideal trimmer will allow a perfect fade from bare neck to slightly-longer stubble along the jawline, then back to a shaven finish on the upper cheeks.</p>
<p>The Philips &#8211; OneBlade was the only trimmer that got anywhere close to an all-in-one solution for this look. If you want to keep permanent five o&#8217;clock shadow, the bare trimmer shaves close enough that you can actually create some contrast with the shortest attachment. This way you can leave a little more fuzz on your face but clean up the edges with the bare trimmer blade, which helps you look &#8220;groomed but rugged&#8221; rather than lazy.</p>
<p>Other trimmers will get close enough to leave an even scruff, but you&#8217;d definitely need to clean up with a razor if you want to keep your neck and cheeks looking clean.</p>
<p>A notable performer in this test is the Andis &#8211; Slimline. The trimmer blade is designed for lining up perfect edges on barbershop fades, and you can even &#8220;zero-gap&#8221; the blade halves to get it cutting closer than the other conventional trimmers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUFb7NWuios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instruction videos</a> and plastic templates make it pretty simple, but note that a zero-gapped blade can scratch you if you&#8217;re not careful. So the OneBlade&#8217;s design still has an edge for casual users.</p>

<h3>Battery life</h3>
<p>We topped off the battery on each trimmer, then ran it until the blades stalled. Every model (except the bargain-priced Remington &#8211; PG6025) could run for longer than 90 minutes, which is plenty of battery for weekly trimmings. They were all running strong enough to cut hair reliably until the end.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re using these in a barbershop, the extra runtime from the gigantic battery in the Wahl &#8211; 9818 is a great bonus, though we should note that it&#8217;s also the heaviest trimmer by far.</p>
<p>The Andis &#8211; Slimline Pro Li runs less than half as long as the Wahl, but that doesn&#8217;t take it out of the running: if you use a trimmer for extended periods, the handy charging stand means the overall battery life isn&#8217;t as important, and the light weight and adjustable blade will probably be worth that tradeoff.</p>

<p>The corded <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006NXRD58/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wahl &#8211; PowerPro 9686</a> stands out in this crowd because you&#8217;ll never have to worry about the battery running flat, and with two trimmer blades and the biggest set of attachments it&#8217;s a bargain.</p>
<p>We paid about $25 for this setup, and it has everything you could ask for. The detail trimmer blade even works quite well for nose hair.</p>
<p>Guide combs are most useful in beards shorter than a half-inch. Once you get past that length, things get tricky: a uniform 1 inch of chin hair usually looks kind of bulbous, so most beardsmen are going to start tapering. The longer guards in this kit might just stay in the box.</p>
<p>That said, it&#8217;s good to have options. Even if you&#8217;re just starting your journey toward a monster beard, the guides will help you learn about the grain and texture of your beard while you psych up for freehand trimming and shaping with a comb.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of this array of attachments but were hoping for something cordless, the Wahl &#8211; 9818 is just that. Beyond cutting the cord (and doubling the price) the differences between the two trimmers come down to attachments. The cordless model has a more nostril-friendly ear/nose trimmer and a (poorly-performing) tiny shaver, while this corded model has a barely-functional six-position guide that you could leave attached to its second trimmer blade.</p>
<p>Wahl also includes some &#8220;stubble guides&#8221; that protect your skin from the points of the blade while cutting closer than the 1/16&#8243; guide comb. These work well to reduce scratching, though they don&#8217;t trim nearly as close as the short settings on other models. The bare blade trims closer than the Panasonic, about the same as the Andis out of the box, but you can&#8217;t zero-gap these Wahl blades.</p>

The detail blade even works for nose hair!</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006NXRD58/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The only real drawback to this set is that there are so many pieces to keep track of, and most are only good, not great. The adjustable guide is actually pretty bad compared to other trimmers. If you need the longer clip-on attachments for blending out to a longer beard, it works. If you don&#8217;t need anything longer than a half-inch, the Panasonic is a better design that you&#8217;ll probably be happier using.</p>
<p>Wahl includes a zip-up pouch to keep all the attachments together, but let&#8217;s face it, fishing through a pocket that has eight of these combs in it isn&#8217;t actually convenient. (Note: You can put white paint on the size markers to help you read them.)</p>
<p>If you want a corded trimmer with more oomph, the Wahl &#8211; 5 Star Detailer or Andis &#8211; T-Outliner are barbershop-grade trimmers with adjustable blades. They don&#8217;t come with many attachments, though, and most beards won&#8217;t require the extra power. The Wahl &#8211; Peanut is another popular offering, again with few attachments, we also like the rocker power switch better than the slide switch on the Peanut.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Wahl &#8211; PowerPro is a great trimmer with a full set of attachments and a five-year warranty.</li>
<li>It isn&#8217;t cordless, and it isn&#8217;t waterproof, but you&#8217;ll never have to worry about an aging battery.</li>
<li>Includes 12 guide combs, everything from long stubble up to a full inch.</li>
<li>This wide T-blade makes detailing edges a little easier.</li>
<li>The accessory detail trimmer is a nice touch, though many won&#8217;t ever use it.</li>

<p>This was a tough pick. Each trimmer we tested has a strength (and a weakness) for particular applications, but the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M24BKOZ/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; ER-GB370K</a> rose to the top of the cordless ranks. Panasonic&#8217;s great features make this easier to use than most other trimmers, and both the motor and blade are top-class.</p>
<p>The Panasonic is versatile enough to do nearly everything, from stubble to shaping full beards, with just its one built-in attachment. This adjustable comb doesn&#8217;t go at long as some of the fixed-length clip-on attachments for other trimmers, but for beards less than 1/2&#8243; (where a length guide is most useful) we love that this wide, sturdy guide won&#8217;t pop off in use or get lost in a drawer.</p>
<p>The teeth on this guide attachment are a little longer in the front than on the other adjustables, so it&#8217;s tricky to go straight up under your nose for a close-trimmed mustache. But they help maintain a consistent length better on the rest of your face, and that&#8217;s what the guide is for anyway.</p>

<p>The Panasonic&#8217;s battery isn&#8217;t as long-lasting as some other trimmers, but the wall-mount charger is convenient and avoids the tangle of cords you usually face with a charger. The two pieces are a lot easier to keep in a drawer between trims than most other models.</p>
<p>Panasonic has one big advantage over the Wahl &#8211; 9818, and that&#8217;s a waterproof design. You can wash the trimmer without taking it apart, and also use it in the shower. The Philips &#8211; 5210 is also waterproof, but we like the wider blade and the closer-cut stubble on the Panasonic.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Panasonic&#8217;s GB370K is cordless, waterproof and doesn&#8217;t burden you with accessories to keep track of.</li>
<li>A strong, but quiet motor makes this easier to live with.</li>
<li>This versatile guide comb adjusts from stubble to bushy in precise steps.</li>
<li>If you remove the comb, this wide blade cuts closer than most other trimmers.</li>
<li>The battery life is short, but the price is also low.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078BDHV9P/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; OneBlade Face + Body</a> has a unique blade design, one of the only successful new designs since motorized hair clippers were invented. It&#8217;s also nearly perfect for keeping a short beard or stubble looking neat.</p>
<p>Rather than just making a row of v-shaped shears sliding against each other, Philips took the one-dimensional concept and made a trimmer that cuts on both edges.</p>
<p>These are also much thinner blades than most clippers, so you can cut very close to the skin without risking scratches from the tips of the blade. This means that you get real contrast between areas you want to look clean and areas where you want to leave some scruff.</p>
<p>The following guide comb attachments are included, along with three blades:</p>
<ul>
<li>3/64&#8243; (1mm)</li>
<li>5/64&#8243; (2mm)</li>
<li>1/8&#8243; (3mm, #1 hair clipper guide equivalent)</li>
<li>3/16&#8243; (5mm, shorter than a #2 equivalent)</li>
<li>A separate 1/8&#8243; comb for body hair use</li>
<li>An &#8220;edge guard&#8221; for shaving delicate skin</li>
</ul>
<p>This is halfway between the other trimmers and the real electric shavers we tested. That&#8217;s going to seem a bit silly for some people, since it&#8217;s not doing either job all the way: You won&#8217;t get smooth shaves, and the short guide combs won&#8217;t help in longer beards. But, if you&#8217;ve got a shorter beard or if you just want to keep your stubble looking neat, it&#8217;s a pretty perfect tool.</p>

<p>This wouldn&#8217;t be our first pick for freehand shaping longer beards, but the blades are quite capable even in that role. Most guys who aspire to full-length beards aren&#8217;t going to be using the bare blade for lining up edges anymore, but if you do it&#8217;s a versatile tool.</p>
<h3>Also a great body hair trimmer</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for one device that can manage all of your grooming, this has you covered below the neck, too. If your back hair is out of control, our other <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-body-hair-trimmer/">body hair trimmer picks</a> are still better at helping you reach, but for everything else the Philips &#8211; OneBlade is a pretty compelling pick.</p>
<p>Is it gross to say that you can use a beard trimmer as a body hair trimmer? Yes, but in this case Philips has kind of cheated. The package comes with three completely separate blade assemblies that you can dedicate to whatever funky fate you choose.</p>
<p>You even get a specific comb attachment for body hair that will help you keep your blades from getting mixed up. This is also by far the easiest trimmer to wash thoroughly, so you won&#8217;t need to worry about contaminating your Dopp kit.</p>
<p>The &#8220;edge guard&#8221; works pretty well for keeping delicate skin out of the blades, but the foil shaver on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0037HP9OA/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Bodygroom</a> is still the safest pick for getting right to the skin in sensitive places.</p>
<h3>What about upgrade options?</h3>
<p>We tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078BDHV9P//?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">mid-tier &#8220;Face + Body&#8221; kit</a>; it has a slightly bigger battery and more attachments than the base kit. For $15 more, we think that&#8217;s a great deal, but spending around $40 more on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072DTDVMC/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OneBlade &#8211; Pro</a> isn&#8217;t quite as compelling.</p>
<p>The Pro features an adjustable guide attachment with a 10mm length, which brings it up to par with the rest of the trimmers we tested for mid-length beards, but the attachment isn&#8217;t as wide or sturdy as the guides bigger trimmers like the Panasonic have.</p>
<p>The Pro doesn&#8217;t come with the spare guides or blades that you can dedicate to body-hair use, which dampens our enthusiasm for it. You can buy those separately for about $30; you can&#8217;t buy a longer guide comb for the base OneBlade.</p>
<h3>How well does it shave, though?</h3>
<p>Our tester used these beard trimmers at the same time as early testing for our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-electric-shaver/">electric shaver guide</a>, using the shavers on neck and cheeks with the beard trimmers to maintain a goatee. We tried the OneBlade in this role, and it&#8217;s not the same class of shave as any of our top picks. If you&#8217;ve got anyone inspecting how close you shave, (be that a domestic partner or a Sergeant), this won&#8217;t do the job.</p>
<p>If you just need to be technically clean-shaven, but you&#8217;re not worried about the prickly feeling of stubble, the OneBlade is cheaper and just as easy to use as an electric shaver. If your hair is light enough, you might even fool people; it&#8217;s a good deal closer than any of the other trimmers.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The OneBlade Face + Body works very well for shaving down to a clean-but-prickly shadow.</li>
<li>This kit includes comb attachments up to three sixteenths of an inch to maintain a shorter beard or mustache.</li>
<li>Philips included the longest-lived battery among the waterproof trimmers.</li>
<li>Also a great body hair trimmer, this model comes with a spare blade and comb just for that purpose.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Wahl &#8211; 9818</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058SY1XQ/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wahl &#8211; 9818</a> is basically a cordless version of the PowerPro trimmer we picked for long beards. The cost is double, but it has the longest battery life on any cordless trimmer we tested.</p>
<p>Battery life isn&#8217;t the only factor to consider when you&#8217;re buying a cordless tool, but it&#8217;s nice to see these kinds of specs. We were happy that we could even get inside to see what kind of battery it is (an off-the-shelf 1000mAh 14650-size cell soldered to the control board).</p>
<p>The battery and heavy steel body are the only parts that got a real upgrade, though. More critical features, like the guide attachment design, are identical to every other cheap Wahl trimmer. OK, not amazing.</p>

<p>That said, if you want to maintain a 3/4&#8243; longer beard at a set length, Wahl&#8217;s clip-on attachments are basically your only option.</p>
<p>For this more expensive cordless trimmer, our standards are a bit higher, and we&#8217;re disappointed that Wahl still uses these flimsy attachments. They&#8217;ll pop off if you put a lot of pressure on them, and you have to squint to read the size markings.</p>
<p>Waterproofing is also a missing feature that would make this a much better cordless trimmer. No, it&#8217;s not a must-have feature, but most of us don&#8217;t have a giant can of clipper spray always at the ready. A waterproof design would make use and cleaning much easier.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to put up with the fussy cleaning requirements of a pro-style clipper, we&#8217;d like to see some pro-grade design considerations, too. Wahl uses a cheap, spring-tensioned blade assembly here, not an adjustable blade like the Andis &#8211; Slimline Pro.</p>
<p>Wahl sets these to trim pretty close, so most people aren&#8217;t going to miss out on gap adjustment, but it&#8217;s another win for the Andis trimmer if you&#8217;re looking for a line-up trimmer.</p>
<p>Wahl still has a more versatile kit than any other trimmer, but most users would trade half of the attachments for some missing features. The build feels solid, but that&#8217;s entirely because of the stainless body tube; the internal components are just as cheap as any of the other trimmers. (A point borne out by the spotty reliability record in the Amazon reviews.)</p>
<h3>Andis &#8211; Slimline Pro Li</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01499YQP2/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Andis &#8211; Slimline Pro Li</a> is a small, light, versatile tool that finds its way onto many barbershop and stylist workstations. It&#8217;s missing some features that would make it an easy top pick, but for some people it might still be the right tool.</p>
<p>The Slimline is at its best without a guide comb. That&#8217;s how most barbers use it, and the few guides that are included makes it clear that Andis knows this. Barbers also complain about these attachments, just like the Wahl attachments.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t need the #4-#8 attachments that the Wahl has, there are a few things this trimmer has going for it. It&#8217;s slimmer and lighter, so it&#8217;ll be easier to pack for travel even if you don&#8217;t have to hold it up all day. The blade is also adjustable to &#8220;hit&#8221; a zero-gap line, so you can get right down to the skin if you want to. (Be careful, and check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019WSCKL2/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">templates that can help you</a> line up the edge.)</p>
<p>If it weren&#8217;t for the OneBlade, then, this might be our pick for trimming close-cropped and precisely-lined beards. With that option on the table, though, the only reason to go for the non-waterproof and more-expensive Slimline is if you find that the OneBlade blades won&#8217;t cut your hair well.</p>
<h3>Philips &#8211; 5210</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017YNUH9E/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Philips Norelco &#8211; 5210</a> is another very close contender for our top cordless pick. The battery runs just a hair longer than the Panasonic&#8217;s, and the adjustable guide combs it comes with will cover beard growth that&#8217;s just a bit longer, too, out to a #4 equivalent with the two longer attachments.</p>
<p>We like the design of these guides for close-cropped beards, and in those conditions we think this is going to be a better choice than the Panasonic, since the long &#8220;teeth&#8221; on Panasonic&#8217;s guide aren&#8217;t really needed.</p>
<p>That said, the 5210 has a stubble-length adjustable guide that&#8217;s deceptive: adjustment marking indicate that you can go from 0.4 mm to 0.8 before you get to the 1mm height setting, but in real-world conditions these settings are no different from taking the attachment off. You won&#8217;t get any contrast from different stubble lengths using these shortest settings.</p>
<p>The OneBlade is a more versatile system for short beards, and it has a much longer battery life and better design overall if that&#8217;s the kind of job you need to do. For beards longer than a #3 guide comb, the Panasonic takes over as a more capable trimmer, with a wide blade and one do-it-all attachment for Philips&#8217;s 3.</p>
<h3>Remington &#8211; PG6025</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H2B4H2M/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Remington &#8211; PG6025</a> is the multi-use pick from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-body-hair-trimmer/#grooming">body hair trimmer</a> review, and it&#8217;s still a good trimmer for $20. The nose hair trimmer attachment is as good as Wahl&#8217;s, though for $5 more Wahl has a much more complete beard trimming package.</p>
<p>Remington&#8217;s budget-priced trimmer had the weakest battery of our lineup, and it&#8217;s not waterproof. The included shaving foil isn&#8217;t really worth using, maybe it&#8217;d be OK on your legs or for other areas that are less sensitive than your face.</p>
<p>The adjustable guide Remington uses is decent enough to work. Remington calls their three snap-on guides &#8220;beard and stubble combs&#8221; and the 8-step adjustable a &#8220;hair&#8221; comb. You&#8217;ll be fine whichever attachment you pick for beard trimming, but none of them are especially good.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Picking the best beard trimmer is a bit like picking the best beard: Every man is going to have different preferences. We narrowed down three picks that will excel in three different beard lengths, and we think that&#8217;s the best way to approach this decision.</p>
<p>For average-length beards on average guys, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M24BKOZ/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; ER-GB370K</a> has everything you need and nothing you don&#8217;t. It trims close enough for clean edges, but it also has a versatile guide comb that works very well in mid-length beards. The plug-in charging stand is also a nifty way to cut down on bathroom clutter.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter two months of testing eight different designs, we&#8217;ve picked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FYVOJC/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; ER430K</a> as the best nose hair trimmer. This is a refined improvement of the classic trimmer design, with a better blade and a vacuum to keep crusty clippings off your shirt. The ER430K is fully waterproof, so it&#8217;s easy to clean and keeps batteries dry. Our runner-up <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTS51NI/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; NT1500</a> proved it’s a better detail trimmer than it is a nose hair trimmer.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>The Wahl 5545 included in this review has been owned and used by our tester for about 10 years and represents a baseline for standard designs. There&#8217;s nothing specifically wrong with it, but we looked at the range of other models on the market to see if we could find improvements in design and function.</p>
<p>Finding credible information to narrow down our selections was tricky. Magazine-style features like <a href="https://www.askmen.com/entertainment/guy_gear/best-nose-hair-trimmers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one from AskMen</a> didn&#8217;t describe anything specific about the performance or cutting ability of the different trimmers they recommend and seemed mostly to focus on claims rather than results.</p>
<p>The relevant subreddits yielded more credible answers about what works and some recommendations. Manual trimmers seemed popular among /r/buyit4life Redditors, so we included the two most popular designs.</p>
<p>We looked for niche blogs that might give more insight into what makes or breaks a trimmer, but again we found no evidence of side-by-side testing in popular reviews.</p>
<p>Amazon and other retailers ratings/user reviews were probably the most useful source of info, with some solid (if anecdotal) evidence of models that were great. As always, we filtered for an average score of 4.0 or better and looked for leading designs that had consistently good reviews.</p>
<p>Nose hair trimmers use cheap components and very basic designs, so we&#8217;re not surprised to see that even the most highly-regarded designs seem to have some units leave the factory with parts that don&#8217;t work or break quickly. A 10-percent failure rate seems to be about average for the most popular models. There was no apparent alternative in compact trimmers with better longevity, at any price.</p>
<p>The vast majority of trimmers use a &#8220;nose cone&#8221; cutter guard, so we tried hard to find representative models that used other shapes or designs. We picked three trimmers with other cutter designs to see if any differences showed up in testing.</p>

<h2>Should you trim or pluck?</h2>
<p>Some popular misconceptions come up frequently when people discuss managing nose hair. For example, many will rightly point out that plucked hairs take longer to grow back than hairs trimmed to a length just inside the nose. Plucking is pretty easy with a pair of the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-tweezers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best tweezers</a>, and that means it&#8217;s better all around, right?</p>
<p>Maybe not. There are a lot of legends and scary stories that you&#8217;ll hear about nose-hair-plucking. Our tester grew up hearing stories from his grandpa about someone who died after plucking a hair that went all the way up into his brain, a story that&#8217;s almost certainly not accurate. We spent some time sorting fact from fiction and getting the details about why you might not want to do it.</p>
<p>Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a real thing, and it&#8217;s really bad, but that doesn&#8217;t mean plucking a nose hair will kill you. Basically, plucking a nose hair leaves the inside of your nose with an unprotected wound that could get infected. An infection so close to your brain <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-plucking-nose-hairs-can-cause-lethal-infections-2016-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is definitely something you want to avoid</a>.</p>
<p>A trimmer that reaches all the way to the base of a nose hair may sound like a great idea, but remember that your nose hairs do serve a useful purpose guarding against stuff that could cause those serious infections. Aggressive trimming won&#8217;t leave a hole, but it still means you&#8217;re not getting the protection the hairs are supposed to provide. Careful trimming of just the ends of the hairs means you&#8217;ve still got hair where you need it, but not peeking out at your date.</p>
<p>Also, remember that trimming your hair cannot cause its rate of growth to change: Using a nose hair trimmer will not make your hairs come back quicker or thicker. The rate of growth varies, but on average it should take about six months to grow an inch. Plucked hair takes far longer to grow back (since you&#8217;ve removed the follicle and it&#8217;ll take time to grow a new one), but just because trimmed hair grows back in a few weeks doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s growing more quickly or in a different shape.</p>
<p>These trimmers are for more than just noses, though. Trimmers are sometimes said to be better for eyebrows than tweezers, though if you&#8217;ve got especially bushy brows then you might appreciate the opportunity to thin them out. We have a bunch of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-tweezers/#hair-removal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommendations for hair removal tweezers</a>, and it&#8217;s probably worth owning both types of tool.</p>

<strong>Trimmer type:</strong> There is no detailed taxonomy of names for trimmer types that we could find, but you&#8217;ll probably recognize most of the cutting elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rotary nose-cone trimmers</strong> use a spinning blade inside an outer guard blade. It can&#8217;t trim especially close, but it keeps your nose safe from cuts. This is by far the most popular design.</li>
<li><strong>Reciprocating clippers</strong> are like tiny hair clippers with a combed blade moving back and forth against a guard blade. Unlike some hair clippers, these are specifically designed so they can&#8217;t cut you, though they can still tickle.</li>
<li><strong>The Philips Nosetrimmer uses</strong> the only really unique cutter design, with a tiny blade moving back and forth inside a hollow foil like a micro-shaver. Despite the unfortunate name, we&#8217;re happy to report that these blades do not trim the flesh of your nose.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Multipurpose systems:</strong> We tested a few models that came with attachments, but the tiny motors in these trimmers aren&#8217;t good for much more than cutting a few hairs at a time.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a device that does more than just trim nose hairs, you&#8217;re definitely better off making the more demanding task a priority. We <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-beard-trimmer/">reviewed beard trimmers</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-body-hair-trimmer/#grooming">body hair trimmers</a> with attachments suitable for nose hair, and they all work just as well as (if not better than) AA-battery-powered trimmers.</p>
<p><strong>Waterproof design:</strong> No, this isn&#8217;t to protect the trimmer from your nose, it&#8217;s to help with cleaning. All the nose hair trimmers we found were designed to be washed out, but some were completely sealed, so water won&#8217;t even get into the battery compartment. This isn&#8217;t a big functional difference for trimming, but keeping water out of the electrical connections will help ensure a long life.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>

    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Batterytest.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<h3>Battery life</h3>
<p>We put fresh Ikea &#8211; Alkalisk AA alkaline batteries in each of these and let them run until they stopped cutting hair.</p>
<p><strong>We want to point out that this isn&#8217;t an absolute virtue: a longer battery life may also indicate a weaker motor.</strong> In the case of the Panasonic, it seems clear that vacuuming up hair clippings has a cost in battery life.</p>
<p>The overall winner for battery life was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002UM5LNW/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair &#8211; NE150R</a>, with a reciprocating blade that trims very efficiently despite its tiny motor. Even when the battery voltage drops too low to spin up the Panasonic, this trimmer will keep on cutting. That said, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTS51NI/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; NT1500</a> was only 10 minutes short of the Conair&#8217;s time, so the waterproof design earned a runner-up pick.</p>
<p>These (and most other) alkaline cells we used give about 1186 mAH with a draw comparable to the Panasonic&#8217;s bigger motor, so you could improve runtime by switching to better battery chemistry like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZV9WTM/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon Basics NiMH AA</a>.</p>
<h3>Easy cutting and comfort test</h3>
<p>Our tester used these trimmers on every nose, eyebrow and ear hair he could find for two months, and supplemented with chest, leg and armpit hair for additional testing. (Leg hair actually hurt the most!)</p>
<p>The electric trimmers all did a good job cutting hair we pushed into the blades, but when it came to actual cutting inside the nostril some designs worked better than others.</p>
<p>The biggest difference we saw among rotary-type blades was inside vs. top cutting blades. Panasonic has developed a blade for their trimmers that cuts on the end as well as the sides, and the ToiletTree trimmer is a very similar design. This allowed for quicker and easier cutting in every task, without giving up the safety and simplicity of the &#8220;nose-cone&#8221; guard blade.</p>
<p>The manual trimmers from Kedsum and Groom Mate were the only designs that caused &#8220;pulling&#8221; in use. The blades sometimes failed to cut hairs cleanly, pulling on the hair instead of removing the trimmed end. We tested with a variety of hair types and tried to ensure we were holding the trimmer still while spinning the blade, but the careful practice didn&#8217;t change the frequency of painful results. You can get OK results with these manual trimmers, but even scissors would be better.</p>
<h3>Thick hair test</h3>
<p>Using thick hair and peanut butter, we tried to bog down these trimmers to the point where they wouldn&#8217;t cut anymore. While some trimmers had more difficulty connecting their cutting elements with the thick and sticky hair, all the powered trimmers were still able to cut.</p>
<h3>Cleaning test</h3>
<p>After running each of the trimmers through hair and peanut butter to get them good and gummy, we tried cleaning each with soap and water, then disassembling to see how clean they really were.</p>
<p>While cleaning, we also put dry tissue paper in the battery compartment and immersed the trimmers in the sink to see how waterproof they actually are. All the units advertised as waterproof actually were, using an O-ring seal around the battery compartment cap to keep water away from the battery terminals.</p>
<h2 id="top-pick">Top pick: Panasonic &#8211; ER430K</h2>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FYVOJC/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; ER430K</a> is a more complicated nose hair trimmer than most. Not satisfied to simply trim your nose hair, it also uses a tiny vacuum to collect the hairs in a little trap for later disposal.</p>
<p>If this trimmer weren&#8217;t great at doing what it says on the box, we wouldn&#8217;t recommend it specifically because of the vacuum. Fortunately, this is one of the best trimmers we tried, and the price is right in the middle of the range. The vacuum, then, is a nice bonus.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re cleaning this trimmer, it takes less work to clean out gunk because of the flow-through design that allows the vacuum to grab hairs. The manual says to clean the trimmer with the motor off, but if you do run it while submerged it&#8217;ll scrub the blades really well with a fast-flowing stream of water drawn through by the vacuum system. The instruction left us uncertain about whether this is intended, but the vacuum-free ERGN30K model lists this as a feature called &#8220;vortex cleaning.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t care about the vacuum feature and want to save $5, the ERGN30K uses the same great blade and should be just as easy to clean. Panasonic lists the same 90-minute runtime for the cheaper model that we got with the vacuum-powered ER430K, but they might just be giving a conservative estimate. The vacuum feature is handy enough that we think the ER430K is worth an extra $5, and it also comes with a cap and zippered case to keep it clean.</p>

The ER430K also comes with a handy vacuum feature.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FYVOJC/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>As mentioned in our testing section, you should see much better run-times with this powerful little motor if you switch to high-capacity nickel metal hydride batteries like these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZV9WTM/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon Basics</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MXCIK32/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eneloop Pro</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000WDSFPM/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ansmann</a> cells. You&#8217;d see an increase with other trimmers, too, but the 90-minute runtime on an alkaline indicates that the Panasonic is pulling just less than 1 ampere of power. This is compared to around 0.3 amps for the others, which means Panasonic will gain more runtime from better battery chemistry.</p>
<h3>The competition</h3>

The real competition for Panasonic&#8217;s trimmer is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E4PMQAO/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ToiletTree</a> trimmer. Some of these are more expensive, some are a bit cheaper, but unless you&#8217;re buying from eBay or Aliexpress you&#8217;re not saving any money by going for lesser-known brands.</p>
<p>As you can see from the image above, the ToiletTree trimmer (with the white post) uses a very similar cutter to Panasonic&#8217;s, so it has similar advantages. It&#8217;s hard to say if the Panasonic was working better for us because of a stronger motor or just because of the vacuum drawing hair into the blades, but it did seem to snip hairs a little bit more readily. The biggest difference between the two is definitely the noise of the vacuum, though we think it&#8217;s a worthwhile trade-off. (And, as we&#8217;ve said, if you don&#8217;t want that feature the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0049LUI9O/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">no-vacuum ERGN30K model</a> is one of the least expensive trimmers we found.)</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A refined blade design helps the Panasonic &#8211; ER430K cut better and at nearly any angle.</li>
<li>The vacuum actually works and helps keep those bits of crusty hair off your shirt.</li>
<li>The strong motor and vacuum feature come at a cost: runtime is only 96 minutes on alkaline AA cells.</li>
<li>Panasonic put a lot of work into making this waterproof and easy to clean.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="runner-up">Runner-up: Philips &#8211; NT1500</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-14639 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500.jpg" alt="Philips-NT1500" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
If the traditional nose-cone design doesn&#8217;t appeal to you, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTS51NI/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; NT1500</a> is definitely worth checking out. This trimmer uses a blade that&#8217;s something like a cross between an electric shaver and a clipper, and it works very well.</p>
<p>On many metrics this trimmer is superior to the Panasonic: it&#8217;s cheaper, it runs four times longer on a battery and it&#8217;s almost just as easy to clean. But for easy trimming of nose hair, the usefulness lags behind Panasonic&#8217;s evolved form of the old standby.</p>

A waterproof design sets this apart from other contenders, but the Panasonic is better inside your nostrils. Easy to clean and long-running, the price is right for a variety of clean-up jobs.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTS51NI/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>You&#8217;ll spend more time fishing around in your nostril with Philips&#8217;s design trying to connect the cutter and that one pesky hair. If you want to keep a decent amount of hair inside your nostril to help you avoid breathing in dust, this design isn&#8217;t very helpful.</p>
<p>For trimming other stray hairs on your face, though, this is a great design. Eyebrow trimming with the included comb attachment works well, and it&#8217;s easy to run over the back of your ear to grab hairs you didn&#8217;t even know about.</p>
<p>The Philips trimmer even does an OK job with sideburns and mustache edges, though it&#8217;s not a replacement for a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-beard-trimmer/">beard trimmer</a>. It won&#8217;t get especially close, either, so if you were relying on this to form sideburns you&#8217;d definitely want to do so before you shave. On the plus side, this design won&#8217;t pull or pinch or even tickle the way some other trimmer blades can.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Philips &#8211; NT1500 is a less-conventional trimmer shape that still works very well for cutting nose hair.</li>
<li>For ear and eyebrow hair, this trimmer is just a bit easier to use.</li>
<li>This trimmer runs longer than any of the other waterproof designs, 373 minutes on an alkaline AA.</li>
<li>The price is right: this is also the least expensive waterproof trimmer we found.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conair &#8211; NE150R</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002UM5LNW/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair &#8211; NE150R</a> uses a blade design that might be most familiar. Basically a tiny five-segment hair clipper, it&#8217;s dialed in to cut efficiently. If you were always certain exactly where your stray hairs are, this design would be ideal. Most people are going to want something they can quickly run around the inside of their nostril, though, and the NE150R doesn&#8217;t do this quite as well as the traditional nose-cone design.</p>
<p>In most other respects, though, this is an excellent trimmer. The blade design is simple and very easy to clean, though sadly the motor and battery compartment aren&#8217;t waterproof. This was the most affordable trimmer we tested, from a name that&#8217;s as old as any in grooming products. The alkaline battery runtime for this trimmer was even a little bit longer than the Philips.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re at all ticklish, the way these blades move back and forth next to your skin might be slightly unnerving. We don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a problem, necessarily, but since the competition can cut without tickling your nose as much, Conair loses a few places in the ranking.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t care about waterproofing and you can always see exactly what hairs you need to cut, this would be a great pick. For the rest of us, it&#8217;s just not quite as good as the Panasonic.</p>
<h3>ToiletTree</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E4PMQAO/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ToiletTree</a> may or may not be the company that designed this trimmer, but it&#8217;s one of the best-selling models out there. The ToiletTree brand came up frequently in consumer mentions in our research, and they&#8217;re now stocked at CVS stores. There are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y5CJG3Z/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">other trimmers that appear to be identical</a>, but this one is easy to find.</p>
<p>On the plus side, this trimmer is quieter than the vacuum on the Panasonic and uses a similar blade design that trims on the end of the cone as well as the sides. It works almost just as well as the Panasonic, and it will run for almost three times longer on a AA battery.</p>
<p>That said, the ToiletTree costs a few dollars more than the Panasonic, and it&#8217;s not quite as powerful or easy to clean. If battery life were a more important consideration this might rank higher. Someday we may see USB-rechargeable designs that make sense, but at this point, you&#8217;re still going to need to keep batteries around. Even a two-fold increase in battery life isn&#8217;t going to change the way you feel about a trimmer.</p>
<p>The LED light is also a bit silly  — even a poorly-lit bathroom doesn&#8217;t really benefit from the amount of light that this puts out. In comparison, the vacuum on the Panasonic trimmer might actually save you from some embarrassment or help keep your bathroom clean.</p>
<h3>Wahl &#8211; 5545</h3>
<p>Everyone who has seen or owned a nose hair trimmer probably knows what they need to know about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002FS4VJQ/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wahl &#8211; 5545</a>. This is a bare-bones rotary trimmer: the rotating blades chop off anything that comes into the nose-cone as they run along the inside.</p>
<p>Compared to our top pick, this design is lacking in a few ways. The blades are only cutting on the sides, compared to the Panasonic design that snips off at the top as well. The motor seems noticeably stronger on the Panasonic, which does have a tradeoff in battery life.</p>
<p>The Wahl doesn&#8217;t have waterproofing, either, which doesn&#8217;t stop you from rinsing the blade under your tap, but after using designs that you can drop in the sink it&#8217;s a definite regression.</p>
<p>We were also surprised that this trimmer isn&#8217;t more affordable. Panasonic has a number of bare-bones designs that are cheaper, and even the waterproof Philips model we picked as our runner up was a few dollars less.</p>
<p>Wahl uses basically this same blade design as an attachment on their cordless 9818 Beard trimmer, and as a free accessory in that package, it&#8217;s good to go. As a stand-alone design, though, it&#8217;s just not compelling.</p>
<h3>Conair &#8211; PG 1000</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074R3G45B/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair &#8211; PG 1000</a> looks like a compelling alternative to the old Wahl design and the new Panasonic design for nose hair cutter shapes. The rotary trimmer is shaped in a cone, with blades that seem designed to trim an even length at the opening of your nostril.</p>
<p>In practice, though, this trimmer has two problems. First, hair that enters the trimmer from the middle of the blade cone rather than the side is actually prevented from moving out to the cutting path. Second, you can&#8217;t remove the cutting blade from this trimmer for cleaning.</p>
<p>We had hoped that this would be competitive with the Panasonic, but it was actually one of the least-effective trimmers we used. It works, but basically any other blade design will trim hair more quickly and easily.</p>
<h3>Not recommended: Kedsum and Groom Mate</h3>

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ID2D1B6/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kedsum</a> is one of many brands selling this scissor-action rotary trimmer, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BPPF5Z4/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Groom Mate &#8211; Platinum XL</a> is a similar rotary cutter that requires two hands to use. These blades cut in a very similar way to the standby rotary electric blade in the Wahl, but with some interesting differences that make them less useful.</p>
<p>On both trimmers, hairs need to slip down into the side of the cutter to be snipped off; on really long hair it works, but if you&#8217;re just doing a precautionary clean-up pass you could easily miss hairs that aren&#8217;t lying in the right direction.</p>
<p>When cutting nose hair, this was mostly a pain-free experience. At times, though, hair was pinched and pulled by the cutting motion. Ouch. It&#8217;s hard to say exactly what the problem is, and it&#8217;s worse when we try it on eyebrow or arm hair than inside the nostril, but since these aren&#8217;t very efficient trimmers to begin with it&#8217;s just not worth the potential pain.</p>
<p>If we had to pick a battery-free way to trim nose hair, we&#8217;d go with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000127IP2/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">these high-end scissors from Rubis</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cocos-Closet-Safety-Hair-Scissors/dp/B01BRV4Q00/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this more affordable option</a> instead.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for your first nose hair trimmer, enjoy your youth while it lasts. If you&#8217;re like those of us who are looking for a trimmer to replace something you&#8217;ve had for a few years that has already died, we have some picks that will hopefully impress.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FYVOJC/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; ER430K</a> is a nearly perfect nose hair trimmer with a powerful motor and blades that cut any hairs at every angle. If you&#8217;re trimming on the way out the door, the vacuum feature also keeps crusty hairs off your shirt. This is a waterproof trimmer that&#8217;s easy to wash and maintain, and the price is right.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like something that&#8217;s a little more versatile and doesn&#8217;t eat through batteries as quickly as Panasonic&#8217;s rotary trimmer, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTS51NI/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; NT1500</a> is cost-effective and quite good at trimming hairs. The Philips is better on ears and eyebrows than inside the nostril, but it&#8217;ll run four times longer than the Panasonic on a AA battery and it&#8217;s still waterproof.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After nine weeks testing ten of the best electric shavers side by side, our team thinks the Panasonic - Arc3 gives the closest shave. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter nine weeks testing ten designs side by side, we picked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013AX8A3M/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; Arc3</a> as best electric razor. With blades that cut close and a motor that doesn&#8217;t let you down in tough stubble, this shaver is also a great value. If your follicles and skin are especially sensitive, we recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MPX171W/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Braun &#8211; Series 7</a> razor. It gets almost as close as the Arc3, but with a gentler touch.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>After reading reviews from shaver-centric blogs like Shavercheck, Pauper&#8217;s Dime and Getarazor.com, along with reviews from Wirecutter and Consumer Reports, it became clear that there are three brands to beat and not many competitors. The three brands that almost always come up are: Braun, Panasonic and Philips.</p>
<p>Braun is the most popular electric on Amazon, and their cleaning stand is iconic. Wirecutter loves them, but has only tested older models, while Ovidiu Nicolae at Shavercheck gives a comparison of up-to-date Braun and Panasonic models. We looked closely at both lines and picked out the newest models for close comparison.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen mixed reviews for rotary-type foils, but Pauper&#8217;s Dime (a website focused on smart spending) is the token enthusiast, lauding the easy cleaning and quiet performance of the Philips rotary shavers. We bought Philips models that represent the newest designs Philips has to offer in both a value-priced and luxury-class shaver.</p>
<p>We tried to find alternatives to the big three, and we didn&#8217;t see much that was encouraging. Skipping no-name shavers that seemed too much of a gamble, we found two more models to calibrate our test experiences. The first is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071YSDPKC/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Andis &#8211; Profoil</a>. It’s the shaver of choice for barbers cleaning up fades, and we wanted to see how it fares in a lineup of complex waterproof razors.</p>
<p>Remington is the other notable name in electric razors. We picked their new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WD7PT1S/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PF-7600</a> as a model that&#8217;s price-comparable to the entry-level models from the other brands.</p>
<p>We looked at &#8220;travel&#8221; razors, but so far as we can tell the only reason to buy them is if you absolutely cannot plug in your charger for a month. Even the power-hungry Panasonic Arc5 should give you at least two weeks of shaving on a charge, and the power adapters for our winners are dual-voltage for international compatibility with a simple plug adapter.</p>
<h2 id="best-for-women">What about electric shavers for women?</h2>
<p>We set out specifically to find the best electric razor for men, and our testers were men shaving their faces. Leg hair is not as curly as facial hair, which is good news for ladies. In other words, any of these shavers should work even better on legs than they did on our faces. The fact that newer shavers are almost all waterproof is also a boon if you&#8217;re used to shaving your legs in the shower.</p>
<p>Shavers for men tend to be more expensive than those aimed at women, though, and the pop-up trimmers and accessories are designed for different jobs. We hope this information about brands, features and designs will help guide your purchase, whatever type of shaver you&#8217;re looking for.</p>

<h2 id="why-electric">Why should you use an electric razor?</h2>
<p>The debate about the best ways to shave has raged for at least 100 years. To get some perspective on the debate, we locked a die-hard wet shaving enthusiast and a committed electric user in a room. After the dust settled they agreed on a few clear wins and trade-offs for the electric razor:</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> An electric razor can mow down stubble quickly and efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>Convenience:</strong> If you dry-shave, you don&#8217;t need any accessories for shaving at work, the gym or even in the car.</li>
<li><strong>No nicks:</strong> Let&#8217;s face it, the worst part about a blade shave is figuring out what to do when you nick yourself in a rush to get out the door.</li>
<li><strong>Sensitive skin:</strong> If you get rashes, bumps and irritation from a blade-shave, an electric shaver will probably be gentler (especially now that shavers can work with <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-shaving-cream/">cream</a> for easier gliding across your skin).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One o’clock shadow:</strong> An electric razor is never going to shave as close as a good disposable cartridge razor, let alone a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-safety-razor/" rel="noopener">double-edge</a> or <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-straight-razor/" rel="noopener">straight razor</a> shave.</li>
<li><strong>Expense:</strong> The initial purchase cost is high; and plan on annual replacement blades, then eventual battery death just like your cell phone.</li>
<li><strong>Bumps:</strong> if you can manage an extra-close shave, the bumps from an electric might actually be worse than from a blade. Careful adjustment of your shave should help, but electrics aren&#8217;t a cure-all.</li>
<li><strong>Mess:</strong> Dry shaving usually means tiny hairs blowing around your bathroom. (Shaving in the shower helps a lot, though.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="foil-vs-rotary">Foil vs. rotary shavers</h2>
<p>There are two common approaches to making a small motor into a hair-shaving machine. Each design is a transformation of the tried-and-true hair clipper mechanism. Rather than a single line of v-shaped cutting blades, though, shavers are a hole-filled &#8220;foil&#8221; of metal that can press safely against your skin and a blade inside that snips off hairs that poke through.</p>
<p><strong>Foil-type shavers:</strong> These use a half-cylinder foil with a set of hoop-shaped blades nesting inside. The inside cutter blade rapidly buzzes back and forth, just like hair clipper blades do, but your skin is protected by the foil.</p>
<p><strong>Rotary-type shavers:</strong> This uses the same scissor-like cutting action, but with a totally different mechanism. Rotary blades have two or three flat circular foils with micro-blades running in circles underneath like little propellers. The spinning blades are quieter and move more quickly than the blades in a foil-type, but they each cut a flat plane rather than a three-dimensional curve.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to angle a rotary drive shaft, so each of the circular cutters can tilt to follow tricky contours like your chin. That said, foil shavers already have some contour-following advantages with the 3D shape of their foils. So the difference between types in this regard isn&#8217;t as big as it might seem.</p>
<p>We asked around about reasons to choose one type over the other, and got mixed responses, but a generally consistent theme. When we asked John Howes from <a href="http://getarazor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getarazor.com</a> about his seven years of experience with different types of razors, he said that it depends mostly on hair and skin type. &#8220;A rotary shaver is great for thicker, coarser hair that grows in different directions. They&#8217;re also better if you prefer to have a less noisy shaver. Foil shavers are kinder to the skin, great for straight hair and precise shaving such as if you have a mustache or goatee.&#8221;</p>
<p>After testing a wide range of models from five different manufacturers, it seems clear that there is no hard and fast rule about who likes foils and who likes rotary shavers. Our two testers had polar-opposite experiences: One got a closer shave on his neck with the rotary shavers than he could get with the foil types, while another tester was convinced the top-of-the-line Philips rotary was broken.</p>
<p>In the end, if you find that a foil-type shaver just can&#8217;t get close to hairs that are growing in swirled growth patterns, you might be a good candidate for a rotary-type design.</p>
<p>On the whole, though, it seems clear that most people will be happier with the bar-shaped foils than the triangular pattern of circular foils. Carefully tracking against the &#8220;grain&#8221; of hair to cut closer is a bit easier that way.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Size and number of foils: </strong>In Panasonic and Braun&#8217;s lines of razors, you get more foils cutting at once when you upgrade to the fancy top-tier models. This does making shaving go a little more quickly, though bigger heads can be tricky to maneuver around the nose and jawline.</p>
<p><strong>Cleaning stands:</strong> Most of the manufacturers will sell you a charging and cleaning stand for their more expensive razors. This automates some daily maintenance functions, but if you want the stands to work their best you need to wash the shaver out before you put it back in the stand anyhow. They&#8217;re also pretty noisy, especially the Braun system.</p>
<p><strong>Cost of ownership:</strong> Beyond the obvious replacement blades (if you&#8217;re shaving every day you should plan on buying a replacement foil set every year) there are also costs like cleaning stand refills or some light mineral oil to keep your razor sharp and clean.</p>
<p><strong>Wet use:</strong> Most people who look to electric razors are seeking speed and efficiency, so taking time to lather up for wet-shaving is kind of counter-intuitive. The shaving suds will help the razor glide more smoothly across your face, though, and shaving in the shower makes cleanup even easier than with dry shaving.</p>
<p><strong>Battery Life:</strong> It doesn&#8217;t take long to complete a shave, but there&#8217;s no downside to a larger battery other than cost. It used to be that one could use a cordless shaver plugged in after the battery ran down. Now that shavers nearly all work wet, the manufacturers have disabled this option to prevent accidental electrocutions.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve got two testers at Your Best Digs who are particular about shaving products. One is a long-time electric user whose skin blisters at the mere mention of razor burn, while the other has been experimenting with straight razors since before he could grow a bad mustache. We asked them for comprehensive feedback in the following categories:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13928" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B.png" alt="Razor tests" width="2000" height="1896" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B.png 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B-610x578.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B-768x728.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B-885x839.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B-1500x1422.png 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B-295x280.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B-1000x948.png 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B-360x341.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B-375x356.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B-414x392.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B-320x303.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B-885x839@2x.png 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Closeness test</h3>
<p>Our testers ranked each design in side-by-side testing, judging which razor shaves closest by checking to see which designs could pick up stubble left behind by the others.</p>
<p>After nine weeks of testing, we compared notes and gave each model a score on a 5-point scale. It&#8217;s tricky to measure this as an absolute, since measuring leftover stubble is nearly impossible, but a five-star shaver could consistently improve on the closeness of a four-star shave, and so on.</p>
<p>Note that a blade and lather will pretty easily out-shave even the Panasonic &#8211; Arc 5, but it&#8217;s much closer than we thought it would be.</p>
<h3>Comfort rating</h3>
<p>This was the most variable feedback we got from testers, particularly for the rotary-type shavers. After testing the top-class Philips &#8211; 8900, one tester (who has used a Braun foil-type shaver for years) said it was pulling at his hair so much he wondered if it was broken or might have a faulty battery.</p>
<p>Rotary shavers like the Philips models we tested use a &#8220;lift and cut&#8221; system that, theoretically, allows them to trim hair closer to the skin. That might explain the discomfort, but the Remington and Andis shavers weren&#8217;t much better. Those less-expensive foil-type models are also buzzy compared to the nearly silent rotary cutters.</p>
<p>Our sensitive tester also said he found the less-expensive Panasonic and Braun shavers slightly more &#8220;scratchy&#8221; feeling compared to the top-of-the-range models, while our less-sensitive tester found it difficult to rank them specifically on comfort during daily shaves.</p>
<p>The foils on the more expensive shavers don&#8217;t have any obviously different features (holes are a similar size, coatings are the same) but the speed of the motor and number of foils are increased by Braun and Panasonic respectively.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis is that the more expensive shavers are cutting more efficiently, which means you don&#8217;t need to press the shaver into your skin as much to get close; less abrasion always means less redness.</p>
<h3>Wet shaving performance</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/electricwetshave_2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Other than the Andis &#8211; Profoil, each of these shavers is able to work wet. That means you can use them in the shower, and if you want a little bit of added luxury, you can use them with shaving foam, cream or soap.</p>
<p>Our wet-shaving enthusiast tried the different shavers with our pick for <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-shaving-cream/">the best shaving cream</a> and some brush-lathered soaps. The biggest difference when wet shaving with an electric is that the foil glides smoothly over your skin with no resistance at all, a welcome relief after rubbing foils into his neck to get as close as possible.</p>
<p>The shavers that work best with this method are from Panasonic, and they were one of the first manufacturers to push waterproofness as a feature so it&#8217;s little surprise. The difference between shavers is not so much in closeness (each shaver gets slightly closer when your hair is dry and standing up as straight as possible), but in how they handle the foam.</p>
<p>Models from Panasonic, Remington and Philips have much more room inside the foil to scoop up the lather between rinses, while the Braun heads just &#8220;snowplow&#8221; the cream around your face.</p>
<h3>Long stubble performance</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/longstubble_2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We also ranked how well these shavers were able to mow down heavy growth after a four-day weekend. This ranking is based on two factors: First, whether the different razors were actually able to get through the thick stubble for a close shave, and second, whether there was a painful &#8220;pulling&#8221; sensation with longer hair.</p>
<p>Panasonic&#8217;s newer models like the Arc3 and Arc5 are supposed to automatically detect long hair and speed up the motor to cut it more efficiently, but we didn&#8217;t notice a significant change in speed as the shave continued. The Arc5&#8217;s extra foils did help mow down the heavy growth, though, and if you&#8217;re going from fuzz to clean-shaven every week this model would save you some time.</p>
<p>Braun&#8217;s Series 7 shaver performed well, and when the speed was cranked up all the way it matched the Panasonic for efficient and smooth cutting. Without the extra foils of the Arc5, though, it&#8217;s at a slight disadvantage for a speedy shave.</p>
<p>The Remington was the clear loser in this category, its smaller motor just couldn&#8217;t generate enough force to effectively chop away the longer stubble without pulling on the roots.</p>
<h3>Cleaning test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13997" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest.jpg" alt="cleaning a shaver" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The best way to keep your razor sharp is to keep it clean. We&#8217;d read about big differences between the different designs, and we found that Braun&#8217;s fully enclosed cutter cartridges are definitely harder to clean thoroughly than Panasonic&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Probably the biggest surprise in our testing was that the high-end cleaning stands weren&#8217;t saving time or effort. Every cleaning stand insisted that a rinse was necessary before using the cleaning cycle, and by the time we got the hang of using liquid hand soap and a cup full of water to pre-clean the shavers, we started to doubt the benefit of another cleaning step with the stands.</p>
<p>The difference in cleaning score mostly came down to easy access to the inside of the cutting system. Braun&#8217;s system is totally contained in the snap-on cartridge, which doesn&#8217;t seem to be a major problem during cleaning after daily use, but makes it tricky to get out clumps of four-day stubble. All of the other systems separate the inside cutter and the foil, which makes it easier to do a thorough cleaning.</p>
<h3>Battery life</h3>
<p>We charged each shaver and then timed how long it took for them to totally run out of juice.</p>
<p>Whether you really need more than a few days of charge is debatable, but theoretically the bigger batteries will also take longer to become useless after the cells lose all their capacity. (All of the wet/dry models will refuse to turn on when plugged in, to prevent people from running power cords into the shower.)</p>
<p>Ideally you should keep the shavers at around 80 percent of capacity for maximum battery life and definitely avoid running them down to empty, but modern Lithium Ion cells are pretty robust.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sad that you can&#8217;t replace the batteries in these machines, given that with replacement foils they should work just fine for decades, but in the worst-case scenario (the power-hungry Panasonic Arc5) <a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_define_battery_life" target="_blank" rel="noopener">300 cycles of full charging and discharging</a> still theoretically works out to around 15 years of shaving time.</p>
<p>One unique feature of the Panasonic razors is that they will leave some reserve power in the battery, rather than just running all the way until dead. If you&#8217;re not paying attention to the blinking warning light, this will give you just enough reserve power to quickly finish your shave (and maybe one more shave after that) rather than just refusing to turn on.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t tell how much power is left in the Braun lithium-ion shavers, but our guess is that Panasonic&#8217;s system is going to do a better job preserving battery life in the long run.</p>

<h3>Replacement foil cost</h3>
<p>All the manufacturers recommend replacing the foils and cutters annually, though the Philips blades have a flat cutting plane, so <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LI-F6QJaEU4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it&#8217;s actually possible to sharpen them</a>.</p>
<p>One issue with replacing foils is availability. We tested current-model shavers hoping that parts would be easy to find, but the cheapest blades right now are from a few years back. (Naturally, the manufacturers don&#8217;t say much about compatibility between model years.)</p>
<h2 id="top-pick">Top pick: Panasonic &#8211; Arc3</h2>

Panasonic has often been pegged as an also-ran in the shaver race, but when we balance performance, price and design considerations we think the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013AX8A3M/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Arc3 ES-LT3N-K</a> does its job best.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Panasonic has released a new model in this line, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QXHZ4YF/?tag=ybdshaver-20">Arc3 ES-LL41</a>. We haven&#8217;t put it through its paces yet, but it looks like a solid update. The only major change on the spec sheet is the replacement foils: the LT3N we tested in 2018 uses a unique foil, while the new LL41 goes back to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001J6O0KA/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WES9087PC foil replacement</a> used on older Arc3 models. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any performance compromise, and this change makes replacement foils much easier to track down.</p>
<p><strong>Original review:</strong> At a street price hovering around $80, this isn&#8217;t a bargain razor by any stretch of the imagination. There are many, many brands competing in the under-$50 bracket, but Panasonic has fixed their sights on the under-$100 bracket instead, and they&#8217;ve hit the bullseye.</p>
<p>The Arc3 is the lowest rung on Panasonic&#8217;s ladder, though with the lack of updates to the Arc4 line that&#8217;s not as complicated as it used to be. This shaver has two foils and a stubble-whacking center trimming bar, just like most foil-type shavers. (Arc4 and Arc5 models add extra foils.)</p>

The Arc3 might take a few more passes than the massive Arc5, but the foil technology is as good as it gets for a price that's great.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013AX8A3M/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Panasonic&#8217;s secret weapon has always been in the motor, and this shaver has that same strength. Fast, powerful, quiet. While the Braun shavers (even the spendy Series 7 and Series 9) sound like hair clippers, Panasonic&#8217;s shavers give a higher-pitched and much smoother whine, like an angry bumblebee to Braun&#8217;s runaway sewing machine.</p>
<p>In terms of closeness, the Arc3 can&#8217;t be beat. The bigger brothers, Arc4 and Arc5, have more foils which means they can theoretically cover more of your face in a hurry, but if you take your time to carefully follow the grain of your hair (which you have to do for a close shave anyway) the Arc3 trims just as close.</p>
<p>Panasonic lists their motor speed in &#8220;CPM,&#8221; which we assume to be two &#8220;cuts&#8221; per full revolution of the internal motor. The Arc3 lists at 13,000, while the two bigger models are 14,000.</p>
<p>Wet-shaving performance is also a win for the entire Panasonic line. You&#8217;ll have to rinse lather off the Arc3 more frequently than the Arc5, but it doesn&#8217;t smear the lather around your face the way Braun&#8217;s shavers do. Combining a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-shaving-cream/">slick shaving cream</a> and the Arc3 is a luxe upgrade to your morning shave routine without the risk of nicks.</p>
<h3>Arc3 vs. other Panasonic models</h3>
[table id=140 /]
<p>Another reason to buy the Arc3 is that this is the newest shaver Panasonic sells in North America. The pricey Arc5 LV95-S is actually a last-gen design; in Japan it has been surpassed by the ES-LV9CX, but they didn&#8217;t bring those models across the pacific. The Arc3 ES-LT3N-K uses up-to-date styling, and we think it&#8217;s an improvement over previous looks. (The ES-CT20 would be a nice option for those who want something compact, but you&#8217;ll have to rely on Ebay to get your hands on that model too.)</p>
<p>Compared to the $160 Braun Series 7, the Arc3&#8217;s shave is definitely more aggressive. If you have sensitive follicles you might consider Braun&#8217;s smoother shave worth the extra $80 over Panasonic&#8217;s close and efficient cut. Braun&#8217;s Series 5, however, which is closer in price to the Arc3, is just buzzy and inefficient by comparison.</p>
<p>Cleaning the Arc3, even without Panasonic&#8217;s pricey optional stand, is a breeze. Panasonic designs their razors with a &#8220;sonic vibration&#8221; cleaning mode, which moves the cutting bar even faster than the normal shaving mode to help rinse and dry the parts more thoroughly.</p>
<p>Panasonic doesn&#8217;t advocate using oil on their blades when you get them wet the way Braun does, but we&#8217;re curious to see how they stand up in long-term use. Getting the blades clean and drying them is definitely going to be the most important part of keeping them sharp, oil is most valuable (in our experience) with moving parts that you can&#8217;t wash for fear of rust or electrical shorts.</p>
<p>The Arc3 also features our favorite pop-up trimmer of the bunch; it&#8217;s not a replacement for a full beard trimmer that can help you maintain a consistent length, but for edging a moustache or sideburns it&#8217;s perfect.</p>
<p>For travel, Panasonic only includes a cheap velour pouch, which is a bit of a let-down at this price point. They do, however, design all their razors with a travel lock. Press the power button to turn it on, then hold down until the lock symbol appears, hold it down again to unlock. We think the swivel-ring lock on the older Panasonic models is a little bit easier to use, but none of the other brands included a lock to keep the razor from starting in your suitcase.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Panasonic &#8211; Arc3 gives most faces the closest shave possible from an electric razor.</li>
<li>Panasonic&#8217;s motor design isn&#8217;t as buzzy as other brands, and the sonic vibration cleaning mode helps keep blades clean.</li>
<li>The aggressive shave isn&#8217;t as gentle on sensitive skin as the Braun Series 7, but at half the price it&#8217;s still better for most of us.</li>
<li>The travel lock requires a sequence of button presses, but it works.</li>
</ul>

If the idea of &#8220;closest possible shave&#8221; makes your skin hurt, there are alternatives. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MPX171W/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Braun&#8217;s Series 7 7865</a> has been lauded as a great razor system by nearly everyone who tries it, and if it we weren&#8217;t considering price it would be tricky to justify picking anything else.</p>
<p>Our most sensitive-skinned tester said that, in comparison, the Panasonic &#8211; Arc3 felt like it was &#8220;very slightly snagging&#8221; on hairs, a tiny bit &#8220;scratchy.&#8221; The Braun shaves with a gentle, whirring caress. If you avoid blade-shaves because you don&#8217;t like the way they feel, that might be more than enough reason to cough up another $80 for the Braun.</p>
<p>Braun&#8217;s battery is also the best we tested, clocking in at 155 minutes of runtime to the Arc3&#8217;s 100. That probably means it will last a bit longer in the coming years, though neither shaver will work when plugged in after the battery goes kaput. (To prevent you from electrocuting yourself in the shower, they say.)</p>
<p>The one shortcoming of Braun&#8217;s careful engineering is the pop-up trimmer: the blade is curved, for some reason, and doesn&#8217;t seem especially effective when shaping sideburns. It&#8217;s not useless, but we found ourselves spending time with other trimmers cleaning up lines from the Series 7.</p>

There are even more expensive shavers out there, but we think this one is actually worth the splurge.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MPX171W/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Braun includes a nice travel case that&#8217;s stiff (though not exactly rugged) and should protect it well on trips. Be sure not to lose the case, though, since there&#8217;s no travel lock to prevent your batteries dying during a flight. The charger is dual-voltage, too.</p>
<h3>Should I buy the Braun cleaning stand?</h3>
<p>Braun&#8217;s Series 5 and 7 models are often sold as &#8220;CC&#8221; versions, and this means you&#8217;ll get a cleaning and charging stand to go with your razor. The cost ranges from $15-50 more, and there aren&#8217;t any other differences. (Braun usually makes sure you can&#8217;t just mix and match by moving the charge port on the &#8220;Solo&#8221; models.)</p>
<p>Many shaver enthusiasts insist that the cleaning stand is an essential purchase with a Braun razor, and we think that&#8217;s a bit of an exaggeration. In a past era when these shavers weren&#8217;t designed to be immersed in water, the use of an alcohol-based solution in the cleaning stand was doubtless a better way to keep the razor clean than trying to blow or rinse every last hair out of the cartridge yourself.</p>
<p>Now that the razors are designed to run wet, it&#8217;s pretty easy to spread some soap on the foil and run the shaver motor while the head is immersed, just as the cleaning stand does. We couldn&#8217;t see any difference between this cleaning method and the results from the stand.</p>
<p>The stand is a cool accessory if you want the shaver to loom over your bathroom countertop, but you can&#8217;t keep it in a drawer or cabinet. The refills are kind of annoying to deal with, and the cleaning process amplifies the normal buzzing sound of the shaver quite a bit. The way the thing starts and stops in cycles might even startle unsuspecting housemates early in the morning.</p>

<p>The big difference in long-term use is that the charging stand uses a solution of alcohol and oil that will keep the blade clean and lubricated while you&#8217;re not using it. Braun&#8217;s latest stands aren&#8217;t rapidly drying the shaver the way Panasonic&#8217;s stand does, but the alcohol solution evaporates quickly enough that it&#8217;s not a deal-breaker.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not 100 percent convinced that the lubrication from the cleaning solution is required, but if you don&#8217;t want to buy the stand, some light mineral oil or cleaning spray can&#8217;t hurt, especially if you&#8217;re dry shaving.</p>
<p>If the solo model of the Series 7 came with at big discount we might tell you to forget about the stand entirely, but the sad truth is that Braun has made it hard to find them and the prices go up and down all the time.</p>
<h3>Series 7 vs. other Braun models</h3>
[table id=141 /]
<p>Braun has four distinct lines of shavers: Series 3 for entry-level, 5 for an upgrade, 7 for people who want an even better shaver and Series 9 for people who want the best shaver possible.</p>
<p>We looked long and hard at the Series 9, and we don&#8217;t see much reason to spend an extra $100 on metallic platings and an extra &#8220;Hyperlift and Cut&#8221; trimmer bar. Plenty of people who spring for the upgrade are happy to say that it shaves closer and with less irritation, so if buying the best is worth $250 we say go for it. For the rest of us, Series 7 is already enough of a stretch that we&#8217;re happy with our pick.</p>
<p>The Series 5, on the other hand, is kind of disappointing. It&#8217;s louder and vibrates far more than the Series 7, definitely not the same class of motor. So far as we can tell the design and construction of the cutting heads is the same, you can even snap a Series 7 head onto the Series 5 body, but the comfortable shave of the Series 7 just wasn&#8217;t there anymore. If you&#8217;re okay sacrificing a little bit of comfort to save some money, Panasonic is a much better bet.</p>
<p>The Series 3 is the only real competition in Braun&#8217;s lineup; for $100 less you still get a decent shave.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Braun&#8217;s Series 7 is easily the most respected shaver line of all time, and we agree that it shaves exceptionally well.</li>
<li>If your follicles scream in terror when you think about &#8220;lift and cut,&#8221; this is the smoothest, kindest shaving experience we found.</li>
<li>Long stubble is no sweat for the S7, though Panasonic&#8217;s shavers get a bit closer.</li>
<li>The cleaning station is kind of unnecessary, but the solo model is often just as expensive.</li>
<li>Braun&#8217;s replacement cartridges are fairly easy to track down even at local stores.</li>
</ul>

<p>We tested four razors that will cost you around $50, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0115I2DRI/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Braun &#8211; Series 3</a> is the only design we think is worth considering.</p>
<p>Braun&#8217;s engineering is represented well in the foil-type blades on the Series 3. The motor is clearly not as strong as the Series 7, and it&#8217;s possible that the blades are made differently. But given how similar these razors are, Braun has done a great job making this feel like a noticeable compromise without making it terrible. (We wish we could say the same for the other budget razors.)</p>
<p>Long stubble was the test that showed the most difference for us; the Series 3 is painful in four-day growth, the Series 7 isn&#8217;t. If you&#8217;re not as sensitive to this prickly feeling you might be 100 percent OK with it, but if you want to go for a weekend without shaving the Series 7 or Panasonic shavers are well worth the extra coin.</p>

<p>The Series 3 didn&#8217;t cut as close as the other shavers, even the weak-tea Series 5 managed to clean up stubble left behind by this budget model. That said, if you&#8217;re okay with a bit of scruff returning at the end of each day this might be a great razor for you.</p>
<p>Compact in size and with a blade cover that doubles as a sort-of button lock, this is a great shaver if you want something to stash in a bag or glove compartment. If the cover comes off in your gym bag when you stuff it in your locker, it&#8217;s still vulnerable to accidentally powering on, but we like the simplicity of the design.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Braun &#8211; Series 3 isn&#8217;t as luxurious as their high-end stuff, but it&#8217;s the best $50 shaver we could find.</li>
<li>If you let your stubble grow on occasion, stay away. It hurts.</li>
<li>A compact hassle-free shaver that you won&#8217;t worry as much about losing at the gym.</li>
<li>The waterproof design is much easier to clean than old-school Braun shavers, still not as easy as the competition.</li>

The popularity of rotary-foil shavers like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JITDVD2/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Aqua-Tech 4500</a> is tricky to explain. For some, this is simply the only kind of electric razor they&#8217;ve ever tried. For others with flat-lying hairs that grow in a swirled pattern, it might be a shaver that actually works better than the straight-cutting foil types.</p>
<p>For most people, the big distinction is going to be maneuverability and performance on sensitive faces or in long stubble. In our tests, the rotary shavers just weren&#8217;t very good, and there was little (if any) difference between the mid-tier shaver 4500 and up-scale model 8900.</p>
<p>One of our testers (yes, the Braun fan-boy) insisted that he felt so much pain from the rotary shavers that they can&#8217;t possibly be working properly. We double-checked with our other tester, and we don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re broken, but they&#8217;re definitely not for everyone. For long stubble (still short enough that running over it with clippers didn&#8217;t make much difference) everyone agrees that the pulling and grabbing from a rotary isn&#8217;t worth it.</p>

<p>That said, our second tester did find that both of the rotary designs cleaned up short hard-to-get stubble on his neck even better than the Panasonic shavers. We&#8217;re not sure if the &#8220;lift and cut&#8221; of the Philips design is working better than the straight foils, or if it&#8217;s just easier to grab tricky hairs with an equally tricky razor.</p>
<p>The overall closeness was a wash; the triangular pattern doesn&#8217;t lend itself to tracking against straight grain in passes, so Philips recommends using a circular pattern instead. This works in some spots, not in others; under the nose or along sideburns it&#8217;s a real pain.</p>
<p>One detail that pushes the 4500 ahead of its big brother is the trimmer attachment; the 8900 requires you to swap the shaver head for a &#8220;SmartClick&#8221; trimmer head, while the 4500 uses the always-ready pop-up style like most shavers. This way you won&#8217;t ever accidentally bring your trimmer on a trip instead of your shaver.</p>
<p>Maybe the most interesting feature of the rotary systems is that you can completely disassemble them for cleaning and maintenance. The rotary drive system is also extremely quiet in comparison to the back-and-forth buzz of other shavers.</p>
<p>The 4500 has just as many strengths as the 8900, but if you hate the feel of a rotary shaver you&#8217;ll probably hate all of them, and our tester who didn&#8217;t mind the feel doesn&#8217;t think the increase in closeness is worth $80.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Philips &#8211; 4500 is a rotary shaver that will give good performance for tricky hair growth.</li>
<li>Easy to clean and maintain, the 4500 has a hinged head for hassle-free rinsing.</li>
<li>Almost as good as a more expensive rotary, at a much better price.</li>
<li>This pop-up sideburn trimmer is always better than a snap-on accessory that doesn&#8217;t even fit in the travel case.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Panasonic &#8211; Arc5 ES-LV95-S</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FPQ70Z2/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; Arc5</a> doubles-down on the multi-blade gimmick, and while it&#8217;s a functional improvement over the Arc3 is some ways, the head is so bulky it&#8217;s not a better shaver for most people.</p>
<p>In practice, we&#8217;re pretty sure we could get quicker shaves with the Arc5&#8217;s extra foils, and in testing it seemed to clean up a few spots of short micro-stubble left behind by the Arc3. Compared to the Braun &#8211; Series 7, we&#8217;d say this is an easy win for Panasonic in overall performance and even comfort.</p>
<p>The size of the head gets in the way, though, if you&#8217;re trying to shave around a moustache or even just around your nose. On the chin it&#8217;s a little bit better than other shavers just because you don&#8217;t have to run as many passes to get the whole surface, but under the jawline it&#8217;s hard to maneuver sideways to track against the grain for a close shave.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013AX8A3M/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/panasonic-arc5-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/panasonic-arc5-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/panasonic-arc5-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/panasonic-arc5-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/panasonic-arc5-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/panasonic-arc5-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/panasonic-arc5-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/panasonic-arc5-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/panasonic-arc5.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Closest Shave: Panasonic – Arc5</h3><p>Panasonic pulls out all the stops with a five-foil monster shaver, and in some spots it'll give you the closest shave in fewer passes than with the Arc3.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013AX8A3M/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The price of the Arc5 is good compared to Braun&#8217;s top-end Series 9, so if you&#8217;re not trying to do anything tricky with detailed maneuvering this might be a better bet for the most luxurious shave you can get. For the rest of us, though, the price is just adding insult to a design that isn&#8217;t quite there.</p>
<h3>Philips &#8211; S8900</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012VL5TB0/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; 8900</a> gives the rotary enthusiast a few reasons to upgrade over an older entry-level model. But on the whole, we don&#8217;t think most people should buy this razor.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to buy a rotary with a cleaning stand because you want to have a neat and functional way to store it on your countertop, this stand is every bit as good as the others we tried. It&#8217;s just as redundant, too, now that electric razors are designed to be waterproof, but it&#8217;s there if you want it.</p>
<p>The 8900 might get a tiny bit closer in a few spots than the modestly priced 4500 model. The &#8220;8 direction&#8221; pivoting head didn&#8217;t seem any different, though, and even if the motor spins slightly faster, this shaver was just as painful and ineffective in long stubble.</p>
<p>This shaver uses the top-end SH90 shaving heads (the same cutting parts as the 9000 series, but without the silly speed adjustment buttons) so we&#8217;re positive you won&#8217;t get better performance out of a rotary-type shaver.</p>
<p>For $100 this might be a worthwhile upgrade in closeness over the 4500, but for closer to $200 street price we&#8217;re just not convinced. It&#8217;s pretty, but most people should stay far away.</p>

<h3>Panasonic &#8211; Arc4 ES-LF51-A</h3>
<p>Panasonic still sells a lot of these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005DKKBTC/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Arc4 shavers</a>, but the middle child in the family has largely been forgotten. The extra foil doesn&#8217;t make as much difference for speedy shaving as the massive surface area on the Arc5 seems to, but when the price dips down to $75 (as it sometimes does) this might be worth considering for a slightly quicker shave than the Arc3.</p>
<p>Compared to the Arc5 the bulkiness of the Arc4&#8217;s head isn&#8217;t nearly as much a problem, but the battery life was still a bit disappointing. We had hoped that this might represent a good compromise between the Arc3 and the Arc5; it&#8217;s not a huge disappointment the way Braun&#8217;s Series 5 is, but it&#8217;s not a compelling choice, either.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not any reason to buy this over the Arc3 unless you get a great deal on it. The Arc3 is still being developed and upgraded in Panasonic&#8217;s Japanese lineup, so it will likely be easier to find blades for the Arc3 in the long term. The Arc4 ES-LF51-A is a design from 2012, while it&#8217;s still &#8220;current&#8221; according to Panasonic&#8217;s U.S. sales people we wouldn&#8217;t bet on it staying that way for many more years.</p>
<h3>Braun &#8211; Series 5 5190cc</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JA7Q4SQ/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Braun &#8211; Series 5</a> is like the Series 7, but weaker. So far as we can tell, the blades are made the same way and might even be entirely compatible, but the motor is slower and vibrates so much it actually makes this bit of a downgrade from the Series 3. One of our testers compared it to &#8220;a medical device geared to stimulate blood flow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new solo model 5147s is harder to find and lists for $120; we bought the 5190 with cleaning stand for $115 and it&#8217;s probably going to remain the best value for this series.</p>
<p>This gives a reasonably close shave, like the Series 7, but it struggles to clean up long stubble without tugging. For a $40 discount, that&#8217;s a tricky tradeoff to make. When we put it against the less-expensive Panasonic Arc3, though, it just seems a bit sad.</p>
<p>The battery life in the Series 5 is definitely a step up from budget shavers, but it&#8217;s still not replaceable and the waterproof design still won&#8217;t turn on when it&#8217;s plugged in.</p>
<p>Cleanup is the same as all the Braun models: use the stand if you have it, or give it an extra turn in the sink once a week to make sure nothing is stuck inside that mostly enclosed blade cartridge.</p>
<h3>Remington &#8211; PF-7600</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WD7PT1S/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Remington &#8211; PF-7600</a> is a new design from this well-established brand, but it&#8217;s pretty much the worst shaver we tried. It won&#8217;t get any closer than the Braun &#8211; Series 3, whatever your hair type.</p>
<p>A post-weekend shave with the Remington is pretty much a disaster. It doesn&#8217;t like grabbing the longer hairs, and when it does, it pulls on them.</p>
<p>If you take it slow and don&#8217;t let your stubble grow long, you can get an acceptable shave with the Remington that&#8217;s more comfortable on sensitive skin than a rotary-type like the Philips, but Braun is easily a better choice in this price range.</p>
<h3>Andis &#8211; 17150 Profoil Lithium</h3>
<p>Andis is a brand better known to barbers than to most of us, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071YSDPKC/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Profoil shaver</a> has a long history cleaning up fades and necklines in some of the best barbershops in the country.</p>
<p>Retro styling aside, this shaver let us down in a few key areas. First, it&#8217;s not as close-trimming as the top-class shavers, though it will keep up with Braun in the $50 pack. Second, it&#8217;s disappointingly weak in longer stubble, an application we&#8217;d hoped it would be perfect for. Finally, the nail in the coffin is dry-shaving only: this is one of the last razors on the market that you can&#8217;t clean out by dunking the head while it&#8217;s running.</p>
<p>For a barber, this might still be a decent choice; it&#8217;s a simple machine and the replacement foils are the cheapest we found. For the rest of us who care about a close, comfortable shave, look elsewhere. Our sensitive-skinned tester managed to draw blood with this shaver, and that&#8217;s pretty much an automatic fail.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Shaving products are tricky to review for a bunch of reasons. Our hair is as individual as our fingerprints, but we hope that we&#8217;ve given you enough info to buy an electric shaver that you&#8217;ll love using.</p>
<p>For the closest shave that modern engineering can provide, our top pick is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013AX8A3M/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; Arc3</a>. This isn&#8217;t Panasonic&#8217;s most expensive razor, but the head design is easier to work with than their other models and it shaves just as close once you get a feel for it. This is also a shaver that&#8217;s easy to clean, and that goes a long way to making it our favorite in long-term testing.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re more worried about irritation than the closest possible shave, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MPX171W/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Braun&#8217;s Series 7</a> is the system to beat. With amazing battery life and a convenient (if redundant) cleaning stand, this is a prestige piece that works hard to earn its steeper price tag.</p>
<p>If you just want a razor that works reliably at an affordable price point, we also think the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0115I2DRI/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Braun &#8211; Series 3</a> is worth looking at. This model isn&#8217;t winning any awards for closeness or comfort, but it&#8217;s definitely the best budget model we tested.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We began our search for the best tweezers by checking out online reviews from Amazon.com, Sephora and Ulta. We consulted relevant subreddits such as r/BuyItForLife and r/MakeupAddiction. We also consulted a review by <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-tweezers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wirecutter</a>, which influenced our decision to include the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EMYJ88/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tweezerman</a>.</p>
<p>We thought it was important to include a variety of tip types, so that we could determine which tweezers were the best for a variety of tasks. Therefore while some types, such as square tip or round tip tweezers are less popular, we still included them in our testing to be thorough.</p>

<h2 id="which-tweezer">Which tweezer is right for you?</h2>
<p>Different angles and styles of tweezer tips are better suited for different tasks. Whether you are plucking brows, applying lashes or looking for a versatile tweezer, our breakdown below will point you in the right direction.</p>
<p><b>Slant tip: </b>These tweezers can precisely grab single hairs or multiple hairs at a time because of the slanted angle of their tip. Slant tip tweezers are a go-to tool for shaping eyebrows and great for hair removal overall.</p>
<p><b>Square tip: </b>Sometimes referred to as straight tip or flat tip, the tips of these tweezers have a simple, flat edge. While these tweezers are not as popular as slant tip tweezers for hair removal, they are faster at removing more facial hair when you don’t need precision (i.e., chin hairs).</p>
<p><b>Round tip: </b>Also known as safety tweezers, the rounded tip of these tweezers prevents accidental poking. These tweezers will pluck multiple hairs at a time and are not meant for precision. While these tweezers have waned in popularity, they are suited for any task in which sharp edges would be a concern. For example, these tweezers would not poke through the soft material of a cotton swab or fabric.</p>
<p><b>Pointed tip: </b>This refers to needle-nose style tweezers. Pointed tip tweezers shine when it comes to precision work. Some pointed tweezers have thick enough tips to do precision hair removal, while others are so fine that they are better suited for ingrown hair and splinter removal.</p>
<p><b>Curved:</b> Curved tweezers are primarily used for application purposes — applying eyelash extensions, nail decals, rhinestones and so on. These tweezers’ tips are pointed and curved (usually about 45° from the handle). They are also referred to as bent-head tweezers.</p>
<p><b>Blackhead tweezers: </b>You will often find these tweezers labeled as comedone blackhead extractors or curved blackhead tweezers. Blackhead tweezers are similar to curved tweezers in that their tips are pointed and curved. However, blackhead-tweezer tips are curved more dramatically in a half-circle shape, so that the tweezer tip is almost 90° from its handle.</p>
<p>Dermatologist <a href="https://www.racked.com/2017/5/25/15655250/blackhead-tweezers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Neal Shcultz</a> explains that these tweezers apply pressure at the base of the black head, so the “contents of the blackhead can easily be squeezed out.” While dermatologists recommend having blackhead extractions done professionally, some say these tweezers are preferable to pinching skin with your hands.</p>

<p><b>Material: </b>Stainless steel is widely accepted as the best material for tweezers, because it is durable and does not irritate skin (unlike other metals such as nickel). All except three we tested are stainless steel.</p>
<p><b>Tip type: </b>The way tweezer tips are angled or curved makes them better suited for certain tasks. If you are unsure about what type of tip you need, check out <a href="#which-tweezer">which tweezer is right for you?</a>.</p>
<p><b>Width of tip:</b> Narrower tweezer tips allow for greater precision. However, as you decrease the width of the tips you also decrease grip on what is being tweezed. A good tweezer for the task balances both attributes.</p>
<p><b>Tweezer length:</b> The closer your fingers are to the tip of the tweezer, the more likely they are to block your view of what you would like to tweeze. Generally, tweezers over 3.5” are easiest to handle.</p>
<p><b>Convenience: </b>A good set of tweezers should be small enough to store easily and including a carrying case is a big plus. Storing tweezers in a carrying case prevents dulling of tips and misalignment.</p>
<p><b>Aesthetics:</b> Make-up Artist <a href="https://www.shefinds.com/from-tweezer-to-nail-clippers-heres-the-right-way-to-store-your-beauty-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Julia Dalton-Brush</a> recommends storing tweezers on your bathroom countertop, so we want tweezers that look nice enough to leave out.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Hair removal</h3>
<p>We put our slant tip, square tip, round tip and pointed tip tweezers to the test by having four testers use them to remove brow and facial hair. One of our testers was a certified esthetician and sugaring specialist, Julia Perez, owner of the Jae and Leona Beauty Collective in San Diego, California. Our other three testers were average consumer testers, each with a different hair type (fine, normal and thick).</p>
<p>All of our testers preferred using the slant tip tweezers to remove hair, as they were easy to use for both precision work and removing multiple hairs at a time. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000ZG71Q/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubis Switzerland</a> had the highest average score from our testers. They were impressed with their sturdy design and ability to precisely grab hairs. Tied in second place were the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EMYJ88/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tweezerman</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B00GI23UT2/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anastasia Beverly Hills</a> tweezer. Both of which scored above average in precision hair removal.</p>
<p>For our square tip and round tip tweezers, the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017KCPV4/?tag=ybdtwz-20">Revlon &#8211; Square Tip</a> came out ahead because of its ability to quickly remove large patches of thin hairs. The Revlon’s large 3mm tips outperformed the Rubis Switzerland and ApeX Tweezer in getting rid of multiple baby hairs quickly.</p>
<p>When it came to pointed tip tweezers, only the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0168FZ5UK/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Classic Necessity</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001KMSUA4/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silver Gripper</a> tweezer were able to effectively remove hairs. The Majestic Bombay and TweezerGuru&#8217;s tips were so thin and sharp that they were only useful for removing splinters or ingrown hairs.</p>
<p>One of our testers was able to test both tweezers on ingrown facial hairs. The Classic Necessity clearly outshone Silver Gripper in precise hair removal, while the Majestic Bombay was best for ingrown hairs. All of our testers cited frustration in trying to handle Silver Gripper, as the tweezer was only 2.5-inches long.</p>
<h3>Lash application</h3>
<p>To help us determine which of our curved tweezers were best for applying lash extensions, we consulted Billie Jeanne Vergara, certified esthetician, lash specialist and owner of B Lash Studio in La Jolla, California. Billie used each of our curved tweezers to apply lash extensions and gave us her feedback.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004SHYMIM/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ReNext &#8211; Curved</a> tweezer was by far the best at applying false eyelashes. Its fine tips were good for picking up and separating lashes. Billie did not recommend using the other curved tweezers by EK Tools and Tweezier &#8211;  Curved for applying lashes; the EK Tool’s reverse grip was not suited for applying lashes, and the Tweezier was much too big and heavy to use around eyes.</p>
<h3>Rhinestone application</h3>
<p>Our curved tweezers were all marketed to be useful for crafting activities, such as applying rhinestones to bedazzle nails or objects. To test these claims, we had our three average consumer testers use these to pick up and glue rhinestones.</p>
<p>Our testers found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTN9XJR/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tweezier &#8211; Heavy Duty 6&#8243; Curved</a> was very good at picking up and handling rhinestones because of the grip of the thicker tips. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AZRGEF8/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EK Tools</a> tweezer was also very good at precisely handling rhinestones. Its reverse grip had a bit of a learning curve, but some of our testers grew to appreciate it once they got the feel for it.</p>
<h3>Blackhead extraction</h3>
<p>We had three testers use our blackhead tweezers to remove multiple blackheads. All of our testers agreed that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072F4726L/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FIXBODY</a> was easy to use, and applied enough pressure to remove blackheads. Our testers also noted minimal skin irritation when using the pure stainless steel FIXBODY.</p>
<h3>Alignment</h3>
<p>We tested the alignment of all of our tweezers by squeezing their tips together and visually noting any discrepancies in their position relative to one another. All of the tweezers we tested were aligned correctly.</p>

<p>For both precision and bulk hair removal, one tweezer clearly outshone all the rest. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000ZG71Q/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubis Switzerland </a> is a simple, sturdy, stainless steel tweezing machine. Our testers all rated the Rubis Switzerland’s ability to pluck single hairs as above average to excellent.</p>
<p>The tweezer’s slant 3mm tips had a good grip on hairs and rarely cut them. Our testers also noted that the Rubis Switzerland’s simple design made it easy to grip and maneuver. The Rubis Switzerland is better suited for precision hair removal than removing multiple hairs at a time, making it a good tweezer for shaping brows. You will still be able to work quickly with the Rubis Switzerland, as it cleanly plucks hairs in a single tweeze.</p>

Its easy-to-handle grip and simple design are perfect for shaping eyebrows. The Rubis is expensive, but it delivers in value and longevity.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000ZG71Q/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p><b>The Rubis Switzerland’s main drawback is its price tag, which is among the highest for tweezers.</b> The price is reflected in the tweezer’s quality, and performance, though. Our esthetician, Julia, referred to the Rubis Switzerland as “one of [her] all time favorites.”</p>
<p>Close behind the Rubis Switzerland &#8211; 3- 3/4” Slant Tip, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B00GI23UT2/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anastasia Beverly Hills</a> tweezer and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EMYJ88/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tweezerman</a> earned above-average scores for precise hair removal from all of our testers. Like the Rubis Switzerland, both of these tweezers have 3mm stainless steel slant tips. While these tweezers were reported to cut hair more than the Rubis Switzerland, both are still very good options. Particularly, the Tweezerman, since it comes in slightly cheaper than the Anastasia Beverly Hills.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a good budget slant tip tweezer, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000532A2/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Revlon &#8211; Slant Tip</a> is the way to go. The Revlon’s price is at the low end; however, it earned average to above-average ratings with our testers, who especially appreciated the tweezer’s textured grip. The Revlon’s stainless steel 4mm tip lacks the precision of our top picks, but offers solid tweezing usability at a good price.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TECGGF8/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coco’s Closet</a> tweezer was unique in that it had an oval grip for finger placement. This grip did not go over well with our testers, who felt that it made changing your finger placement awkward and that it made the tweezer more unwieldy overall.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ANA4T8K/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zizzili Basics</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B016LI8E4S/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TweezerGuru</a> both received average scores from our testers for hair removal, the major complaint for both being they cut hairs too often. Both of these tweezers had wider tips, the Zizzili Basics coming in at 4.5 inches and the TweezerGuru at 4 inches. While both of these stainless steel tweezers get the job done, you are better off purchasing the Revlon &#8211; Slant Tip at a similar price.</p>
<p>Square and round tip tweezers often pluck multiple hairs at a time. This makes them ill suited for precision brow shaping but good for getting rid of patches of facial hair. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017KCPV4/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Revlon &#8211; Square Tip</a> was our top square tip tweezer, because our testers ranked it above average for removing multiple hairs at a time. Our testers also liked the textured grip and bright coral color of the tweezer.</p>
<p>The Revlon offers 3mm stainless steel square tips for a low price, which makes it a good value tweezer. For those looking for a square tip tweezer, the Revlon is easy-to-use, has a good grip for plucking hair and looks appealing.</p>

<p>We also tested the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000PHDNZM/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubis Switzerland &#8211; Straight Tip</a>, which has square 2mm stainless steel tips. The Rubis Switzerland performed well with our testers, however was not as quick at pulling out patches of hair as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000PHDNZM/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Revlon &#8211; Square Tip</a> because of its smaller tips. If you are looking for precision plucking, we recommend the Rubis Switzerland &#8211; 3- 3/4” Slant Tip, but the Rubis Switzerland &#8211; Straight Tip is a solid option for those who insist on a square tip.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HEW78R0/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ApeX &#8211; Round Tip</a> was the only safety tweezer we tested. The most notable feature of this tweezer was the wonderful leather travel case it came with, which works well for protecting tweezers. Our testers ranked ApeX’s hair removal performance as low because it did not grip hair well. For those looking for a safety tweezer to apply cotton swabs, this tweezer would work well as it is easy to handle and its rounded tips would not pierce soft material.</p>

<p>Our top tweezer for removing splinters and ingrown hairs is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BAYWOFY/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Majestic Bombay &#8211; Surgical Pointed</a>. The sharp, precise stainless steel tips of the Majestic Bombay tweezer removed ingrown hairs easily. These tweezer’s stainless steel tips are sharp enough to free ingrown hairs or splinters that are partially under skin.</p>
<p>One of our testers commented that the Majestic Bombay was exceptionally easy to grip and handle, which is an important consideration when you are bringing sharp-pointed tips close to your skin. It is important to handle these tweezers with care, as their exceptionally sharp tips will puncture skin.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012X2ZNOA/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TweezerGuru &#8211; Pointed Tweezer</a> was also able to free ingrown hairs from skin; however, our tester was not able to handle and squeeze the tweezer tips together as comfortably as with the Majestic Bombay. Both of these tweezers had a similar price point, so we recommend going with Majestic Bombay if you are looking for tweezers to remove splinters or ingrown hairs.</p>
<p>Our other pointed tip tweezers were not suited for removing ingrown hairs or splinters, because their tips were thicker. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0168FZ5UK/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Classic Necessity &#8211; Pointed Eyebrow</a> tweezer’s stainless steel tips were able to grip single hairs and remove them — making it a very precise tweezer for hair removal. However, most of our testers preferred using a slant tip tweezer for precision grooming.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001KMSUA4/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silver Gripper &#8211; Pointed Keychain Tweezer</a> Silver Gripper was the smallest tweezer we tested, only 2.5-inches long, and the only tweezer that came with an attached keychain holder. While Silver Gripper was very handy to travel with, the tweezer itself was hard to use. It performed very poorly at plucking hairs and was only mediocre at picking up small items.</p>

<p>After consulting our lash professional, who tested all of our curved tweezers, we found that the best tweezer for applying false lashes was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004SHYMIM/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ReNext &#8211; Curved</a>. While the ReNext is marketed for nail art, this tweezer was also good for picking up and separating lash extensions. Our lash professional Billie Jeanne states that a great lash tweezer should be, “light, easy to pinch and have small precise tips.” The ReNext ticked all of these boxes.</p>
<p>Light and easy handling is important for lash tweezers ,because you don’t want your hands to get tired while doing the repetitive task of applying lashes. The ReNext’s lightweight and simple grip make it easy to use for application.</p>

<p>Precise pointed tips can individually separate and handle tiny lash extensions. However with precision comes extra caution. Because the ReNext’s points are very fine and sharp, it should be used with the utmost care around eyes.</p>
<p>Blackhead tweezers are a relatively recent trend that prevent users from using hands (which naturally are very oily) to do at-home extractions. Dermatologists recommend having blackhead extractions done professionally for the best hygienic conditions and to minimize skin irritation. However if you are still going to do at-home extractions, we tested blackhead tweezers to see which work best.</p>

The FIXBODY is stainless steel, so it will not irritate sensitive skin. This tweezer was also light and easy to grip, which is important when trying to precisely handle these tweezers around small blackheads.</p>

<p>The FIXBODY also came with other comedone extractor tools that we did not test. We did not test these tools because they were not tweezers, and were not necessary to the function of the FIXBODY tweezer. However these included tools are a plus when considering the value of the tweezer set. The tweezer and two other comedone extraction tools were sold for under $10 for the whole set.</p>

<p>When it comes to applying small rhinestones, a tweezer needs to have precise tips that have enough grip to securely hold the rhinestone. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTN9XJR/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tweezier &#8211; Heavy Duty 6&#8243; Curved</a> was our top choice for the job, because its stainless steel tip was able to hold the rhinestones securely.</p>
<p>The Tweezier is a large and sturdy six-inch tweezer. Its extra length gave testers more maneuverability while precisely placing rhinestones. Plus, its solid tips increased versatility for objects it could handle. However, the length and stainless steel material make it heavier than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AZRGEF8/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EK Tools &#8211; Craft</a>.</p>

<p>EK Tools also performed well for picking up and placing rhinestones; however, its grip had a learning curve that frustrated some testers. This tweezer has a reverse grip, meaning that when you squeeze the tweezer the tips move away from one another. If you are comfortable with a reverse grip, and are looking for a very lightweight tweezer, the EK Tools would be a good choice. However, we recommend the Tweezier as a better choice for most consumers who want a versatile tweezer that offers a great grip on small objects.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>For grooming brows, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000ZG71Q/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubis Switzerland</a> was our top choice. Its simple stainless-steel design and solid slant tip removes hair without cutting. The Rubis’ performance could not be matched. Its only downside is the expensive price tag of around $40. If you are looking for a cheaper tweezer, we would recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000532A2/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Revlon.</a> This tweezer received average reviews for performance and above-average reviews for its textured grip from our testers. It does the job for under $10.</p>
<p>Our best square tip tweezer was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017KCPV4/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Revlon &#8211; Square Tip</a>, which can remove patches of hair quickly. This tweezer is not recommended for precision brow shaping. However for those who prefer a square tip tweezer, the Revlon performs the best &#8211; and for under $10.</p>
<p>If you need to remove ingrown hairs we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BAYWOFY/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Majestic Bombay</a>  tweezer, whose sharp tip is precise enough to free small objects from the skin. Its stainless-steel tips will not irritate skin.</p>
<p>For applying false lashes we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004SHYMIM/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ReNext &#8211; Curved</a> and for removing blackheads, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072F4726L/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FIXBODY.</a> The ReNext’s tips were fine enough to separate lashes, and apply lash extensions. It was also lightweight enough to handle easily. The FIXBODY’s pure stainless-steel curved tip extracted blackheads easily. Remember, dermatologists recommend going to a professional for blackhead extractions; however, some say that blackhead tweezers are better than using your hands if you insist on doing at-home extractions.</p>
<p>Finally if you are looking for a tweezer for arts and crafts we recommend the the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTN9XJR/?tag=ybdtwz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tweezier</a> heavy duty six-inch tweezer. This is a large tweezer that has a great grip on tweezed objects. Its size also makes it very versatile in what it can pick up.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We spent two months testing the seven of the leading double edge safety razors on the market in order to make our pick of the Parker - 99R as the best safety razor.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>uring nearly two months of researching, testing and even dreaming about double-edge safety razors, we asked five different testers to put their faces on the line with each of the seven best products available to discover the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NTHWLU/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Parker &#8211; 99R</a> was the best safety razor for the money. The Parker &#8211; 99R earned high marks for easy maneuvering, blade loading, construction material and all-around shaving comfort. The<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B011L8WJIA/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Viking &#8211; Chieftain</a> came in a close runner-up.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Starting with the safety razors that carried the most praise on Amazon, we sifted through hundreds of subreddit comments in /r/wicked_edge along with user reviews from sites like <a href="https://www.westcoastshaving.com/Safety-Razors_c_8.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">West Coast Shaving</a> and reviews from sites like <a href="https://sharpologist.com/2017/10/best-safety-razor-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharpologist</a>, pointing us toward the integral features of the best models. While aesthetics were a nice bonus, the essential features of a top-rated razor included easy maneuvering (to find the right shaving angle), minimal nicks/cuts, blade loading and the right amount of aggression.</p>
<p>Looking at sites like Best Reviews, Sharpologist, West Coast Shaving and more, we also hunted for a spread of different safety razors, avoiding several popular razors too similar to other well-reviewed models that made the final cut. Since price and overall value were also consistent themes, we focused on razors under $40 with at least 500 reviews from credible vendors and a minimum rating of 4.3 out of five. We ultimately selected razors that provided different levels of aggressiveness, allowing us to consider the viewpoints of both the experienced safety razor shaver and also the novice considering a switch.</p>

<h2 id="why-safety-razor">Why a safety razor?</h2>
<p>Beneath the carefully crafted designs and methodology of the best razors, shavers tend to come back to a quintessential question: what’s the fastest and most effective way to shave without bloodshed? While <a href="https://www.amazon.com/cartridge-razor/s?ie=UTF8&amp;page=1&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Acartridge%20razor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">cartridge razors</a> are very popular options for wet shaving — balancing attractive upfront prices with exceptional ease of use — they also have a reputation for using lower-quality steel blades that can make it difficult to get a truly close shave. <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-straight-razor/" rel="noopener">Straight razors</a> have also had somewhat of a renaissance, allowing users the possibility of a simple and very close shave, but they’re notoriously difficult to get accustomed to for someone who normally uses either a cartridge or electric razor.</p>
<p>Enter the safety razor, which offers the best of both worlds. Safety razors still showcase the features that King C. Gillette envisioned when his first double-edge safety razors launched near the onset of the 20th century. These days, the impressive variety of safety razors gives shavers plenty of options while searching for the perfect shave, tapping into centuries-old tradition but also allowing countless opportunities for customization. It’s this type of diversity that is at the core of safety razors, allowing them to be a potentially great fit no matter your shaving starting point.</p>
<p>Given the cost of replacing cartridges, and the relatively inexpensive blade replacements for safety razors, it can even be significantly more expensive to use cartridge razors instead of traditional safety razors. Cartridges can also cause bacteria to build-up, a key factor in razor burn. Factor in the wide range of razor heads that cater to many different shaving preferences and it’s easy to see how the best safety razors feed into the desire for customization in the modern age.</p>

<p>When French innovator <a href="http://www.shaveworld.org/home/Perret.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jean-Jacques Perret</a> first pondered the concept of a safety razor in the 1760s, men were still shaving by candlelight in front of poorly polished metal mirrors, where they would predictably attack their earlobes nearly as well as they did their chin whiskers. Looking to limit the bloodshed, Perret added a simple wood cover to minimize the exposure of the blade, a basic concept that Gillette would enhance a century later when he looked to mass-produce a safer shaving razor.</p>
<p>Instead of just a wood shield over a straight razor, Gillette’s version was an entirely different model of safety razor that expanded on Perret’s initial concept. The new model came with three detachable pieces, a smaller and thinner stainless steel double-blade and a metal bar that limited blade exposure and provided much more control and safety.</p>
<p>Shortly after inventing the modern safety razor, Gillette began mass-producing affordable disposable blades at the beginning of the 20th century. The safety razors of today are all variations of the original design, including both the cartridge-style razors that use multiple blades within a disposable head and the classic double-edge razor that is the focus of this review.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>Everyone has a different idea of what they’re looking for in a razor, but several features tend to generate a bulk of the commentary and have an outsized effect on the overall outlook. Unsurprisingly, price and all-around value are main drivers of opinion, although other features like handle design, blade exposure, loading style, guard design and weight all are essentials in the conversation as well.</p>
<h3>Handle length and material</h3>

<p>Finding the right handle length is a balancing act that leads to different preferences for every shaver. The 4-inch long handle is standard with some of the most highly respected razors, although the classic early 20th century 3-inch models remain popular as well. Some manufacturers have created adjustable models, yet they have never really hit the mainstream — much like the 2-inch travel razors. There are also plenty of handles in the middle that don’t fall directly into either category.</p>
<p>As for materials, many manufacturers opt for the brass handle with a polished chrome finish, giving it an eye-pleasingly smooth look that is also designed to ward off rusting. Others prefer stainless steel, which is generally advertised as being less likely to chip than its chrome counterparts. Though less prominent than polished handles, matte finishes as well as colorful glossy finishes are not uncommon, specifically with upscale razors being marketed as modern takes on classic razors. While tubular handles are standard, we discovered plenty of creative handle designs, including specially designed cigar and barrel-shaped handles as well as handcrafted handles that combine elements from various razors.</p>
<p>Because the first safety razors users found out the hard way that wet handles can slip, different manufacturers have also tried an assortment of different ways to create the best grip possible. The typical solution was to create knurled handles with ridged patterns built right into the metal (or plastic), giving designers a chance to show some visual flair while also solving a practical problem of wet shaving. Even the top-rated synthetic plastic safety razors tend to have a knurled handle, although the texture can range from fairly rough to nearly smooth, with many different distinguishing patterns to separate from the competition.</p>
<h3>Weight</h3>
<p>The weight of a razor has a variety of ways that it can impact the overall shave. While light razors can still provide a great shave, heavier razors are preferred by many because they let the weight actually do the bulk of the work. The more pressure that a shaver has to exert, the better the chance that more passes will be needed, increasing the likelihood of skin irritation. True to expectations, heavier models like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NTHWLU/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parker &#8211; 99R</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003LW4L2W/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Edwin Jagger &#8211; DE89</a> did very well in overall ease of shaving, outperforming lighter models like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NL0T1G/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Merkur &#8211; MK 23C</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YJ70NY/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Feather &#8211; Popular</a>.</p>
<p>The weight is also a determinative factor the razor’s point of balance, which is the <a href="http://www.primandprep.com/how-to-hold-a-safety-razor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">typically the easiest way to find the best grip</a> for a shave. Most safety razors are designed to balance on your pointer finger about an inch away from the head; for others, this can be slightly less than an inch. Once you find the balance point, securing the razor with your thumb is generally all you need to obtain a workable grip, which is why it’s particularly useful to find a razor that has a point of balance you prefer. Although it may not seem important to a safety razor rookie, the point of balance influences your shave — whether you notice it or not.</p>
<h3>Guard design</h3>
<p>Guard designs typically fall into four main categories: straight safety bars, slanted safety bars, adjustable guards and open combs. Easily the most popular is the straight safety bar, which simply provides a straight buffer between your face and the blade. Within the straight safety bar, many manufacturers create a ridge along the bar for aesthetic purposes, a design usually referred to as “scalloped” or “microcomb system.” Designed for thicker beards, slanted safety bars can yield a slightly more aggressive shave, slicing at an angle down on your beard.</p>
<p>Also geared towards the thicker beards, open comb guards have small gaps in the bar — just like a comb — and let you put an additional amount of pressure on the edge of the blade. Lastly, the adjustable guard designs give shavers the ultimate freedom to choose their blade gap, although they tend to be high-end razors and fall outside the scope of this review. A few examples of adjustable heads include the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000G0JZYQ/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Merkur Futur</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XJBBJMQ/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parker Variant Adjustable</a> and <a href="https://rockwellrazors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rockwell 6C</a>, among others.</p>
<h3>Loading Style</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/razor-blade-install.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Considering that convenience has been a crucial aspect of shaving since early man was using shark teeth and clamshells, a razor that doesn’t easily load can be a deal-breaker. One of the most popular loading styles is the butterfly open of a one-piece razor, which opens the razor head with a few quick turns of a knob handle (generally at the bottom). Butterfly razors, also commonly called twist-to-open, typically score high in terms of blade-loading convenience, although the drawbacks are an elevated chance of clogs and a harder time with cleaning.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, three-piece razors are an absolute breeze when it comes to cleaning out those hair holdovers. Even if it takes a few extra seconds to unscrew the handle from the two head pieces, well-made traditionally loading safety razors are still anything, but a problem when it comes to loading, and can even encourage good cleaning habits. At the end of the day, shavers typically have to decide whether they value the pure convenience of the butterfly or the old-school style and cleanliness of the standard three-piece razor.</p>
<h2>Aggressiveness</h2>
<p>Although a few different features will give clues about a razor’s aggressiveness, ultimately the perceived level of aggressiveness by the shaver is what is important. This is why quantifying a razor’s aggressiveness level can be very difficult, as the process is as much art as science and each shaver will experience the razor differently. Shavers who prefer mild razors usually like them because they are less likely to produce cuts or skin irritation, making them ideal for new safety razor users and those with sensitive skin. Razors on the aggressive side are designed to provide a much closer shave, which is why they tend to be favorites for experienced shaving enthusiasts and those with thicker beards.</p>
<p>Those looking to pinpoint a razor’s aggressiveness can focus on two important metrics to provide a basic guideline: blade gap and blade exposure. Although other features (e.g. weight, shaving angle) also contribute to the overall aggressiveness, determining the blade gap and blade exposure is essential to separate razors that otherwise might be very similar.</p>
<h3>Blade gap</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-9110 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-768x512@2x.jpg 1536w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Even tenths of a millimeter between the guard plate and the blade can change everything when it comes to a razor’s aggressiveness. While fairly mild razors like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NL0T1G/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Merkur &#8211; MK 23C</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YJ70NY/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Feather &#8211; Popular</a> land in the 0.61 to 0.64 mm range for blade gap, it’s not uncommon for an aggressive razor to have a blade gap well north of one millimeter. On the extreme side, adjustable razors like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000G0JZYQ/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Merkur Futur</a> can have a blade gap of 1.75 mm for the top end of the adjustable settings. The blade gap between the guard plate and blade also affects how easily you can clean up after a shave, as larger gaps won&#8217;t collect plugs of stubble and shaving cream as easily.</p>
<h3>Blade exposure</h3>
<p>Even though the blade gap often gets the bulk of the attention, partially because the data is more readily available, the blade exposure is still critical in determining aggressiveness. Blade exposure is simply the amount of blade that protrudes from the edge of the razor head, which combines with the blade gap, weight and shaving angle to create a general level of aggressiveness. A head that has significant exposure, like the V3A head on the <a href="http://www.maggardrazors.com/product/maggard-razors-mr7-knurled-handle-chrome-safety-razor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maggard &#8211; MR7</a>, will end up feeling more aggressive than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NTHWLU/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parker &#8211; 99R</a> despite having nearly an identical blade gap of 0.89.</p>
<p>The problem with blade exposure as a metric is that it is much harder to measure. Even though actual measurements for blade exposure are rare, a basic rating scale from mild (limited exposure) to aggressive (maximum exposure) can easily give you an idea of how aggressive a razor is, particularly if you have measurements for blade gap. Whether you’re looking for mild and easy or want to push the upper limits of aggressiveness, the blade gap and blade exposure can be great metrics to help get you started.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Our group of five testers started with their normal razors, giving us a chance to see what they liked about their own razors before moving on to the test group. To make sure the group started on the same page, testers were encouraged to shower before each shave, one of the recommended ways to properly prime the skin. Instead of using a new shaving soap or cream across the board, however, testers were instructed to continue using what they were accustomed to, as a change could distort the data and lead to skin irritation that may not be a reflection of the razor.</p>

<p>Each test razor was then loaded solely with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Y4FFIEK/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Voskhod Teflon-coated blades</a>, which fit every standard double-edge razor and can be purchased inexpensively in hundred-packs. Testers used each razor five times at their normal rate of shaving, rating the razors from 0-5 in a range of different categories: ease of maneuvering, closeness of shave, blade loading, ease of rinse, construction material and overall satisfaction. Each tester was also asked to check their pride and keep track of any nicks/cuts not attributable to user error, finishing each razor by jotting down a detailed description of their experience.</p>
<p>After the test period was over, each tester looked through their results and came up with their favorite razor as well as their runner-up and least favorite. By breaking down the individual scores for each category compared with the macro views of the testers, we were then able to determine the razors that best held up during the process and performed the best.</p>
<h2 id="top-pick">Best overall: Parker &#8211; 99R</h2>

<p>Smooth and substantial to hold, easy to use and a tremendous all-around value, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NTHWLU/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parker &#8211; 99R</a> scored very well with both the most experienced shavers and the tester who has been using electric razors for years. Parker may not have been one of the original trailblazers in the space, but the 99R model has perfected the twist-to-open style with an eye-appealing design and materials that feel built to last. The 99R’s blade gap is even on the aggressive side, though that doesn’t stop it from delivering a comfortable, close shave.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The Gillette SuperSpeed is generally considered the prototypical butterfly-open safety razor, a model that was very popular in the years before disposable cartridges took over. Four decades after the SuperSpeed was in its heyday, the Parker 99R carries on the torch with a 4-inch chrome-plated handle, spiral knurl grip and a weighty design meant to do the heavy-lifting portion of your shaving routine.</p>
<p>Elegant and sharp to look at, but not over-designed, the 99R also has a lightly ribbed (microcombed) straight safety bar and one of the thicker handles that you’ll find on a safety razor. Though the blade gap of 0.89 was more aggressive than most of the other test razors in the group, all five testers found it natural to maneuver and ended up with minimal nicks and cuts. The girth and weight of the handle also yielded a point of balance much closer to the center than is typical, making some of the slender-handled models feel somewhat flimsy by comparison.</p>
<h3>The features that testers loved</h3>
<p>With its simple twist-to-open knob at the handle base and standard butterfly open, the Parker was clearly going to be in the running for easiest to load, and it more than lived up to the billing with the highest score in this category. A surprising find? Testers found that it cleaned very easily, a feature that twist-to-open one-piece razors are definitely <i>not</i> known for. While this could change over the longer haul as the shaves begin to pile up, it’s a great sign that cleaning the head isn’t the problem that some butterfly opens tend to have.</p>
<p>Thanks to its bulkier design, it also might be easy to anticipate a few problems in terms of overall maneuverability, yet this turned out not to be a problem for testers. The long handle and central point of balance combined to create an easy shaving angle that made it one of the top performers in maneuverability; only the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B011L8WJIA/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Viking &#8211; Chieftain</a> scored as high, matching the 99R with a 4.2 out of five.</p>
<p>Although it was right in the middle of the pack for shaving closeness, the convenience factor and the overall shave elevated it to the top of the list for three out of the five testers. It was also the only tested razor to avoid an overall satisfaction rating of lower than four and wasn’t named by any of the testers as the least favorite of the group.</p>
<p>At face value, the Parker 99R is the razor equivalent of a moderately priced sedan, built to get the kids to soccer practice and back home again without the frequent trips to the mechanic. In action, however, the 99R proves that it has much more under the hood than it does on the surface, providing a user-friendly and luxurious shaving experience that is easy to appreciate no matter your shaving background.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NTHWLU/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parker &#8211; 99R</a> may seem aggressive with its 0.89 blade gap, but its limited blade exposure and heavyweight design makes for an incredibly easy shave while still getting close.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to its simple twist-to-open design and sturdy materials, blade-changing is as fast and easy as possible with a safety razor.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike some other one-piece, butterfly razors, cleaning the 99R isn’t problematic.</li>

<p>Don’t let the name of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B011L8WJIA/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Viking &#8211; Chieftain</a> fool you. Though it may sound harsh and menacing, it is more of a mild-mannered charmer than the bane of a civilization. With its microcomb system embedded in its safety bar, the one-piece Chieftain is designed to placate irritable skin while still providing a close shave with its limited blade exposure.</p>
<p>Our razor collector friends tell us this is one of many clones of the classic Gillette &#8211; SuperSpeed, probably made by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M1VGXT1/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baili as the BD17</a> and re-packaged with the custom travel case. The polished 3-inch chrome handle and knurled grip make it look slightly like a Viking axe ready for battle, though 18 months after we tested this group it&#8217;s now easy to find this same design under different names if you look. An updated version of the Chieftain has a new nameplate on the bottom of the head, but as far as we can tell none of the important design geometry has changed.</p>

<p>Designed for convenience at home or on the go, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011L8WJIA/?tag=ybdsafet-20&amp;th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chieftain</a> delivers a smooth shaving experience complete with easy blade loading and just enough aggression to satisfy shaving enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Much more important than the aesthetics, however, the Chieftain performed extremely well in the key categories. Although the butterfly open was a touch flimsier than the brass-bodied <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NTHWLU/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parker &#8211; 99R</a>, the Chieftain was still a cinch to load and was as easy to maneuver as any razor in the group.  The Chieftain scored the highest in the group in closeness, left the least number of cuts and nicks and finished just behind the Parker in overall satisfaction, showcasing its combination of convenience and comfort that put it in the running for the top razor.</p>
<p>The Chieftain even came with a nice little bonus: a surprisingly effective case that accompanies most purchases and highlights the razor’s versatility as both an everyday option and travel companion. Although packaging won&#8217;t make it shave better, The Chieftain’s practical and elegant leatherette travel case works perfectly with its shorter handle and could slide into a work or travel bag without you even knowing it’s there.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">Very high convenience and versatility factor. Like most twist-to-open razors, changing blades is lightning fast and the complimentary case is a nice add-on that makes it ideal for traveling.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Easy to maneuver for all safety razor experience levels despite the relatively short three-inch handle and ostensibly aggressive 1.04 blade gap.</li>

<p>The name <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003LW4L2W/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Edwin Jagger &#8211; DE89</a> tends to command respect in the world of double-edge safety razors, and the DE89 certainly points to the reasons why that holds true. The Edwin Jagger’s 3.7-inch handle is a manageable length, the construction material (polished chrome over brass) convinced testers it was a high quality, and it demonstrated a nice balance between comfort and aggressiveness. Although lighter than the Parker, the EJ’s handle is just as thick as its counterpart and shows off an attractive, vertically-knurled grip that contributes to its overall classic look.</p>

<p>Even though it has a blade gap on the mild side, the DE89 slightly topped the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NTHWLU/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parker &#8211; 99R</a> in shave closeness and scored higher in ease of blade-loading than the other multi-piece razors that we tested. Still, we were left unconvinced that it would truly make the best safety razor for beginners despite the company’s own marketing efforts. Thanks to middle-of-the-road maneuverability, a unique handle length and more difficulty loading than the top butterfly models, beginners might be better off going for an option centered more on pure convenience. But even with a less than ideal starting point for safety razor rookies, the Edwin Jagger &#8211; DE89 is a very good all-around razor.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">High-quality material and a comfortable all-around shave make the Edwin Jagger &#8211; DE89 a great long-term shaving option.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Easy to get a close shave despite a minimal blade gap/exposure and overall mild feel.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Ergonomic, but classy design make for a razor that is as eye-appealing as it is effective.</li>

<h3>Feather &#8211; Popular</h3>
<p>Not to discriminate against the synthetic plastic safety razors, we also tested the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YJ70NY/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Feather &#8211; Popular</a>, a generally well-liked and inexpensive butterfly model that failed to make much of a connection with testers. Without the classic look of its more substantial metal counterparts or the pure convenience of a cartridge razor, the Feather simply had a rough comparison with the best models in the price range. In a vacuum, however, the Feather would probably get a chance to shine brighter thanks to its easy-to-load head, decent maneuverability and unbeatable price tag (typically under $20).</p>
<h3>Baili &#8211; BT171</h3>
<p>While the Merkur 23C held its own next to the competition, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M1LFKPE/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baili &#8211; BT171</a> missed the mark despite showing flashes of potential. More than anything, the Baili proved difficult to tame, as three different testers reported at least three nicks/cuts. This is a modern clone of a classic Gillette &#8211; Tech, and it&#8217;s a razor that works well for a lot of people, but takes some practice. No other razor had more than one tester who ended up with at least three different nicks or cuts not attributed to user error. Where it did score fairly well, however, was the construction material (another polished chrome finish) and in closeness of shave, even though testers paid for their smooth faces with a bit of bloodshed.<br />
This model from Baili shows up under a variety of names if you look around for it, and our original test was of a popular but now-disappeared Amazon brand called &#8220;Smoothere.&#8221; The travel case with its tiny shaving mirror is, we have to admit, a nice touch. You can also find versions of this razor sold by boutique shaving shops, sometimes with different handles like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MA53LRO?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the DE1 from The Italian Barber.</a></p>
<h3>Maggard &#8211; MR7</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.maggardrazors.com/product/maggard-razors-mr7-knurled-handle-chrome-safety-razor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maggard &#8211; MR7</a>, is a unique safety razor that comes with a few different head choices. Looking to pick a head on the aggressive side, we went with the V3A, a zinc alloy, chrome-plated head with a (scalloped) close-combed safety bar that yielded an aggressive shave not to be taken lightly. Though the Maggard had no problem getting a very close shave, even the testers used to aggressive heads saw an uptick in cuts while greenhorns found it nearly impossible to use.</p>
<p>Having said that, the Maggard &#8211; MR7 is still a highly respected razor that could still be a great option for intermediate or expert shavers, though even veteran safety razor users could have a learning curve with the aggressiveness of the V3A head. Other head options that might be better suited to warm shavers up to the Maggard &#8211; MR7 include the open-combed V2 and the standard version of the V3.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>For anyone intimidated by the prospect of switching from cartridge to a safety razor, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NTHWLU/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parker &#8211; 99R</a> is a classic-looking butterfly razor that promises a soft landing for both face and wallet alike. Rating well for both overall shave and value, the Parker is simple for beginners, but aggressive enough for more seasoned shavers to get their money’s worth, making it a rare razor that can satisfy a host of different beards and shaving styles.
