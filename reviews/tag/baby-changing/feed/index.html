								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter we lugged baby gear around in six top-rated baby diaper bags for three months, our team of seven veteran parents carefully deliberated on their picks. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I0P7WIU/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">JuJuBe &#8211; B.F.F.</a> was the best overall, with convertible backpack straps, high-quality materials and great organization features. The best diaper bags on a budget are the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077N4G6DW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eddie Bauer &#8211; Traverse</a> backpack diaper bag and the stylish <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B7XUVLW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Skip Hop &#8211; Duo Special Edition</a> tote-style bag.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Our researcher for this project has used a variety of diaper bags over the years, so we already had some expectations about what to look for. We checked the latest reviews from testing sites like BabyGearLabs and Wirecutter.</p>
<p>We also looked at the latest trends on The Bump, Babylist and Instagram. One trend that we had to make a call on was leather and leather-like bags: After researching user reviews for popular artificial-leather bags we decided that they don&#8217;t stand up to wear-and-tear well enough to be a best pick overall.</p>
<p>Genuine leather is a material that usually wears well in a bag, but water and staining are problems. We also recognize that many people simply don&#8217;t want to use leather or other animal products, so we skipped leather bags, at least for this test.</p>
<p>After collecting recommendations for 24 popular diaper bags, we narrowed the field to a set of finalists. We eliminated bags that had more than a handful of complaints about material quality or flaws in manufacturing. We also picked bags that at least claimed to offer insulated bottle pockets.</p>
<p>We eliminated bags that were expensive without justification in the materials used. Most of the bags we tested came in at less than $70. We did make an exception for the JuJuBe&#8217;s perennial award winner; compared to other bags we looked at in the $150–180 price range,  JuJuBe’s zippers and fabric are actually an upgrade (with a warranty to back them up).</p>
<p>We wanted to find bags with style options, rather than focusing on different diaper bags &#8220;for girls&#8221; and &#8220;for dads.&#8221; For example, the fashion-forward JuJuBe &#8211; B.F.F. comes in a range of &#8220;black-out&#8221; styles to cater to all sensibilities.</p>
<p>We did test a few designs that were aiming to be more trendy, too. We avoided overtly &#8220;tacti-cool&#8221; dad-bags, but we tested some diaper changing pads that you could add to any good backpack or messenger bag that you already trust.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs-diaper-bag">Do you really need a diaper bag?</h2>
<p>Should you buy a diaper bag, or is a regular messenger bag or backpack just as good? The case for buying a new diaper bag might seem to rest on style, but there are some compelling reasons to have a dedicated bag.</p>
<p>Most importantly, there is an essential feature missing from a shoulder bag or backpack: a changing pad.</p>
<p>A changing pad isn&#8217;t always necessary to change a diaper. Sometimes, though, you see a puddle on that already-sketchy changing table in the mall. Many public restrooms can make you wonder why you don&#8217;t carry a bottle of bleach solution everywhere.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t even have a changing table to work with, a diaper bag changing pad can&#8217;t make every location suitable, but it really helps in situations where you&#8217;re not prepared to sacrifice your baby&#8217;s favorite blanket.</p>

<p><strong>If you already have a bag you like and just want to make it into a diaper bag with a changing pad, check out our reviews of <a href="#changing-pads">add-on changing pads below</a>.</strong></p>
<p>But there&#8217;s another reason you should think about buying a new bag: A dedicated diaper bag means you don&#8217;t have to shuffle diapers and other essentials in and out of your favorite backpack or shopping bag.</p>
<p>Additionally, a diaper bag eliminates confusion about which bag has the diapers in it when a spouse or sitter has the baby for a few hours. Nothing&#8217;s worse than realizing you brought the wrong bag on a day trip just as certain smells begin to fill the car.</p>
<p>A dedicated diaper bag doesn&#8217;t automatically re-stock itself with diapers, so picking the best bag doesn&#8217;t solve all your problems. But knowing exactly where to stash your emergency supplies is at least a start to winning back some sanity. This is the bag you&#8217;ll take everywhere you go with your baby, so make sure it&#8217;s a good one.</p>

<p>We started our testing with a survey of seven experienced parents, many of whom had three or more kids already out of diapers. We asked them to rank the importance of factors like storage capacity, specialized organization options and backpack straps versus shoulder slings.</p>
<p>After in-depth testing of all the bags, we ranked them against these concerns. We then asked our group of testers to rank the bags from most-desirable to least-desirable.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[table id=235 /]</span></p>
<h3>Storage versatility</h3>
<p>This is the category where our testers were fairly ambivalent about specific bags. Organizer pockets are a great idea, and they can turn out to be perfect for what you need to keep on hand. Most times, however, a bag is just a bag.</p>
<p><strong>After testing, we decided that the best organization features were options to separate the contents of your bag.</strong> Especially if you have stuff for more than one kid in there, this helps you find a specific item without pulling everything out.</p>
<p>The stand-out bag here is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I0P7WIU/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">JuJuBe &#8211; B.F.F.</a> It combines a spacious main compartment, extra side pockets and organizer pouches to make it practically perfect, even for those parents who keep extra stuff in the diaper bag all the time.</p>
<p>On the flip side, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K2RXRWY/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Obersee &#8211; Bern</a> is a great backpack that really doesn&#8217;t distinguish itself as a diaper bag. The tall compartments and organization features are better for carrying laptops and pens than wipes and spare socks.</p>
<h3>Comfortable straps</h3>
<p>How well a particular bag carries definitely depends on your body, but good straps never hurt. We ranked these bags based on how we felt about them after an all-day outing.</p>
<p>In the case of the two backpacks, we took them on a trip that involved shambling around the SFX airport for hours late at night with a three-year-old and an infant.</p>

<p>The Obersee &#8211; Bern isn&#8217;t going to win awards from backpackers on a through-hike, but it&#8217;s definitely the best diaper backpack for comfort. The closest competitor was the Eddie Bauer, though we have to give JuJuBe credit for designing convertible backpack straps that actually work and keep up with the purpose-built backpacks.</p>
<p>The cross-body straps on the rest of the bags are fine if you only need to wear them for a half-hour, but you&#8217;ll be looking for ways to ditch them after that. This is one area where the convertible JuJuBe and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074Q56ZJQ/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ergobaby &#8211; Coffee Run</a> really stand out.</p>
<h3>Changing pad size</h3>
<p>We used the changing pads for diaper changing and they&#8217;re all good enough — that is, they provide you with the reassurance that your baby won&#8217;t be lying on top of something icky during a change. They&#8217;re all fairly small.</p>
<p>The pads are also waterproof enough, but none of them are large enough to change a diaper in a puddle. Check out our <a href="#changing-pads">add-on changing pad review</a> if you want something bigger.</p>
<p>The Eddie Bauer and Maman bags lose points here because the fabric soaks up a trace of liquid and they also use sponge padding instead of closed-cell foam, so they could trap liquid inside. Water beads up and rolls off quite well, but you do not want to leave these pads sitting in something wet and nasty.</p>
<h3>Insulated bottle pockets</h3>
<p>An ice pack is essential for keeping bottles chilled if you&#8217;re on a day-long outing in the heat, even if you&#8217;re using a fully-enclosed cooler. We found the same results in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-coolers/">cooler review</a> and when <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-lunch-box/">testing the best lunch boxes</a>: Insulation helps, but you need ice to keep perishable food safe for longer than a few hours.</p>
<p>This is another case where our testers had mixed feelings. If you use a lot of bottles every day, having a way to carry them for a little bit longer at safe temperatures is a big deal. But only one of our testers was really sold on having a bottle cooler integrated into a diaper bag.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re carrying a bottle around for more than a few hours on a hot day, an insulated pocket will do very little to keep it cold. You will need to use an ice pack to keep cooler temperatures on an all-day trip.</p>

<p>The Obersee &#8211; Bern is the only diaper bag we tested with insulation worth noting. It can hold three small bottles along with a slim ice pack, which might make all the difference when you&#8217;re traveling.</p>

<p>Many dads resent diaper bags. The look of most trendy diaper bags mimics designer purses or tote bags, so a handful of enterprising men have started companies to offer alternatives. There&#8217;s now an entire market segment for diaper bags designed around military aesthetics: Stuff like MOLLE-style ladder straps and velcro for clever diaper-joke morale patches.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goruck.com/stories/gr1-aka-the-most-badass-diaper-bag-ever-built/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason McCarthy of GORUCK bags insists that a specific bag design for diaper-bag duty is a ridiculous idea</a>, and he&#8217;s not entirely wrong. McCarthy tells you to buy his $400 GR1, of course. It and a lot of other great &#8220;tactical&#8221; bags are very capable of holding diapers, wipes, a change of clothes and other necessities.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re well aware of the diversity of preferences among parents. Not every dad wants to use an ammo pouch to carry bottles, and not all diaper bags for girls will have pastel floral prints. Happily, there are now diaper bags on the market that suit nearly every possible taste.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[table id=236 /]</span></p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve already said above, though, we don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s as easy as saying your favorite bag for other purposes is also your best choice for a diaper bag.<b> If you&#8217;re splitting play-date duties with your spouse, finding a diaper bag you can both be happy with will save you some confusion when you&#8217;re rushing to get somewhere on time.</b></p>
<p>Fortunately, most of the bags we tested come in at least neutral colors and design options. Our dad testers and our mom testers didn&#8217;t think any specific bag style was objectively &#8220;most neutral.&#8221; Taste is still going to play a big role in what you like. That said, we did have some popular picks.</p>
<p>JuJuBe won big with moms for the huge range of styles available. There are offerings that cover the entire spectrum of fashion sensibilities: many are colorful prints, but they do offer more subdued versions, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K3PLBGD/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the &#8220;Gray Matter&#8221; style</a>. It&#8217;s not going to pass for &#8220;tactical,&#8221; though.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077N4G6DW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eddie Bauer- Traverse</a> won some points in this category with the subdued-but-not-boring textured gray fabric. It&#8217;s only available in that color, but nearly everyone loved it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing stopping you from buying two diaper bags if you can’t agree on one design or shape. Just make sure you and your partner are on the same page about which bag actually has diapers and spare clothes in it.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I0P7WIU/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">JuJuBe &#8211; B.F.F.</a> is a lesson in excellence through compromise. This isn&#8217;t a gigantic bag, but it&#8217;s not too small to carry more than the essentials. It&#8217;s not a bag for all-day trekking, but the comfortable straps can be un-clipped. This is both a great shoulder bag and the best backpack diaper bag.</p>
<p>The fabric is durable, with a Teflon coating that makes it washable and stain-resistant. It feels smooth and supple, a real upgrade from the cheap polyester or even the Cordura-style nylon you find on suitcases and messenger bags.</p>
<p>Organization features are the real key to the B.F.F.&#8217;s success. <strong>The main compartment is spacious and allows for carrying bulky items along with your diaper-change essentials.</strong> The front zippered compartment keeps smaller items from getting lost, and there&#8217;s a no-scratch front pocket that&#8217;s great for sunglasses or smartphones.</p>
<p>The side pockets are great, easily holding baby bottles as well as <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-water-bottle/">our favorite water bottles</a> and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-sippy-cup/">sippy cups</a>. They&#8217;re insulated with Thinsulate, which is very good as far as insulation materials go. On a summer day when you&#8217;re out for more than a few hours, you&#8217;ll still want to use an ice pack inside the bag to maintain safe temperatures for milk or formula.</p>
<p>The founders of JuJuBe came from the world of sneakers, backpacks and sunglasses, and they&#8217;ve put together one of the largest selections of styles and prints available. This is a designer diaper bag, but it doesn&#8217;t sacrifice functionality for style.</p>

It easily converts from a great shoulder bag to a very good backpack, and it's just the right size. The great materials are also backed by a lifetime warranty.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I0P7WIU/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>When it comes to the changing pad, there&#8217;s a lot to love about the quality, but it&#8217;s the smallest pad we tested. The memory foam in the middle provides great cushioning, but it would probably be too thick to fit easily in the side pocket if it were any wider. The pad has one satin and one waterproof side to help with a variety of diaper emergencies and environments.</p>
<p>JuJuBe has been making this bag since 2005 and it&#8217;s a design they haven&#8217;t topped. Some of our friends have used JuJuBe bags for more than five years, and they just don&#8217;t die.</p>
<p><b>Key Takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The JuJuBe &#8211; B.F.F. is a near-perfect balance of style and functionality.</li>
<li>You can make the B.F.F a backpack or a shoulder bag and it&#8217;s great either way.</li>
<li>This bag is not too big for one baby, not too small for two toddlers.</li>
<li>Good materials, zippers and buckles are guaranteed for a lifetime against defects.</li>
<li>JuJuBe promises these bags will stand up to machine washing.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077N4G6DW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eddie Bauer &#8211; Traverse</a> backpack diaper bag has a look that all of our testers liked. It&#8217;s not the height of fashion, but the gray textured nylon has a sleek look that helps it blend in anywhere. This diaper backpack also has some features that make it great for carrying your baby-care essentials.</p>
<p>This is definitely the best diaper bag backpack on a budget. The zippers and other hardware are all fine. Not amazing, but perfectly acceptable for a $50 backpack. The one place where the price shows most clearly is in the changing pad: It will work well enough for a year or so, but the stitching on the edge of the pad started to unravel after washing it once.</p>
<p>Among our testers, the only thing more important than good organization features is good backpack straps. This bag has both. If you weigh it down with books it won’t beat a high-end backpack, but the shoulder straps are still comfortable when the bag is full of clothes and diaper-change supplies.</p>
<p>The main internal compartment is narrower than the JuJuBe, but it&#8217;s still a great diaper bag. There are obvious places for diapers, wipes, and other essentials. Our lead tester took this backpack on a Christmas vacation trip with two kids, and the sheer number of pockets with external zippered access was impressive.</p>
<p><strong>Having a few carefully planned pockets is usually better than having random pockets all over a bag.</strong> That principle becomes apparent when you&#8217;re getting used to a backpack like this. There are many pockets that could hold your keys, wallet or baby&#8217;s favorite pacifier, but the chance you&#8217;ll forget which one you used is high for the first week or so.</p>

The changing pad is the only place where the low price really shows. It's not the best backpack we've seen, but it's just right for diaper-change essentials.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077N4G6DW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The wipe pocket on the side of the bag is a handy feature to have that we quickly learned to appreciate in a late-night airport layover. Tossing a 100-count pack of <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-baby-wipes/">our favorite wipes</a> into the bag is less annoying than figuring out how many wipes to load. The side-pocket dispenser makes going back for that last sneaky blob of poop less of a hassle.</p>
<p>Stroller clips are built in to the top of this backpack, so you still have a way to hang it if you&#8217;re just out for a stroll. We know that some people don&#8217;t like stroller-mounting bags since a heavy bag can tip some strollers, but it&#8217;s nice to have the option.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Eddie Bauer &#8211; Traverse looks like a regular backpack, but inside it&#8217;s all diaper bag.</li>
<li>Real backpack straps make this easy to carry for all-day outings.</li>
<li>Our testers all liked the style of this bag.</li>
<li>For the price, quality and materials pretty good.</li>
<li>Wipes are kept handy in a convenient dispenser pocket.</li>

<p>This is a special edition of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B7XUVLW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Skip Hop &#8211; Duo</a> that brings some extra touches to a reliable budget-friendly tote. The handles and buckles all look better than the nylon luggage look of the original model, but the upgraded wipe-clean fabric is also stiff enough to help this bag stay upright better.</p>
<p>Compared to the JuJuBe, this is a smaller bag, about 13 liters instead of 16. But the fact that it&#8217;s tall and slim means it feels even smaller than it actually is while carrying loads of baby gear.</p>
<p>The real downside to the slim-and-tall shape of this bag is when you need to carry heavy, bulky stuff. Pumps, lunch boxes and shopping items have to be narrower than three inches to fit down to the bottom of the main compartment. That&#8217;s not a big problem since it&#8217;s a bag that will mostly carry folded clothes, diapers and wipes. However, if you like carrying a jumbo-size package of wipes you might be surprised at how much it fills the space.</p>
<p>This is a cross-body shoulder bag only, which means if you&#8217;re on an all-day outing you may start to resent it flopping around at your side. The shoulder strap is decent, but nothing special. Skip Hop has also sewn in a set of stroller attachment loops.</p>
<p>There are some simple but very effective organization features in this bag. The side pockets are a good size for bottles, and they&#8217;re zippered so the bottles sit inside the bag. This way you get even better insulation than you would with a bit of padding on the outside of a pouch pocket.</p>

The SE style options are more limited than for the regular Duo, but in either case you get a tote that holds plenty and still feels small.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B7XUVLW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p><strong>A zippered accessory pocket on the top holds as much as a mid-size purse — it won&#8217;t keep your glasses safe from your keys, but it&#8217;s a great catch-all for stuff you don&#8217;t want to lose in the bottom of the bag.</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a key-clip ring conveniently positioned on the zipper pull (we&#8217;ve never met anyone who used a key-keeper that&#8217;s hidden inside a pocket), but it doesn&#8217;t actually have a clip. Points for making it potentially useful, but none of our testers actually used it.</p>
<p>Front pockets on the Duo have magnetic buttons that don&#8217;t really do much to keep stuff in if you turn the bag upside-down, but they&#8217;re big enough for <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-water-bottle/">a 32-ounce insulated water bottle like our favorite Klean Kanteen</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a pen loop cleverly hidden in one of the front pouch pockets. We&#8217;d rather keep a pen in the zippered pocket, but at least it won&#8217;t fall out in either case.</p>
<p>The quality of the Skip Hop is not at the same level as the JuJuBe: The fabric stained in one spot after a few weeks and the zippers definitely feel less reliable (though we didn&#8217;t have any problems). Skip Hop won&#8217;t cover damage from a washing machine under warranty either. There&#8217;s a two-year warranty against defects.</p>
<p>The price is definitely a crowd-pleaser, though: Some of our testers assumed it was a $200 bag like the JuJuBe, but the list price is $70 and we&#8217;ve seen it going for as little as $42.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B7XUVLW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Skip Hop &#8211; Duo Special Edition</a> is an even better version of a mainstay budget diaper bag.</li>
<li>You can still hold a lot of diaper-changing gear in this tall, deceptively-slim design.</li>
<li>Special Edition style choices are limited, but they&#8217;re top-tier looks.</li>
<li>While this version only comes in fashion-forward patterns, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J4J243Y/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">regular Duo comes in more neutral styles</a>.</li>
<li>A shoulder bag only, so if you&#8217;ve got a long day you&#8217;ll be relying on the stroller clips.</li>

<p>In many ways, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074Q56ZJQ/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ergobaby &#8211; Coffee Run</a> feels like an attempt to make a better version of the Skip Hop Duo. The shape and pocket configuration are similar, though this is about 40% bigger than the Duo. The big difference is the addition of shoulder straps to make it a convertible design.</p>
<p>On the plus side, Ergobaby has included a big, totally-waterproof changing pad with this bag, six inches wider than most of the others. The organization of the interior pockets is good, and the front zippered pouch is insulated.</p>
<p>Ergobaby is famous for their baby carriers, which are usually made from materials that feel great and have excellent padding. We mostly bought this bag on faith that it would live up to that legacy. It&#8217;s a bit of a let-down that their foray into diaper bags feels like a cheap nylon school backpack.</p>
<p>Even with the water-resistant tub bottom and mesh panels on the shoulder straps, and after looking at the other color options, the look and feel did not impress any of our testers. <strong>Many assumed the Ergobaby was the least-expensive bag we tested, when it was actually more expensive than most at $70.</strong></p>
<p>That said, all but one of our testers said backpack straps are in their top two priorities for diaper bag features. Even if the Ergobaby straps aren&#8217;t exactly class-leading, they&#8217;re better than nothing. Compared to other large totes, like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RYU9FZA/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Skip Hop &#8211; Grand Central</a> or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NBT92X6/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">JuJuBe &#8211; Be Prepared</a>, these backpack straps can really save you from an aching neck when you load up the bag.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KL5LPHK/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Maman &#8211; Designer Tote</a> is putting all their style-eggs in the quilted-jacket basket, and it works pretty well. If you love this look, there&#8217;s a lot to love about the design of this bag, too.</p>
<p>As far as we can tell, this style launched around the same time as the Skip Hop &#8211; Duo Special Edition, so we&#8217;re not going to call out an original or a copycat. The styles are distinct because of the fabric, but most of the actual features are surprisingly similar. That&#8217;s not a bad thing, though, since the Skip Hop tote design has been a great choice since they launched it in 2003.</p>
<p>The same things we loved about the Skip Hop are present here: it&#8217;s a slim, tall tote shape that stands fairly well on its own. Maman gives you places to keep stuff from sinking to the bottom of the bag, but it&#8217;s not an overwhelming number of pockets to lose your keys in.</p>
<p>After using the bag for a few weeks, we started to wonder how well it would resist stains. The waterproof coating on the fabric does its job and it&#8217;s more durable than we expected. The quilt-stitching is almost certainly going to be the weak point in the long-term if you let this bag get buried under other stuff in your trunk or closet: wear on the corners of a bag is one thing, but there&#8217;s nothing appealing about a running stitch on a quilted design.</p>

<p>Obersee has made the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K2RXRWY/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bern backpack diaper bag</a> out of a unique combination of pieces you&#8217;d expect to see other places. This is basically an anti-diaper bag, but in the best way.</p>
<p><strong>If you cover up the labels, you could easily mistake this bag for a SwissGear laptop backpack.</strong> Obersee is a real family-owned American company that mostly sells gymnastics gear, not a giant luggage-brand-conglomerate that just swaps labels, so there&#8217;s nothing disingenuous about saying this was designed as a diaper bag. But the changing pad pocket is definitely a repurposed laptop pocket, complete with a fleece-lined tablet pouch on the side.</p>
<p>This is still a good bag for carrying baby gear. There&#8217;s a full-length zip-up mesh compartment for a change of clothes and plenty of room for whatever you might need to throw inside. There aren&#8217;t any features designed around carrying baby-specific items, but maybe you want a music player headphone pass-through more than a wipe dispenser. We won&#8217;t judge.</p>
<p>There are a few pieces that really do seem like the result of carefully thought-out design and clever innovation. The changing pad is slightly bigger than average, 23 by 14 instead of 22 by 12 inches. It also has a nice easy-cleaning waterproof side, like the Ergobaby changing pad.</p>
<p>The clip-on bottle pocket is a nifty design that does a much better job of keeping two or three bottles cold on a long summer day, but only if you slip an ice pack into the mesh pocket. Without ice it&#8217;s still not really any safer than throwing a bottle in the bottom of a regular diaper bag.</p>
<p>Having a bottle cooler is a great idea. When we took this bag on a trip it was very rewarding being able to store bottles, liquids and gels in it to detach when going through TSA checks before a flight.</p>
<p>Most of the time, though, this clip-on system wasn&#8217;t any better than having a separate bottle cooler bag. If anything, it kind of gets in the way when you need to open the backpack. We found ourselves leaving it detached most of the time we were testing.</p>
<p>If all of that sounds good, maybe this bag is for you. The price was what pushed it to the bottom of our ranking, though: For $80, you can probably find a backpack you like even better and slip an accessory changing pad into it, with money left over for <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-lunch-box/#the-best-small-coolers">a great small cooler</a>.</p>
<h2 id="changing-pads">Changing pad replacements we tested</h2>
<p>If you have a backpack or tote you like already, there&#8217;s nothing stopping you from adding a changing pad to make it a great diaper bag.</p>
<p>We tried the DaffaDoot and Baby Loovi changing pads, both much bigger than the average diaper bag pad and fairly affordable. They&#8217;re also great replacements if you happen to lose the pad that&#8217;s included in your diaper bag.</p>
<h3>An absorbent pad: DaffaDoot</h3>
<p>The first changing pad we tested is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GSJLTS8/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the DaffaDoot</a>. It&#8217;s gigantic — double the size of the average pad. It&#8217;s soft fleece on one side, water absorbent in the middle, and waterproof on the bottom. All that plush material makes this more difficult to fold up and stow in a bag, but it&#8217;s an excellent changing pad.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GSJLTS8/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>A Backup for the Car: DaffaDoot Absorbent Pad</h3><p>This is an extra-large changing pad, but it's also soft and absorbent on one side. We wouldn't want to rely on this as a changing pad on every outing, since you'll have to carry around everything it might soak up in your bag, but for protecting your car's upholstery it's perfect.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GSJLTS8/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a replacement to carry around in a bag, though, all our testers agree that a waterproof pad is definitely better than something that absorbs the kinds of fluids you might encounter during a diaper change. If you have a containment leak in a mall washroom, you want to be able to wipe everything off then and there.</p>
<p><strong>For an emergency in the car (where keeping the upholstery clean is mission-critical) DaffaDoot&#8217;s pad is perfect.</strong> You&#8217;ll probably be happiest if you store it in a plastic bag you can seal well until you have a chance to wash out whatever it soaks up.</p>
<h3>A wipe-down changing pad: Baby Loovi</h3>
<p>We also tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0EU3A5/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baby Loovi change pad</a>, an even bigger pad than the DaffaDoot at 25 by 31 inches. It&#8217;s easy to wipe down after any sort of messy encounter with a leaky diaper.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re the kind of person who appreciates a well-folded roadmap (do they still make those?), or someone who can get a bed-in-a-bag sheet set back in the storage pouch, you&#8217;ll love that the Loovi comes with a storage pouch that&#8217;s just big enough to keep your bag tidy.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0EU3A5/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Waterproof Pick: Baby Loovi</h3><p>This is a gigantic changing pad. At three times the size of a regular changing pad, you can probably use it doubled-up most of the time for extra padding. It's still easy to fit in a bag, and you can probably use it as a mattress protector when you're done with diapers.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0EU3A5/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If you can&#8217;t fold things to save your life, The Baby Loovi still a pretty manageable changing pad without the pouch. It isn&#8217;t as cushioning on hard surfaces as the DaffaDoot, but it&#8217;s much better than your average changing pad and easier to carry around.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Buying a diaper bag is a lot like buying most parenting gear: After spending years researching our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-baby-carrier/">baby carrier review</a>, <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-infant-car-seat/">car seat review</a> and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-baby-monitor/">baby monitor review</a> we think it’s clear that parents are faced with overwhelming choices. After carefully selecting and thoroughly testing six diaper bags, we’re confident that this is these picks all have something you&#8217;ll appreciate.</p>
<p><strong>We asked our testers what stood out after using a bag for five years or more, and they told us that backpack straps really do make a difference, but sometimes it&#8217;s also nice to have a shoulder bag.</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I0P7WIU/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">JuJuBe &#8211; B.F.F.</a> is the best example of a do-it-all bag: The straps totally convert from one mode to the other. Either way, the bag is great at keeping stuff organized for one or two babies.</p>
<p>If you prefer a purpose-built backpack or tote, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077N4G6DW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eddie Bauer &#8211; Traverse</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B7XUVLW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Skip Hop &#8211; Duo SE</a> are great bags too. They don&#8217;t quite live up to the great materials that make the JuJuBe such an unstoppable force in the world of diaper bags, but these two bags are still dependable and well-made for the price.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After many hours of real life testing with two babies: dropping diapers, lid flipping, bag changing and room sniffing, we found the Munchkin - STEP to be the best diaper pail overall.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ith dozens of diaper pail models on the market, it can be tough to figure out which pail will best meet your needs. We tested six top-selling diaper pails over six summer weeks, filling them with disposable diapers from two toddlers and seeing how they contained odors. After hours of diaper dropping, lid flipping, bag changing and room sniffing, we concluded that the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BDQDIGM/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Munchkin &#8211; STEP Diaper Pail</a> is the best diaper pail overall. Its superior odor-containment, easy hands-free operation and sturdy design gave this diaper pail an edge above the rest. Our runner-up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00821FLSU/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ubi &#8211; Diaper Pail</a> costs around $20 more, but it’s very sturdy, attractive and uses a standard kitchen trash bag.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>First of all, we limited this review to diaper pails for disposable diapers, since disposables make up an estimated 90-95% of the diaper market. Although some of our finalists are adaptable for cloth diapers, the differences between the two types of containers are significant enough that we chose to focus only on functionality related to disposable diapers.</p>
<p>We began our research by seeing which diaper pails people were talking about most in 2017. We considered diaper pail reviews from only real testing review sites such as <a href="https://www.babygearlab.com/topics/diapering-potty/best-diaper-pail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Babygearlab</a>. There were many other lists out there from big baby brand sites but we put much less weight on their choices since they didn&#8217;t do any testing.</p>
<p>A survey of a moms’ Facebook group helped to pare down the results even further and provide direction for our selection. Finally, we headed over to Amazon to check out the top sellers, read reviews and add to our set of finalists to test. These reviews and user comments also helped us learn what features are most important to folks shopping for diaper pails.</p>
<p>In 2018, the Diaper Genie &#8211; Essentials model was discontinued, and we tested the new Expressions pail side-by side in a household that&#8217;s been using the old model for three years. We looked again at lesser-known brands like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U0UJ5SS/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bubula</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U5YC1C6/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tommee Tippee</a>, and we&#8217;re still satisfied that the Munchkin is the best you can get.</p>

<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>Our research revealed that caregivers and gift-givers are concerned about the following when selecting a diaper pail:</p>
<p><strong>Odor containment</strong>: Above all other concerns, a diaper pail should contain odors; this is its primary function and sets it apart from regular trash cans.</p>
<p><strong>One-handed or hands-free operation</strong>: Diaper pails that are easy to open one-handed or hands-free are especially convenient, since one hand is usually occupied with the baby.</p>
<p><strong>Easy bag changing</strong>: The plastic liners that hold the diapers inside the diaper pail should be easy to remove and change, to minimize the unpleasantness of the task as much as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Diaper capacity and unit size</strong>: The pail should be compact, yet large enough not to merit daily emptying.</p>
<p><strong>Keeps out kids</strong>: Lid locks and other deterrents can help keep curious toddlers (and pets) away from the contents.</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: Consider not only the one-time cost of the diaper pail, but also the ongoing cost of purchasing the appropriate liners.</p>
<p><strong>Design and longevity</strong>: Some shoppers may consider whether the pail has an attractive design that blends in with baby’s deécor, and if it has potential for a life after diapers.</p>

<p>But why buy a dedicated diaper pail at all? Can’t you simply throw the diapers away in a regular trash can? Or toss them in the outdoor trash or down the garbage chute one at a time? While these are certainly options, many caregivers prefer a dedicated bin specially designed to minimize odors that they can keep close to the diaper-changing area.</p>
<p>The sealed-lid design of diaper pails is what sets them apart from regular trash cans. In addition to sealed lids, some diaper pails also have built-in odor-masking features, such as the baking soda sachet in the Munchkin &#8211; STEP and the deodorizer disc in the Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver. Others feature two barriers to keep odors at bay, such as the lid-plus-trapdoor design of the Dékor &#8211; Plus and the Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions. Still others are made of materials that won’t absorb odors, such as the Ubbi. For the most part, all of these features are relatively effective in keeping odors at bay.</p>
<p>Some diaper pails feature a child lock that helps keep little hands out. Of the models we tested, only the Dékor &#8211; Plus and the Ubbi have dedicated child locks — although neither one was any trouble for our 20-month-old and 3-year-old testers, who figured them out in minutes. None of the diaper pails we tested claim to keep out pets, and we didn’t specifically test for this. However, it would take a very clever and dexterous dog to work its way into any of the pails we tested. A possible exception is the Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver, which opens if pushed over with enough force.</p>

<p>Diaper pails get daily use in homes with small children, so we knew our testing needed to reflect the realities of caregivers’ lives. We looked at how easy it was to unpack each one from its shipping packaging, how simple it was to assemble and start using, and how nice it looked in the nursery. Our practical testing included all the concerns we identified in our research phase, including one-handed operation, changing the liner and keeping the kids out. We also considered each one’s diaper capacity, how well it contained odors and how they stacked up to in a price comparison.</p>
<h3>Out of the box</h3>
<p>For the most part, all of the pails we tested were easy to remove from their packaging. The Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver was the easiest, in fact, with absolutely no packaging inside the shipping box. The Ubbi and Dékor &#8211; Plus each had more packaging than the rest, including packing foam and plastic bags, which is logical considering their emphasis on attractiveness.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009A4FBQ/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BDQDIGM/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin &#8211; STEP</a> were the only models that required any assembly. They each include odor-masking features that need to be attached inside the lids. Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver has a deodorizing disc and Munchkin &#8211; STEP has a baking soda sachet. Both were very simple to install.</p>
<p>The Dékor &#8211; Plus, Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions and Munchkin &#8211; STEP each have a proprietary “continuous liner” that comes already loaded in the diaper pail. (See below for more on the continuous liner system.) The others all use standard kitchen trash bags, which we needed to insert before testing. For our practical testing, we elected to use unscented trash bags to keep the playing field even with the unscented proprietary liners. However, there are no unscented liners available for the Dékor &#8211; Plus, so in our testing we used the lightly scented liners that came with the diaper pail.</p>
<p>In a physical side-by-side comparison, the Ubbi, Dékor &#8211; Plus and the Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions are more visually appealing than the other models we tested. They are colorful — both models offer several color options to match your nursery scheme — and have sleek, modern shapes that seem more likely to blend into a well-designed nursery than the other models. Diaper Genie earns a bit of an edge here by offering <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HLYR6HM/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">slip covers in three colors and five patterns</a>. The Munchkin &#8211; STEP is solidly middle-of-the-road design-wise, with a tall, bright white plastic exterior. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002IWYXH4/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe</a> has a large blue (or pink) handle that adds an interesting visual element, but overall doesn’t either blend in or stand out in a stylish way. And the Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver simply looks like a plain, rather small trash can, not particularly appealing on any level beyond practicality.</p>
<h3>Practical testing</h3>
<p>In our hands-on testing, we rated each diaper pail for odor containment, ease of one-handed operation and simplicity of changing the liner. We also considered each one’s effectiveness at keeping the kids out, its diaper capacity and how they stacked up to one another in a price comparison.</p>
<p>We tested each diaper pail for two weeks in a home with two diaper-wearers, ages one and three years, each wearing size-four diapers. The pails were kept in two interior rooms — one in a child’s room and the other in a bathroom — and both were in locations where the resident kids had easy access to them. Each pail was used several times per day and emptied at least four times in the course of testing. We also <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-baby-wipes/">reviewed the best baby wipes</a> at the same time.</p>
<h3>Odor containment</h3>

<p>Hands down, the number one most important quality in a diaper pail is its ability to contain odors. Otherwise, why bother with a special container? <strong>Odor containment was foremost in our minds during testing and was given the most weight in our rankings.</strong></p>
<p>In fact, the other characteristics of diaper pails are simply less important than odor containment. If you buy a standard-bag diaper pail hoping to save money on liners, but you can only put in five diapers before it starts to stink up your nursery, you’ll be changing bags too often to see any cost savings. An attractive design quickly becomes unappealing and inconsequential if odor drives you to store it out of sight. Odor control is absolutely essential.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BDQDIGM/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin &#8211; STEP</a> and <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions</a> pails were both tops in this category, reaching bag capacity before the smell became troubling. The Ubbi was a distant third place, releasing odor upon every open, but containing odors exceptionally well when closed. The Dékor &#8211; Plus is next best, allowing odor to escape every time a diaper was inserted, but not smelling after five days with a full bag. Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe and Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver had abysmal results in our testing, releasing odor upon opening to insert a diaper and leaching stink after only a couple days with only a few diapers inside.</p>
<h3>One-handed operation</h3>

<p>One-handed operation is a top concern of reviewers, because one hand is usually on the baby while the other hand disposes of the diaper. All of the models we tested are relatively easy to open with one hand:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009A4FBQ/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver</a> has a push-button that opens a hatch to put the diaper through. The only difficulty with this model was that the bulbous compartment that holds the deodorizing disc is mounted inside the hatch door, and it sometimes gets in the way of pushing fuller diapers through.</li>
<li>Like a city mailbox (remember those?), the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002IWYXH4/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe</a> has a handle you pull up to reveal a compartment to place the diaper in. Push down on the handle to deposit the diaper into the liner. A little foot built into the front of the pail allows you to step and hold it steady during all the handle ups and downs.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00821FLSU/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ubbi’s</a> slide-hatch has a small handle to facilitate opening. It’s an easy quarter-turn to unset the lid lock before opening, and to reset it upon closing.</li>
<li>The snap-close lid of the now-discontinued Diaper Genie &#8211; Essentials is the only lid that has stumped all of our kid testers. The updated <a href="https://www.target.com/p/-/A-51094345" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Expressions model</a> has a push-button pop-up lid that&#8217;s more convenient, and the spring-loaded inner trap door keeps kids out of the diapers themselves, but it&#8217;s not what it used to be.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BDQDIGM/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin &#8211; STEP</a> step-controlled lid reveals a self-sealing opening that a diaper must be pushed through. This was the easiest one-handed operation of all the pails we tested.</li>
<li>The step-controlled lid of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F55P1WW/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dékor &#8211; Plus</a> opens to reveal a trapdoor for diapers to be dropped through. The lid lock for the trapdoor is a simple dial that’s easy to use but can be a little tricky to turn with a diaper in your hand.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changing the bag</h3>
<p>It’s not difficult to change out the liner in any of the diaper pails we tested. Half of the models we tested use proprietary liners and the other half use standard kitchen trash bags. The process for changing the bags in all of them is intuitive and self-explanatory, but we discovered that the models with proprietary liners have a distinct advantage over those that take standard bags.</p>
<p>Reviewers and manufacturers alike often claim the benefits of being able to use standard trash bags, which potentially saves you money because you don’t have to buy more than one kind of trash bag for your home. However, we found that the models with proprietary bags were much more pleasant to change, because their contents are never open to the air during the changing process. This is thanks to the continuous liner design used by the Munchkin &#8211; STEP, Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions and Dékor &#8211; Plus.</p>

<p>The continuous liner is a long tube-shaped roll of plastic liner that hangs down into the diaper pail and is tied off at the bottom to create a bag. Once full, the bag of diapers is cut off the roll using an included child-proof cutter and tied off at the top to create a sealed “sausage” of diapers. Because the full bag is removed through a door on the side of the diaper pail and not by opening the lid, the liner can be tied off without exposing the contents to the air. When the roll cartridge is empty, it is removed and replaced with a refill. While this process is a bit involved to describe, changing the liner on these three diaper pails is not difficult, and is significantly more pleasant than replacing the bags on the other models.</p>
<p>Note that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BDQDIGM/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin &#8211; STEP</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009TJ3J60/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions</a> use interchangeable “continuous ring” proprietary bag cartridges. The Munchkin &#8211; STEP can also accommodate a different, but similarly odor-containing bag design, called the “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009R27JVU/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">snap, seal and toss</a>,” which has a snap-top that allows it to be sealed without exposing the contents to the air. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00389VFH2/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dékor &#8211; Plus</a> has its own continuous ring design.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009A4FBQ/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ubbi, Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002IWYXH4/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe</a> use standard kitchen trash bags. While relatively straight-forward in all of these models, the process for changing the bag in the Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver requires the top of the bag to be open to the air for as long as it takes to remove the bag from the pail. This can be a very unpleasant few moments. The Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe and the Ubbi have similar clever methods for bag changing that keep the bag from opening when you remove it (see more under Runner Up and Other Finalists, below).</p>
<h3>Keeping kids out</h3>
<p>Generally, kids are fascinated by anything they’re not supposed to touch, and even more so if the off-limits item is something regularly used by their parents. Our tester kids were predictably drawn to all of the diaper pails we tested, and gave us good insight into how accessible the germy contents are to curious little hands.</p>
<p>The Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions, Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver and Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe were easy to access. Our 20-month-old tester figured out the push-button open on the Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver and was thrilled to open and close the hatch repeatedly, letting out the diaper smell in small bursts. And the Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe, with its fun handle revealing a hidden compartment, was the best toy in the house during its testing weeks. Countless small items were fished out of the diaper pail after they’d had a toddler-assisted ride down the chute. The Diaper Genie&#8217;s spring-loaded inner trap door keeps kids separated from diapers the same way it keeps smells in, but the flip-up outer lid is just as much a kid magnet.</p>
<p>The child locks on the Ubbi and the Dékor &#8211; Plus were minimally effective at keeping the kids out, but they provided enough discouragement to keep these models from becoming objects of play. Similarly, the lid-control pedal of the Munchkin &#8211; STEP was fun for the kids to step on, but they were put off by the self-sealing diaper hole.</p>
<h3>Diaper capacity</h3>

<p>All of the models we tested had similar capacity, even considering their size differences. Each will hold about 15-20 size four diapers (according to our testing), or about 30 newborn diapers (according to their marketing), although <a href="https://ubbiworld.com/pages/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubbi</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002IWYXH4/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baby Trend’s</a> marketing claim their models can hold closer to 60 newborn diapers. For testing purposes, we defined the diaper pail as “full” if the bag could not hold any more diapers.</p>
<p>In addition to testing diaper capacity, we also wanted to see how well each model contained odors overnight, when full, with the lid closed. In this test, only the Munchkin &#8211; STEP and Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions didn’t stink up the room. The Ubbi and Dékor &#8211; Plus leaked enough odor to be detectable, but not gag-worthy. For the other models, the results of overnight testing were so stinky we couldn’t stand to let subsequent bags fill up because the odor became too unpleasant.</p>
<p>This is a meaningful result to highlight, because diaper capacity means very little if the diaper pail starts to stink with only a few diapers in it. The added convenience and cost-savings of having a diaper pail you can fill to capacity could significantly improve your diapering experience.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>

<p>We saw a significant difference in quality and odor-containment based on price. Our top picks are the two most expensive models, with Munchkin &#8211; STEP at around $56 and Ubbi at about $80. Dékor &#8211; Plus is around $40 and Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe is around $30. Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions, our pick for best lower-cost diaper pail, costs under $25. And our bottom-rated model, Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver, is the least expensive at about $16.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind when considering cost is how much you’ll spend on bags. Ubbi, Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe and Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver all use standard kitchen trash bags. Munchkin &#8211; STEP and Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions take only proprietary bags and Dékor &#8211; Plus can use either its proprietary bags or standard trash bags.</p>
<p>The proprietary refills do cost a lot more than standard trash bags, and that’s a cost that adds up. You could spend $70 more per year on bags for the Diaper Genie, for example, than on standard bags for the Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver. If cost is a primary driver for you, consider one of the models that takes non-proprietary bags.</p>

<p>Our favorite diaper pail was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BDQDIGM/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Munchkin &#8211; STEP</a> diaper pail. This easy-to-use, sturdy diaper pail contained odors, kept kids out and was a breeze to empty.</p>
<p>The continuous bag design provides superior odor containment. The bag refills for the Munchkin &#8211; STEP (and Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions) keep the odors in very effectively; diaper smell isn’t even detectable when sniffing the outside of a full bag. The Munchkin &#8211; STEP also includes a deodorizing baking powder sachet that helps keep a nice smell at the opening of the pail. It’s easy to change the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009TJ3J60/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bag cartridge</a> (or the single use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009R27JVU/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">snap, seal and toss bag</a>) and not at all unpleasant to remove full bags.</p>

<p>Design-wise, the Munchkin &#8211; STEP has a neutral look of white plastic offset with chrome-like accents. It’s tall enough that we could insert a diaper without having to bend down. Additionally, not only is it sturdy enough that there’s no fear of it tipping over, having a foot pedal gives it an extra level of stability.</p>
<p>Our tester kids liked opening the lid with the foot pedal and even trying to throw away diapers, but weren’t able to push the diapers all the way through the opening. We saw this as a good thing that meant there was no way they could access the mess inside the liner.</p>
<p>Changing the bag is as simple as opening the door on the side of the pail, pulling down on the bag to make slack at the top, cutting the bag on the child-proof cutter and tying it off. It’s fast, stink-free and intuitive. The Munchkin &#8211; STEP even has a recessed push-button release for the side-access door, so it’s pretty difficult for kids to get into.</p>
<p>The one drawback about this diaper pail is the need to push diapers through an opening that has a valve-style seal. There is an element of “squish” here, and there was one time in our testing that mess escaped from a diaper and got on the liner. This was easily resolved, however, by pulling more liner from the cartridge down into the pail, hiding the mess inside. One other note is that condensation from inside the bag can get onto your hand as you’re pushing the diaper in, but it’s our regular practice to wash hands immediately after changing diapers anyway, so that wasn’t a big deal.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Munchkin &#8211; STEP diaper pail features superior odor control when closed and full of diapers, and also doesn’t allow odors to escape when inserting a diaper.</li>
<li>Easy to use with one hand, and foot pedal provides extra stability when disposing of diapers.</li>
<li>Simple, intuitive, stink-free bag changing procedure.</li>

<p>Our second favorite diaper pail was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00821FLSU/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ubbi</a>. Its sleek design, quality materials and ability to contain odors when closed make this a very compelling choice, especially if you want a diaper pail that coordinates with your nursery.</p>
<p>The Ubbi is a sturdy diaper pail with a lockable sliding hatch in the lid. We never worried it would stay upright upon opening — this was an issue with some of the more lightweight models — and the door for depositing diapers opened easily. It was awkward to try to unlock the lid and slide open the hatch while holding a diaper all with the same hand, but it was doable once we got the hang of it.</p>
<p>The stainless steel construction seals in odors exceptionally well. With the hatch closed, the diaper pail did not smell at all, even on hot days, and only the faintest of smells escaped overnight when the bag was completely full. It also repels odors, so even the interior of the pail didn’t smell too bad after our testing weeks. It may be temping to use <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-baby-wipes/" rel="noopener">baby wipes</a> for cleaning up odors, but a quick wipe-down with a <em>disinfecting wipe</em> removed the minimal lingering odor.</p>

<p>This diaper pail is available in <a href="https://ubbiworld.com/pages/diaper-pail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13 colors and five (limited-edition) patterns</a>, so you’ll probably find one to match your baby’s décor. And the powder-coated steel is easy to wipe clean and looks as high-quality as it feels.</p>
<p>Our main gripe with the Ubbi is how it smells when it’s not sealed shut. There’s a puff of diaper odor that’s released every time the hatch is opened to insert a diaper. If you’re quick, it’ll be a short puff, but it’s still a yucky several moments while the smell dissipates. When you’re changing the bag, opening the lid releases all the odor that steel case has been containing so well. There is a bag-holding ring that helps a bit, so at least you don’t have to come face-to-face with the contents. But it’s a shame that such an otherwise well-designed diaper pail still requires a good amount of breath-holding when changing the liner.</p>
<p>Finally, the Ubbi came in at the very top of the price range for all of our selections, over $20 more than the next most expensive model. As we’ve noted, it does seem like you are getting a higher quality product for that price, so depending on your priorities in a diaper pail, the higher price might be worth it to you. This diaper pail may also have a life beyond diapers, most likely as a pet-waste trash can, since the opening in the lid is a little small for a wide variety of household trash.</p>
<p>Because it did allow odors to escape upon opening, this model couldn’t compete with our top pick, the Munchkin &#8211; STEP, in odor control. However, we liked the Ubbi very much, and would recommend it especially to folks who care a lot about the quality and design of their diaper pail.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Ubbi &#8211; Diaper Pail features easy one-handed operation, although occasionally tricky to unlock and open while holding a diaper.</li>
<li>High-quality, well-designed exterior available in a variety of colors and patterns.</li>
<li>Allows odors to escape when inserting diapers and when changing the bag.</li>
<li>Highest price of all the models we tested.</li>

There is a lot of gear to buy when you’re having a baby, and cost of luxury accessories is certainly a concern for most families. Our pick for the best lower-cost diaper pail is the <a href="https://www.target.com/p/-/A-51094345" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions diaper disposal system</a>.</p>
<p>The name Diaper Genie is synonymous with diaper pails, but reviews of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0713M8Z5L/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">top-of-the-line step-to-open models</a> have always been lukewarm at best. The basic models, on the other hand, have always been award winners. The Diaper Genie &#8211; Essentials was our old budget pick, and the Expressions is a refresh of the exterior design that leaves the smell-stopping mechanism basically unchanged.</p>
<p>With its snap-top/push-and-lock design, the Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions was on par with our top pick, the Munchkin &#8211; STEP, regarding odor control. Smells were minimal or non-existent when inserting a diaper. And even better, the continuous cartridge design allows the bag to be changed without ever allowing those trapped odors to escape.</p>
<p>While the now-discontinued Diaper Genie &#8211; Essentials was the only model we tested that kept the kids out entirely, the new Expressions model has a push-button pop-open lid that toddlers might love to play with. The strong spring on the inner door means your those toddlers still won&#8217;t be able to put anything in, but the update trades away security for a little bit of convenience.</p>

If you're looking for something that's not a white plastic bucket, you can also buy optional slip covers.</p><a href="https://www.target.com/p/-/A-51094345" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Target.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If you like the look of a plain white plastic pail, this model is just as unassuming as any of the others. You&#8217;ve got the option of buying <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HLYR6HM/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a slip-on cover in one of six patterns</a>, though, which makes this pail a bit more versatile than any of the others.</p>
<p>Finally, we have to address the “squish” issue. The Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions’ push-and-lock design functions exceptionally well as an airlock, but it does require you to forcefully push diapers through a pretty tight opening. In our combined years of using this system, we have not seen instances of diaper contents erupting during the “squish,” but online reviewers frequently cite this as a concern — and the competitors like to highlight how their models do not require a “squish.”</p>
<p>Overall, the Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions is a functional, lower-cost diaper pail with superior odor containment. This option is a good choice for those more concerned with budget than design.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions offers superior odor containment when disposing of diaper and when changing the bag.</li>
<li>Optional slip covers make this easier to match with your nursery decor.</li>
<li>Easy one-handed operation, though kids might want to pop the outer lid open.</li>
<li>Requires you to squish diaper through tight opening.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F55P1WW/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dékor &#8211; Plus Diaper Pail</a> is functional and attractive. We loved its foot pedal for easy one-handed operation, and it’s nice and tall so there’s no need to bend down to toss diapers. The lid opens to reveal a trapdoor to drop diapers through, making this a truly “hands free” diaper pail, since you don’t have to touch any part of the pail with your hand when using it.</p>
<p>If you want to use the child lock, however — which we discovered we definitely needed to do, since that foot pedal and trapdoor combo are so fun for kids to explore — you lose some of the hands-free appeal. Twisting the knob of the child lock while holding a diaper can be tricky, especially if the diaper isn’t a tidy package. Our answer to this dilemma was to place the diaper on top of the trapdoor, then turn the child lock knob and hope the diaper would be heavy enough to force open the trapdoor and fall down inside. This worked about half of the time.</p>
<p>The other major drawback of this model was the stink factor. The trapdoor opens directly into the bag of diapers, letting out smelly air with every diaper deposit. The proprietary continuous liners that come with the Dékor &#8211; Plus are lightly scented, but the diaper odor was still very noticeable with every trapdoor open.</p>
<p>As we noted with the Munchkin &#8211; STEP and the Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions, the continuous bag design is terrific for odor control when changing out the liner. Open the side door, pull the bag down to let out some slack, slice the plastic with the included safety cutter, tie off the top. No need to inhale the full degree of accumulated aroma in that bag. In our opinion, it truly is worth the money for the proprietary refills if it saves us a face full of diaper stink every time we change the bag.</p>
<p>The Dékor &#8211; Plus could have a life after diapers, especially since the trapdoor insert is removeable from the lid casing.</p>
<h3>Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe</h3>

<p>We were surprised by the poor odor containment of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002IWYXH4/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe</a>, especially considering the positive reviews both on Amazon and various blogs. After only a couple days, it began to smell up the room, and airing it out didn’t solve the problem.</p>
<p>With its airlock-style design, you pull up the handle, place the diaper in the compartment and push the handle down to deposit the diaper into the container. It is a great one-handed operation, especially if you steady it by standing on the little foot built into the front of the pail. However, the diaper-holding compartment is also an odor-holding compartment, so every time you pull the handle up, you’re greeted by a puff of diaper smell. Even storing it with the handle in the “up” position didn’t help as much as it should have. Odor leaked out of the container and had the room smelling bad within a couple days.</p>
<p>Additionally, our 1-year-old tester loved to play with the handle of this pail, inserting a toy into the compartment, pulling the handle down and then back up to find that his toy had disappeared! Because there is no child lock on this model, we had to keep it in a room with limited child accessibility.</p>
<p>The best feature of the Baby Trend &#8211; Diaper Champ Deluxe is the bag insertion and removal. This model takes regular kitchen trash bags or proprietary scented liners. There’s a bag holder ring just under the lid that holds the bag in the pail. To change the bag, you can open the lid in a way that keeps the top of the bag held in the ring, so you don’t need to open the bag to the air and get a face full of stink. This clever design somehow functions better than the similar set-up of the Ubbi, holding in more smell, although still allowing some to escape.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a sturdy, rather short diaper pail with an odor containment problem. Some online reviewers describe having luck with deep cleaning the pail every two or three bag changes, or treating the rubber seal with <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-essential-oils/" rel="noopener">essential oils</a>. But for our money, we’d rather have a diaper pail that requires as little cleaning and maintenance as possible.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009A4FBQ/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver Diaper Pail</a> is just a step above a regular trash can, the main difference being the diaper hatch in the lid. It takes regular kitchen trash bags that are straightforward to install and change, and looks like it could be a typical trash can.</p>
<p>At only 18.5 inches tall, this is the shortest model we tested and also the widest at 14 inches. For some spaces, these measurements can matter a lot; all of the other models feature a “space saving” oval shape, while the Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver is round. We noticed a difference in our testing spaces, where the Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver seemed not to fit as well as the others.</p>
<p>This diaper pail’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000SOXF82/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">deodorizing disc</a>, which lives in the bulbous compartment on the underside of the hatch, did not have a discernible scent or a noticeable impact on odor control. In fact, the compartment holding the disc even got in the way as we tried to insert fuller diapers through the hole, so for us it was more hindrance than helper.</p>
<p>Because the hatch opens directly into the container, odors were released upon opening the hatch. But that wasn’t all — the smells also escaped from the container when it was closed. Partially full of diapers and left in a poorly ventilated room for a couple hours, the Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver made a real stink. We had to air it out overnight twice in its two-week testing period, and we still needed to change the bag more frequently than the other models to avoid having a constantly stinky room.</p>
<p>With its squat, beige container, the Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver isn’t likely to appeal to anyone setting up a designer nursery. And the push-button operation for the hatch was very fun for our tester kids to play with — opening and closing the hatch, inserting small toys into the hole — which was especially a problem when they opened it and walked away, leaving a pungent surprise for whoever entered the room next.</p>
<p>Overall, the Safety 1st &#8211; Easy Saver functioned as well as we would expect a regular lidded trash can to work as a diaper pail — not very well, unless you empty it every day. That being said, this would function just fine as a regular trash can, although you’d likely just lift the entire lid to throw away garbage, rather than using the hatch. It could also function reasonably well for pet waste, albeit with the same limitations we noted for diaper use. And at just $15.79, it’s a bargain for either use, if you’re prepared to deal with some stink.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>One of the most satisfying things about changing diapers while you&#8217;re on the go with <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-diaper-bags/">a great diaper bag like one of the backpacks or totes we reviewed</a> is that you can leave the dirty diaper in someone else&#8217;s trash. When you&#8217;re at home, unless you&#8217;ve got an outside storage bin close at hand, there&#8217;s really no way to get around temporary diaper containment until trash day.</p>
<p>Our pick for the best diaper pail is the Munchkin &#8211; STEP Diaper Pail powered by Arm &amp; Hammer. The step-lid combined with the self-sealing system and continuous liner design offer excellent odor containment and easy one-handed use.</p>
<p>We also recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00821FLSU/?tag=ybdpail-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ubbi</a> if you’re looking for a high-quality, designer diaper pail, and the <a href="https://www.target.com/p/-/A-51094345" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Diaper Genie &#8211; Expressions</a> if you want a functional pail with a lower price tag. Both contain odors when closed and are easy to use with one hand.</p>
<p>As with many purchases, price was a major identifier of the quality and functionality of the diaper pails we tested. In our opinion, odor containment is the most important consideration for any diaper disposal system, and the more expensive models we tested had the best odor control. Think about how much you value a clean-smelling room, and consider budgeting a little more for a quality diaper pail.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter more than 35 hours of research and weeks of practical testing with a group of seven pairs of parents, and taking into consideration the price, ingredients, wiping performance and a host of intangible qualities, we&#8217;ve determined that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NVLP2ZI/?tag=ybdwpe-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Babyganics &#8211; Face, Hand &amp; Baby Wipes</a> are the best baby wipes.</p>
<p>Babyganics wipes clean up messy diapers with ease. They also feel soft and gentle, have a pleasant scent and contain mostly plant-based ingredients. Though not most inexpensive, they are still competitively priced against baby-product giant Pampers and relative newcomer Amazon.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-chose">How we chose finalists to test</h2>
<p>Our baby wipes finalists are among the most-reviewed products we have researched and tested at Your Best Digs. A simple Google search for “best baby wipes” turns up more than three million results from parenting blogs, forums, magazines and product pages. All of our finalists have more than 100 user reviews on Amazon, and some of them have well over 1,000.</p>
<p>Led by these user reviews, and with guidance from the bloggers such as Momtricks, and analysis of online market share, we chose eight of the top-selling natural, sensitive and fragrance-free wipes — the ones that claim to be the best baby wipes for newborns or the best wipes for sensitive skin. Carefully observing scent, softness, thickness, texture, moisture and strength, our seven testers wiped baby bottoms, hands, faces and furniture.</p>
<p>We tested the two leading brands’ natural wipes, an up-and-comer and several smaller players.</p>
<h2 id="the-eight-best">Compare the best baby wipes</h2>
[table id=32 /]
<h2 id="why-use-wipes">Why should you use baby wipes?</h2>
<p>Only 30 years ago, caregivers were still wiping baby bottoms with wash cloths. It wasn’t until 1990 that Huggies introduced the first widely available disposable wipes, revolutionizing the way we changed diapers.  Baby wipes are a billion-dollar industry in the U.S. alone, with steady worldwide growth.</p>
<p>Demand for these convenient products continues to grow thanks to rising household incomes, busier lifestyles and constantly improving manufacturing methods. While there is a strong movement among new parents toward reusable wipes (and diapers), <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/research-and-markets---global-baby-wipes-market-2016-2020-with-johnson--johnson-pg-kimberly-clark-svenska-cellulosa-aktiebolaget--unicharm-dominating-300274010.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disposable baby wipes are still the established choice</a> for caregivers at home and on the go.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re out and about, having a cleaning product you can rely on in your <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-diaper-bags/">diaper bag</a> or even just in the bottom of your <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-double-stroller/">stroller</a> will help you deal with all the little messes in your day.</p>
<p>Eco-friendly, natural and sensitive baby wipes are a relatively recent and growing facet of the industry. This trend is in response to consumer demand for wipes that are safe for babies and better for the environment. As the economy improves, mainstream and boutique brands are introducing and improving baby wipes made with high-value features like plant-based ingredients and natural fibers.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5271" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/online-market-share.png" alt="chart of baby wipe online market share" width="900" height="665" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/online-market-share.png 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/online-market-share-610x451.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/online-market-share-768x567.png 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/online-market-share-300x222.png 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/online-market-share-295x218.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/online-market-share-885x654.png 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/online-market-share-360x266.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/online-market-share-375x277.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/online-market-share-414x306.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/online-market-share-320x236.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h2 id="features-you-need">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>Caregivers’ preferences vary across the board when it comes to baby wipe features, and there is a wipe on the market for every preference. Do you want a thick yet soft wipe, or a light, untextured wipe? Do you prefer scented or unscented? Are you concerned about the percentage of plant-origin ingredients and materials, or is price your primary driver? Or maybe you only care that your wipes are available at your favorite store.</p>
<p>For our testing purposes, we selected key features from our own experiences with personal care wipes as well as noting some of the more commonly cited product features. We considered the measurable features of cost, size, ingredients and materials used, as well as more subjective features like softness, thickness and texture.</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> As is often the case, with baby wipes it usually pays to buy in bulk. Purchasing several packs of wipes at a time can often save you a few cents per wipe, and that savings can be significant if you’re stocking up. Each brand of wipes offers different amounts of wipes per package, so we found it helpful to look at price per wipe when comparing cost.</p>
<p><strong>Wipe size:</strong> A baby wipe needs to be small enough to easily dispense, but big enough to create a sense of security when wiping a very messy diaper. Much like other paper products — facial tissues, toilet paper, paper towels — consumers expect a baby wipe to be a standard size, give or take fractions of an inch, or it will feel odd and negatively influence the wiping experience. Few brands even mention size on their packaging, apart from providing the dimensions of the individual wipes.</p>
<p><strong>Package size:</strong> most brands we tested come in large packages of around 100. That&#8217;s good for saving on wasteful packaging, but if you&#8217;re using a wipe dispenser like the one from our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-diaper-bags/">Eddie Bauer diaper bag backpack review</a> you&#8217;ll have to take wipes out of those packages to load into the dispenser.</p>
<p><strong>Natural ingredients:</strong> Because a baby’s skin is still developing, irritation can develop very easily. As <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0042RJR74/?tag=ybdwpe-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Babyganics</a> says, “babies’ most sensitive places are also the messiest.” Harsh additives and excessive friction can contribute to skin irritation, diaper rashes and discomfort. Manufacturers of baby wipes need to find a balance between mild, non-irritating ingredients and those that will be effective enough to clean with as few passes over the skin as possible.</p>
<p>While formulations vary, baby wipes generally contain similar types of ingredients: cleansers, moisturizers, preservatives, fragrance, thickeners and featured ingredients like aloe or vitamin E.</p>
<p><strong>Wipe materials:</strong> Baby wipes are made from nonwoven fabrics that usually comprise a combination of natural and synthetic materials. None of the wipes we tested are biodegradable, compostable or flushable.</p>
<p><strong>Strength and durability:</strong> Nobody wants a wipe to break in the middle of a diaper change. And while none of the wipes we tested broke mid-wipe, some of them tore or stretched easily when removing them from the package, which can be frustrating when trying to change a squirming child. Our “tug test” put each kind of wipes up against a gentle two-hand tug to see how easily it would break and how well it would hold its shape.</p>
<p><strong>The intangibles:</strong> Softness, texture and thickness are a kind of trifecta of difficult-to-measure, yet very important qualities in a baby wipe. Each quality affects the wipe experience, and often a combination of the three can improve or detract from the experience.</p>
<p>Softness is a quality one would expect in all baby wipes. When considering a wipe’s softness, we looked at its feeling in the hand and whether its texture felt harsh or gentle. In some cases, thickness tipped the scales in favor of one wipe over another.</p>
<p>Scent and moisture are also subjective and subtle qualities in a wipe. A mild or unobtrusive scent is preferred among our test group and presumably among targeted consumers. As for moisture, testers agreed the ideal level is a “know it when I feel it” middle-ground. Too wet, and it dripped when it shouldn’t. Too dry and it didn’t feel effective in its purpose. Somewhere in the middle was the “just right” moisture level we expected.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5272" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/baby-wipes-test-results.png" alt="baby wipes test results chart" width="900" height="754" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/baby-wipes-test-results.png 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/baby-wipes-test-results-610x511.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/baby-wipes-test-results-768x643.png 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/baby-wipes-test-results-300x251.png 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/baby-wipes-test-results-295x247.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/baby-wipes-test-results-885x741.png 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/baby-wipes-test-results-360x302.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/baby-wipes-test-results-375x314.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/baby-wipes-test-results-414x347.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/baby-wipes-test-results-320x268.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We distributed packages of wipes evenly among the seven testers, ensuring each type of wipes was tested by at least four people. Each tester was given several days to test their wipes for diaper changes, after-meal cleanup, wiping runny noses and other household and on-the-go uses.</p>
<p>Then, each tester was asked to take a survey and rank each brand’s scent, softness, texture, thickness and moisture on a scale of one to five, with one being the worst and five being the best. Once all the surveys were complete, we averaged the scores of each quality to see which wipes impressed our testers the most. We also asked testers to share any comments about using the wipes, as well as whether they would purchase those wipes in the future. Using this data, we also calculated a “wiping” score to complete the evaluation.</p>
<p>It’s important to reiterate the personal nature of preferences in these categories. Even in side-by-side tests, the differences in these qualities tended to be subtle and highly subjective. This observation explains the myriad wipes on the market, and certainly makes it tricky to name a winner. However, some wipes received consistently higher overall rankings than others, so we’ve graded below according to those ratings.</p>
<h2>The price test</h2>
<p>The top eight brands of wipes we used range between two cents per wipe and six cents per wipe on Amazon. If you’re using a conservative 500 wipes a month, that’s a difference of $20 a month — $240 a year — if you choose the least expensive wipes over the most expensive.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5273" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cost-data.png" alt="chart of cost comparison data" width="900" height="664" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cost-data.png 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cost-data-610x450.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cost-data-768x567.png 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cost-data-300x221.png 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cost-data-295x218.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cost-data-885x653.png 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cost-data-360x266.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cost-data-375x277.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cost-data-414x305.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cost-data-320x236.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Most wipes will hold up well when stored for two years or more in a closet, pantry or bathroom. The exception in our testing group is WaterWipes. As we discuss below, the lack of preservatives in these wipes shortens their shelf life compared to other brands, so the manufacturer recommends using them within 15 months of purchase.</p>
<p>For some brands, it is significantly more economical to buy in bulk. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O8LOS14/?tag=ybdwpe-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kirkland Signature</a> are the least expensive wipes we tested, at less than two cents per wipe — but only when you purchase a box of 900 wipes. If you wanted only 400 wipes, for example, you could pay seven cents per wipe for the same product.</p>
<h2>The ingredient test: additives and fabrics</h2>
<p>All of the wipes we tested are marketed specifically on their natural or sensitive ingredients, and in fact all of them are hypoallergenic, alcohol free and free of dyes. Packaging claims include “plant-based ingredients,” “chemical free,” “hypoallergenic” and “naturally scented.” Several of the brands print their ingredients on their packaging or website as a chart listing the purpose of each substance, and most have detailed information about their ingredients and fabrics online.</p>

Instead, these wipes contain only two ingredients: water and grapefruit seed extract. The result is fewer potential allergens or irritants, plus these wipes have a pleasant scent that doesn't linger on the skin.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B071X4SDPW/?tag=ybdwpe-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Chemical preservatives are an added ingredient in all of the wipes we tested except <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B071X4SDPW/?tag=ybdwpe-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WaterWipes</a>.</p>
<p>Babyganics, Pampers, Amazon, Kirkland and Seventh Generation each include Sodium Benzoate, a common synthetic food and cosmetics preservative. Four of the brands — Kirkland, Amazon, Huggies and Bloom — include Phenoxyethanol, a preservative controversial for its <a href="https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/704811/PHENOXYETHANOL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possible toxicity or allergic reaction</a>, especially when used around the mouth.</p>
<p>Babyganics, Bloom, Seventh Generation and WaterWipes all contain a majority of plant-derived ingredients, which is our expectation of “natural” baby wipes. The remaining wipes include multiple other chemicals that, while common in cosmetics and other personal care products, don’t seem to jive with the “natural” or “sensitive” label.</p>
<p>WaterWipes certainly stand out in this category. Marketed as “the world’s purest baby wipe,” WaterWipes contain only two ingredients: water and grapefruit seed extract. The obvious benefit of this is the inclusion of fewer potential allergens or irritants. Grapefruit seed extract is a natural skin conditioner and frequent ingredient in skin care products. Because there are no preservatives in these wipes, the manufacturer recommends using them within 15 months of purchase.</p>
<p>The Amazon brand embraces an extra level of transparency in the sharing of ingredient information. A QR code on each individual package allows you to see the geographical origin of every ingredient in that package, as well as its manufacture and expiration dates. For example, the water used in Amazon’s wipes comes from White Lick Creek Aquifer in Mooresville, Indiana. While it may not affect the wipe’s cleansing ability, this level of detail may give consumers more peace of mind or simply warmer feelings about the brand.</p>
<p>As for fabrics, Bloom wipes are 100% naturally derived cellulose. Pampers, Amazon and WaterWipes use 100% synthetic fibers. Seventh Generation, Babyganics and Huggies wipes include a combination of plant-based cellulose and synthetic fibers. Kirkland advertises that their wipes are 70% TENCEL fiber, a naturally derived cellulose fiber, but they do not share what the other 30% of the material is.</p>
<h2>The size test: physical dimensions</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5267" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/size-measurement-test.jpg" alt="tape measuring a baby wipe" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/size-measurement-test.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/size-measurement-test-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/size-measurement-test-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/size-measurement-test-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/size-measurement-test-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/size-measurement-test-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/size-measurement-test-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/size-measurement-test-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/size-measurement-test-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/size-measurement-test-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Does the size of the individual wipe make a difference in its wiping ability? In a word, our testers said no. Kirkland’s “extra-large wipe” is only a quarter-inch larger than Babyganics, the next largest wipe, which isn’t noticeable. Testers did notice that WaterWipes and Seventh Generation wipes have a slightly smaller feel in the hand, but specifically cited no noticeable difference in effectiveness for their smaller size.</p>
<h2>The sniff test: scent</h2>
<p>Seven of the eight wipes tested were marked “unscented,” “fragrance free,” or “perfume free” — and WaterWipes’ two-ingredient composition implies this quality as well.</p>
<p>All of the wipes have some kind of scent — none of them smells like nothing — even those marketed as “unscented” or “fragrance free.” <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0042RJR74/?tag=ybdwpe-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Babyganics</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B071X4SDPW/?tag=ybdwpe-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WaterWipes</a> came in at the top of the list here with pleasant scents that didn’t linger on skin. Babyganics’ scent is a lightly floral fragrance, while WaterWipes has a clean, astringent, almost fruity smell. Amazon Elements and Seventh Generation also got high marks for their mild, soapy fragrances.</p>
<p>Kirkland wipes turned off several of our reviewers, who said they had a “chemical” smell.</p>
<h2>The touch test: softness, texture and thickness</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5265" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wipe-texture-detail.jpg" alt="wipe texture detail" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wipe-texture-detail.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wipe-texture-detail-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wipe-texture-detail-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wipe-texture-detail-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wipe-texture-detail-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wipe-texture-detail-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wipe-texture-detail-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wipe-texture-detail-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wipe-texture-detail-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wipe-texture-detail-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Testers were divided on these three qualities. Pampers and Babyganics were the top softness performers, with especially high marks compared to the other brands. Pampers credits their blend of plant-derived rayon and polypropylene for the “fabric-like feel.” But that wasn’t enough for either one to get the highest marks for texture, which went to Bloom, and thickness, which went to Huggies and Pampers.</p>
<p>Texture on baby wipes is created by stamping or weaving a pattern or picture into the surface of the wipe. Six of the eight wipes have textures, including ducks and clouds, polka dots, and wavy lines. WaterWipes and Babyganics are simply smooth cloth with no specially created texture.</p>
<p>Seventh Generation wipes are relatively thick with a stamped texture, but because they’re not soft they feel stiff and not pliable enough for the inevitable crevices that need to be cleaned. Babyganics, however, is a thinner, softer wipe with no stamped texture that still feels very effective at clean-up.</p>
<p>In these categories the personal preferences really shone through. For example, some testers rated Amazon wipes as “too coarse” and “too papery,” while another noted they were “among the best wipes I’ve tried.” One tester gave Babyganics the lowest score possible for texture and thickness, while another gave the same wipes the highest score possible in those categories.</p>
<h2>The drip test: moisture</h2>
<p>Amazon, Pampers and Seventh Generation tied for first in this category, achieving that “just right” level of moisture that’s so hard to define. Some testers thought WaterWipes were “too wet” — although one tester noted that is her preference. Babyganics had median scores, but two testers noted the wipes were “not wet enough at all.”</p>

<h2>The tug test: strength</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5266" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tug-test.jpg" alt="two hands administering the tug test" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tug-test.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tug-test-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tug-test-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tug-test-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tug-test-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tug-test-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tug-test-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tug-test-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tug-test-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tug-test-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Using an admittedly unscientific method, a “tug test” was administered to each kind of wipes to determine breakability and stretchiness. Huggies wipes consistently broke with only one tug, and also occasionally tore when dispensing from a Huggies-brand container. Seventh Generation, Bloom and Kirkland all tore on the third or fourth tug, with minimal stretching. Amazon, Babyganics, WaterWipes and Pampers all stretched significantly and held up to seven or eight tugs before breaking.</p>
<h2>The wipe test: cleaning</h2>
<p>All of the wipes performed adequately on post-meal cleanup of hands, faces and high chairs. Testers noted a few areas of sensitivity, however. One tester stopped using Amazon wipes on her children’s faces and hands because “the kids hate the taste.” Another stopped using Huggies wipes altogether after kissing her daughter’s recently wiped face and musing, “If they taste that bad I’m afraid to use them” for further diaper changes.</p>
<p>In our testing, all the wipes stood up well to the rigors of wet and soiled diapers. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0042RJR74/?tag=ybdwpe-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Babyganics</a> was a stand-out, cleaning messy diapers with fewer wipes than the other brands required. Bloom was labeled “efficient” by our testers, and Seventh Generation also performed well. Surprisingly, the most breakable wipes — Huggies — also had a high wiping score.</p>
<p>Bottom of the heap? Kirkland wipes didn’t have the thickness or texture to clean a mess in one or two wipes, so big messes required multiple passes with multiple wipes. WaterWipes also disappointed with soiled diapers, with one reviewer noting a damp washcloth would have been more effective.</p>
<h2 id="top-pick">Best overall: Babyganics</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5268 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/babyganics-wipes.jpg" alt="Box and packages of Babyganics wipes" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/babyganics-wipes.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/babyganics-wipes-610x404.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/babyganics-wipes-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/babyganics-wipes-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/babyganics-wipes-295x195.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/babyganics-wipes-885x586.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/babyganics-wipes-360x238.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/babyganics-wipes-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/babyganics-wipes-414x274.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/babyganics-wipes-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Because there wasn’t one kind of wipes that topped every category, we took a close look at all of the wipes’ features, measurable and otherwise, and carefully considered our choice for best baby wipes. Our reviewers generally agreed that scent, wiping efficiency, natural ingredients and price are their highest priorities in choosing baby wipes, so we gave those qualities more weight as we made our final rankings.</p>

For a mostly all-natural product, these wipes stood out from the competition.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0042RJR74/?tag=ybdwpe-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If you’re looking for hypoallergenic wipes with mostly plant-derived ingredients, efficient wiping ability and a pleasant scent at a competitive price point, you can’t go wrong with Babyganics &#8211; Face, Hand &amp; Baby Wipes. Our testers loved their scent and softness, noting especially that the scent — however pleasant — did not linger after wiping. This brand also wiped out the competition at diaper-changing time, requiring fewer wipes per change than any other brand, which definitely saves money in the long run. And with a regular price of $14.99 for 400 wipes, they’re a good buy for a mostly all-natural product.</p>
<p>Babyganics are truly well-rounded, all-purpose wipes. While most of the other wipes we tested were adequate for diaper changes, Babyganics was also a superstar at wiping messy faces, fingers, and surfaces. This all-around quality is extremely valuable for caregivers who may also be spending money on products like baby face wipes or extra paper towels.</p>
<p>Although they’re not the most natural wipes we tested or the least expensive, the overall experience of the Babyganics wipes won us over in the test to choose the best wipes for our babies.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Babyganics has a pleasant scent that doesn&#8217;t linger on the skin.</li>
<li>Thinner than the rest, yet it cleaned up diapers with fewer wipes than any other brand.</li>
<li>Sold as a natural product, Babyganics contains a majority of plant-derived ingredients.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of the subjective nature of these products, several other brands earned honorable mentions among the best baby wipes. If your top priorities are minimal ingredients, plant-derived materials, or extreme softness, these three finalists are worth your consideration.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B071X4SDPW/?tag=ybdwpe-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>WaterWipes</strong></a></p>
<p>WaterWipes need to be at or near the top of the list for anyone looking for the most natural baby wipes, or for the best baby wipes for newborns or babies with sensitive skin. Truly, ingredient lists don’t get much more “natural” (or minimalist) than water and grapefruit seed oil. High marks for scent and decent performance in all-around wiping balance out the slightly higher price. If you want truly natural baby wipes and price isn’t your main driver, these are the wipes for you.<br />
Another bonus: these smaller packets take up minimal space, and fit neatly in the side dispenser pocket of one of the finalists from our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-diaper-bags/">review of the best diaper bags</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QEMUTEU/?tag=ybdwpe-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Seventh Generation Free &amp; Clear</strong></a></p>
<p>Seventh Generation was a consistent performer in diaper changes and on messy hands and faces, without leaving a residue or lingering smell behind. Ingredients are almost all plant-derived and the wipes themselves are made from 70% plant-derived cellulose. They’re not the softest or most friendly wipes we tested, but more than one tester named these their favorite.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FMWWN6U/?tag=ybdwpe-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Pampers Sensitive</strong></a></p>
<p>Pampers scored very high in our tests, with especially high marks for softness, which is an important concern when selecting sensitive baby wipes. They’re not quite “natural” wipes, with several synthetic chemicals in their formulation, but testers liked their gentleness and light scent. And with a price point of $0.02 per wipe, these are an exceptionally good buy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OPH8HYA/?tag=ybdwpe-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Amazon Elements Unscented</strong></a></p>
<p>It’s evident that the folks at Amazon have done a lot of homework on what consumers want in baby wipes. If we consider the purchasing experience side by side with the product itself, Amazon Elements has an edge on the competition. It’s good to know what’s in your baby wipes; it’s downright impressive to be able to track the source of every ingredient too. Testers found the wipes rather thin and not particularly soft, but overall, these are average wipes with a great price.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B019ENBOYE/?tag=ybdwpe-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Bloom Baby Sensitive</strong></a></p>
<p>Another middle-of-the-road wipe that got the job done without any kind of bells and whistles, Bloom just didn’t stand out to our testers. The almost-all-natural ingredient list and 100% natural fabric go a long way to recommend this brand, although the addition of possible irritant Phenoxyethanol might give some caregivers pause.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07M6XVCBY/?tag=ybdwpe-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Huggies Natural Care</strong></a></p>
<p>These medium-thick, relatively soft wipes feel like they could tear at any minute. At $0.05 per wipe for 448 wipes, it’s at the higher end of the price range of the wipes we tested. And the inclusion of Phenoxyethanol and Cocamidopropyl Betaine, among other synthetic additives, belies the “natural” in this wipe’s name. They’re champion wipers, but if you’re looking for truly natural wipes, these don’t really fit the bill.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O8LOS14/?tag=ybdwpe-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Kirkland Signature</strong></a></p>
<p>Budget wipes well-known to caregivers shopping at Costco, the smell of these “unscented” wipes put off our testers. Firmly falling to the bottom of the group in most categories, these wipes couldn’t stand up to their higher-quality competitors. When purchased in bulk (900 wipes per box), this product prices out at less than two cents per wipe, so that could be a deciding feature for many consumers. However, the cost savings doesn’t feel as significant when you end up using more wipes per diaper change compared to the other brands.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Caregivers want a gentle, mildly scented, effective product when selecting the best natural baby wipes for their needs. There are some great choices out there that cater to specific preferences for few additives, extra softness and enhanced manufacturing transparency.</p>
<p>For our money, Babyganics Face, Hand &amp; Baby Wipes are the best natural baby wipes in overall performance, price, and those all-important intangibles that combine to make your wiping experience feel “just right.”</p>
