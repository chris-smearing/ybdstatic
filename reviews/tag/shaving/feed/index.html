								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen it comes to trimming and shaving the delicate bikini area, gentle grooming tools are key — especially for those with sensitive skin. With the help of tender-skinned, irritation-prone testers, we tried out eight of the highest-rated bikini trimmers and bikini razors on the market and selected three standout performers.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QYOSKFS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips Norelco &#8211; GoStyler</a>, a men’s body trimmer with an easy-to-maneuver body and small trimmer head, turned out to be ideal for the bikini area. Our runner-up was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079C81WDS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veet &#8211; Sensitive Precision Beauty Styler</a>, a women’s trimmer that cuts hair effortlessly and also wins points for its light, ergonomic design. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0092K7C1O/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gillette &#8211; Mach3 Men’s Razor</a>, another men’s tool, won in the best bikini razor category for its narrow head and extra-close yet gentle shave.</p>

<li><a href="#bottom">The bottom line</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>We kicked off our research with a visit to Amazon to find out which bikini trimmers and razors were rated the highest by users and why. Then we compiled a list of the features most sought after by women in a trimmer or razor.</p>
<p>Reading through subreddits, trusted product review sites and Amazon customer reviews helped pinpoint the problems faced by users with sensitive skin, as well as the tools they’d personally tried that had provided the smoothest trim or shave with the least irritation.</p>
<p>Given the volume of discussion surrounding how to minimize irritation while trimming and shaving sensitive skin, we decided to dedicate a separate category to the best bikini trimmers and razors for sensitive skin. We also consulted with cosmetologist and skincare expert <a href="https://www.facebook.com/brushedbysabrina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sabrina Orchid</a> about her trimming and shaving best practices, and how to avoid irritation.</p>
<p>Once we were fully educated and up to speed on bikini hair removal, we selected five trimmers (three of them designed especially for sensitive skin) and three razors that boasted high customer ratings on Amazon and checked the boxes of our desired features: affordable tools that were easy to hold and maneuver and delivered a quick, close yet gentle shave or trim with minimal nicks or irritation.</p>
<h2 id="pink-tax">Are men’s grooming products better?</h2>
<p>While researching women’s bikini trimmers and razors, it was impossible to ignore the number of men’s grooming tools that had received high ratings from women for delivering a smooth, nick-free trim or shave specifically in the bikini area. These products often outranked women’s trimmers and razors designed especially for the pubic area.</p>
<p>This observation begged the inevitable question: Do men’s grooming products deliver a higher quality trim/shave than women’s products? (Spoiler: The answer is <b>yes</b>, according to our tests. Scroll down to see our testing results.) Consumer Reports even <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/electric-razors/buying-guide/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> in their Electric Razor Buying Guide that they’ve chosen not to test any women’s models because they had performed relatively poorly in trials — but that there was no reason why women couldn’t use men’s shavers (insert side-eye here).</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dca/downloads/pdf/partners/Study-of-Gender-Pricing-in-NYC.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> published in 2015 by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, women pay an average of 13 percent more than men for equivalent personal care products and an average of 11 percent more for women’s razor cartridges than men’s cartridges. This phenomenon, dubbed the Pink Tax, has stirred up a good amount of outrage.</p>
<p>A quick search online unearthed long and heated subreddit discussions regarding the superiority of men’s grooming products over women’s — often for a fraction of the price. This was also a recurring theme in Amazon customer reviews of men’s body hair trimmers and razors, in which women often raved about how much better the product in question had performed in comparison to those specifically designed for women.</p>
<p>Women’s brands clearly have some catching up to do when it comes to bikini trimmers and razors. In the meantime, we decided to include three highly rated men’s trimmers and razors (which also passed our testing criteria with flying colors) in our pool of contenders.</p>

<h3>Bikini trimmers</h3>
[table id=307 /]
<h3>Bikini razors</h3>
[table id=308 /]
<h2 id="versus">Bikini trimmers vs. bikini razors</h2>
<h3>Bikini trimmers</h3>
<p>Because trimmers cut hair <i>above</i> the skin, without the blade actually coming in contact with the skin, they’re a great choice for women with sensitive skin. There’s no razor burn to worry about, a smaller chance of irritation or ingrown hairs and virtually zero chance of cutting yourself. With trimmers, women can keep the bikini region neat and groomed without shaving everything off. However, though you can usually choose a hair length setting, you’ll never be able to cut your hair as close as you can with a razor.</p>
<h3>Bikini razors</h3>
<p>For the purpose of this article, we’re going to focus on the two types of razors best suited for the sensitive bikini area: cartridge razors and electric foil shavers.</p>
<p>Cartridge razors come in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0092K7C1O/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">3-blade</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SMIIR0W/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">5-blade</a> and even 7-blade varieties, and the number of blades you choose comes down to personal preference. Some razor users claim that less blades scraping the skin equals less irritation; others say that razors with more blades reduce the number of swipes required for a smooth, irritation-free shave. Cartridge razors are a good choice for women who want a close, baby-smooth shave.</p>
<p>The “foil” in the head of an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01APRR4ME/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">electric foil shaver</a> is a thin, perforated sheet of metal covering the razor itself where hairs enter the shaver and are cut by the oscillating blades underneath. Because only the foil comes in contact with the skin — never the actual blades — electric foil shavers tend to cause less irritation than cartridge razors.</p>
<p>Some electric razors are wet/dry, which means you can either use them on dry skin or wet with shaving cream, which typically gives a closer shave. Electric foil razors are convenient and great for traveling (or anytime you don’t have access to a shower); however, they usually don’t deliver as close of a shave as cartridge razors.</p>
<p>Whether you choose to use trimmers or a razor for your bikini area, when you’re just starting out, it&#8217;s a good idea to trim hair down with scissors to about a quarter of an inch, which prevents your trimmers or razor from getting clogged.</p>
<h2 id="tips">Trimming and shaving tips for sensitive skin</h2>
<p>Our bikini-area skincare expert, Sabrina, recommends dedicating one razor to the bikini area only, rather than using the same tool for bikini, legs and underarms. In her own experience, she has also had better luck using a shaving cream instead of a gel.</p>
<p>“My two go-to shave creams are Coochy Oh So Smooth Shave Cream and Cremo,” says Sabrina. “Apply the cream first thing when you get in the shower, wait to shave last in your routine, apply the cream again and shave. Doing this will help make sure the hair is as soft as possible and the skin is prepped.”</p>
<p>Sabrina also points out that tending to your skin outside of the shower pays off in a big way when grooming the bikini area. “Dry brushing can help beforehand, as well as using witch hazel after to help calm skin. To prevent ingrowns, I use PFB Vanish + Chromabright. If you have extra sensitive skin, make sure to toss or change out your razor blades weekly, and store your razor outside of the shower.”</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Wet vs. dry</h3>
<p>When choosing the best bikini line trimmer for you, it’s important to note that many electric trimmers and razors advertised as “waterproof” are not actually impervious to water. Even if the product box is plastered with terms like “water-resistant,” “shower-ready” and “waterproof,” we recommend reading the manufacturer’s instructions or even contacting customer service before taking your trimmer or shaver into the shower with you.</p>
<p>While some electric trimmers and razors are truly waterproof, be forewarned that the majority are only intended for dry trimming and shaving, sometimes with the option to detach and rinse the head under running water.</p>
<h3>Trimmer skin guards/combs and hair-length settings</h3>
<p>To achieve your desired hair length and keep your tool’s blade from touching skin, bikini trimmers will either feature a built-in skin guard/comb that can be clicked into various hair length settings or include separate, manually attachable combs of different lengths. Some skin guards/combs feature rounded tips for an extra-gentle glide — a bonus for those with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>When selecting your trimmer, consider how closely you want to trim your hair down there. Are you aiming for a super close trim? Happy to keep things neat and tidy, but not super short? Or do you want the option of achieving different lengths, depending on the season?</p>
<h3>Blade type</h3>
<p>The best bikini trimmer for sensitive skin will have hypoallergenic, stainless steel blades and foils, to avoid redness and irritation. Bikini razor blades generally fall into two categories: stainless steel and carbon steel, which should be avoided since it tends to rust. Many razors also feature lubricating strips, which are intended to keep skin moisturized as you shave.</p>
<h3>Size and maneuverability</h3>
<p>The bikini zone is one area where an easily maneuverable razor or trimmer is vital. We recommend using slim, compact, lightweight grooming tools and razors with heads that aren’t too wide (no more than 3 centimeters, including attachments) so you can access hard-to-reach spots.</p>
<h3>Ease of cleaning</h3>
<p>As we noted above, some water-resistant bikini razors and trimmers require you to detach the head to rinse them under water, while others are watertight and can just be rinsed off quickly while still intact. Most come with a cleaning brush to help remove tiny hairs from the head. Razors with moisturizing strips can be tougher to clean, since they often end up with more gunk to remove from the blades.</p>
<h2 id="how-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>To test our lineup of eight bikini trimmers and razors, we recruited female testers with especially sensitive skin who had been through the gamut of ingrown hairs, red bumps and general irritation. Our sensitive-skin warriors rated the trimmers and razors on a scale of 1 to 10, using the following metrics.</p>
<h3>Hair-cutting performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>How well does this trimmer/razor groom your bikini area to your liking?</li>
<li>How close of a shave does this razor deliver? Any irritation or nicks?</li>
<li>How well do the skin guards/combs perform?</li>
<li>How effective is this tool’s blade? Do you only need to go over an area once, twice or several times?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Effect on skin</h3>
<ul>
<li>How gentle is the blade on skin? Any irritation, bumps or redness?</li>
<li>What is the effect of this tool’s skin guard/comb on your skin? Any irritation?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Maneuverability and ease of use</h3>
<ul>
<li>How easy is it to grip this tool while shaving?</li>
<li>How would you rate the tool’s size, in terms of ease of use?</li>
<li>Does it reach the areas you want to shave or trim?</li>
<li>How easy is it to clean this tool after use?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Noise level</h3>
<ul>
<li>How would you rate this tool’s noise level? Was it quiet or obnoxiously loud?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Price</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do you think this tool is worth its listed price?</li>
<li>Would you buy this tool yourself, based on its performance and listed price?</li>
</ul>

<p>After mowing our way through eight contenders for the best women’s bikini trimmer, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QYOSKFS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Norelco GoStyler</a> — a grooming tool marketed specifically toward men — was the standout performer, checking off all of our testing criteria and then some.</p>
<p>Although it was neck and neck with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079C81WDS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veet &#8211; Sensitive Precision Beauty Styler</a>, the GoStyler’s winning feature was its capacity to trim all the way down to 1 millimeter — shorter than any lengths offered by the other trimmers. Offering interchangeable 3-millimeter and 5-millimeter combs as well, the GoStyler caters equally to those who want the closest trim possible without shaving, as well as users who prefer a longer, more natural groom.</p>
<p>The GoStyler features stainless steel blades that cut easily and efficiently, requiring only one or two swipes over an area to trim hair to the desired length. Although the GoStyler’s advertising specifically touts its “DualCut” technology (basically, two blades in the head that move speedily from side to side to trim hair), most of the trimmers we tested also featured a two-bladed design.</p>
<p>We experienced zero pulling or irritation during our trimming sessions with the GoStyler, with no nicks to speak of. The buzzing noise produced by this trimmer is not ideal; however, all of the trimmers we tested left something to be desired, decibel-wise.</p>

<p>In a sea of glossy pink, white and lavender women’s trimmers, the GoStyler’s matte black-and-red color scheme is certainly more subdued. Its lightweight, slender body (about 17 centimeters long, with the circumference of an electric toothbrush) fit effortlessly in our hand and was easy to maneuver; the handle’s textured, rubberized surface also provided good grip.</p>
<p>With the comb attached, the end of the GoStyler’s trimmer head was one of two tools we tested that were only 27 millimeters wide (the other was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079C81WDS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veet</a> model). Whereas some of the other trimmers were much too wide for the bikini area, the head of the GoStyler felt appropriately narrow, giving us the option to do more detailed trimming.</p>
<p>According to the manufacturer, the GoStyler is watertight; however, Philips advises against using it under wet conditions because “wet hairs cannot be lifted by the comb properly.” In any case, the trimmer can be rinsed under water and used in the shower if you choose to risk wetting your hairs.</p>
<p>Though this review is focused on its trimming capabilities, it’s worth noting that the GoStyler also comes with a “detail shaver” head — a floating foil-style electric razor head that could be handy for cleaning up the bikini line (though you won’t get as close a shave as you will with a cartridge razor like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0092K7C1O/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gillette Mach3</a>).</p>
<p>The trimmer also comes with a cleaning brush and AA battery, and Philips offers a 45-day money-back guarantee and full 2-year warranty. With its sleek shape, efficient blade and superb maneuverability, the GoStyler feels high-end and expensive for its $19.95 price tag.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Though it’s designed for men’s use, the Philips Norelco &#8211; GoStyler is our top trimmer choice for the women’s bikini area, delivering a smooth, effortless trim that can be adjusted down to 1 millimeter.</li>
<li>With 3- and 5-millimeter hair-length options as well, the GoStyler is a good choice for a variety of trimming preferences.</li>
<li>The GoStyler is truly watertight; it can be used in the shower and rinsed with water.</li>

<p>Our runner-up for best trimmer is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079C81WDS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veet &#8211; Sensitive Precision Beauty Styler</a>. In many aspects, the Veet trimmer is like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QYOSKFS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips Norelco &#8211; GoStyler</a>’s fraternal twin, delivering the same excellent performance in a glossy pink-and-white package.</p>
<p>Like the GoStyler, the Veet model includes interchangeable combs, though with two length options instead of three: 2 millimeters and 4 millimeters. While the GoStyler features a fully rubberized, textured surface for grip, the Veet model is only partially covered with textured rubber, making it slightly tougher to hang on to. However, it did feel slightly more lightweight in our hand than the GoStyler.</p>
<p>The Veet tool trimmed our bikini area smoothly, requiring only a couple of passes down each “trimming path” to groom the hair to our liking. We didn’t experience any tugging or nicks, and our skin wasn’t irritated or red afterward.</p>
<p>According to the manufacturer, the Veet is a truly wet/dry trimmer. The buzz that emanates from the trimmer is on par with the GoStyler — it’s not obnoxiously loud, but it will make its presence known in your bathroom. In an ironic twist, the femininely designed Veet model’s whine is lower-pitched than the masculine GoStyler.</p>

<p>Like the GoStyler, the Veet feels like a petite, lightweight electric toothbrush in the hand and is easy to hold and maneuver. Its front is coated with rubber for grip, and we wish the back was as well; the shiny white plastic is pretty to look at, but counterintuitive for a non-slip tool. However, the Veet makes up for it with a slightly flatter and wider body, which feels more ergonomic to hold than the GoStyler. With its 27-millimeter head width (with comb attached), this trimmer is narrow enough to maneuver the difficult curves of the bikini area.</p>
<p>Like the GoStyler, the Veet trimmer kit includes an additional head option — a two-sided eyebrow trimmer with 16-millimeter and 6-millimeter hair length options, as well as an attachable eyebrow comb that shortens the length to 2 or 4 millimeters. An AA battery is also included, as well as a cleaning brush. The whole set comes in a clear pink zippered pouch, which is handy for travel. At around $20, the Veet trimmer kit is well-priced for its value, though it doesn’t come with a warranty.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Veet &#8211; Sensitive Precision Beauty Styler trimmed smoothly and efficiently, with no pulling and no irritation afterwards.</li>
<li>This tool’s easily maneuverable design features a slightly flatter body that’s particularly comfortable to hold.</li>

<p>Another men’s grooming tool, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0092K7C1O/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gillette &#8211; Mach3 Men&#8217;s Razor</a>, is our pick for the best bikini line razor. The Mach 3 has received many endorsements from women for its efficient, gentle, top-notch shave.</p>
<p>The Mach3’s three stainless-steel blades glide effortlessly over the skin of the bikini area, with no roughness or feeling of “catching” on the hairs. After passing the razor over each area once or twice, our skin was literally as smooth as a baby’s bottom. We only nicked ourselves once when, accustomed to shaving with less capable razors, we pressed down too hard mid-swipe. Clearly, the Mach3 requires zero pressure to produce a super-close shave.</p>
<p>Besides that hiccup, we found this men’s razor to be very gentle on the bikini area. Our tester, who has extremely sensitive skin and is prone to red bumps and ingrown hairs, saw no signs of irritation other than three minor bumps the day after she shaved.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079C81WDS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mach3-cta_-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mach3-cta_-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mach3-cta_-180x180@2x.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mach3-cta_-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mach3-cta_-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mach3-cta_-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mach3-cta_-180x180.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mach3-cta_-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mach3-cta_-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mach3-cta_.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Bikini Razor - Gillette - Mach3</h3><p>Narrow, compact and easy to maneuver, the Mach3 Men's Razor gave us a smooth, super-close shave in the bikini area with minimal irritation.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079C81WDS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>In a world of bulky cartridge mega-razors loaded with up to seven blades, the Mach3’s slender, lightweight handle and narrow three-bladed head are ideal for hard-to-reach parts of the bikini area. The rubberized grips on its 14-centimeter chrome handle make it easy to hold on to in the shower, and because its pivoting head measures just 4 centimeters across, we were able to access all the areas we wanted to shave.</p>
<p>Bonus: Since the Mach3 only has three blades, with more space between them than what you’d find in a 5 or 7-blade razor, it rinsed easily after shaving. The Mach3 is priced at around $8 with cartridges running about $2 a pop.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike some bulky bikini razors that were supposedly designed for the difficult-to-navigate pubic area, the Gillette &#8211; Mach3 Men&#8217;s Razor has a compact, narrow head and slim body that make it easy to reach tough spots.</li>
<li>The Mach3’s three stainless-steel blades gave us an incredibly close shave.</li>
<li>Our sensitive-skinned testers experienced minimal irritation after shaving with the Mach3.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After testing a lineup of both women’s and men’s trimmers and razors on the bikini zone, we were most impressed with the men’s tools for grooming the area gently yet effectively. The narrow and efficient <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QYOSKFS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips Norelco &#8211; GoStyler</a> gave us a fast and tidy trim, cutting our hair all the way down to 1, 3 or 5 millimeters with no irritation. Simple to hold and maneuver, the GoStyler won us over with its easy to grip, rubberized body and the closest trim of all the tools we tried.</p>
<p>Our second choice, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079C81WDS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veet &#8211; Sensitive Precision Beauty Styler</a>, performed as well as the GoStyler, with the option to trim hair down to 2 or 4 millimeters. While its body was only partially covered with rubber, we liked its lightweight feel and ergonomic shape.</p>
<p>Out of the razors we tested, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0092K7C1O/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gillette &#8211; Mach3 Men&#8217;s Razor</a>, turned out to be the best shaver for the bikini area. With a narrow, pivoting head and three stainless-steel blades, the Mach3 gave us butter-smooth skin and minimal irritation, even for our sensitive-skinned testers.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After three months of testing against beard trimmers and electric shavers, the Philips- OneBlade is our pick for keeping stubble perfectly groomed.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter three months of head-to-head testing with beard trimmers, electric shavers and conventional razors, the OneBlade is our pick for keeping a stubble-beard at a perfect balance between scruffy and groomed. It might be a good choice as a shaver if you don&#8217;t need smooth results, and it does double-duty with body hair attachments.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078BDHV9P/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips – OneBlade Face + Body</a> has a unique blade design, one of the only successful new designs since motorized hair clippers were invented. Rather than just making a row of v-shaped shears sliding against each other, Philips took the one-dimensional trimmer concept and made a new blade that cuts on both edges.</p>
<p>These are also much thinner blades than most clippers have, so you can cut very close to the skin without risking scratches from the tips of the blade. This means that you get real contrast between areas you want to look clean and areas where you want to leave some scruff.</p>
<p>The downside to this blade design is that you can&#8217;t sharpen the blades. Once they stop cutting effectively, you need to buy a replacement blade unit. They cut well for four months with most hair types.</p>
<p>Like most new electric shavers, the OneBlade is completely waterproof. That makes cleaning easy, and you can shave, trim your beard or groom your body hair in the shower. The Lithium-Ion battery in this upgraded model also lasts for a long time.</p>

<p>The Philips &#8211; OneBlade is the first successful attempt at an electric device that can be both a good hair trimmer and a good electric razor. These technologies have been around for nearly a century, and the OneBlade is a blend of the two mechanisms that performs both tasks.</p>
<p>The OneBlade is most similar to a hair clipper, but the OneBlade uses razor-thin plates instead of heavy, thick clipper blade plates. This means the edges can still cut close without scratching you with pointed cutting tips.</p>
<p>In many ways the thinness of the blades makes the cutting action of the OneBlade more like an electric shaver, where the distance between the moving blade inside and your skin is determined by a protective foil. The OneBlade doesn&#8217;t cut on the flat face of its head, though, just along the two edges.</p>
<h2>What about the other OneBlade?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JZ88HJ5/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OneBlade Core</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HBBR9FC/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hybrid</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GINTAP8/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesis</a> are a family of innovative single-edge safety razors from a high-profile Austin startup. That OneBlade brand is not directly related to the Philips-Norelco hybrid electric trimmer this review is about. But it&#8217;s still a product you should know about if you&#8217;re interested in shaving.</p>
<p>This other OneBlade is a company that set out in 2002 to design the perfect razor, and when the Genesis model launched in 2015 it was universally lauded as an excellent shave. Much like a modern multi-blade cartridge razor, OneBlade designed the head to pivot while you&#8217;re shaving to maintain the perfect angle with minimal practice required. OneBlade uses a single-edge disposable razor blade that you slide in through a carefully-engineered refill slot.</p>
<p>At $400, the OneBlade &#8211; Genesis isn&#8217;t for everyone, but the newer Core and Hybrid models swap in Tritan polyester for some of the steel parts, so they&#8217;re slightly easier to afford. The specially-made Japanese blades are far less expensive than Mach 3 or Fusion refills, but they&#8217;re still 75 cents.</p>
<p>We haven&#8217;t reviewed that OneBlade, because it&#8217;s the definition of a niche product. If you love heirloom-quality products that push the envelope of design and engineering, it&#8217;s worth looking at. But we&#8217;ve <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-safety-razor/">reviewed double-edge safety razors</a> that also give an excellent shave. They also use common double-edge blades, which are one-third the price even if you buy the fancy brands.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a close shave that doesn&#8217;t require buying $4-a-week cartridges, these razors are all good options; some require more practice, some cost more. The electric OneBlade from Philips takes for granted a different set of needs, which is why we&#8217;re writing this review.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested the OneBlade</h2>
<p>Our resident shaving enthusiast gave his straight and safety razors a break for almost six months while he tested beard oil, beard trimmers and electric razors. The OneBlade was part of our lineup of beard trimmers, but it&#8217;s unique enough that we felt it deserved a separate review.</p>
<h3>Closeness</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/closeness.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>In the course of his time with all the different shaving products, our tester would compare different devices back to back, even taking extra passes after a shave to see if leftover stubble could be picked up by a superior device. That gives a relative ranking of better or worse when comparing minute differences between similar shavers, but we needed a real scale to show differences between trimmers, shavers and razors.</p>
<p>Putting our tester&#8217;s face under a microscope or trying to measure hairs with a micrometer is impractical. We came up with an easier and more relatable way to compare the OneBlade with other shavers: <b>We can compare the feel of the leftover stubble after shaving with these devices based on the time it takes to get similar stubble feel from hair that grows out after a smooth blade shave.</b> Hair growth rates aren&#8217;t universal, of course, so this isn&#8217;t a measurement that will translate to another person, but it&#8217;s one way to evaluate differences between shaving methods.</p>
<p>The OneBlade leaves about the same amount of stubble as our tester can feel after 18 hours of growth. A good beard trimmer like the Wahl will only trim down to something like 48-hour stubble, while a top-class electric razor like the Panasonic can get almost as close as a blade shave, usually about the same difference as five-hour growth.</p>
<p>The variability in this kind of measurement is high. If you take your time and learn the growth patterns in your hair you&#8217;ll get a better shave with any method than when you&#8217;re rushing.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re using a waterproof shaver like the OneBlade, making a wet shave part of your morning routine can also take closeness to another level by ensuring that the hairs are standing up as straight as possible. We covered the essentials of wet shave gear in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-shaving-brush/">shaving brush review</a> and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-shaving-cream/">shaving cream review</a>.</p>
<h3>Ingrown hairs and razor bumps</h3>
<p>A problem with ingrown hairs after shaving, often called razor bumps, has the clinical name pseudofolliculitis barbae. This condition primarily affects curly hair. If it&#8217;s shaved below the skin, the sharpened point on a curled or bent hair can start growing out under the skin and cause inflammation, infection or even scarring.</p>
<p>Razor bumps are a much, much bigger problem than just discomfort. It&#8217;s not an isolated problem, either: The <a href="https://www.aocd.org/page/pseudofolliculitisb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Osteopathic College of Dermatology says</a> this condition affects about 60% of African-American men, but it can be a problem for anyone with curly hair.</p>
<p>Alternatives to shaving like depilatory &#8220;shaving powder&#8221; or other forms of hair removal seem drastic, but when the alternative is scarred-over bumps it&#8217;s no wonder people will try extreme measures.</p>
<p>Keeping pores clean is one way to prevent infections, so a clean razor, good preparation routines and post-shave can help, but keeping the hair from curling under the skin is the only way to fully prevent bumps.</p>
[table id=249 /]
<p>Our tester is fortunate not to suffer from ingrown hairs — if anything, his problem is the opposite, with hair growth patterns that are tricky to cut close. But we checked hundreds of reviews from a half-dozen retailers and other sources to see if there were any reports of ingrown hair problems the way there are with razors.</p>
<p>We couldn&#8217;t find any account of razor bumps from using the OneBlade. Irritation, yes, but not bumps. This seems to be as close as you can shave without risking razor bumps. In comparison, many rotary-type and foil shavers can be almost as bad for ingrown hairs as a blade-shave is.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got curly hair, it&#8217;s probably on the thicker side, too, so you may need to replace the OneBlade heads more frequently than other folks. Philips recommends a replacement every four months.</p>
<h3>Irritation</h3>
<p>Unlike razor bumps, irritation is a fairly easy problem to solve. The OneBlade gives a fairly irritation-free shave, relative to other methods, but you&#8217;ll still need to get used to it. Shaving close with the OneBlade requires going against the grain and laying the blade head flat against your skin, so if you&#8217;re pushing too hard you can still get redness.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got skin that&#8217;s especially prone to razor burn, the OneBlade can be used wet. We tried with the winning products from our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-shaving-cream/">shaving cream review</a>, and the slickness of a dense lather definitely helped the OneBlade glide more smoothly. You could also use a light oil for similar results, though clean-up isn&#8217;t as easy that way.</p>
<p>Compared to a good electric shaver, the OneBlade is about equivalent in terms of irritation. It&#8217;s much less irritating than a zero-gapped clipper blade, which can actually scratch your skin if you&#8217;re not careful.</p>
<h3>One trimmer for face and body hair</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/face-and-body.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>If you need a close trim on body hair (whether for swimming, cycling or personal comfort) you may have considered an electric shaver for a smoother result. If you use a foil shaver for body hair, though, you&#8217;re probably not going to want to use it anywhere else. Even if you can clean it with antiseptic.</p>
<p>The Face + Body version of the Philips &#8211; OneBlade comes with two spare blades, and along with a set of stubble and short beard combs it also has two comb attachments specifically to help you with trimming body hair. <strong>This means that you can keep your body-grooming attachments totally separate from your face-grooming attachments, but you get the same close trim everywhere.</strong></p>
<p>Most guys who try &#8220;man-scaping&#8221; are just looking for clean results without risking nicks in sensitive areas, and that&#8217;s where OneBlade excels. In our testing, we didn&#8217;t find a way to get nicks in sensitive areas — you still need to pay attention, but it&#8217;s a safe grooming tool. It also pulls less on thin body hair than foil shavers do.</p>
<p>If you need totally-smooth results like you would get from a razor, or if your hair is especially tough, the OneBlade might not be good enough. Our favorite body hair grooming tool overall is still the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H41JQVR/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bodygroom trimmer and shaver</a>, also from Philips. Check out our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-body-hair-trimmer/">review of body hair trimmers</a> for all the details.</p>
<p>The Bodygroom will shave closer than the OneBlade, and tickles a little bit less. The trimmer side of the Bodygroom will also handle thick, dense hair better. It&#8217;s a bigger, more expensive and more complicated tool, though.</p>
<h3>Charging and battery life</h3>
<p>The OneBlade charger and battery system are very good. We tested the upgraded Face + Body version, which has a Lithium-Ion battery rated by the manufacturer for 60 minutes of use. In our tests it ran for three hours with no load.</p>
<p>Compared with other older Philips nickel-metal hydride batteries, and all but the very biggest beard trimmer batteries, that&#8217;s a great result. It also charges more quickly than budget-priced cordless trimmers, and the charger is dual-voltage for international use with a converter.</p>
<p>Your biggest problem might be losing track of the charger, since you can probably go for two weeks of daily use without needing it.</p>
<h3>Maintenance costs</h3>
[table id=250 /]
<p>If you think about every purchase as an investment, you&#8217;re probably wondering about the replacement blade costs for the OneBlade. As you might expect, the blades can only be purchased from Philips/Norelco, and they&#8217;re not exactly cheap.</p>
<p>Given a three-year expected battery life and four months of blade life, using the OneBlade every day for six years (which includes buying a replacement unit after three and a half years) will cost you almost $250 total. That&#8217;s about $100 less than a premium electric shaver, and less than a quarter the cost of buying new Gillette five-blade razor cartridges every week.</p>
<p>The long-term cost of the OneBlade shouldn&#8217;t scare you off if it does what you need, since this is a unique combination of trimmer and shaver. But blades for a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-safety-razor/">double-edge safety razor</a> are still by far the most economical way to shave at less than 25 cents for a premium blade.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-love">What we loved about the OneBlade</h2>

<p>The Philips Norelco OneBlade is a design that&#8217;s going to be best in a very specific set of uses.</p>
<p><b>The first ideal use-case is for people who can&#8217;t use a razor.</b> Mostly that&#8217;s if you&#8217;re worried about razor bumps. If you want a closer shave than hair clippers can provide, but not the closeness of a good foil shaver, the OneBlade is nearly perfect. Its blades don&#8217;t last as long as clipper blades, but they&#8217;re not as expensive as shaver foils.</p>
<p><b>The other case it&#8217;s perfect for is maintaining stubble.</b> With the short 1mm comb in the Face + Body kit, you can keep some slightly-scruffy face fuzz at a consistent length, but still clean up around the edges easily with the bare blade. All this with one tool.</p>
<p>Some argue that the perfect stubble-beard still involved shaving close below the jawline just in case someone wants to caress or nuzzle you there, but the OneBlade does a great job at keeping up appearances.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got thick beard growth and like the look of close-cropped 3/16&#8243; of growth, but not more, the OneBlade has a set of length attachments that will help you keep it there and clean up the edges.</p>
<p>If any of these situations describe your needs for facial hair grooming and you also trim your body hair, the OneBlade is a great do-it-all purchase. The fact that you can keep your armpit blade separate from your face blade is a great benefit of the replaceable blade design.</p>
<h2 id="did-not-like">What we didn&#8217;t like about the OneBlade</h2>
<p>The consequence is that the OneBlade is also missing some qualities of both systems.</p>
<p>If you have thick hair, the blade may not have enough mass or motor power to cut well. This is more of a problem when trimming or cutting off longer hairs than when shaving. The blades are also disposable, unlike clipper blades which can be sharpened.</p>
<p><strong>If you&#8217;re looking for a smooth shave, you&#8217;re also going to be disappointed by the OneBlade.</strong> Compared to a foil-type shaver, it&#8217;s just not possible to get that close. Electric shavers often use a lift-and-cut mechanism to pull hairs into the cutting edge.</p>
<p>At the very least, shavers allow you to press the protective foil into your skin, so stubby hairs pop through holes to be trimmed off right at the base. To get this close with the OneBlade, you&#8217;d have to press the row of cutting teeth into your skin — something Philips prevents with plastic guard teeth.</p>
<p>Electric shavers are already a compromise compared to the bare blades on a manual <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-straight-razor/">straight razor</a> or <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-safety-razor/">safety razor</a>, which cut with no protective gap or guard between the blade and your skin.</p>
<h2 id="other-versions">Other versions of the OneBlade</h2>
<p>We tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078BDHV9P/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">mid-tier “Face + Body” kit</a>; it has a much better battery and more attachments than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D328DH8/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">base model</a>. For $15 more, we think that’s a great deal, but spending around $40 more on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072DTDVMC/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OneBlade – Pro</a> isn’t quite as compelling.</p>
<p>The Pro features an adjustable guide attachment with a 10mm length, which brings it up to par with the rest of the trimmers we tested for mid-length beards, but the attachment isn’t as wide or sturdy as the guides bigger trimmers like the Panasonic have.</p>
<p>The Pro doesn’t come with the spare guides or blades that you can dedicate to body-hair use, which dampens our enthusiasm for it. You can buy those separately for about $30; you can’t buy a longer guide comb for the base OneBlade.</p>
<h2 id="other-shavers">Alternatives to the OneBlade</h2>
[table id=251 /]
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a trimmer that will help you with a beard longer than 3/16&#8243;, the Panasonic or Wahl trimmers from our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-beard-trimmer/">beard trimmer review</a> will give you the length guides you need.</p>
<p>The OneBlade is also not a good pick if you need a smooth-feeling shave. Our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-safety-razor/">safety razor review</a> has great picks for close shaves: The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YJ70NY/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Feather &#8211; Popular DE safety razor</a> is a good choice if you need a closer shave than the OneBlade offers but you want to minimize irritation. An even closer shave can be had with a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-straight-razor/">straight razor</a>, though they aren&#8217;t for the faint of heart.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s the time-saving of a dry shave you want, the Panasonic and Braun shavers that won our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-electric-shaver/">electric razor review</a> are also a good way to get a smoother shave than the OneBlade can achieve.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you just need to be technically clean-shaven but you’re not worried about the prickly feeling of stubble, the OneBlade is cheaper than an electric shaver and just as easy to use. If your hair is light enough, you&#8217;ll actually look clean-shaven; it’s a much closer shave than other trimmers.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in cultivating the look of stubble, this trimmer is ideal. The included length guides will help you grow out a tiny bit more fuzz in specific areas, and the bare blade will keep your neck and cheeks looking clean.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a body hair trimmer, the OneBlade isn&#8217;t strong enough for everyone&#8217;s hair, but for most it will do a great job.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>or nine weeks, we tested seven beard trimmers on beards of all lengths. We washed the trimmers, tested battery life and compared their attachments. Ultimately, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006NXRD58/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wahl &#8211; PowerPro 9686</a> earned our pick for best beard trimmer. It’s a corded trimmer with great blades and uses clip-on attachments just like your barber&#8217;s. If you don’t mind recharging, our top cordless pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M24BKOZ/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; ER-GB370K</a>, has an adjustable comb guide that replaces a mountain of clip-on attachments.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>To track down a lineup of worthy candidates, we checked out reviews from solid publications like Wirecutter. We were disappointed with most of the info we found, most of the content from magazines and style websites seemed more like promotional info.</p>
<p>Youtube reviews of clippers wound up being some of the most solid info we found, though most of the great in-depth reviews are from a barbershop perspective, so not many gave in-depth info about attachments useful for self-trimming.</p>
<p>We filtered retailers ratings and user reviews extensively, ruling out models with poor review scores on Amazon. We looked for the most popular models from established manufacturers, and selected models that were new or recent updates if a popular brand had multiple offerings.</p>
<p>Consulting with barbers at <a href="https://www.thestatesmangrooming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Statesman in Anaheim</a> and <a href="https://www.floydsbarbershop.com/tustin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Floyd&#8217;s in Tustin</a> gave us some assurance that we were looking at solid brands and useful features.</p>
<p>We only selected one corded trimmer for review. Compact corded trimmers (which are mostly tools for barbers and stylists doing detail work) tend not to include the attachments you&#8217;d want to have for beard-keeping. You could buy a hair clipper set, like the Wahl &#8211; Super Taper with eight attachments, but those clippers are just too big to be convenient.</p>
<p>If you do need a corded trimmer with more oomph to cut through your super-hard alpha-hairs, the Wahl &#8211; 5 Star Detailer or Andis &#8211; T-Outliner are barbershop-grade trimmers with adjustable blades. They don&#8217;t come with many attachments, though, and most beards won&#8217;t require the extra power.</p>
<p>Our top cordless pick from Panasonic also has a pro-grade bigger brother: the ER-GP80 is a top-class cordless hair trimmer with a fancy linear motor. But it&#8217;ll set you back about $180, and that&#8217;s just too much for most of us to spend on a beard trimmer. Likewise for the new Bevel Trimmer, which looks great for edging and stubble but doesn&#8217;t have any attachments for maintaining beard length.</p>
<p>We also dismissed gimmicky features like vacuums and digital speed controllers. If we got those features for free in a proven product we wouldn&#8217;t turn them down, but the core features need to be the priority.</p>

[table id=153 /]
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Battery or plug-in power:</strong> Cordless trimmers are significantly more popular than their corded predecessors, and it&#8217;s easy to make a case for the convenience. How much motor speed you give up going cordless depends on the model, but all batteries will die eventually.</p>
<p><strong>Size of blade:</strong> Wider blades make for quick work and straight edges, while narrower trimmers can be easier to work with around the chin and nose.</p>
<p><strong>Waterproof operation:</strong> If you have a shower mirror, waterproof cordless trimmers are great way to avoid leaving tiny hairs all over your bathroom. They&#8217;re also easy to clean, just soap and rinse the head under running water! You might also want to apply some clipper lube when you&#8217;re done, just to keep rust at bay.</p>
<p><strong>Stands and travel cases:</strong> The most sophisticated kits in this lineup included a pouch to store accessories or a stand for convenient countertop charging, but we didn&#8217;t find any models with both. Good travel cases are pretty easy to find, charging stands not so much.</p>
<p><strong>Attachment guides:</strong> The comb-toothed attachments on a trimmer will keep it at a consistent distance from your face, which makes it easy to keep your beard at a consistent length. Which attachment works best depends on what kinds of trimming you do most, and how you like to shape your beard.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories:</strong> A few of these kits include accessories like nose hair trimmers, narrow-blade detail trimmers or even foil shavers. We think the nose hair trimmer attachments are a nice bonus, but the shavers were basically junk.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>After leading a team of testers in our nine-week <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-beard-oil/">beard oil review</a>, our &#8220;bearditor&#8221; took his six-month beard progressively down to nothing with each of these trimmers.</p>
<h3>Trimming long beards</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/longbeard.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Using a comb, freehand trimming and the longest of the included guide attachments, we tested which trimmer works best for maintenance of a beard longer than one-half inch.</p>
<p>The difficulty of freehand trimming made this the trickiest category to judge. Using a guide like the No. 8 clip-on attachments for the Wahl trimmers means you won&#8217;t have to worry as much about taking a random chunk out of your beard. But, in the era of &#8220;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/yeard/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yeards</a>&#8221; an inch barely counts as &#8220;long.&#8221; If you want to join that club and keep your beard looking neat, you&#8217;ll need to learn how to shape a beard with a comb and the bare trimmer blade.</p>
<p>We gave this test to the Wahl trimmers simply because of the versatility of these kits for shaping and blending, especially as you&#8217;re figuring out how long your mustache can get before it starts stealing your beverages.</p>
<p>The Wahl T-shaped blades were great for freehand shaping, though the wide Panasonic blade is stiff competition if you don&#8217;t need the longer attachments anyway.</p>
<h3>Trimming with a shorter attachment</h3>
<p>For short beards, a guard or comb attachment make it much easier to maintain a consistent length. All of the trimmers except the OneBlade included at least a ⅜&#8221; comb, and even this is longer than what was once considered &#8220;groomed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every attachment we tested is very capable of helping you keep your beard at a consistent length, but we noticed that most adjustable guides were only adjusting the height of the blade, with no protection from the tips.</p>
<p>Except for the Panasonic with its longer teeth, the adjustable combs won&#8217;t keep you from &#8220;dipping&#8221; the teeth into your beard as you run it over tricky areas. We also preferred the Panasonic&#8217;s wider blade for quicker twice-weekly trimming; it&#8217;s tricky to use around the nose at first, but we think it&#8217;s worth the learning curve.</p>
<p>For most beards, we also think a built-in adjustable guide makes more sense than the various clip-on guides than barbers use on their trimmers. The Andis and Wahl trimmers perform very well and are great to use, but if the attachment pops off and falls behind something when you&#8217;re travelling, your trimmer basically becomes worthless until you can replace it.</p>
<h3>Stubble maintenance</h3>
<p>Using the shortest guide combs and the bare trimmer edge, we tried to maintain perfect groomed stubble with each model.nThe ideal trimmer will allow a perfect fade from bare neck to slightly-longer stubble along the jawline, then back to a shaven finish on the upper cheeks.</p>
<p>The Philips &#8211; OneBlade was the only trimmer that got anywhere close to an all-in-one solution for this look. If you want to keep permanent five o&#8217;clock shadow, the bare trimmer shaves close enough that you can actually create some contrast with the shortest attachment. This way you can leave a little more fuzz on your face but clean up the edges with the bare trimmer blade, which helps you look &#8220;groomed but rugged&#8221; rather than lazy.</p>
<p>Other trimmers will get close enough to leave an even scruff, but you&#8217;d definitely need to clean up with a razor if you want to keep your neck and cheeks looking clean.</p>
<p>A notable performer in this test is the Andis &#8211; Slimline. The trimmer blade is designed for lining up perfect edges on barbershop fades, and you can even &#8220;zero-gap&#8221; the blade halves to get it cutting closer than the other conventional trimmers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUFb7NWuios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instruction videos</a> and plastic templates make it pretty simple, but note that a zero-gapped blade can scratch you if you&#8217;re not careful. So the OneBlade&#8217;s design still has an edge for casual users.</p>

<h3>Battery life</h3>
<p>We topped off the battery on each trimmer, then ran it until the blades stalled. Every model (except the bargain-priced Remington &#8211; PG6025) could run for longer than 90 minutes, which is plenty of battery for weekly trimmings. They were all running strong enough to cut hair reliably until the end.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058SY1XQ/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wahl-9818-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wahl-9818-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wahl-9818-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wahl-9818-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wahl-9818-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wahl-9818-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wahl-9818-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wahl-9818-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wahl-9818.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Battery: Wahl - 9818</h3><p>This trimmer kept running for an astonishing 364 minutes in our testing.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058SY1XQ/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If you&#8217;re using these in a barbershop, the extra runtime from the gigantic battery in the Wahl &#8211; 9818 is a great bonus, though we should note that it&#8217;s also the heaviest trimmer by far.</p>
<p>The Andis &#8211; Slimline Pro Li runs less than half as long as the Wahl, but that doesn&#8217;t take it out of the running: if you use a trimmer for extended periods, the handy charging stand means the overall battery life isn&#8217;t as important, and the light weight and adjustable blade will probably be worth that tradeoff.</p>

<p>The corded <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006NXRD58/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wahl &#8211; PowerPro 9686</a> stands out in this crowd because you&#8217;ll never have to worry about the battery running flat, and with two trimmer blades and the biggest set of attachments it&#8217;s a bargain.</p>
<p>We paid about $25 for this setup, and it has everything you could ask for. The detail trimmer blade even works quite well for nose hair.</p>
<p>Guide combs are most useful in beards shorter than a half-inch. Once you get past that length, things get tricky: a uniform 1 inch of chin hair usually looks kind of bulbous, so most beardsmen are going to start tapering. The longer guards in this kit might just stay in the box.</p>
<p>That said, it&#8217;s good to have options. Even if you&#8217;re just starting your journey toward a monster beard, the guides will help you learn about the grain and texture of your beard while you psych up for freehand trimming and shaping with a comb.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of this array of attachments but were hoping for something cordless, the Wahl &#8211; 9818 is just that. Beyond cutting the cord (and doubling the price) the differences between the two trimmers come down to attachments. The cordless model has a more nostril-friendly ear/nose trimmer and a (poorly-performing) tiny shaver, while this corded model has a barely-functional six-position guide that you could leave attached to its second trimmer blade.</p>
<p>Wahl also includes some &#8220;stubble guides&#8221; that protect your skin from the points of the blade while cutting closer than the 1/16&#8243; guide comb. These work well to reduce scratching, though they don&#8217;t trim nearly as close as the short settings on other models. The bare blade trims closer than the Panasonic, about the same as the Andis out of the box, but you can&#8217;t zero-gap these Wahl blades.</p>

The detail blade even works for nose hair!</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006NXRD58/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The only real drawback to this set is that there are so many pieces to keep track of, and most are only good, not great. The adjustable guide is actually pretty bad compared to other trimmers. If you need the longer clip-on attachments for blending out to a longer beard, it works. If you don&#8217;t need anything longer than a half-inch, the Panasonic is a better design that you&#8217;ll probably be happier using.</p>
<p>Wahl includes a zip-up pouch to keep all the attachments together, but let&#8217;s face it, fishing through a pocket that has eight of these combs in it isn&#8217;t actually convenient. (Note: You can put white paint on the size markers to help you read them.)</p>
<p>If you want a corded trimmer with more oomph, the Wahl &#8211; 5 Star Detailer or Andis &#8211; T-Outliner are barbershop-grade trimmers with adjustable blades. They don&#8217;t come with many attachments, though, and most beards won&#8217;t require the extra power. The Wahl &#8211; Peanut is another popular offering, again with few attachments, we also like the rocker power switch better than the slide switch on the Peanut.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Wahl &#8211; PowerPro is a great trimmer with a full set of attachments and a five-year warranty.</li>
<li>It isn&#8217;t cordless, and it isn&#8217;t waterproof, but you&#8217;ll never have to worry about an aging battery.</li>
<li>Includes 12 guide combs, everything from long stubble up to a full inch.</li>
<li>This wide T-blade makes detailing edges a little easier.</li>
<li>The accessory detail trimmer is a nice touch, though many won&#8217;t ever use it.</li>

<p>This was a tough pick. Each trimmer we tested has a strength (and a weakness) for particular applications, but the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M24BKOZ/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; ER-GB370K</a> rose to the top of the cordless ranks. Panasonic&#8217;s great features make this easier to use than most other trimmers, and both the motor and blade are top-class.</p>
<p>The Panasonic is versatile enough to do nearly everything, from stubble to shaping full beards, with just its one built-in attachment. This adjustable comb doesn&#8217;t go at long as some of the fixed-length clip-on attachments for other trimmers, but for beards less than 1/2&#8243; (where a length guide is most useful) we love that this wide, sturdy guide won&#8217;t pop off in use or get lost in a drawer.</p>
<p>The teeth on this guide attachment are a little longer in the front than on the other adjustables, so it&#8217;s tricky to go straight up under your nose for a close-trimmed mustache. But they help maintain a consistent length better on the rest of your face, and that&#8217;s what the guide is for anyway.</p>

<p>The Panasonic&#8217;s battery isn&#8217;t as long-lasting as some other trimmers, but the wall-mount charger is convenient and avoids the tangle of cords you usually face with a charger. The two pieces are a lot easier to keep in a drawer between trims than most other models.</p>
<p>Panasonic has one big advantage over the Wahl &#8211; 9818, and that&#8217;s a waterproof design. You can wash the trimmer without taking it apart, and also use it in the shower. The Philips &#8211; 5210 is also waterproof, but we like the wider blade and the closer-cut stubble on the Panasonic.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Panasonic&#8217;s GB370K is cordless, waterproof and doesn&#8217;t burden you with accessories to keep track of.</li>
<li>A strong, but quiet motor makes this easier to live with.</li>
<li>This versatile guide comb adjusts from stubble to bushy in precise steps.</li>
<li>If you remove the comb, this wide blade cuts closer than most other trimmers.</li>
<li>The battery life is short, but the price is also low.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078BDHV9P/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; OneBlade Face + Body</a> has a unique blade design, one of the only successful new designs since motorized hair clippers were invented. It&#8217;s also nearly perfect for keeping a short beard or stubble looking neat.</p>
<p>Rather than just making a row of v-shaped shears sliding against each other, Philips took the one-dimensional concept and made a trimmer that cuts on both edges.</p>
<p>These are also much thinner blades than most clippers, so you can cut very close to the skin without risking scratches from the tips of the blade. This means that you get real contrast between areas you want to look clean and areas where you want to leave some scruff.</p>
<p>The following guide comb attachments are included, along with three blades:</p>
<ul>
<li>3/64&#8243; (1mm)</li>
<li>5/64&#8243; (2mm)</li>
<li>1/8&#8243; (3mm, #1 hair clipper guide equivalent)</li>
<li>3/16&#8243; (5mm, shorter than a #2 equivalent)</li>
<li>A separate 1/8&#8243; comb for body hair use</li>
<li>An &#8220;edge guard&#8221; for shaving delicate skin</li>
</ul>
<p>This is halfway between the other trimmers and the real electric shavers we tested. That&#8217;s going to seem a bit silly for some people, since it&#8217;s not doing either job all the way: You won&#8217;t get smooth shaves, and the short guide combs won&#8217;t help in longer beards. But, if you&#8217;ve got a shorter beard or if you just want to keep your stubble looking neat, it&#8217;s a pretty perfect tool.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078BDHV9P/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-beard-trimmer-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-beard-trimmer-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-beard-trimmer-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-beard-trimmer-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-beard-trimmer-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-beard-trimmer-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-beard-trimmer-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-beard-trimmer-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-beard-trimmer.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best for Stubble: Philips - OneBlade Face + Body</h3><p>This hybrid shaver-trimmer is exceptionally good at trimming stubble, and includes great accessories that make it a multi-task purchase.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078BDHV9P/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>This wouldn&#8217;t be our first pick for freehand shaping longer beards, but the blades are quite capable even in that role. Most guys who aspire to full-length beards aren&#8217;t going to be using the bare blade for lining up edges anymore, but if you do it&#8217;s a versatile tool.</p>
<h3>Also a great body hair trimmer</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for one device that can manage all of your grooming, this has you covered below the neck, too. If your back hair is out of control, our other <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-body-hair-trimmer/">body hair trimmer picks</a> are still better at helping you reach, but for everything else the Philips &#8211; OneBlade is a pretty compelling pick.</p>
<p>Is it gross to say that you can use a beard trimmer as a body hair trimmer? Yes, but in this case Philips has kind of cheated. The package comes with three completely separate blade assemblies that you can dedicate to whatever funky fate you choose.</p>
<p>You even get a specific comb attachment for body hair that will help you keep your blades from getting mixed up. This is also by far the easiest trimmer to wash thoroughly, so you won&#8217;t need to worry about contaminating your Dopp kit.</p>
<p>The &#8220;edge guard&#8221; works pretty well for keeping delicate skin out of the blades, but the foil shaver on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0037HP9OA/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Bodygroom</a> is still the safest pick for getting right to the skin in sensitive places.</p>
<h3>What about upgrade options?</h3>
<p>We tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078BDHV9P//?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">mid-tier &#8220;Face + Body&#8221; kit</a>; it has a slightly bigger battery and more attachments than the base kit. For $15 more, we think that&#8217;s a great deal, but spending around $40 more on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072DTDVMC/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OneBlade &#8211; Pro</a> isn&#8217;t quite as compelling.</p>
<p>The Pro features an adjustable guide attachment with a 10mm length, which brings it up to par with the rest of the trimmers we tested for mid-length beards, but the attachment isn&#8217;t as wide or sturdy as the guides bigger trimmers like the Panasonic have.</p>
<p>The Pro doesn&#8217;t come with the spare guides or blades that you can dedicate to body-hair use, which dampens our enthusiasm for it. You can buy those separately for about $30; you can&#8217;t buy a longer guide comb for the base OneBlade.</p>
<h3>How well does it shave, though?</h3>
<p>Our tester used these beard trimmers at the same time as early testing for our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-electric-shaver/">electric shaver guide</a>, using the shavers on neck and cheeks with the beard trimmers to maintain a goatee. We tried the OneBlade in this role, and it&#8217;s not the same class of shave as any of our top picks. If you&#8217;ve got anyone inspecting how close you shave, (be that a domestic partner or a Sergeant), this won&#8217;t do the job.</p>
<p>If you just need to be technically clean-shaven, but you&#8217;re not worried about the prickly feeling of stubble, the OneBlade is cheaper and just as easy to use as an electric shaver. If your hair is light enough, you might even fool people; it&#8217;s a good deal closer than any of the other trimmers.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The OneBlade Face + Body works very well for shaving down to a clean-but-prickly shadow.</li>
<li>This kit includes comb attachments up to three sixteenths of an inch to maintain a shorter beard or mustache.</li>
<li>Philips included the longest-lived battery among the waterproof trimmers.</li>
<li>Also a great body hair trimmer, this model comes with a spare blade and comb just for that purpose.</li>

<h3>Wahl &#8211; 9818</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058SY1XQ/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wahl &#8211; 9818</a> is basically a cordless version of the PowerPro trimmer we picked for long beards. The cost is double, but it has the longest battery life on any cordless trimmer we tested.</p>
<p>Battery life isn&#8217;t the only factor to consider when you&#8217;re buying a cordless tool, but it&#8217;s nice to see these kinds of specs. We were happy that we could even get inside to see what kind of battery it is (an off-the-shelf 1000mAh 14650-size cell soldered to the control board).</p>
<p>The battery and heavy steel body are the only parts that got a real upgrade, though. More critical features, like the guide attachment design, are identical to every other cheap Wahl trimmer. OK, not amazing.</p>

<p>That said, if you want to maintain a 3/4&#8243; longer beard at a set length, Wahl&#8217;s clip-on attachments are basically your only option.</p>
<p>For this more expensive cordless trimmer, our standards are a bit higher, and we&#8217;re disappointed that Wahl still uses these flimsy attachments. They&#8217;ll pop off if you put a lot of pressure on them, and you have to squint to read the size markings.</p>
<p>Waterproofing is also a missing feature that would make this a much better cordless trimmer. No, it&#8217;s not a must-have feature, but most of us don&#8217;t have a giant can of clipper spray always at the ready. A waterproof design would make use and cleaning much easier.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to put up with the fussy cleaning requirements of a pro-style clipper, we&#8217;d like to see some pro-grade design considerations, too. Wahl uses a cheap, spring-tensioned blade assembly here, not an adjustable blade like the Andis &#8211; Slimline Pro.</p>
<p>Wahl sets these to trim pretty close, so most people aren&#8217;t going to miss out on gap adjustment, but it&#8217;s another win for the Andis trimmer if you&#8217;re looking for a line-up trimmer.</p>
<p>Wahl still has a more versatile kit than any other trimmer, but most users would trade half of the attachments for some missing features. The build feels solid, but that&#8217;s entirely because of the stainless body tube; the internal components are just as cheap as any of the other trimmers. (A point borne out by the spotty reliability record in the Amazon reviews.)</p>
<h3>Andis &#8211; Slimline Pro Li</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01499YQP2/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Andis &#8211; Slimline Pro Li</a> is a small, light, versatile tool that finds its way onto many barbershop and stylist workstations. It&#8217;s missing some features that would make it an easy top pick, but for some people it might still be the right tool.</p>
<p>The Slimline is at its best without a guide comb. That&#8217;s how most barbers use it, and the few guides that are included makes it clear that Andis knows this. Barbers also complain about these attachments, just like the Wahl attachments.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t need the #4-#8 attachments that the Wahl has, there are a few things this trimmer has going for it. It&#8217;s slimmer and lighter, so it&#8217;ll be easier to pack for travel even if you don&#8217;t have to hold it up all day. The blade is also adjustable to &#8220;hit&#8221; a zero-gap line, so you can get right down to the skin if you want to. (Be careful, and check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019WSCKL2/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">templates that can help you</a> line up the edge.)</p>
<p>If it weren&#8217;t for the OneBlade, then, this might be our pick for trimming close-cropped and precisely-lined beards. With that option on the table, though, the only reason to go for the non-waterproof and more-expensive Slimline is if you find that the OneBlade blades won&#8217;t cut your hair well.</p>
<h3>Philips &#8211; 5210</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017YNUH9E/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Philips Norelco &#8211; 5210</a> is another very close contender for our top cordless pick. The battery runs just a hair longer than the Panasonic&#8217;s, and the adjustable guide combs it comes with will cover beard growth that&#8217;s just a bit longer, too, out to a #4 equivalent with the two longer attachments.</p>
<p>We like the design of these guides for close-cropped beards, and in those conditions we think this is going to be a better choice than the Panasonic, since the long &#8220;teeth&#8221; on Panasonic&#8217;s guide aren&#8217;t really needed.</p>
<p>That said, the 5210 has a stubble-length adjustable guide that&#8217;s deceptive: adjustment marking indicate that you can go from 0.4 mm to 0.8 before you get to the 1mm height setting, but in real-world conditions these settings are no different from taking the attachment off. You won&#8217;t get any contrast from different stubble lengths using these shortest settings.</p>
<p>The OneBlade is a more versatile system for short beards, and it has a much longer battery life and better design overall if that&#8217;s the kind of job you need to do. For beards longer than a #3 guide comb, the Panasonic takes over as a more capable trimmer, with a wide blade and one do-it-all attachment for Philips&#8217;s 3.</p>
<h3>Remington &#8211; PG6025</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H2B4H2M/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Remington &#8211; PG6025</a> is the multi-use pick from our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-body-hair-trimmer/#grooming">body hair trimmer</a> review, and it&#8217;s still a good trimmer for $20. The nose hair trimmer attachment is as good as Wahl&#8217;s, though for $5 more Wahl has a much more complete beard trimming package.</p>
<p>Remington&#8217;s budget-priced trimmer had the weakest battery of our lineup, and it&#8217;s not waterproof. The included shaving foil isn&#8217;t really worth using, maybe it&#8217;d be OK on your legs or for other areas that are less sensitive than your face.</p>
<p>The adjustable guide Remington uses is decent enough to work. Remington calls their three snap-on guides &#8220;beard and stubble combs&#8221; and the 8-step adjustable a &#8220;hair&#8221; comb. You&#8217;ll be fine whichever attachment you pick for beard trimming, but none of them are especially good.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Picking the best beard trimmer is a bit like picking the best beard: Every man is going to have different preferences. We narrowed down three picks that will excel in three different beard lengths, and we think that&#8217;s the best way to approach this decision.</p>
<p>For average-length beards on average guys, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M24BKOZ/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; ER-GB370K</a> has everything you need and nothing you don&#8217;t. It trims close enough for clean edges, but it also has a versatile guide comb that works very well in mid-length beards. The plug-in charging stand is also a nifty way to cut down on bathroom clutter.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter two months of testing eight different designs, we&#8217;ve picked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FYVOJC/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; ER430K</a> as the best nose hair trimmer. This is a refined improvement of the classic trimmer design, with a better blade and a vacuum to keep crusty clippings off your shirt. The ER430K is fully waterproof, so it&#8217;s easy to clean and keeps batteries dry. Our runner-up <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTS51NI/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; NT1500</a> proved it’s a better detail trimmer than it is a nose hair trimmer.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>The Wahl 5545 included in this review has been owned and used by our tester for about 10 years and represents a baseline for standard designs. There&#8217;s nothing specifically wrong with it, but we looked at the range of other models on the market to see if we could find improvements in design and function.</p>
<p>Finding credible information to narrow down our selections was tricky. Magazine-style features like <a href="https://www.askmen.com/entertainment/guy_gear/best-nose-hair-trimmers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one from AskMen</a> didn&#8217;t describe anything specific about the performance or cutting ability of the different trimmers they recommend and seemed mostly to focus on claims rather than results.</p>
<p>The relevant subreddits yielded more credible answers about what works and some recommendations. Manual trimmers seemed popular among /r/buyit4life Redditors, so we included the two most popular designs.</p>
<p>We looked for niche blogs that might give more insight into what makes or breaks a trimmer, but again we found no evidence of side-by-side testing in popular reviews.</p>
<p>Amazon and other retailers ratings/user reviews were probably the most useful source of info, with some solid (if anecdotal) evidence of models that were great. As always, we filtered for an average score of 4.0 or better and looked for leading designs that had consistently good reviews.</p>
<p>Nose hair trimmers use cheap components and very basic designs, so we&#8217;re not surprised to see that even the most highly-regarded designs seem to have some units leave the factory with parts that don&#8217;t work or break quickly. A 10-percent failure rate seems to be about average for the most popular models. There was no apparent alternative in compact trimmers with better longevity, at any price.</p>
<p>The vast majority of trimmers use a &#8220;nose cone&#8221; cutter guard, so we tried hard to find representative models that used other shapes or designs. We picked three trimmers with other cutter designs to see if any differences showed up in testing.</p>

<h2>Should you trim or pluck?</h2>
<p>Some popular misconceptions come up frequently when people discuss managing nose hair. For example, many will rightly point out that plucked hairs take longer to grow back than hairs trimmed to a length just inside the nose. Plucking is pretty easy with a pair of the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-tweezers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best tweezers</a>, and that means it&#8217;s better all around, right?</p>
<p>Maybe not. There are a lot of legends and scary stories that you&#8217;ll hear about nose-hair-plucking. Our tester grew up hearing stories from his grandpa about someone who died after plucking a hair that went all the way up into his brain, a story that&#8217;s almost certainly not accurate. We spent some time sorting fact from fiction and getting the details about why you might not want to do it.</p>
<p>Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a real thing, and it&#8217;s really bad, but that doesn&#8217;t mean plucking a nose hair will kill you. Basically, plucking a nose hair leaves the inside of your nose with an unprotected wound that could get infected. An infection so close to your brain <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-plucking-nose-hairs-can-cause-lethal-infections-2016-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is definitely something you want to avoid</a>.</p>
<p>A trimmer that reaches all the way to the base of a nose hair may sound like a great idea, but remember that your nose hairs do serve a useful purpose guarding against stuff that could cause those serious infections. Aggressive trimming won&#8217;t leave a hole, but it still means you&#8217;re not getting the protection the hairs are supposed to provide. Careful trimming of just the ends of the hairs means you&#8217;ve still got hair where you need it, but not peeking out at your date.</p>
<p>Also, remember that trimming your hair cannot cause its rate of growth to change: Using a nose hair trimmer will not make your hairs come back quicker or thicker. The rate of growth varies, but on average it should take about six months to grow an inch. Plucked hair takes far longer to grow back (since you&#8217;ve removed the follicle and it&#8217;ll take time to grow a new one), but just because trimmed hair grows back in a few weeks doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s growing more quickly or in a different shape.</p>
<p>These trimmers are for more than just noses, though. Trimmers are sometimes said to be better for eyebrows than tweezers, though if you&#8217;ve got especially bushy brows then you might appreciate the opportunity to thin them out. We have a bunch of <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-tweezers/#hair-removal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommendations for hair removal tweezers</a>, and it&#8217;s probably worth owning both types of tool.</p>

<strong>Trimmer type:</strong> There is no detailed taxonomy of names for trimmer types that we could find, but you&#8217;ll probably recognize most of the cutting elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rotary nose-cone trimmers</strong> use a spinning blade inside an outer guard blade. It can&#8217;t trim especially close, but it keeps your nose safe from cuts. This is by far the most popular design.</li>
<li><strong>Reciprocating clippers</strong> are like tiny hair clippers with a combed blade moving back and forth against a guard blade. Unlike some hair clippers, these are specifically designed so they can&#8217;t cut you, though they can still tickle.</li>
<li><strong>The Philips Nosetrimmer uses</strong> the only really unique cutter design, with a tiny blade moving back and forth inside a hollow foil like a micro-shaver. Despite the unfortunate name, we&#8217;re happy to report that these blades do not trim the flesh of your nose.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Multipurpose systems:</strong> We tested a few models that came with attachments, but the tiny motors in these trimmers aren&#8217;t good for much more than cutting a few hairs at a time.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a device that does more than just trim nose hairs, you&#8217;re definitely better off making the more demanding task a priority. We <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-beard-trimmer/">reviewed beard trimmers</a> and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-body-hair-trimmer/#grooming">body hair trimmers</a> with attachments suitable for nose hair, and they all work just as well as (if not better than) AA-battery-powered trimmers.</p>
<p><strong>Waterproof design:</strong> No, this isn&#8217;t to protect the trimmer from your nose, it&#8217;s to help with cleaning. All the nose hair trimmers we found were designed to be washed out, but some were completely sealed, so water won&#8217;t even get into the battery compartment. This isn&#8217;t a big functional difference for trimming, but keeping water out of the electrical connections will help ensure a long life.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Batterytest.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<h3>Battery life</h3>
<p>We put fresh Ikea &#8211; Alkalisk AA alkaline batteries in each of these and let them run until they stopped cutting hair.</p>
<p><strong>We want to point out that this isn&#8217;t an absolute virtue: a longer battery life may also indicate a weaker motor.</strong> In the case of the Panasonic, it seems clear that vacuuming up hair clippings has a cost in battery life.</p>
<p>The overall winner for battery life was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002UM5LNW/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair &#8211; NE150R</a>, with a reciprocating blade that trims very efficiently despite its tiny motor. Even when the battery voltage drops too low to spin up the Panasonic, this trimmer will keep on cutting. That said, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTS51NI/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; NT1500</a> was only 10 minutes short of the Conair&#8217;s time, so the waterproof design earned a runner-up pick.</p>
<p>These (and most other) alkaline cells we used give about 1186 mAH with a draw comparable to the Panasonic&#8217;s bigger motor, so you could improve runtime by switching to better battery chemistry like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZV9WTM/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon Basics NiMH AA</a>.</p>
<h3>Easy cutting and comfort test</h3>
<p>Our tester used these trimmers on every nose, eyebrow and ear hair he could find for two months, and supplemented with chest, leg and armpit hair for additional testing. (Leg hair actually hurt the most!)</p>
<p>The electric trimmers all did a good job cutting hair we pushed into the blades, but when it came to actual cutting inside the nostril some designs worked better than others.</p>
<p>The biggest difference we saw among rotary-type blades was inside vs. top cutting blades. Panasonic has developed a blade for their trimmers that cuts on the end as well as the sides, and the ToiletTree trimmer is a very similar design. This allowed for quicker and easier cutting in every task, without giving up the safety and simplicity of the &#8220;nose-cone&#8221; guard blade.</p>
<p>The manual trimmers from Kedsum and Groom Mate were the only designs that caused &#8220;pulling&#8221; in use. The blades sometimes failed to cut hairs cleanly, pulling on the hair instead of removing the trimmed end. We tested with a variety of hair types and tried to ensure we were holding the trimmer still while spinning the blade, but the careful practice didn&#8217;t change the frequency of painful results. You can get OK results with these manual trimmers, but even scissors would be better.</p>
<h3>Thick hair test</h3>
<p>Using thick hair and peanut butter, we tried to bog down these trimmers to the point where they wouldn&#8217;t cut anymore. While some trimmers had more difficulty connecting their cutting elements with the thick and sticky hair, all the powered trimmers were still able to cut.</p>
<h3>Cleaning test</h3>
<p>After running each of the trimmers through hair and peanut butter to get them good and gummy, we tried cleaning each with soap and water, then disassembling to see how clean they really were.</p>
<p>While cleaning, we also put dry tissue paper in the battery compartment and immersed the trimmers in the sink to see how waterproof they actually are. All the units advertised as waterproof actually were, using an O-ring seal around the battery compartment cap to keep water away from the battery terminals.</p>
<h2 id="top-pick">Top pick: Panasonic &#8211; ER430K</h2>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FYVOJC/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; ER430K</a> is a more complicated nose hair trimmer than most. Not satisfied to simply trim your nose hair, it also uses a tiny vacuum to collect the hairs in a little trap for later disposal.</p>
<p>If this trimmer weren&#8217;t great at doing what it says on the box, we wouldn&#8217;t recommend it specifically because of the vacuum. Fortunately, this is one of the best trimmers we tried, and the price is right in the middle of the range. The vacuum, then, is a nice bonus.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re cleaning this trimmer, it takes less work to clean out gunk because of the flow-through design that allows the vacuum to grab hairs. The manual says to clean the trimmer with the motor off, but if you do run it while submerged it&#8217;ll scrub the blades really well with a fast-flowing stream of water drawn through by the vacuum system. The instruction left us uncertain about whether this is intended, but the vacuum-free ERGN30K model lists this as a feature called &#8220;vortex cleaning.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t care about the vacuum feature and want to save $5, the ERGN30K uses the same great blade and should be just as easy to clean. Panasonic lists the same 90-minute runtime for the cheaper model that we got with the vacuum-powered ER430K, but they might just be giving a conservative estimate. The vacuum feature is handy enough that we think the ER430K is worth an extra $5, and it also comes with a cap and zippered case to keep it clean.</p>

<p>As mentioned in our testing section, you should see much better run-times with this powerful little motor if you switch to high-capacity nickel metal hydride batteries like these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZV9WTM/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon Basics</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MXCIK32/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eneloop Pro</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000WDSFPM/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ansmann</a> cells. You&#8217;d see an increase with other trimmers, too, but the 90-minute runtime on an alkaline indicates that the Panasonic is pulling just less than 1 ampere of power. This is compared to around 0.3 amps for the others, which means Panasonic will gain more runtime from better battery chemistry.</p>
<h3>The competition</h3>

The real competition for Panasonic&#8217;s trimmer is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E4PMQAO/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ToiletTree</a> trimmer. Some of these are more expensive, some are a bit cheaper, but unless you&#8217;re buying from eBay or Aliexpress you&#8217;re not saving any money by going for lesser-known brands.</p>
<p>As you can see from the image above, the ToiletTree trimmer (with the white post) uses a very similar cutter to Panasonic&#8217;s, so it has similar advantages. It&#8217;s hard to say if the Panasonic was working better for us because of a stronger motor or just because of the vacuum drawing hair into the blades, but it did seem to snip hairs a little bit more readily. The biggest difference between the two is definitely the noise of the vacuum, though we think it&#8217;s a worthwhile trade-off. (And, as we&#8217;ve said, if you don&#8217;t want that feature the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0049LUI9O/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">no-vacuum ERGN30K model</a> is one of the least expensive trimmers we found.)</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A refined blade design helps the Panasonic &#8211; ER430K cut better and at nearly any angle.</li>
<li>The vacuum actually works and helps keep those bits of crusty hair off your shirt.</li>
<li>The strong motor and vacuum feature come at a cost: runtime is only 96 minutes on alkaline AA cells.</li>
<li>Panasonic put a lot of work into making this waterproof and easy to clean.</li>

If the traditional nose-cone design doesn&#8217;t appeal to you, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTS51NI/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; NT1500</a> is definitely worth checking out. This trimmer uses a blade that&#8217;s something like a cross between an electric shaver and a clipper, and it works very well.</p>
<p>On many metrics this trimmer is superior to the Panasonic: it&#8217;s cheaper, it runs four times longer on a battery and it&#8217;s almost just as easy to clean. But for easy trimming of nose hair, the usefulness lags behind Panasonic&#8217;s evolved form of the old standby.</p>

A waterproof design sets this apart from other contenders, but the Panasonic is better inside your nostrils. Easy to clean and long-running, the price is right for a variety of clean-up jobs.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTS51NI/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>You&#8217;ll spend more time fishing around in your nostril with Philips&#8217;s design trying to connect the cutter and that one pesky hair. If you want to keep a decent amount of hair inside your nostril to help you avoid breathing in dust, this design isn&#8217;t very helpful.</p>
<p>For trimming other stray hairs on your face, though, this is a great design. Eyebrow trimming with the included comb attachment works well, and it&#8217;s easy to run over the back of your ear to grab hairs you didn&#8217;t even know about.</p>
<p>The Philips trimmer even does an OK job with sideburns and mustache edges, though it&#8217;s not a replacement for a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-beard-trimmer/">beard trimmer</a>. It won&#8217;t get especially close, either, so if you were relying on this to form sideburns you&#8217;d definitely want to do so before you shave. On the plus side, this design won&#8217;t pull or pinch or even tickle the way some other trimmer blades can.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Philips &#8211; NT1500 is a less-conventional trimmer shape that still works very well for cutting nose hair.</li>
<li>For ear and eyebrow hair, this trimmer is just a bit easier to use.</li>
<li>This trimmer runs longer than any of the other waterproof designs, 373 minutes on an alkaline AA.</li>
<li>The price is right: this is also the least expensive waterproof trimmer we found.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conair &#8211; NE150R</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002UM5LNW/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair &#8211; NE150R</a> uses a blade design that might be most familiar. Basically a tiny five-segment hair clipper, it&#8217;s dialed in to cut efficiently. If you were always certain exactly where your stray hairs are, this design would be ideal. Most people are going to want something they can quickly run around the inside of their nostril, though, and the NE150R doesn&#8217;t do this quite as well as the traditional nose-cone design.</p>
<p>In most other respects, though, this is an excellent trimmer. The blade design is simple and very easy to clean, though sadly the motor and battery compartment aren&#8217;t waterproof. This was the most affordable trimmer we tested, from a name that&#8217;s as old as any in grooming products. The alkaline battery runtime for this trimmer was even a little bit longer than the Philips.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re at all ticklish, the way these blades move back and forth next to your skin might be slightly unnerving. We don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a problem, necessarily, but since the competition can cut without tickling your nose as much, Conair loses a few places in the ranking.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t care about waterproofing and you can always see exactly what hairs you need to cut, this would be a great pick. For the rest of us, it&#8217;s just not quite as good as the Panasonic.</p>
<h3>ToiletTree</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E4PMQAO/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ToiletTree</a> may or may not be the company that designed this trimmer, but it&#8217;s one of the best-selling models out there. The ToiletTree brand came up frequently in consumer mentions in our research, and they&#8217;re now stocked at CVS stores. There are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y5CJG3Z/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">other trimmers that appear to be identical</a>, but this one is easy to find.</p>
<p>On the plus side, this trimmer is quieter than the vacuum on the Panasonic and uses a similar blade design that trims on the end of the cone as well as the sides. It works almost just as well as the Panasonic, and it will run for almost three times longer on a AA battery.</p>
<p>That said, the ToiletTree costs a few dollars more than the Panasonic, and it&#8217;s not quite as powerful or easy to clean. If battery life were a more important consideration this might rank higher. Someday we may see USB-rechargeable designs that make sense, but at this point, you&#8217;re still going to need to keep batteries around. Even a two-fold increase in battery life isn&#8217;t going to change the way you feel about a trimmer.</p>
<p>The LED light is also a bit silly  — even a poorly-lit bathroom doesn&#8217;t really benefit from the amount of light that this puts out. In comparison, the vacuum on the Panasonic trimmer might actually save you from some embarrassment or help keep your bathroom clean.</p>
<h3>Wahl &#8211; 5545</h3>
<p>Everyone who has seen or owned a nose hair trimmer probably knows what they need to know about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002FS4VJQ/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wahl &#8211; 5545</a>. This is a bare-bones rotary trimmer: the rotating blades chop off anything that comes into the nose-cone as they run along the inside.</p>
<p>Compared to our top pick, this design is lacking in a few ways. The blades are only cutting on the sides, compared to the Panasonic design that snips off at the top as well. The motor seems noticeably stronger on the Panasonic, which does have a tradeoff in battery life.</p>
<p>The Wahl doesn&#8217;t have waterproofing, either, which doesn&#8217;t stop you from rinsing the blade under your tap, but after using designs that you can drop in the sink it&#8217;s a definite regression.</p>
<p>We were also surprised that this trimmer isn&#8217;t more affordable. Panasonic has a number of bare-bones designs that are cheaper, and even the waterproof Philips model we picked as our runner up was a few dollars less.</p>
<p>Wahl uses basically this same blade design as an attachment on their cordless 9818 Beard trimmer, and as a free accessory in that package, it&#8217;s good to go. As a stand-alone design, though, it&#8217;s just not compelling.</p>
<h3>Conair &#8211; PG 1000</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074R3G45B/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair &#8211; PG 1000</a> looks like a compelling alternative to the old Wahl design and the new Panasonic design for nose hair cutter shapes. The rotary trimmer is shaped in a cone, with blades that seem designed to trim an even length at the opening of your nostril.</p>
<p>In practice, though, this trimmer has two problems. First, hair that enters the trimmer from the middle of the blade cone rather than the side is actually prevented from moving out to the cutting path. Second, you can&#8217;t remove the cutting blade from this trimmer for cleaning.</p>
<p>We had hoped that this would be competitive with the Panasonic, but it was actually one of the least-effective trimmers we used. It works, but basically any other blade design will trim hair more quickly and easily.</p>
<h3>Not recommended: Kedsum and Groom Mate</h3>

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ID2D1B6/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kedsum</a> is one of many brands selling this scissor-action rotary trimmer, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BPPF5Z4/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Groom Mate &#8211; Platinum XL</a> is a similar rotary cutter that requires two hands to use. These blades cut in a very similar way to the standby rotary electric blade in the Wahl, but with some interesting differences that make them less useful.</p>
<p>On both trimmers, hairs need to slip down into the side of the cutter to be snipped off; on really long hair it works, but if you&#8217;re just doing a precautionary clean-up pass you could easily miss hairs that aren&#8217;t lying in the right direction.</p>
<p>When cutting nose hair, this was mostly a pain-free experience. At times, though, hair was pinched and pulled by the cutting motion. Ouch. It&#8217;s hard to say exactly what the problem is, and it&#8217;s worse when we try it on eyebrow or arm hair than inside the nostril, but since these aren&#8217;t very efficient trimmers to begin with it&#8217;s just not worth the potential pain.</p>
<p>If we had to pick a battery-free way to trim nose hair, we&#8217;d go with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000127IP2/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">these high-end scissors from Rubis</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cocos-Closet-Safety-Hair-Scissors/dp/B01BRV4Q00/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this more affordable option</a> instead.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for your first nose hair trimmer, enjoy your youth while it lasts. If you&#8217;re like those of us who are looking for a trimmer to replace something you&#8217;ve had for a few years that has already died, we have some picks that will hopefully impress.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FYVOJC/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; ER430K</a> is a nearly perfect nose hair trimmer with a powerful motor and blades that cut any hairs at every angle. If you&#8217;re trimming on the way out the door, the vacuum feature also keeps crusty hairs off your shirt. This is a waterproof trimmer that&#8217;s easy to wash and maintain, and the price is right.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like something that&#8217;s a little more versatile and doesn&#8217;t eat through batteries as quickly as Panasonic&#8217;s rotary trimmer, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTS51NI/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; NT1500</a> is cost-effective and quite good at trimming hairs. The Philips is better on ears and eyebrows than inside the nostril, but it&#8217;ll run four times longer than the Panasonic on a AA battery and it&#8217;s still waterproof.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After nine weeks testing ten of the best electric shavers side by side, our team thinks the Panasonic - Arc3 gives the closest shave. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter nine weeks testing ten designs side by side, we picked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013AX8A3M/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; Arc3</a> as best electric razor. With blades that cut close and a motor that doesn&#8217;t let you down in tough stubble, this shaver is also a great value. If your follicles and skin are especially sensitive, we recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MPX171W/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Braun &#8211; Series 7</a> razor. It gets almost as close as the Arc3, but with a gentler touch.</p>

<p>After reading reviews from shaver-centric blogs like Shavercheck, Pauper&#8217;s Dime and Getarazor.com, along with reviews from Wirecutter and Consumer Reports, it became clear that there are three brands to beat and not many competitors. The three brands that almost always come up are: Braun, Panasonic and Philips.</p>
<p>Braun is the most popular electric on Amazon, and their cleaning stand is iconic. Wirecutter loves them, but has only tested older models, while Ovidiu Nicolae at Shavercheck gives a comparison of up-to-date Braun and Panasonic models. We looked closely at both lines and picked out the newest models for close comparison.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen mixed reviews for rotary-type foils, but Pauper&#8217;s Dime (a website focused on smart spending) is the token enthusiast, lauding the easy cleaning and quiet performance of the Philips rotary shavers. We bought Philips models that represent the newest designs Philips has to offer in both a value-priced and luxury-class shaver.</p>
<p>We tried to find alternatives to the big three, and we didn&#8217;t see much that was encouraging. Skipping no-name shavers that seemed too much of a gamble, we found two more models to calibrate our test experiences. The first is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071YSDPKC/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Andis &#8211; Profoil</a>. It’s the shaver of choice for barbers cleaning up fades, and we wanted to see how it fares in a lineup of complex waterproof razors.</p>
<p>Remington is the other notable name in electric razors. We picked their new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WD7PT1S/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PF-7600</a> as a model that&#8217;s price-comparable to the entry-level models from the other brands.</p>
<p>We looked at &#8220;travel&#8221; razors, but so far as we can tell the only reason to buy them is if you absolutely cannot plug in your charger for a month. Even the power-hungry Panasonic Arc5 should give you at least two weeks of shaving on a charge, and the power adapters for our winners are dual-voltage for international compatibility with a simple plug adapter.</p>
<h2 id="best-for-women">What about electric shavers for women?</h2>
<p>We set out specifically to find the best electric razor for men, and our testers were men shaving their faces. Leg hair is not as curly as facial hair, which is good news for ladies. In other words, any of these shavers should work even better on legs than they did on our faces. The fact that newer shavers are almost all waterproof is also a boon if you&#8217;re used to shaving your legs in the shower.</p>
<p>Shavers for men tend to be more expensive than those aimed at women, though, and the pop-up trimmers and accessories are designed for different jobs. We hope this information about brands, features and designs will help guide your purchase, whatever type of shaver you&#8217;re looking for.</p>

<h2 id="why-electric">Why should you use an electric razor?</h2>
<p>The debate about the best ways to shave has raged for at least 100 years. To get some perspective on the debate, we locked a die-hard wet shaving enthusiast and a committed electric user in a room. After the dust settled they agreed on a few clear wins and trade-offs for the electric razor:</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> An electric razor can mow down stubble quickly and efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>Convenience:</strong> If you dry-shave, you don&#8217;t need any accessories for shaving at work, the gym or even in the car.</li>
<li><strong>No nicks:</strong> Let&#8217;s face it, the worst part about a blade shave is figuring out what to do when you nick yourself in a rush to get out the door.</li>
<li><strong>Sensitive skin:</strong> If you get rashes, bumps and irritation from a blade-shave, an electric shaver will probably be gentler (especially now that shavers can work with <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-shaving-cream/">cream</a> for easier gliding across your skin).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One o’clock shadow:</strong> An electric razor is never going to shave as close as a good disposable cartridge razor, let alone a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-safety-razor/" rel="noopener">double-edge</a> or <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-straight-razor/" rel="noopener">straight razor</a> shave.</li>
<li><strong>Expense:</strong> The initial purchase cost is high; and plan on annual replacement blades, then eventual battery death just like your cell phone.</li>
<li><strong>Bumps:</strong> if you can manage an extra-close shave, the bumps from an electric might actually be worse than from a blade. Careful adjustment of your shave should help, but electrics aren&#8217;t a cure-all.</li>
<li><strong>Mess:</strong> Dry shaving usually means tiny hairs blowing around your bathroom. (Shaving in the shower helps a lot, though.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="foil-vs-rotary">Foil vs. rotary shavers</h2>
<p>There are two common approaches to making a small motor into a hair-shaving machine. Each design is a transformation of the tried-and-true hair clipper mechanism. Rather than a single line of v-shaped cutting blades, though, shavers are a hole-filled &#8220;foil&#8221; of metal that can press safely against your skin and a blade inside that snips off hairs that poke through.</p>
<p><strong>Foil-type shavers:</strong> These use a half-cylinder foil with a set of hoop-shaped blades nesting inside. The inside cutter blade rapidly buzzes back and forth, just like hair clipper blades do, but your skin is protected by the foil.</p>
<p><strong>Rotary-type shavers:</strong> This uses the same scissor-like cutting action, but with a totally different mechanism. Rotary blades have two or three flat circular foils with micro-blades running in circles underneath like little propellers. The spinning blades are quieter and move more quickly than the blades in a foil-type, but they each cut a flat plane rather than a three-dimensional curve.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to angle a rotary drive shaft, so each of the circular cutters can tilt to follow tricky contours like your chin. That said, foil shavers already have some contour-following advantages with the 3D shape of their foils. So the difference between types in this regard isn&#8217;t as big as it might seem.</p>
<p>We asked around about reasons to choose one type over the other, and got mixed responses, but a generally consistent theme. When we asked John Howes from <a href="http://getarazor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getarazor.com</a> about his seven years of experience with different types of razors, he said that it depends mostly on hair and skin type. &#8220;A rotary shaver is great for thicker, coarser hair that grows in different directions. They&#8217;re also better if you prefer to have a less noisy shaver. Foil shavers are kinder to the skin, great for straight hair and precise shaving such as if you have a mustache or goatee.&#8221;</p>
<p>After testing a wide range of models from five different manufacturers, it seems clear that there is no hard and fast rule about who likes foils and who likes rotary shavers. Our two testers had polar-opposite experiences: One got a closer shave on his neck with the rotary shavers than he could get with the foil types, while another tester was convinced the top-of-the-line Philips rotary was broken.</p>
<p>In the end, if you find that a foil-type shaver just can&#8217;t get close to hairs that are growing in swirled growth patterns, you might be a good candidate for a rotary-type design.</p>
<p>On the whole, though, it seems clear that most people will be happier with the bar-shaped foils than the triangular pattern of circular foils. Carefully tracking against the &#8220;grain&#8221; of hair to cut closer is a bit easier that way.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Size and number of foils: </strong>In Panasonic and Braun&#8217;s lines of razors, you get more foils cutting at once when you upgrade to the fancy top-tier models. This does making shaving go a little more quickly, though bigger heads can be tricky to maneuver around the nose and jawline.</p>
<p><strong>Cleaning stands:</strong> Most of the manufacturers will sell you a charging and cleaning stand for their more expensive razors. This automates some daily maintenance functions, but if you want the stands to work their best you need to wash the shaver out before you put it back in the stand anyhow. They&#8217;re also pretty noisy, especially the Braun system.</p>
<p><strong>Cost of ownership:</strong> Beyond the obvious replacement blades (if you&#8217;re shaving every day you should plan on buying a replacement foil set every year) there are also costs like cleaning stand refills or some light mineral oil to keep your razor sharp and clean.</p>
<p><strong>Wet use:</strong> Most people who look to electric razors are seeking speed and efficiency, so taking time to lather up for wet-shaving is kind of counter-intuitive. The shaving suds will help the razor glide more smoothly across your face, though, and shaving in the shower makes cleanup even easier than with dry shaving.</p>
<p><strong>Battery Life:</strong> It doesn&#8217;t take long to complete a shave, but there&#8217;s no downside to a larger battery other than cost. It used to be that one could use a cordless shaver plugged in after the battery ran down. Now that shavers nearly all work wet, the manufacturers have disabled this option to prevent accidental electrocutions.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve got two testers at Your Best Digs who are particular about shaving products. One is a long-time electric user whose skin blisters at the mere mention of razor burn, while the other has been experimenting with straight razors since before he could grow a bad mustache. We asked them for comprehensive feedback in the following categories:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13928" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B.png" alt="Razor tests" width="2000" height="1896" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B.png 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B-610x578.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B-768x728.png 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B-885x839.png 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B-1500x1422.png 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B-295x280.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B-1000x948.png 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B-360x341.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B-375x356.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B-414x392.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B-320x303.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElectricRazor_charts_01-01_1B-885x839@2x.png 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Closeness test</h3>
<p>Our testers ranked each design in side-by-side testing, judging which razor shaves closest by checking to see which designs could pick up stubble left behind by the others.</p>
<p>After nine weeks of testing, we compared notes and gave each model a score on a 5-point scale. It&#8217;s tricky to measure this as an absolute, since measuring leftover stubble is nearly impossible, but a five-star shaver could consistently improve on the closeness of a four-star shave, and so on.</p>
<p>Note that a blade and lather will pretty easily out-shave even the Panasonic &#8211; Arc 5, but it&#8217;s much closer than we thought it would be.</p>
<h3>Comfort rating</h3>
<p>This was the most variable feedback we got from testers, particularly for the rotary-type shavers. After testing the top-class Philips &#8211; 8900, one tester (who has used a Braun foil-type shaver for years) said it was pulling at his hair so much he wondered if it was broken or might have a faulty battery.</p>
<p>Rotary shavers like the Philips models we tested use a &#8220;lift and cut&#8221; system that, theoretically, allows them to trim hair closer to the skin. That might explain the discomfort, but the Remington and Andis shavers weren&#8217;t much better. Those less-expensive foil-type models are also buzzy compared to the nearly silent rotary cutters.</p>
<p>Our sensitive tester also said he found the less-expensive Panasonic and Braun shavers slightly more &#8220;scratchy&#8221; feeling compared to the top-of-the-range models, while our less-sensitive tester found it difficult to rank them specifically on comfort during daily shaves.</p>
<p>The foils on the more expensive shavers don&#8217;t have any obviously different features (holes are a similar size, coatings are the same) but the speed of the motor and number of foils are increased by Braun and Panasonic respectively.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis is that the more expensive shavers are cutting more efficiently, which means you don&#8217;t need to press the shaver into your skin as much to get close; less abrasion always means less redness.</p>
<h3>Wet shaving performance</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/electricwetshave_2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Other than the Andis &#8211; Profoil, each of these shavers is able to work wet. That means you can use them in the shower, and if you want a little bit of added luxury, you can use them with shaving foam, cream or soap.</p>
<p>Our wet-shaving enthusiast tried the different shavers with our pick for <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-shaving-cream/">the best shaving cream</a> and some brush-lathered soaps. The biggest difference when wet shaving with an electric is that the foil glides smoothly over your skin with no resistance at all, a welcome relief after rubbing foils into his neck to get as close as possible.</p>
<p>The shavers that work best with this method are from Panasonic, and they were one of the first manufacturers to push waterproofness as a feature so it&#8217;s little surprise. The difference between shavers is not so much in closeness (each shaver gets slightly closer when your hair is dry and standing up as straight as possible), but in how they handle the foam.</p>
<p>Models from Panasonic, Remington and Philips have much more room inside the foil to scoop up the lather between rinses, while the Braun heads just &#8220;snowplow&#8221; the cream around your face.</p>
<h3>Long stubble performance</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/longstubble_2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We also ranked how well these shavers were able to mow down heavy growth after a four-day weekend. This ranking is based on two factors: First, whether the different razors were actually able to get through the thick stubble for a close shave, and second, whether there was a painful &#8220;pulling&#8221; sensation with longer hair.</p>
<p>Panasonic&#8217;s newer models like the Arc3 and Arc5 are supposed to automatically detect long hair and speed up the motor to cut it more efficiently, but we didn&#8217;t notice a significant change in speed as the shave continued. The Arc5&#8217;s extra foils did help mow down the heavy growth, though, and if you&#8217;re going from fuzz to clean-shaven every week this model would save you some time.</p>
<p>Braun&#8217;s Series 7 shaver performed well, and when the speed was cranked up all the way it matched the Panasonic for efficient and smooth cutting. Without the extra foils of the Arc5, though, it&#8217;s at a slight disadvantage for a speedy shave.</p>
<p>The Remington was the clear loser in this category, its smaller motor just couldn&#8217;t generate enough force to effectively chop away the longer stubble without pulling on the roots.</p>
<h3>Cleaning test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13997" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest.jpg" alt="cleaning a shaver" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cleaningtest-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The best way to keep your razor sharp is to keep it clean. We&#8217;d read about big differences between the different designs, and we found that Braun&#8217;s fully enclosed cutter cartridges are definitely harder to clean thoroughly than Panasonic&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Probably the biggest surprise in our testing was that the high-end cleaning stands weren&#8217;t saving time or effort. Every cleaning stand insisted that a rinse was necessary before using the cleaning cycle, and by the time we got the hang of using liquid hand soap and a cup full of water to pre-clean the shavers, we started to doubt the benefit of another cleaning step with the stands.</p>
<p>The difference in cleaning score mostly came down to easy access to the inside of the cutting system. Braun&#8217;s system is totally contained in the snap-on cartridge, which doesn&#8217;t seem to be a major problem during cleaning after daily use, but makes it tricky to get out clumps of four-day stubble. All of the other systems separate the inside cutter and the foil, which makes it easier to do a thorough cleaning.</p>
<h3>Battery life</h3>
<p>We charged each shaver and then timed how long it took for them to totally run out of juice.</p>
<p>Whether you really need more than a few days of charge is debatable, but theoretically the bigger batteries will also take longer to become useless after the cells lose all their capacity. (All of the wet/dry models will refuse to turn on when plugged in, to prevent people from running power cords into the shower.)</p>
<p>Ideally you should keep the shavers at around 80 percent of capacity for maximum battery life and definitely avoid running them down to empty, but modern Lithium Ion cells are pretty robust.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sad that you can&#8217;t replace the batteries in these machines, given that with replacement foils they should work just fine for decades, but in the worst-case scenario (the power-hungry Panasonic Arc5) <a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_define_battery_life" target="_blank" rel="noopener">300 cycles of full charging and discharging</a> still theoretically works out to around 15 years of shaving time.</p>
<p>One unique feature of the Panasonic razors is that they will leave some reserve power in the battery, rather than just running all the way until dead. If you&#8217;re not paying attention to the blinking warning light, this will give you just enough reserve power to quickly finish your shave (and maybe one more shave after that) rather than just refusing to turn on.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t tell how much power is left in the Braun lithium-ion shavers, but our guess is that Panasonic&#8217;s system is going to do a better job preserving battery life in the long run.</p>

<h3>Replacement foil cost</h3>
<p>All the manufacturers recommend replacing the foils and cutters annually, though the Philips blades have a flat cutting plane, so <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LI-F6QJaEU4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it&#8217;s actually possible to sharpen them</a>.</p>
<p>One issue with replacing foils is availability. We tested current-model shavers hoping that parts would be easy to find, but the cheapest blades right now are from a few years back. (Naturally, the manufacturers don&#8217;t say much about compatibility between model years.)</p>

Panasonic has often been pegged as an also-ran in the shaver race, but when we balance performance, price and design considerations we think the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013AX8A3M/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Arc3 ES-LT3N-K</a> does its job best.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Panasonic has released a new model in this line, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QXHZ4YF/?tag=ybdshaver-20">Arc3 ES-LL41</a>. We haven&#8217;t put it through its paces yet, but it looks like a solid update. The only major change on the spec sheet is the replacement foils: the LT3N we tested in 2018 uses a unique foil, while the new LL41 goes back to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001J6O0KA/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WES9087PC foil replacement</a> used on older Arc3 models. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any performance compromise, and this change makes replacement foils much easier to track down.</p>
<p><strong>Original review:</strong> At a street price hovering around $80, this isn&#8217;t a bargain razor by any stretch of the imagination. There are many, many brands competing in the under-$50 bracket, but Panasonic has fixed their sights on the under-$100 bracket instead, and they&#8217;ve hit the bullseye.</p>
<p>The Arc3 is the lowest rung on Panasonic&#8217;s ladder, though with the lack of updates to the Arc4 line that&#8217;s not as complicated as it used to be. This shaver has two foils and a stubble-whacking center trimming bar, just like most foil-type shavers. (Arc4 and Arc5 models add extra foils.)</p>

The Arc3 might take a few more passes than the massive Arc5, but the foil technology is as good as it gets for a price that's great.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013AX8A3M/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Panasonic&#8217;s secret weapon has always been in the motor, and this shaver has that same strength. Fast, powerful, quiet. While the Braun shavers (even the spendy Series 7 and Series 9) sound like hair clippers, Panasonic&#8217;s shavers give a higher-pitched and much smoother whine, like an angry bumblebee to Braun&#8217;s runaway sewing machine.</p>
<p>In terms of closeness, the Arc3 can&#8217;t be beat. The bigger brothers, Arc4 and Arc5, have more foils which means they can theoretically cover more of your face in a hurry, but if you take your time to carefully follow the grain of your hair (which you have to do for a close shave anyway) the Arc3 trims just as close.</p>
<p>Panasonic lists their motor speed in &#8220;CPM,&#8221; which we assume to be two &#8220;cuts&#8221; per full revolution of the internal motor. The Arc3 lists at 13,000, while the two bigger models are 14,000.</p>
<p>Wet-shaving performance is also a win for the entire Panasonic line. You&#8217;ll have to rinse lather off the Arc3 more frequently than the Arc5, but it doesn&#8217;t smear the lather around your face the way Braun&#8217;s shavers do. Combining a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-shaving-cream/">slick shaving cream</a> and the Arc3 is a luxe upgrade to your morning shave routine without the risk of nicks.</p>
<h3>Arc3 vs. other Panasonic models</h3>
[table id=140 /]
<p>Another reason to buy the Arc3 is that this is the newest shaver Panasonic sells in North America. The pricey Arc5 LV95-S is actually a last-gen design; in Japan it has been surpassed by the ES-LV9CX, but they didn&#8217;t bring those models across the pacific. The Arc3 ES-LT3N-K uses up-to-date styling, and we think it&#8217;s an improvement over previous looks. (The ES-CT20 would be a nice option for those who want something compact, but you&#8217;ll have to rely on Ebay to get your hands on that model too.)</p>
<p>Compared to the $160 Braun Series 7, the Arc3&#8217;s shave is definitely more aggressive. If you have sensitive follicles you might consider Braun&#8217;s smoother shave worth the extra $80 over Panasonic&#8217;s close and efficient cut. Braun&#8217;s Series 5, however, which is closer in price to the Arc3, is just buzzy and inefficient by comparison.</p>
<p>Cleaning the Arc3, even without Panasonic&#8217;s pricey optional stand, is a breeze. Panasonic designs their razors with a &#8220;sonic vibration&#8221; cleaning mode, which moves the cutting bar even faster than the normal shaving mode to help rinse and dry the parts more thoroughly.</p>
<p>Panasonic doesn&#8217;t advocate using oil on their blades when you get them wet the way Braun does, but we&#8217;re curious to see how they stand up in long-term use. Getting the blades clean and drying them is definitely going to be the most important part of keeping them sharp, oil is most valuable (in our experience) with moving parts that you can&#8217;t wash for fear of rust or electrical shorts.</p>
<p>The Arc3 also features our favorite pop-up trimmer of the bunch; it&#8217;s not a replacement for a full beard trimmer that can help you maintain a consistent length, but for edging a moustache or sideburns it&#8217;s perfect.</p>
<p>For travel, Panasonic only includes a cheap velour pouch, which is a bit of a let-down at this price point. They do, however, design all their razors with a travel lock. Press the power button to turn it on, then hold down until the lock symbol appears, hold it down again to unlock. We think the swivel-ring lock on the older Panasonic models is a little bit easier to use, but none of the other brands included a lock to keep the razor from starting in your suitcase.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Panasonic &#8211; Arc3 gives most faces the closest shave possible from an electric razor.</li>
<li>Panasonic&#8217;s motor design isn&#8217;t as buzzy as other brands, and the sonic vibration cleaning mode helps keep blades clean.</li>
<li>The aggressive shave isn&#8217;t as gentle on sensitive skin as the Braun Series 7, but at half the price it&#8217;s still better for most of us.</li>
<li>The travel lock requires a sequence of button presses, but it works.</li>
</ul>

If the idea of &#8220;closest possible shave&#8221; makes your skin hurt, there are alternatives. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MPX171W/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Braun&#8217;s Series 7 7865</a> has been lauded as a great razor system by nearly everyone who tries it, and if it we weren&#8217;t considering price it would be tricky to justify picking anything else.</p>
<p>Our most sensitive-skinned tester said that, in comparison, the Panasonic &#8211; Arc3 felt like it was &#8220;very slightly snagging&#8221; on hairs, a tiny bit &#8220;scratchy.&#8221; The Braun shaves with a gentle, whirring caress. If you avoid blade-shaves because you don&#8217;t like the way they feel, that might be more than enough reason to cough up another $80 for the Braun.</p>
<p>Braun&#8217;s battery is also the best we tested, clocking in at 155 minutes of runtime to the Arc3&#8217;s 100. That probably means it will last a bit longer in the coming years, though neither shaver will work when plugged in after the battery goes kaput. (To prevent you from electrocuting yourself in the shower, they say.)</p>
<p>The one shortcoming of Braun&#8217;s careful engineering is the pop-up trimmer: the blade is curved, for some reason, and doesn&#8217;t seem especially effective when shaping sideburns. It&#8217;s not useless, but we found ourselves spending time with other trimmers cleaning up lines from the Series 7.</p>

There are even more expensive shavers out there, but we think this one is actually worth the splurge.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MPX171W/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Braun includes a nice travel case that&#8217;s stiff (though not exactly rugged) and should protect it well on trips. Be sure not to lose the case, though, since there&#8217;s no travel lock to prevent your batteries dying during a flight. The charger is dual-voltage, too.</p>
<h3>Should I buy the Braun cleaning stand?</h3>
<p>Braun&#8217;s Series 5 and 7 models are often sold as &#8220;CC&#8221; versions, and this means you&#8217;ll get a cleaning and charging stand to go with your razor. The cost ranges from $15-50 more, and there aren&#8217;t any other differences. (Braun usually makes sure you can&#8217;t just mix and match by moving the charge port on the &#8220;Solo&#8221; models.)</p>
<p>Many shaver enthusiasts insist that the cleaning stand is an essential purchase with a Braun razor, and we think that&#8217;s a bit of an exaggeration. In a past era when these shavers weren&#8217;t designed to be immersed in water, the use of an alcohol-based solution in the cleaning stand was doubtless a better way to keep the razor clean than trying to blow or rinse every last hair out of the cartridge yourself.</p>
<p>Now that the razors are designed to run wet, it&#8217;s pretty easy to spread some soap on the foil and run the shaver motor while the head is immersed, just as the cleaning stand does. We couldn&#8217;t see any difference between this cleaning method and the results from the stand.</p>
<p>The stand is a cool accessory if you want the shaver to loom over your bathroom countertop, but you can&#8217;t keep it in a drawer or cabinet. The refills are kind of annoying to deal with, and the cleaning process amplifies the normal buzzing sound of the shaver quite a bit. The way the thing starts and stops in cycles might even startle unsuspecting housemates early in the morning.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Braun-7893s-Electric-Foil-Shaver/dp/B06XBHYDVK?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/braun-7893s-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/braun-7893s-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/braun-7893s-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/braun-7893s-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/braun-7893s-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/braun-7893s-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/braun-7893s-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/braun-7893s-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/braun-7893s.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Available Without the Stand: Braun – 7893s</h3><p>The price of the solo option is often very close, but check and see how much you can save before you buy the model with the stand.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Braun-7893s-Electric-Foil-Shaver/dp/B06XBHYDVK?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The big difference in long-term use is that the charging stand uses a solution of alcohol and oil that will keep the blade clean and lubricated while you&#8217;re not using it. Braun&#8217;s latest stands aren&#8217;t rapidly drying the shaver the way Panasonic&#8217;s stand does, but the alcohol solution evaporates quickly enough that it&#8217;s not a deal-breaker.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not 100 percent convinced that the lubrication from the cleaning solution is required, but if you don&#8217;t want to buy the stand, some light mineral oil or cleaning spray can&#8217;t hurt, especially if you&#8217;re dry shaving.</p>
<p>If the solo model of the Series 7 came with at big discount we might tell you to forget about the stand entirely, but the sad truth is that Braun has made it hard to find them and the prices go up and down all the time.</p>
<h3>Series 7 vs. other Braun models</h3>
[table id=141 /]
<p>Braun has four distinct lines of shavers: Series 3 for entry-level, 5 for an upgrade, 7 for people who want an even better shaver and Series 9 for people who want the best shaver possible.</p>
<p>We looked long and hard at the Series 9, and we don&#8217;t see much reason to spend an extra $100 on metallic platings and an extra &#8220;Hyperlift and Cut&#8221; trimmer bar. Plenty of people who spring for the upgrade are happy to say that it shaves closer and with less irritation, so if buying the best is worth $250 we say go for it. For the rest of us, Series 7 is already enough of a stretch that we&#8217;re happy with our pick.</p>
<p>The Series 5, on the other hand, is kind of disappointing. It&#8217;s louder and vibrates far more than the Series 7, definitely not the same class of motor. So far as we can tell the design and construction of the cutting heads is the same, you can even snap a Series 7 head onto the Series 5 body, but the comfortable shave of the Series 7 just wasn&#8217;t there anymore. If you&#8217;re okay sacrificing a little bit of comfort to save some money, Panasonic is a much better bet.</p>
<p>The Series 3 is the only real competition in Braun&#8217;s lineup; for $100 less you still get a decent shave.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Braun&#8217;s Series 7 is easily the most respected shaver line of all time, and we agree that it shaves exceptionally well.</li>
<li>If your follicles scream in terror when you think about &#8220;lift and cut,&#8221; this is the smoothest, kindest shaving experience we found.</li>
<li>Long stubble is no sweat for the S7, though Panasonic&#8217;s shavers get a bit closer.</li>
<li>The cleaning station is kind of unnecessary, but the solo model is often just as expensive.</li>
<li>Braun&#8217;s replacement cartridges are fairly easy to track down even at local stores.</li>
</ul>

<p>We tested four razors that will cost you around $50, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0115I2DRI/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Braun &#8211; Series 3</a> is the only design we think is worth considering.</p>
<p>Braun&#8217;s engineering is represented well in the foil-type blades on the Series 3. The motor is clearly not as strong as the Series 7, and it&#8217;s possible that the blades are made differently. But given how similar these razors are, Braun has done a great job making this feel like a noticeable compromise without making it terrible. (We wish we could say the same for the other budget razors.)</p>
<p>Long stubble was the test that showed the most difference for us; the Series 3 is painful in four-day growth, the Series 7 isn&#8217;t. If you&#8217;re not as sensitive to this prickly feeling you might be 100 percent OK with it, but if you want to go for a weekend without shaving the Series 7 or Panasonic shavers are well worth the extra coin.</p>

For the man who throws his razor in a gym bag, it's practically perfect.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0115I2DRI/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Series 3 didn&#8217;t cut as close as the other shavers, even the weak-tea Series 5 managed to clean up stubble left behind by this budget model. That said, if you&#8217;re okay with a bit of scruff returning at the end of each day this might be a great razor for you.</p>
<p>Compact in size and with a blade cover that doubles as a sort-of button lock, this is a great shaver if you want something to stash in a bag or glove compartment. If the cover comes off in your gym bag when you stuff it in your locker, it&#8217;s still vulnerable to accidentally powering on, but we like the simplicity of the design.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Braun &#8211; Series 3 isn&#8217;t as luxurious as their high-end stuff, but it&#8217;s the best $50 shaver we could find.</li>
<li>If you let your stubble grow on occasion, stay away. It hurts.</li>
<li>A compact hassle-free shaver that you won&#8217;t worry as much about losing at the gym.</li>
<li>The waterproof design is much easier to clean than old-school Braun shavers, still not as easy as the competition.</li>

The popularity of rotary-foil shavers like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JITDVD2/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Aqua-Tech 4500</a> is tricky to explain. For some, this is simply the only kind of electric razor they&#8217;ve ever tried. For others with flat-lying hairs that grow in a swirled pattern, it might be a shaver that actually works better than the straight-cutting foil types.</p>
<p>For most people, the big distinction is going to be maneuverability and performance on sensitive faces or in long stubble. In our tests, the rotary shavers just weren&#8217;t very good, and there was little (if any) difference between the mid-tier shaver 4500 and up-scale model 8900.</p>
<p>One of our testers (yes, the Braun fan-boy) insisted that he felt so much pain from the rotary shavers that they can&#8217;t possibly be working properly. We double-checked with our other tester, and we don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re broken, but they&#8217;re definitely not for everyone. For long stubble (still short enough that running over it with clippers didn&#8217;t make much difference) everyone agrees that the pulling and grabbing from a rotary isn&#8217;t worth it.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JITDVD2/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/philips-4500-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/philips-4500-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/philips-4500-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/philips-4500-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/philips-4500-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/philips-4500-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/philips-4500-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/philips-4500-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/philips-4500.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Rotary Shaver: Philips – 4500</h3><p>This type of shaver isn't the best for most people, but if your hairs just aren't picked up by a straight foil then a rotary system might get you the close shave you've been looking for.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JITDVD2/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>That said, our second tester did find that both of the rotary designs cleaned up short hard-to-get stubble on his neck even better than the Panasonic shavers. We&#8217;re not sure if the &#8220;lift and cut&#8221; of the Philips design is working better than the straight foils, or if it&#8217;s just easier to grab tricky hairs with an equally tricky razor.</p>
<p>The overall closeness was a wash; the triangular pattern doesn&#8217;t lend itself to tracking against straight grain in passes, so Philips recommends using a circular pattern instead. This works in some spots, not in others; under the nose or along sideburns it&#8217;s a real pain.</p>
<p>One detail that pushes the 4500 ahead of its big brother is the trimmer attachment; the 8900 requires you to swap the shaver head for a &#8220;SmartClick&#8221; trimmer head, while the 4500 uses the always-ready pop-up style like most shavers. This way you won&#8217;t ever accidentally bring your trimmer on a trip instead of your shaver.</p>
<p>Maybe the most interesting feature of the rotary systems is that you can completely disassemble them for cleaning and maintenance. The rotary drive system is also extremely quiet in comparison to the back-and-forth buzz of other shavers.</p>
<p>The 4500 has just as many strengths as the 8900, but if you hate the feel of a rotary shaver you&#8217;ll probably hate all of them, and our tester who didn&#8217;t mind the feel doesn&#8217;t think the increase in closeness is worth $80.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Philips &#8211; 4500 is a rotary shaver that will give good performance for tricky hair growth.</li>
<li>Easy to clean and maintain, the 4500 has a hinged head for hassle-free rinsing.</li>
<li>Almost as good as a more expensive rotary, at a much better price.</li>
<li>This pop-up sideburn trimmer is always better than a snap-on accessory that doesn&#8217;t even fit in the travel case.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Panasonic &#8211; Arc5 ES-LV95-S</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FPQ70Z2/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; Arc5</a> doubles-down on the multi-blade gimmick, and while it&#8217;s a functional improvement over the Arc3 is some ways, the head is so bulky it&#8217;s not a better shaver for most people.</p>
<p>In practice, we&#8217;re pretty sure we could get quicker shaves with the Arc5&#8217;s extra foils, and in testing it seemed to clean up a few spots of short micro-stubble left behind by the Arc3. Compared to the Braun &#8211; Series 7, we&#8217;d say this is an easy win for Panasonic in overall performance and even comfort.</p>
<p>The size of the head gets in the way, though, if you&#8217;re trying to shave around a moustache or even just around your nose. On the chin it&#8217;s a little bit better than other shavers just because you don&#8217;t have to run as many passes to get the whole surface, but under the jawline it&#8217;s hard to maneuver sideways to track against the grain for a close shave.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013AX8A3M/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/panasonic-arc5-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/panasonic-arc5-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/panasonic-arc5-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/panasonic-arc5-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/panasonic-arc5-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/panasonic-arc5-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/panasonic-arc5-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/panasonic-arc5-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/panasonic-arc5.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Closest Shave: Panasonic – Arc5</h3><p>Panasonic pulls out all the stops with a five-foil monster shaver, and in some spots it'll give you the closest shave in fewer passes than with the Arc3.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013AX8A3M/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The price of the Arc5 is good compared to Braun&#8217;s top-end Series 9, so if you&#8217;re not trying to do anything tricky with detailed maneuvering this might be a better bet for the most luxurious shave you can get. For the rest of us, though, the price is just adding insult to a design that isn&#8217;t quite there.</p>
<h3>Philips &#8211; S8900</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012VL5TB0/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; 8900</a> gives the rotary enthusiast a few reasons to upgrade over an older entry-level model. But on the whole, we don&#8217;t think most people should buy this razor.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to buy a rotary with a cleaning stand because you want to have a neat and functional way to store it on your countertop, this stand is every bit as good as the others we tried. It&#8217;s just as redundant, too, now that electric razors are designed to be waterproof, but it&#8217;s there if you want it.</p>
<p>The 8900 might get a tiny bit closer in a few spots than the modestly priced 4500 model. The &#8220;8 direction&#8221; pivoting head didn&#8217;t seem any different, though, and even if the motor spins slightly faster, this shaver was just as painful and ineffective in long stubble.</p>
<p>This shaver uses the top-end SH90 shaving heads (the same cutting parts as the 9000 series, but without the silly speed adjustment buttons) so we&#8217;re positive you won&#8217;t get better performance out of a rotary-type shaver.</p>
<p>For $100 this might be a worthwhile upgrade in closeness over the 4500, but for closer to $200 street price we&#8217;re just not convinced. It&#8217;s pretty, but most people should stay far away.</p>

<h3>Panasonic &#8211; Arc4 ES-LF51-A</h3>
<p>Panasonic still sells a lot of these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005DKKBTC/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Arc4 shavers</a>, but the middle child in the family has largely been forgotten. The extra foil doesn&#8217;t make as much difference for speedy shaving as the massive surface area on the Arc5 seems to, but when the price dips down to $75 (as it sometimes does) this might be worth considering for a slightly quicker shave than the Arc3.</p>
<p>Compared to the Arc5 the bulkiness of the Arc4&#8217;s head isn&#8217;t nearly as much a problem, but the battery life was still a bit disappointing. We had hoped that this might represent a good compromise between the Arc3 and the Arc5; it&#8217;s not a huge disappointment the way Braun&#8217;s Series 5 is, but it&#8217;s not a compelling choice, either.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not any reason to buy this over the Arc3 unless you get a great deal on it. The Arc3 is still being developed and upgraded in Panasonic&#8217;s Japanese lineup, so it will likely be easier to find blades for the Arc3 in the long term. The Arc4 ES-LF51-A is a design from 2012, while it&#8217;s still &#8220;current&#8221; according to Panasonic&#8217;s U.S. sales people we wouldn&#8217;t bet on it staying that way for many more years.</p>
<h3>Braun &#8211; Series 5 5190cc</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JA7Q4SQ/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Braun &#8211; Series 5</a> is like the Series 7, but weaker. So far as we can tell, the blades are made the same way and might even be entirely compatible, but the motor is slower and vibrates so much it actually makes this bit of a downgrade from the Series 3. One of our testers compared it to &#8220;a medical device geared to stimulate blood flow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new solo model 5147s is harder to find and lists for $120; we bought the 5190 with cleaning stand for $115 and it&#8217;s probably going to remain the best value for this series.</p>
<p>This gives a reasonably close shave, like the Series 7, but it struggles to clean up long stubble without tugging. For a $40 discount, that&#8217;s a tricky tradeoff to make. When we put it against the less-expensive Panasonic Arc3, though, it just seems a bit sad.</p>
<p>The battery life in the Series 5 is definitely a step up from budget shavers, but it&#8217;s still not replaceable and the waterproof design still won&#8217;t turn on when it&#8217;s plugged in.</p>
<p>Cleanup is the same as all the Braun models: use the stand if you have it, or give it an extra turn in the sink once a week to make sure nothing is stuck inside that mostly enclosed blade cartridge.</p>
<h3>Remington &#8211; PF-7600</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WD7PT1S/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Remington &#8211; PF-7600</a> is a new design from this well-established brand, but it&#8217;s pretty much the worst shaver we tried. It won&#8217;t get any closer than the Braun &#8211; Series 3, whatever your hair type.</p>
<p>A post-weekend shave with the Remington is pretty much a disaster. It doesn&#8217;t like grabbing the longer hairs, and when it does, it pulls on them.</p>
<p>If you take it slow and don&#8217;t let your stubble grow long, you can get an acceptable shave with the Remington that&#8217;s more comfortable on sensitive skin than a rotary-type like the Philips, but Braun is easily a better choice in this price range.</p>
<h3>Andis &#8211; 17150 Profoil Lithium</h3>
<p>Andis is a brand better known to barbers than to most of us, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071YSDPKC/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Profoil shaver</a> has a long history cleaning up fades and necklines in some of the best barbershops in the country.</p>
<p>Retro styling aside, this shaver let us down in a few key areas. First, it&#8217;s not as close-trimming as the top-class shavers, though it will keep up with Braun in the $50 pack. Second, it&#8217;s disappointingly weak in longer stubble, an application we&#8217;d hoped it would be perfect for. Finally, the nail in the coffin is dry-shaving only: this is one of the last razors on the market that you can&#8217;t clean out by dunking the head while it&#8217;s running.</p>
<p>For a barber, this might still be a decent choice; it&#8217;s a simple machine and the replacement foils are the cheapest we found. For the rest of us who care about a close, comfortable shave, look elsewhere. Our sensitive-skinned tester managed to draw blood with this shaver, and that&#8217;s pretty much an automatic fail.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Shaving products are tricky to review for a bunch of reasons. Our hair is as individual as our fingerprints, but we hope that we&#8217;ve given you enough info to buy an electric shaver that you&#8217;ll love using.</p>
<p>For the closest shave that modern engineering can provide, our top pick is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013AX8A3M/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; Arc3</a>. This isn&#8217;t Panasonic&#8217;s most expensive razor, but the head design is easier to work with than their other models and it shaves just as close once you get a feel for it. This is also a shaver that&#8217;s easy to clean, and that goes a long way to making it our favorite in long-term testing.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re more worried about irritation than the closest possible shave, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MPX171W/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Braun&#8217;s Series 7</a> is the system to beat. With amazing battery life and a convenient (if redundant) cleaning stand, this is a prestige piece that works hard to earn its steeper price tag.</p>
<p>If you just want a razor that works reliably at an affordable price point, we also think the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0115I2DRI/?tag=ybdshaver-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Braun &#8211; Series 3</a> is worth looking at. This model isn&#8217;t winning any awards for closeness or comfort, but it&#8217;s definitely the best budget model we tested.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We gave 10 bearded gentlemen eight samples of the most popular beard oils. After a two-month blind comparison trial, the overall value champion is Mountaineer Brand.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent weeks researching and two months blind testing eight oil blends with a group of 10 bearded gentlemen to determine the best beard oil. The differences between beard oils are subtle, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K9KEQA6/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mountaineer Brand beard oil</a> wins this roundup with a great blend of effective oils at a very good price. Our top pick also comes in five scents, and it&#8217;s easy to find. For our runner-up, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WF6VFSS?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Gentlemen&#8217;s Beard</a> ranked highest overall with a near-perfect blend of different oil weights, but it&#8217;s far more expensive than it should be.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Our resident beard-guy has tried various substances on his beard for conditioning and itch-relief, so he thought he understood the basic principles fairly well before he started researching this category. Oil is oil, right? He found out that there&#8217;s far more nuance to the topic than he expected.</p>
<p>A casual perusal of the relevant subreddits, forums and Facebook groups yields a lot of great info on what to try and what to avoid, but we were looking for more specific information on what&#8217;s in beard oil and why it works.</p>
<p>Reading up on the science of hair care, we quickly discovered that the warnings about supermarket hair conditioner are based on a simple but strong principle: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12715094" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mineral oils and silicones coat your hair</a> to make it shiny and smooth, but they don&#8217;t actually penetrate inside to moisturize the hair.</p>
<p>That took oils with ingredients like siloxane and dimethicone off our list categorically. The effects might not be as disastrous as some imply, but for helping your beard stay soft and pliable, it&#8217;s clear that oils should be able to soak in.</p>
<p>Most of the other nearly scientific content we found was either targeted at hair care or basically promotional in nature. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be anyone doing studies on specific oils for beards, so we had to rely more heavily on anecdotal consensus.</p>
<p>We looked at lists of beard care products in mainstream publications, but for the most part it seemed clear that if the list was <a href="https://www.toolsofmen.com/best-beard-oil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">based on actual testing</a>, products were rarely ranked for any specific reason.</p>
<p>YouTube is practically flooded with reviews of oils, balms and other grooming products, so we tried to come up with a list of must-try brands from as many different reviewers as we could consult. (Total YouTube watching time for this research: eight hours, and that&#8217;s with skipping ahead through top-ten-lists.)</p>
<p>As always, we rely on customer reviews from sites like Amazon to guide our assessment of long-term use and obvious problems with a product that might be missed in a quick review. We didn&#8217;t find many negative reviews, and even using the <a href="https://www.fakespot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fakespot</a> review-analysis system to filter out products with obviously fake reviews didn&#8217;t help much to narrow the field.</p>
<p>In the end, we focused on brands that have easy-to-understand ingredients labelled clearly and hopefully come in more than one scent and with an unscented option.</p>
<p>We set our per-ounce budget at $20 to see if a premium brand would actually do anything different than a cheap oil. We also bought some popular ingredients in bulk: fractionated coconut oil, so we&#8217;d have a simple, cheap lightweight control in our test, and olive oil for a heavier control sample.</p>

<h2 id="do-oils-help">Do beard oils help grow a beard?</h2>
<p>This is a common question. But if you were looking for the &#8220;best beard growth oil,&#8221; the answer we have is probably not the one you were hoping for.</p>
<p>Beard growth is almost entirely down to genetics. We&#8217;re still in early days of understanding how beard and hair traits work, <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/genetic-clues-to-monobrows-and-bushy-beards-revealed-1.19483" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but there are some clear markers</a>.</p>
<p>The other factor to think about is your diet. Your skin and hair need oil, protein and water to grow, but there&#8217;s no clear link we could find between any specific foods and hair growth. Studies have definitely found <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28243487" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a link between malnutrition and hair loss</a>, though. So, step one: don&#8217;t spend your food budget on beard oil, but don&#8217;t overbuy trendy food, either.</p>
<p>So, is that a &#8220;no&#8221; then? Definitely. But also, kinda-sorta-maybe technically yes.</p>
<p>Honest beard oil companies will tell you two things that their products <em>can</em> do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Beard oil keeps your beard hairs soft, healthy and under control.</li>
<li>Beard oil keeps your skin moisturized to reduce itching and flaking.</li>
</ol>
<p>The biggest struggle most men have growing a beard is itchy skin and frizzy, dry hair. Usually after the first three weeks of growth, you start thinking about shaving it all off.</p>
<p>So while beard oil may not be able to sprout new follicles or change the diameter of your hairs, it can stop you from cutting your beard off prematurely in itchy frustration.</p>

<p>While there are as many different kinds of oil as there are plants (you can extract oily compounds from almost everything that&#8217;s alive), a few oils have become very popular. Ingredients on personal care products are listed in &#8220;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/IngredientNames/ucm2005218.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">order of predominance,</a>&#8221; but with any more than two oils in a blend, it gets increasingly difficult to say how much of a particular oil is present from just the ingredient list.</p>
<p><b>Jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) oil:</b> The seeds of the Jojoba, a shrub from North American deserts, contain an inedible long-molecular-chain wax (similar to the once-popular whale oil). The &#8220;oil&#8221; is non-greasy and often used in skin-care because it has properties very similar to the sebum oil that our skin produces. Research involving its application to hair is limited, but it&#8217;s a very trendy oil. The only oil we tested that doesn&#8217;t include Jojoba is our top pick, Mountaineer Brand.</p>
<p><b>Argan (Argania spinosa) oil:</b> Argan oil is extracted (usually by hand) from the seeds of a tree native to Morocco. This oil has achieved a near-legendary status in the world of natural cosmetic products, and it&#8217;s the most expensive edible oil. While it&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3723062/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">known antioxidant</a> there is only limited research data on how it&#8217;s absorbed by your hair.</p>
<p><b>Castor (Ricinus communis) oil:</b> Castor oil is one of the thickest oils typically found in beard oil. This has been a popular medicinal product for thousands of years, though mostly as a strong laxative. In beard oil it should give a bit more control. Popular claims of hair-growing properties are unproven, though it does <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11263183" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boost prostoglandin levels</a>, which are linked to hair growth.</p>
<p><b>Coconut (Cocos nucifera) oil:</b> While this trendy oil has spawned countless clickbait articles, it does at least have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12715094" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some research to back up its popularity</a>. It has proven to be great on hair, but it&#8217;s not as common as we expected in beard oil, probably to avoid <a href="https://www.byrdie.com/coconut-oil-for-acne" target="_blank" rel="noopener">problems for acne-prone users</a>. We used refined coconut oil as a control in our testing, and most of our testers did say that it disappeared into their beards quickly. (Raw coconut oil, which is solid at room temperature, makes a good beard butter.)</p>
<p><b>Other oils: </b>We found <a href="http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/oils-which-ones-soak-in-vs-coat-hair.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some basic information</a> about common oil types and how well they soak into hair. This isn&#8217;t the only relevant factor in a beard oil, but it&#8217;s good to know that the beard-oil artisans aren&#8217;t just grabbing totally random ingredients.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>This is typically the part of a review where we would tell you what&#8217;s most important about the winning products, but&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Beard oil is both too simple and too complicated to understand from a set of features on a box.</b> You could have two different blends of the same base ingredients and get different performance, but the difference isn&#8217;t huge.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re confident that most beard oils out there will do a good job. You could use vegetable cooking oil if you wanted and get fairly similar results. That said, there are some factors that could make the difference between an oil you like and an oil you love:</p>
<p><b>Scent:</b> Finding a scent you can live with (or even enjoy!) is a big part of choosing a brand, though some people are less picky than others. Most of the brands we tested feature an unscented choice, but not all.</p>
<p><b>Packaging:</b> We encountered three different types of bottle in our research. A <strong>reducer-type bottle</strong> has a plastic insert that makes it easier to get drops of oil rather than accidentally dumping out half an ounce. A <strong>dropper</strong> makes applying the oil even easier, since you can control exactly how much goes on your beard. A <strong>pump dispenser</strong> works OK, but we found it didn&#8217;t give quite as much control as a dropper.</p>
<p><b>Availability: </b>There are now hundreds of different beard oils you can choose from, but it&#8217;s nice to be able to pick up a bottle on short notice. Shipping internet orders is getting easier and easier, but it&#8217;s always nice to be able to see (and smell) a product.</p>
<h2 id="make-my-own">Can I make my own beard oil?</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to make your own beard oil blend, that&#8217;s usually a sign you&#8217;re very passionate about beard care or very frugal. If you have the time, it can be a rewarding pursuit.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of recipe resources on the web, and once you find an enclave of beard enthusiasts you like, you&#8217;ll typically find offers of recipes and even free samples passed around. For example, Reddit&#8217;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beardoil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beard oil sub</a> is mostly devoted to discussions about DIY beard oil experiments.</p>
<p>One cool benefit of mixing your own beard oil is that you can add your own scent ingredients exactly as you like them. But the long and winding road toward the dark art of perfumery is not for the faint of heart. <a href="http://www.basenotes.net/forums/15-Fragrance-DIY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Basenotes.net</a> is probably the best place to start learning about what makes a scent blend work, though nobody wants a beard oil to be as strong as a cologne.</p>
<p>Be careful with <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-essential-oils/" rel="noopener">essential oils</a> and other fragrance ingredients. Buy from a reputable seller and understand that some ingredients can be dangerous in high concentrations.</p>
<p>Applying a highly diluted blend like a beard oil (where each ounce of oil should have only a few drops of essential oils or even less fragrance added) is even less risky than the common approach of using <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-essential-oil-diffuser/" rel="noopener">a diffuser</a> for aromatherapy, but it still pays to make sure you aren&#8217;t highly sensitive to something. Never apply something to your skin out of a bottle unless you know how concentrated the contents are.</p>

<h3>Base oils and control testing</h3>
<p>In our first week of blind testing, our ten beard-scientists were given two oil mixes in bottles with only testing labels (E and F) to try out: a blend of slow-absorbing extra-virgin olive oil and 10-percent jojoba oil, then a blend of fast-absorbing coconut and 10-percent jojoba oil. This established a baseline of how the guys responded to thicker or thinner beard oil blended from popular ingredients.</p>
<p>Over the following eight weeks, we asked the volunteers to blind-test pairs of oil samples side-by-side, with one oil on each side of the beard. They had no idea what the products were, which gave us some hope to see if they could tell the difference between the samples. Testing two at once to controlled for some day-to-day variables that might come from applying every sample one day at a time.</p>
<p>We asked our testers to note results in five categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Softness:</strong> How much softer does the hair feel when it’s moisturized?</li>
<li><strong>Absorption:</strong> Does the hair feel greasy a few hours after oiling?</li>
<li><strong>Skin condition:</strong> Does the oiled beard help itch and flakes, or does it cause breakouts or other problems?</li>
<li><strong>Control:</strong> Does the oil help keep frizz and curls manageable?</li>
<li><strong>Lasting:</strong> How frequently do you need to reapply the oil?</li>
</ul>

<p>We followed the testing period with an exit poll and were surprised by the results. Top brands with established credibility got lower average scores, while some unknown brands or blends of &#8220;boring&#8221; oils without many obvious advantages scored better on average.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s tricky to calibrate self-reporting on this scale, since we&#8217;re asking for testers&#8217; opinions about qualities that are hard to measure precisely. Our sample size is on the small side, and it could be that there&#8217;s just too much error in the way our testers were reporting to draw any valid conclusions.</p>
<p>That said, the results demonstrate that beard oil in a blind test isn&#8217;t all &#8220;the same.&#8221; There was a consistent preference for the more complex blends of commercially produced oil over the simple oils. The fact that one tester picked olive oil as his favorite shows that oil shouldn&#8217;t have to be expensive to help your beard.</p>
<h3>Beard oil and acne</h3>
<p>We asked testers to report how the oils affected skin condition, and this was the category that our testers were most obviously not getting any significant data for; nearly all of the responses hovered around four out of five.</p>
<p>We had hoped to find something like &#8220;the best beard oil for acne-prone skin,&#8221; but our results are nowhere near that conclusive. Mountaineer Brand got highest score for skincare by a few percent, but on the whole we didn&#8217;t consider this data worth including in our averaged score.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t claim that the results we&#8217;ve gathered will be universal, even with the range of skin and hair types in our sample group. If you get breakouts or acne after using a beard oil, you should definitely stop using it and try again with a different oil after your skin gets a chance to recover.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">The best overall: Mountaineer Brand</h2>

<p>Mountaineer Brand is a solid oil from a little company that really cares about making great beard-care products. The blend doesn&#8217;t use exotic oils like argan and jojoba, but that didn&#8217;t stop it from getting solid scores across the board.</p>
<p>This is one of three blends we tested that uses castor oil paired with grapeseed oil, and it&#8217;s a combination of thick and light that works very well. Mountaineer also adds almond oil, and the recipe seems fine-tuned for a balance between fast-enough absorption with long-enough staying power.</p>

<p>The most critical factor in this pick is price. There are cheaper ways to care for your beard (hair conditioner or veggie oil from your kitchen), but our testing shows Mountaineer&#8217;s blend is definitely a step up. At about $6.50 per ounce, though, you&#8217;re not just throwing money away on trendy ingredients.</p>
<p>We tested Mountaineer&#8217;s &#8220;Barefoot&#8221; unscented blend, but they also have three other scents and a medicated blend.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H5UGUTS/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WV Timber</a> is a top-selling woodsy scent.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IBOJ1BG/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WV Coal</a> is &#8220;clean, cool and musky.&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0149MGRH4/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Citrus &amp; Spice</a> rounds out the lineup with clove, orange and grapefruit notes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pine Tar is an ingredient long used for skin problems, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5434829/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seems to relieve some psoriasis</a>, though it&#8217;s not well understood how exactly the different tar compounds work. If that sounds like something that could help your skin, Mountaineer sells a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LW5J1EM/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pine Tar beard oil blend</a>.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Mountaineer Brand is one of the least expensive ways to try a reliable, high-quality beard oil.</li>
<li>Relative performance is balanced; not too thick, not too thin, average all around.</li>
<li>Three scents to try and a unique pine-tar option means there should be something for everyone.</li>
<li>Easy to find at local retailers if you run out and need an emergency replacement.</li>

<p>The Gentlemen&#8217;s Beard is an out-of-nowhere Amazon storefront with luxury branding cues that more or less work despite the unfortunate name. (Who are these gentlemen, and why do they share a beard?)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC-k8c3MgtI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The YouTube video</a> is a cringe-fest, but these guys have picked solid ingredients and come up with a recipe that works just a bit better than anything else.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WF6VFSS/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-gentlemens-beard-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-gentlemens-beard-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-gentlemens-beard-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-gentlemens-beard-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-gentlemens-beard-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-gentlemens-beard-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-gentlemens-beard-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-gentlemens-beard-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-gentlemens-beard.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>The Best Oil Blend: The Gentlemen's Beard</h3><p>This is a recipe that works better than the rest for almost all of our testers. Even at flash-sale prices, though, it's very expensive.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WF6VFSS/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The premium ingredients on offer include the usual suspects: super-trendy oils like jojoba and argan, as well as reliable standby sunflower. Evening primrose oil is an unique addition, it&#8217;s <a href="https://nccih.nih.gov/health/eveningprimrose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not as well-studied</a> as something like coconut oil or olive oil for hair care, but it has been used in traditional medicine for a long time.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear if there&#8217;s anything particular that makes this oil better than others; one tester even called it &#8220;boring,&#8221; and on reflection, some testers said it was their least-favorite. That said, the blind-test ratings were consistently a few points higher for this oil in every category.</p>
<p>Scent options are diverse and mostly come from added essential oils:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MQKODUO?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cedarwood</a> is the ever-popular choice of lumbersexual instagram influencers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0182RJU3K?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sandalwood</a> adds a little more heat than cedar for an exotic touch.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016J3G9MO?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bay Rum</a> is a classic aftershave scent, distant cousin of Old Spice. Also includes coconut oil.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MRLZXJ7?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gentlemen&#8217;s Scent</a> offers a captivating, manly aroma.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WF6VFSS?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Unscented</a> is what we tested. It&#8217;s definitely scent-free.</li>
</ul>
<p>The catch, then, is price. It&#8217;s not clear if The Gentlemen&#8217;s Beard is paying a lot of extra money for the unique ingredient, maybe they&#8217;re buying it in 4-oz bottles. At nearly $20 for an ounce, this is a very expensive product.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.target.com/p/beardbrand-153-blank-slate-beard-oil-1-fl-oz/-/A-52735474" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Beardbrand</a> and a few other carefully marketed &#8220;premium&#8221; brands are aiming for even bigger margins, but at least in this case we found that maybe a little bit of the extra cost was justified.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Gentlemen&#8217;s Beard is an Amazon-exclusive beard care company that has picked just the right blend of oils.</li>
<li>All the expected premium oils are here, and evening primrose oil is a unique addition.</li>
<li>Four scents and an unscented blend, so everyone should be able to find something that works.</li>
<li>That price, though. Ouch.</li>

<p>Sometimes you try a personal care product that works well, but has a scent you dislike, and Honest Amish was that way for many of our testers.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M49SG0Q/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honest-amish-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honest-amish-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honest-amish-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honest-amish-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honest-amish-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honest-amish-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honest-amish-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honest-amish-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honest-amish.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Another Great Value: Honest Amish</h3><p>If you're OK with the licorice scent, this is another great oil blend, tied for lowest price.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M49SG0Q/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The performance, value and availability of Honest Amish are all great; very close to our top pick, with slightly better performance on average. The trouble, then, is that it comes in one scent: a faint-but-distinct blend of essential oils, the strongest notes being clove and anise.</p>
<p>If you love black licorice, you might love this; maybe even better if your partner loves black licorice. For the rest of us (especially those with spouses who veto the scent) it&#8217;s a no-go.</p>
<p>Honest Amish is one of the older beard-oil-makers, starting up in 2012 after selling a successful balm recipe at Pennsylvania flea markets. They didn&#8217;t have any other scents available when we started our testing, but it looks like they may be launching two other scents. More options from this company would be very welcome!</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Honest Amish beard oil ranked best overall for softening beards.</li>
<li>This isn&#8217;t quite as long-lasting as our top pick, so keep the bottle handy on dry days.</li>
<li>Value is great, with a big dropper bottle for a low price.</li>
<li>The scent is polarizing; do you want your beard to smell like black licorice?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cremo</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JQXACS6/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cremo</a> is a brand that has done impressive work building an empire of grooming products. Starting with a super-concentrated shaving cream (which we named <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-shaving-cream/">best shaving cream</a>), they&#8217;ve expanded into all corners of the shaving aisle: pomade, body wash, solid cologne and a lineup of beard oils, balms and shampoos.</p>
<p>For performance factors, Cremo ranked in the solid upper-middle of our samples. A little longer-lasting than most, but on the whole a very average oil. Looking at the ingredients, that&#8217;s no wonder: there&#8217;s basically every kind of oil imaginable in this blend.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for trustworthy ingredients and a small bottle you can buy at a local discount retailer for a gift, Cremo&#8217;s stuff is easy to find and comes in a range of four scents. At $12.50 per ounce, though, it&#8217;s closer to the &#8220;luxury&#8221; end of the pricing scale.</p>
<h3>V76 by Vaughn</h3>
<p>The V76 label is a luxury brand that&#8217;s purportedly curated by a top hairstylist, with products made by some cosmetics company somewhere &#8220;exclusively&#8221; for the private label. As skeptical as that idea makes us, their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EBTAUNW/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">V76 beard oil</a> is unique enough to get an inclusion here.</p>
<p>This blend of oils includes a long list of nearly every obvious skin and hair care oil we can think of. The consistency, though, is different than every other blend we tried; it&#8217;s very nearly sticky, so it seems to give a little bit more weight to beard hairs than the other oils.</p>
<p>That said, in a blind test this oil didn&#8217;t really garner any more or less praise than average. The most notable thing about it is a strong sandalwood scent; if that&#8217;s your thing it should be fine, but it&#8217;s a more concentrated smell than most scented oils we tried.</p>
<h3>Ranger</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0118B5O7I?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ranger</a> is a spin-off from the Leven Rose line of essential oils. At $16 per ounce it&#8217;s actually on the upper end of the price scale we tested, though still far less than buying EE blends through your friend&#8217;s girlfriend&#8217;s MLM company.</p>
<p>This is just rosehip, argan and jojoba oil, so it absorbs quickly; second-fastest according to our blind test. Two essential oil scent options and an unscented blend make this a solid line of beard oils, but not exceptional.</p>
<h3>Beardbrand</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.target.com/p/beardbrand-153-blank-slate-beard-oil-1-fl-oz/-/A-52735474" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Beardbrand</a> is the two-ton gorilla in this lineup. Eric Bandholz turned his love for sweet beards into an explicit mission: to &#8220;change the way society views beardsmen&#8221; through a lifestyle brand. He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXyeYhT7NYQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed that mission accomplished in 2017</a>, making his new tagline &#8220;keep on growing.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a meteoric rise following an appearance on Shark Tank (where he happily admitted that his $25-40 bottles of oil cost about $2 to make), Bandholz has turned his oil into the fuel for a beard-centered lifestyle brand juggernaut. Now there&#8217;s a network of beard bloggers and Instagrammers sharing how awesome it is to have a beard, sponsored by the best-known beard oil.</p>
<p>That said, Beardbrand has drawn its share of criticism. One prominent YouTuber even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0hwNjX3BUI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called out Beardbrand on the &#8220;premium&#8221; label</a>, noting that nearly every beard oil is using &#8220;premium&#8221; ingredients and that the price brackets are all about tricking people.</p>
<p>Bandholz basically <a href="https://youtu.be/oEskpW6X7kg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted this in his rebuttal</a>, but he&#8217;s unapologetic about creating a successful business that makes people happy (and happy to spend lots of money).</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in more sophisticated scents than bare-bones cedar or sandalwood oil, Beardbrand &#8220;<a href="https://www.beardbrand.com/products/gold-line-beard-oil-collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gold line</a>&#8221; of Temple Smoke, Four Vices and Old Money is aimed at you.</p>
<p>The catch, for us, was performance. Overall, our testers felt that the oil (&#8220;designed to be very lightweight&#8221; says the ad copy) just didn&#8217;t have the staying power they were looking for. If it were the same price as other oils, we could call that a matter of preference, but $25 per ounce is pretty steep.</p>
<p>Beardbrand used to only sell direct through their website, but they&#8217;ve got their two most popular oils in <a href="https://www.target.com/p/beardbrand-153-blank-slate-beard-oil-1-fl-oz/-/A-52735474" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Target</a> at $15 now. If you find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IZMZGWM/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Beardbrand on Amazon</a>, it&#8217;s probably someone re-selling a bottle they bought directly, with prices to match.</p>
<p>Now that it&#8217;s available for $15 per ounce, we look more favorably on Beardbrand&#8217;s product, but Cremo has a growing line of scents and accessories that looks like it&#8217;s beat Beardbrand to the punch. (Plus, we liked Cremo&#8217;s eye-dropper bottles better for dispensing oil.)</p>
<h3>Grave Before Shave</h3>
<p>If you bump into a display of beard oil at a hip barbershop, it&#8217;ll likely have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V53NTKO?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Grave Before Shave</a> products. The guys at Fisticuffs LLC have targeted their brand at the bearded-skull-tattoo subculture (we didn&#8217;t really realize that was a thing, either) and they&#8217;ve grown into a mainstay among the more bombastic bearded bretheren.</p>
<p>Grave Before Shave has a solid list of ingredients, including tea tree oil for a little tingle, but the oil performed about as well as straight-up fractionated coconut oil. It&#8217;s not bad, but most people will prefer something more balanced.</p>
<p>The strength of this company is the huge range of scents offered. When we were selecting products, they had nine on offer, and most of them can be found on Amazon or in a sample pack from the company&#8217;s website.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After a few months of testing a wide range of oils, our testers said they were between 20- and 30-percent confident they could tell an oil they liked from an oil they didn&#8217;t. What&#8217;s more, many of our testers started to find that they were looking for a little more hold and control than beard oil offers and asked repeatedly if we were going to test <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ybdbeardo-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=8de1ccfe9bf75885defe8507d786d4cc&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;index=hpc&amp;keywords=beard%20balm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">beard balms</a>.</p>
<p>All things considered, though, any beard oil definitely helps a dry and itchy beard. Even if you just use whatever vegetable oil you have in the cupboard, it&#8217;ll help if you find your beard dull and frizzy or if beardruff is cramping your style at formal events.</p>
<p>At a price that&#8217;s very reasonable for a big bottle, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K9KEQA6/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mountaineer Brand</a> is our best buy. It&#8217;s definitely better than buying bulk coconut oil or jojoba oil, and it comes in a range of scents that can add some spice to your beard-care routine.</p>
<p>There are some oils that use a balanced blend of carefully selected oils that get even better performance, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WF6VFSS/?tag=ybdbeardo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Gentlemen&#8217;s Beard</a> had the best score overall in our tests. We don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth the money for most people, but if you&#8217;re looking for a particular scent then it might be worth a splurge.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Starting with the safety razors that carried the most praise on Amazon, we sifted through hundreds of subreddit comments in /r/wicked_edge along with user reviews from sites like <a href="https://www.westcoastshaving.com/Safety-Razors_c_8.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">West Coast Shaving</a> and reviews from sites like <a href="https://sharpologist.com/2017/10/best-safety-razor-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharpologist</a>, pointing us toward the integral features of the best models. While aesthetics were a nice bonus, the essential features of a top-rated razor included easy maneuvering (to find the right shaving angle), minimal nicks/cuts, blade loading and the right amount of aggression.</p>
<p>Looking at sites like Best Reviews, Sharpologist, West Coast Shaving and more, we also hunted for a spread of different safety razors, avoiding several popular razors too similar to other well-reviewed models that made the final cut. Since price and overall value were also consistent themes, we focused on razors under $40 with at least 500 reviews from credible vendors and a minimum rating of 4.3 out of five. We ultimately selected razors that provided different levels of aggressiveness, allowing us to consider the viewpoints of both the experienced safety razor shaver and also the novice considering a switch.</p>

<h2 id="why-safety-razor">Why a safety razor?</h2>
<p>Beneath the carefully crafted designs and methodology of the best razors, shavers tend to come back to a quintessential question: what’s the fastest and most effective way to shave without bloodshed? While <a href="https://www.amazon.com/cartridge-razor/s?ie=UTF8&amp;page=1&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Acartridge%20razor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">cartridge razors</a> are very popular options for wet shaving — balancing attractive upfront prices with exceptional ease of use — they also have a reputation for using lower-quality steel blades that can make it difficult to get a truly close shave. <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-straight-razor/" rel="noopener">Straight razors</a> have also had somewhat of a renaissance, allowing users the possibility of a simple and very close shave, but they’re notoriously difficult to get accustomed to for someone who normally uses either a cartridge or electric razor.</p>
<p>Enter the safety razor, which offers the best of both worlds. Safety razors still showcase the features that King C. Gillette envisioned when his first double-edge safety razors launched near the onset of the 20th century. These days, the impressive variety of safety razors gives shavers plenty of options while searching for the perfect shave, tapping into centuries-old tradition but also allowing countless opportunities for customization. It’s this type of diversity that is at the core of safety razors, allowing them to be a potentially great fit no matter your shaving starting point.</p>
<p>Given the cost of replacing cartridges, and the relatively inexpensive blade replacements for safety razors, it can even be significantly more expensive to use cartridge razors instead of traditional safety razors. Cartridges can also cause bacteria to build-up, a key factor in razor burn. Factor in the wide range of razor heads that cater to many different shaving preferences and it’s easy to see how the best safety razors feed into the desire for customization in the modern age.</p>

<p>When French innovator <a href="http://www.shaveworld.org/home/Perret.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jean-Jacques Perret</a> first pondered the concept of a safety razor in the 1760s, men were still shaving by candlelight in front of poorly polished metal mirrors, where they would predictably attack their earlobes nearly as well as they did their chin whiskers. Looking to limit the bloodshed, Perret added a simple wood cover to minimize the exposure of the blade, a basic concept that Gillette would enhance a century later when he looked to mass-produce a safer shaving razor.</p>
<p>Instead of just a wood shield over a straight razor, Gillette’s version was an entirely different model of safety razor that expanded on Perret’s initial concept. The new model came with three detachable pieces, a smaller and thinner stainless steel double-blade and a metal bar that limited blade exposure and provided much more control and safety.</p>
<p>Shortly after inventing the modern safety razor, Gillette began mass-producing affordable disposable blades at the beginning of the 20th century. The safety razors of today are all variations of the original design, including both the cartridge-style razors that use multiple blades within a disposable head and the classic double-edge razor that is the focus of this review.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>Everyone has a different idea of what they’re looking for in a razor, but several features tend to generate a bulk of the commentary and have an outsized effect on the overall outlook. Unsurprisingly, price and all-around value are main drivers of opinion, although other features like handle design, blade exposure, loading style, guard design and weight all are essentials in the conversation as well.</p>
<h3>Handle length and material</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-9112 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Handle___02.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Handle___02.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Handle___02-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Handle___02-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Handle___02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Handle___02-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Handle___02-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Handle___02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Handle___02-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Handle___02-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Handle___02-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Handle___02-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Handle___02-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Handle___02-768x512@2x.jpg 1536w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Handle___02-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Handle___02-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Finding the right handle length is a balancing act that leads to different preferences for every shaver. The 4-inch long handle is standard with some of the most highly respected razors, although the classic early 20th century 3-inch models remain popular as well. Some manufacturers have created adjustable models, yet they have never really hit the mainstream — much like the 2-inch travel razors. There are also plenty of handles in the middle that don’t fall directly into either category.</p>
<p>As for materials, many manufacturers opt for the brass handle with a polished chrome finish, giving it an eye-pleasingly smooth look that is also designed to ward off rusting. Others prefer stainless steel, which is generally advertised as being less likely to chip than its chrome counterparts. Though less prominent than polished handles, matte finishes as well as colorful glossy finishes are not uncommon, specifically with upscale razors being marketed as modern takes on classic razors. While tubular handles are standard, we discovered plenty of creative handle designs, including specially designed cigar and barrel-shaped handles as well as handcrafted handles that combine elements from various razors.</p>
<p>Because the first safety razors users found out the hard way that wet handles can slip, different manufacturers have also tried an assortment of different ways to create the best grip possible. The typical solution was to create knurled handles with ridged patterns built right into the metal (or plastic), giving designers a chance to show some visual flair while also solving a practical problem of wet shaving. Even the top-rated synthetic plastic safety razors tend to have a knurled handle, although the texture can range from fairly rough to nearly smooth, with many different distinguishing patterns to separate from the competition.</p>
<h3>Weight</h3>
<p>The weight of a razor has a variety of ways that it can impact the overall shave. While light razors can still provide a great shave, heavier razors are preferred by many because they let the weight actually do the bulk of the work. The more pressure that a shaver has to exert, the better the chance that more passes will be needed, increasing the likelihood of skin irritation. True to expectations, heavier models like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NTHWLU/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parker &#8211; 99R</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003LW4L2W/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Edwin Jagger &#8211; DE89</a> did very well in overall ease of shaving, outperforming lighter models like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NL0T1G/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Merkur &#8211; MK 23C</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YJ70NY/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Feather &#8211; Popular</a>.</p>
<p>The weight is also a determinative factor the razor’s point of balance, which is the <a href="http://www.primandprep.com/how-to-hold-a-safety-razor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">typically the easiest way to find the best grip</a> for a shave. Most safety razors are designed to balance on your pointer finger about an inch away from the head; for others, this can be slightly less than an inch. Once you find the balance point, securing the razor with your thumb is generally all you need to obtain a workable grip, which is why it’s particularly useful to find a razor that has a point of balance you prefer. Although it may not seem important to a safety razor rookie, the point of balance influences your shave — whether you notice it or not.</p>
<h3>Guard design</h3>
<p>Guard designs typically fall into four main categories: straight safety bars, slanted safety bars, adjustable guards and open combs. Easily the most popular is the straight safety bar, which simply provides a straight buffer between your face and the blade. Within the straight safety bar, many manufacturers create a ridge along the bar for aesthetic purposes, a design usually referred to as “scalloped” or “microcomb system.” Designed for thicker beards, slanted safety bars can yield a slightly more aggressive shave, slicing at an angle down on your beard.</p>
<p>Also geared towards the thicker beards, open comb guards have small gaps in the bar — just like a comb — and let you put an additional amount of pressure on the edge of the blade. Lastly, the adjustable guard designs give shavers the ultimate freedom to choose their blade gap, although they tend to be high-end razors and fall outside the scope of this review. A few examples of adjustable heads include the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000G0JZYQ/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Merkur Futur</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XJBBJMQ/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parker Variant Adjustable</a> and <a href="https://rockwellrazors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rockwell 6C</a>, among others.</p>
<h3>Loading Style</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/razor-blade-install.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Considering that convenience has been a crucial aspect of shaving since early man was using shark teeth and clamshells, a razor that doesn’t easily load can be a deal-breaker. One of the most popular loading styles is the butterfly open of a one-piece razor, which opens the razor head with a few quick turns of a knob handle (generally at the bottom). Butterfly razors, also commonly called twist-to-open, typically score high in terms of blade-loading convenience, although the drawbacks are an elevated chance of clogs and a harder time with cleaning.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, three-piece razors are an absolute breeze when it comes to cleaning out those hair holdovers. Even if it takes a few extra seconds to unscrew the handle from the two head pieces, well-made traditionally loading safety razors are still anything, but a problem when it comes to loading, and can even encourage good cleaning habits. At the end of the day, shavers typically have to decide whether they value the pure convenience of the butterfly or the old-school style and cleanliness of the standard three-piece razor.</p>
<h2>Aggressiveness</h2>
<p>Although a few different features will give clues about a razor’s aggressiveness, ultimately the perceived level of aggressiveness by the shaver is what is important. This is why quantifying a razor’s aggressiveness level can be very difficult, as the process is as much art as science and each shaver will experience the razor differently. Shavers who prefer mild razors usually like them because they are less likely to produce cuts or skin irritation, making them ideal for new safety razor users and those with sensitive skin. Razors on the aggressive side are designed to provide a much closer shave, which is why they tend to be favorites for experienced shaving enthusiasts and those with thicker beards.</p>
<p>Those looking to pinpoint a razor’s aggressiveness can focus on two important metrics to provide a basic guideline: blade gap and blade exposure. Although other features (e.g. weight, shaving angle) also contribute to the overall aggressiveness, determining the blade gap and blade exposure is essential to separate razors that otherwise might be very similar.</p>
<h3>Blade gap</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-9110 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-768x512@2x.jpg 1536w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BladeCLoseup_03-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Even tenths of a millimeter between the guard plate and the blade can change everything when it comes to a razor’s aggressiveness. While fairly mild razors like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NL0T1G/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Merkur &#8211; MK 23C</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YJ70NY/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Feather &#8211; Popular</a> land in the 0.61 to 0.64 mm range for blade gap, it’s not uncommon for an aggressive razor to have a blade gap well north of one millimeter. On the extreme side, adjustable razors like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000G0JZYQ/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Merkur Futur</a> can have a blade gap of 1.75 mm for the top end of the adjustable settings. The blade gap between the guard plate and blade also affects how easily you can clean up after a shave, as larger gaps won&#8217;t collect plugs of stubble and shaving cream as easily.</p>
<h3>Blade exposure</h3>
<p>Even though the blade gap often gets the bulk of the attention, partially because the data is more readily available, the blade exposure is still critical in determining aggressiveness. Blade exposure is simply the amount of blade that protrudes from the edge of the razor head, which combines with the blade gap, weight and shaving angle to create a general level of aggressiveness. A head that has significant exposure, like the V3A head on the <a href="http://www.maggardrazors.com/product/maggard-razors-mr7-knurled-handle-chrome-safety-razor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maggard &#8211; MR7</a>, will end up feeling more aggressive than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NTHWLU/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parker &#8211; 99R</a> despite having nearly an identical blade gap of 0.89.</p>
<p>The problem with blade exposure as a metric is that it is much harder to measure. Even though actual measurements for blade exposure are rare, a basic rating scale from mild (limited exposure) to aggressive (maximum exposure) can easily give you an idea of how aggressive a razor is, particularly if you have measurements for blade gap. Whether you’re looking for mild and easy or want to push the upper limits of aggressiveness, the blade gap and blade exposure can be great metrics to help get you started.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Our group of five testers started with their normal razors, giving us a chance to see what they liked about their own razors before moving on to the test group. To make sure the group started on the same page, testers were encouraged to shower before each shave, one of the recommended ways to properly prime the skin. Instead of using a new shaving soap or cream across the board, however, testers were instructed to continue using what they were accustomed to, as a change could distort the data and lead to skin irritation that may not be a reflection of the razor.</p>

<p>Each test razor was then loaded solely with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Y4FFIEK/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Voskhod Teflon-coated blades</a>, which fit every standard double-edge razor and can be purchased inexpensively in hundred-packs. Testers used each razor five times at their normal rate of shaving, rating the razors from 0-5 in a range of different categories: ease of maneuvering, closeness of shave, blade loading, ease of rinse, construction material and overall satisfaction. Each tester was also asked to check their pride and keep track of any nicks/cuts not attributable to user error, finishing each razor by jotting down a detailed description of their experience.</p>
<p>After the test period was over, each tester looked through their results and came up with their favorite razor as well as their runner-up and least favorite. By breaking down the individual scores for each category compared with the macro views of the testers, we were then able to determine the razors that best held up during the process and performed the best.</p>

<p>Smooth and substantial to hold, easy to use and a tremendous all-around value, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NTHWLU/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parker &#8211; 99R</a> scored very well with both the most experienced shavers and the tester who has been using electric razors for years. Parker may not have been one of the original trailblazers in the space, but the 99R model has perfected the twist-to-open style with an eye-appealing design and materials that feel built to last. The 99R’s blade gap is even on the aggressive side, though that doesn’t stop it from delivering a comfortable, close shave.</p>

Unless you're wearing a blindfold, it’s almost impossible to have a bad shaving experience.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NTHWLU/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The Gillette SuperSpeed is generally considered the prototypical butterfly-open safety razor, a model that was very popular in the years before disposable cartridges took over. Four decades after the SuperSpeed was in its heyday, the Parker 99R carries on the torch with a 4-inch chrome-plated handle, spiral knurl grip and a weighty design meant to do the heavy-lifting portion of your shaving routine.</p>
<p>Elegant and sharp to look at, but not over-designed, the 99R also has a lightly ribbed (microcombed) straight safety bar and one of the thicker handles that you’ll find on a safety razor. Though the blade gap of 0.89 was more aggressive than most of the other test razors in the group, all five testers found it natural to maneuver and ended up with minimal nicks and cuts. The girth and weight of the handle also yielded a point of balance much closer to the center than is typical, making some of the slender-handled models feel somewhat flimsy by comparison.</p>
<h3>The features that testers loved</h3>
<p>With its simple twist-to-open knob at the handle base and standard butterfly open, the Parker was clearly going to be in the running for easiest to load, and it more than lived up to the billing with the highest score in this category. A surprising find? Testers found that it cleaned very easily, a feature that twist-to-open one-piece razors are definitely <i>not</i> known for. While this could change over the longer haul as the shaves begin to pile up, it’s a great sign that cleaning the head isn’t the problem that some butterfly opens tend to have.</p>
<p>Thanks to its bulkier design, it also might be easy to anticipate a few problems in terms of overall maneuverability, yet this turned out not to be a problem for testers. The long handle and central point of balance combined to create an easy shaving angle that made it one of the top performers in maneuverability; only the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B011L8WJIA/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Viking &#8211; Chieftain</a> scored as high, matching the 99R with a 4.2 out of five.</p>
<p>Although it was right in the middle of the pack for shaving closeness, the convenience factor and the overall shave elevated it to the top of the list for three out of the five testers. It was also the only tested razor to avoid an overall satisfaction rating of lower than four and wasn’t named by any of the testers as the least favorite of the group.</p>
<p>At face value, the Parker 99R is the razor equivalent of a moderately priced sedan, built to get the kids to soccer practice and back home again without the frequent trips to the mechanic. In action, however, the 99R proves that it has much more under the hood than it does on the surface, providing a user-friendly and luxurious shaving experience that is easy to appreciate no matter your shaving background.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NTHWLU/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parker &#8211; 99R</a> may seem aggressive with its 0.89 blade gap, but its limited blade exposure and heavyweight design makes for an incredibly easy shave while still getting close.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to its simple twist-to-open design and sturdy materials, blade-changing is as fast and easy as possible with a safety razor.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike some other one-piece, butterfly razors, cleaning the 99R isn’t problematic.</li>

<p>Don’t let the name of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B011L8WJIA/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Viking &#8211; Chieftain</a> fool you. Though it may sound harsh and menacing, it is more of a mild-mannered charmer than the bane of a civilization. With its microcomb system embedded in its safety bar, the one-piece Chieftain is designed to placate irritable skin while still providing a close shave with its limited blade exposure.</p>
<p>Our razor collector friends tell us this is one of many clones of the classic Gillette &#8211; SuperSpeed, probably made by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M1VGXT1/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baili as the BD17</a> and re-packaged with the custom travel case. The polished 3-inch chrome handle and knurled grip make it look slightly like a Viking axe ready for battle, though 18 months after we tested this group it&#8217;s now easy to find this same design under different names if you look. An updated version of the Chieftain has a new nameplate on the bottom of the head, but as far as we can tell none of the important design geometry has changed.</p>

<p>Designed for convenience at home or on the go, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011L8WJIA/?tag=ybdsafet-20&amp;th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chieftain</a> delivers a smooth shaving experience complete with easy blade loading and just enough aggression to satisfy shaving enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Much more important than the aesthetics, however, the Chieftain performed extremely well in the key categories. Although the butterfly open was a touch flimsier than the brass-bodied <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NTHWLU/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parker &#8211; 99R</a>, the Chieftain was still a cinch to load and was as easy to maneuver as any razor in the group.  The Chieftain scored the highest in the group in closeness, left the least number of cuts and nicks and finished just behind the Parker in overall satisfaction, showcasing its combination of convenience and comfort that put it in the running for the top razor.</p>
<p>The Chieftain even came with a nice little bonus: a surprisingly effective case that accompanies most purchases and highlights the razor’s versatility as both an everyday option and travel companion. Although packaging won&#8217;t make it shave better, The Chieftain’s practical and elegant leatherette travel case works perfectly with its shorter handle and could slide into a work or travel bag without you even knowing it’s there.</p>

<p>The name <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003LW4L2W/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Edwin Jagger &#8211; DE89</a> tends to command respect in the world of double-edge safety razors, and the DE89 certainly points to the reasons why that holds true. The Edwin Jagger’s 3.7-inch handle is a manageable length, the construction material (polished chrome over brass) convinced testers it was a high quality, and it demonstrated a nice balance between comfort and aggressiveness. Although lighter than the Parker, the EJ’s handle is just as thick as its counterpart and shows off an attractive, vertically-knurled grip that contributes to its overall classic look.</p>

<p>Even though it has a blade gap on the mild side, the DE89 slightly topped the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NTHWLU/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parker &#8211; 99R</a> in shave closeness and scored higher in ease of blade-loading than the other multi-piece razors that we tested. Still, we were left unconvinced that it would truly make the best safety razor for beginners despite the company’s own marketing efforts. Thanks to middle-of-the-road maneuverability, a unique handle length and more difficulty loading than the top butterfly models, beginners might be better off going for an option centered more on pure convenience. But even with a less than ideal starting point for safety razor rookies, the Edwin Jagger &#8211; DE89 is a very good all-around razor.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">High-quality material and a comfortable all-around shave make the Edwin Jagger &#8211; DE89 a great long-term shaving option.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Easy to get a close shave despite a minimal blade gap/exposure and overall mild feel.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Ergonomic, but classy design make for a razor that is as eye-appealing as it is effective.</li>

<h3>Feather &#8211; Popular</h3>
<p>Not to discriminate against the synthetic plastic safety razors, we also tested the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YJ70NY/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Feather &#8211; Popular</a>, a generally well-liked and inexpensive butterfly model that failed to make much of a connection with testers. Without the classic look of its more substantial metal counterparts or the pure convenience of a cartridge razor, the Feather simply had a rough comparison with the best models in the price range. In a vacuum, however, the Feather would probably get a chance to shine brighter thanks to its easy-to-load head, decent maneuverability and unbeatable price tag (typically under $20).</p>
<h3>Baili &#8211; BT171</h3>
<p>While the Merkur 23C held its own next to the competition, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M1LFKPE/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baili &#8211; BT171</a> missed the mark despite showing flashes of potential. More than anything, the Baili proved difficult to tame, as three different testers reported at least three nicks/cuts. This is a modern clone of a classic Gillette &#8211; Tech, and it&#8217;s a razor that works well for a lot of people, but takes some practice. No other razor had more than one tester who ended up with at least three different nicks or cuts not attributed to user error. Where it did score fairly well, however, was the construction material (another polished chrome finish) and in closeness of shave, even though testers paid for their smooth faces with a bit of bloodshed.<br />
This model from Baili shows up under a variety of names if you look around for it, and our original test was of a popular but now-disappeared Amazon brand called &#8220;Smoothere.&#8221; The travel case with its tiny shaving mirror is, we have to admit, a nice touch. You can also find versions of this razor sold by boutique shaving shops, sometimes with different handles like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MA53LRO?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the DE1 from The Italian Barber.</a></p>
<h3>Maggard &#8211; MR7</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.maggardrazors.com/product/maggard-razors-mr7-knurled-handle-chrome-safety-razor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maggard &#8211; MR7</a>, is a unique safety razor that comes with a few different head choices. Looking to pick a head on the aggressive side, we went with the V3A, a zinc alloy, chrome-plated head with a (scalloped) close-combed safety bar that yielded an aggressive shave not to be taken lightly. Though the Maggard had no problem getting a very close shave, even the testers used to aggressive heads saw an uptick in cuts while greenhorns found it nearly impossible to use.</p>
<p>Having said that, the Maggard &#8211; MR7 is still a highly respected razor that could still be a great option for intermediate or expert shavers, though even veteran safety razor users could have a learning curve with the aggressiveness of the V3A head. Other head options that might be better suited to warm shavers up to the Maggard &#8211; MR7 include the open-combed V2 and the standard version of the V3.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>For anyone intimidated by the prospect of switching from cartridge to a safety razor, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NTHWLU/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parker &#8211; 99R</a> is a classic-looking butterfly razor that promises a soft landing for both face and wallet alike. Rating well for both overall shave and value, the Parker is simple for beginners, but aggressive enough for more seasoned shavers to get their money’s worth, making it a rare razor that can satisfy a host of different beards and shaving styles. While the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B011L8WJIA/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Viking &#8211; Chieftain</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003LW4L2W/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Edwin Jagger &#8211; DE89</a> were also comfortable, convenient and very good overall safety razors, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NTHWLU/?tag=ybdsafet-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parker &#8211; 99R</a> stood above the pack as the clear top pick in its price range.

<h2 id="why-a-straight">Why a straight razor?</h2>
<p>There are a few differences between shaving with a straight razor and a safety razor (the latter category includes basically any razor that’s T-shaped).</p>
<p>The biggest difference is the lack of a safety “bar” or “guard” between you and the blade that guides you to a “correct” shaving angle. A straight razor gives you only the naked edge. The wedge shape of a straight razor can still guide you to a good angle for efficient shaving, but it doesn’t force you into an angle the way safety designs do.</p>
<p>This means that more skill is required to shave with a straight razor, but it also means that you can cut through stubble that would clog a safety razor. What’s more, without a guard you can see exactly where the edge is cutting, and that’s why straight razors are so much preferred by barbers doing precise “lineups” for hair edges.</p>
<p>It’s sometimes possible to find a safety razor that cuts at exactly the right angle for your facial hair growth pattern, but with a straight razor the only thing that’s standing between you and a perfect shave is technique. It takes some time to get a feel for that angle, but the rewards are <em>very</em> satisfying.</p>

<p>The hardest part of shaving with a straight razor is making your skin as flat as possible so that you can get the edge of the blade right on the skin without nicks. The jawline is especially tricky to shave with a straight razor, but you can stretch your skin so the part you’re shaving will be either above or below the jawbone and lying flat.</p>
<p>There’s some debate about the “best” way to hold a razor. The handle can swing almost 360 degrees around the blade, and some shavers prefer to leave it sticking out straight, while some prefer it folded to one side or the other to move the balance closer to the blade. Some even shave ambidextrously, switching hands when they switch sides of the face. The options are dizzying, but most will quickly find a comfortable, natural grip in the dominant hand and adjust as needed for different parts of the face.</p>

<p>The angle of blade to skin isn’t fixed, the way it is with a safety razor. A shallower angle (with the back or “spine” of the blade closer to the face) will do less harsh scraping against your skin, but a steep angle (with the edge digging in more) may be required to get under your nose and into the contours of your lips.</p>
<p>Some razors are known for audible feedback often described as “ringing” as the edge cuts through stubble. Thin-ground blades like those made in Germany since the late 19th Century are sometimes called “singing” razors. All razors will make some sound as they cut your stubble, and if you listen closely you can use this feedback to learn how the angle of the blade to skin changes the way a razor cuts.</p>
<p>Every razor system takes some getting used to. Trying a straight razor can easily lead to tiny nicks and some redness. With time, your technique will improve and your skin will adjust to the closer shave; it’s not something to pick up for the first time the day of your wedding or a big interview.</p>
<p>Shaving with a straight also takes more time than shaving with a safety razor (how long it takes depends on your skill and your nerve).</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FA35K02/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">alum block</a> (to help minor irritation) and a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000YM76VU/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">styptic pencil</a> (to stop any bleeding), though, are all you really need to deal with the adjustment period. It’s certainly possible to hurt yourself with a straight edge, but the sharp blade encourages cautious behavior. You’re more likely to get a cut from careless or rushed shaving with a modern disposable razor.</p>
<p>Many will recommend that you use a straight razor only on your cheeks at first, then carry the technique of careful grain-following and skin-stretching with a safety razor to your jaw, neck and lips until you gain confidence.</p>

<p>The biggest barrier to success when starting out with a traditional straight razor is maintenance. Any straight razor will almost certainly be sharper than the sharpest kitchen knife you’ve ever used, but to give a smooth irritation-free shave the edge needs to be perfect and stay that way.</p>
<p>The stakes here are high: you’re not slicing charcuterie for Instagram pictures, you’re shaving hair off some of the most sensitive skin on your body.</p>
<p>The cross-section shape of a straight razor is actually a built-in sharpening guide, so sharpening or “honing” a straight razor isn’t a test of a steady hand so much as practiced understanding of what defects need to be honed out. We’re not going to discuss all of the skills, but here are some great resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://michaelsleen.blogspot.com/2013/01/hone-basics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Leen</a> has a good rundown of the basics, including some videos and animations.</li>
<li><a href="http://shavelibrary.com/index.php/Beginner's_Guide_to_Honing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Shave Library wiki</a> has a more in-depth collection of info gleaned from enthusiast discussions.</li>
<li><a href="http://shavelibrary.com/index.php/Lynn_Abrams_On_Honing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This page</a> is a collection of Lynn Abram’s famous posts on his “pyramid” methodology for honing razors.</li>
<li>Or check out the “Unicot” honing method <a href="http://www.coticule.be/unicot.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as described by the editors of Couticle.be</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These articles reference high-end waterstones designed for someone sharpening a shop full of woodworking tools. Sharpening gear to maintain a razor doesn’t <em>have</em> to be prohibitively expensive, though. A set of ultra-fine abrasive sheets stuck to a piece of flat glass can replace both the “only hone you need” <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006NFDPI/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Norton 4k/8k combination stone</a> and an ultra-fine finishing hone like the the legendary Escher or Couticle barber hones. (Sheets will wear out quickly, though, so stones are a valuable investment if you want to build a collection.)</p>
<p>Even with a brand new straight razor, it’s highly recommended to send a razor out for sharpening by a professional “honemeister.” <strong>If you want to learn to hone your own gear, the edge from a pro’s hones will give you something to which you can compare your own developing skills.</strong></p>
<p>There are many, many experts to choose from. <a href="https://www.maggardrazors.com/services/honing-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maggard Razors</a> or <a href="http://theperfectedge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Perfect Edge</a> are some of the best-known and considered very reliable. Anthony Sculimbrene did a very interesting “on location” recording with Howard Schechter of The Perfect Edge on his <a href="http://www.geargeekslive.com/gear-geeks-live-audio-adventure-1-seeking-the-ultimate-edge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gear Geeks Live podcast</a>. If you want an idea of what goes into getting a straight razor perfectly sharp, have a listen.</p>
<p>Once you or a professional get a razor as sharp as possible, the edge can be maintained for a long time with only <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001DYM5TG/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a leather strop</a>. Cutting hair typically won’t <em>blunt</em> the blade for a long time, but the micron-thin edge can become misaligned and needs to be carefully smoothed back into shape so it can shave perfectly. This is done by carefully sliding the blade backward over the strop&#8217;s firm, smooth leather.</p>
<p>A set of strops with ultra-fine abrasive pastes applied can also replace a set of finishing hones for occasional maintenance of an edge that starts perfect and doesn’t need anything more than a bit of refinement.</p>
<p>Touch-ups like this shouldn&#8217;t need to be frequent, but different steels and different hairs will wear against each other at different rates, so it&#8217;s hard to set a guideline. Once you acquire gear to re-polish an edge yourself, it&#8217;s easy to get more and more picky about how perfect your edges are and pull out the strops or finishing hones every month or so.</p>

<p>If all that talk of maintenance leaves you lost, confused and ready to give up any hope of owning a straight razor, stay with us. There’s an answer to your concern.</p>
<p>We considered testing some budget-priced straight razors, but the reputation of so-called “shave-ready” bargain straight razors is pretty bad. Even $100 razors from old-world brands like Böker and Dovo are often not quite sharp enough for a good shave out of the box, and there are even well-respected &#8220;honemeisters&#8221; who get troubling reviews about &#8216;budget restoration&#8217; razors shipping with less-than-ready edges.</p>
<p>Instead of talking about products that may or may not be ready to use when you buy them, we decided to cover a specific area of the straight razor market that’s a bit more beginner-friendly: the disposable-blade barber razor.</p>
<p>Disposable-blade straight razors like the Durham Duplex and Weck Sextoblade were invented for convenience around the turn of the 20th century, but the concept carved out a bigger niche when evolving health code standards began to prohibit barbers from using the same blade on multiple patrons.</p>
<p><strong>The biggest advantage to a disposable blade is that you’ll never have to sharpen it or second-guess how sharp it <em>could</em> be if a pro were doing the maintenance.</strong> So long as you can get replacement blades for your disposable-blade straight razor, every shave can be exactly as smooth as the last.</p>

<p>The other advantage to a disposable blade razor is price: these are tools made to be affordable for working barbers and beauty-school students, while the good solid-blade straight razors of today are handmade for enthusiasts and collectors.</p>
<p>Despite the low cost of initial purchase compared to a handmade German razor, the cost of the refill blades is something to consider. They’re no more expensive than safety razor blades, though, and the cost of the more expensive disposable blades for a year would barely buy you one professional sharpening for an old-school blade.</p>
<p>There are a few other drawbacks to disposable blades. For one, the blades and the razors that go with them have evolved to be perfect for shaping sideburns, fades and other hair styling techniques. The blades are shorter and thinner, the frame isn’t as helpful for finding a gentle cutting angle and the lighter weight might trick a novice into using too much pressure. The fact that you don’t even have to think about maintaining the blade offsets these concerns, but it’s something to be aware of.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We set a budget of $80 per straight razor, and that finished any debate about pricier solid-blade straight razors. There are some “affordable” solid-blade razors that are said to be great if you know how to get them sharp, but they often don’t come ready for a comfortable shave. Likewise, antique razors can be found nearly everywhere and are sometimes a bargain, but you never really know what you’re going to get.</p>
<p>We polled enthusiasts on the web and local barbers, checked out innumerable Youtube reviews, and selected the highest-rated of three popular and affordable disposable-blade systems.</p>
<p>It might be a bit ironic that we didn’t include <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001QJTYVA/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dovo’s Shavette system</a>, given that ‘shavette’ has basically become a generic term for disposable-blade straight razors. We feel that the models we selected are better-built and easier to work with than the stamped aluminum and plastic “clamshell” blade holder Dovo has designed. (It’s a versatile system, though, so if your goal is to try a variety of blade types you should check it out.)</p>
<p>Startup <a href="https://irvingbarberco.com/collections/razors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Irving Barber Company</a> has a cool magnetic loading system that we investigated, but isn’t available through major retailers and is on the pricey side.</p>
<p>There are many, many other razors in the under-$20 price range, but they all have similar characteristics. We chose the Equinox because it’s a best-seller on Amazon with a very good feedback score. We expected that the Parker would be better, but we wanted to see just how much difference $15 makes.</p>

<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Blade systems</h3>
<p><strong>Double-edge blades:</strong> These razors use the same double-edge or “DE” blades that have been popular in safety razors since King C. Gillette started selling them in 1903. These blades are still widely available in drug stores, supermarkets and other places where you find grooming products the world over.</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blade-install-animation-1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>You have to snap or cut these blades in half. Folding the blade until it snaps is very simple and safe, especially if the blade comes in a paper wrapper. You can also buy the blades pre-cut if you’re never going to use any in a safety razor or if you’re working in a barber shop and can’t spend time snapping blades between customers.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-7750 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/loading-injector-blades.jpg" alt="two razors opened for cleaning" width="900" height="545" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/loading-injector-blades.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/loading-injector-blades-610x369.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/loading-injector-blades-768x465.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/loading-injector-blades-300x182.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/loading-injector-blades-295x179.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/loading-injector-blades-885x536.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/loading-injector-blades-360x218.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/loading-injector-blades-375x227.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/loading-injector-blades-414x251.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/loading-injector-blades-320x194.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/loading-injector-blades-300x182@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><strong>“Mini Hair Shaper” blades:</strong> Personna sells their own version of another classic safety razor blade that died out a long time ago: the Schick Injector. These are already one-sided blades, no snapping required; otherwise they’re quite similar to the DE blades, but a bit thicker and longer-lasting.</p>
<p><strong>Feather Artist Club blades:</strong> These are perhaps the best blades you can buy for any razor. An entire category of safety razors was invented so that people who love these blades could get the sharpness and long-lasting performance in a less-scary daily-shaving package. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008CF6KMC/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Feather “Artist Club” straight</a> is what these blades were designed for. They’re thicker and approximately 50% longer than a DE blade.</p>
<h3>Blade availability</h3>
<p>This isn’t a factor for razor performance, but it might be important for you if you’re buying into a system with the intent to use it every day and won’t always have a backup razor ready to go.</p>
<p>You can buy blades for all of the systems we tested on Amazon and in some specialty stores, but only the DE blades are widely available at local retailers.</p>
<p>DE blades are available from so many manufacturers, it’s a bit tricky sometimes to decide which blades to buy. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J5C2R2M/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sample packs like this</a> are an easy way to experience the entire gamut. <a href="https://www.refinedshave.com/razor-blade-sharpness-summary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Refinedshave.com</a> has methodical and rigorous reviews of DE blades that can help guide your selections.</p>
<p>The “Artist Club” injection-loading razor system is made by Feather, but KAI cutlery and Schick each makes a line of blades that will fit the same razors. (They’re not any more economical or readily available, though.)</p>

<p>We tested these razors for daily shaving for four weeks. Our benchmark for shave quality is a small collection of vintage straight razors from makers like Boker, Wade and Butcher, and a favorite from the Electric Razor Co. While our tester typically uses a double-edge safety razor for daily shaving to save time, he used his straight razors exclusively for a week before beginning tests with this lineup.</p>
<p><strong>The biggest difference between the straight razors we tested and “big boy” solid-blade straight razors is how sharp they are.</strong> Some say their vintage straight razors or modern custom-made razors can get as sharp as a disposable blade, and that’s a real payoff for time invested in developing the skills required. These disposable blades are always sharp, though, for less than 10¢ per shave.</p>
<p>If you’re shaving against the grain of your facial hair to get as close as possible, the first shave with a new extra-sharp blade can leave a little bit more irritation from a machine-sharpened edge than a straight razor carefully smoothed against leather would. People say that traditional straight razors are “more forgiving,” partly for that reason. Some obsessive types will actually strop or run the extra-sharp blades across a cork to smooth out the edge. It’s not required, but if you find that the blades are irritating your skin it’s something you can try.</p>
<p>Our tester likes to wear a mustache, but he shaved it off with the razors as part of testing to make sure every aspect of face-shaving was covered. The skin in those areas was definitely more sensitive and plenty of small nicks showed up. (You’ll get nicks shaving your mustache off with a modern cartridge razor, too, but this was a bit harsher than we’d recommend.)</p>
<p>We didn’t test straight razors for leg shaving, but we’re told that straight razors work very well and are much easier to use on legs than on your own face. (Just be careful around the knees and anklebones.)</p>
<p>We rated the <em><strong>quality</strong></em> of these razors based on a few factors. Looking at the fit and finish of the blades and handles tells you about the care that went into a design; a shiny chrome plating is one thing, but a razor that folds smoothly and is easy to keep clean is most important.</p>
<p>Materials were considered in the quality score; certainly you can get nicer handles and finishes on an expensive heirloom-quality custom or high-end factory-made straight razor. The razors we tested are comparable with the quality you’d find in economical models with Bakelite handles from the turn of the 20th Century, and will serve for a lifetime if you take care of them.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important test of a razor is this: how easy is it to load a blade and get a smooth shave? We carefully noted any difficulties and challenges in daily use of the razors and gave them a <em><strong>design</strong></em> rating on a scale of five.</p>
<p>The balance and weight of each razor was good; even compared to the “gold standard” of a mid-size ⅝” antique straight razor, these new models were under control and capable of doing the job at hand.</p>
<p><strong><em>Efficiency</em></strong> and <strong><em>blade exposure</em></strong> are related, but not identical measurements. Blade exposure is simply the distance the edge of the blade protrudes from the front of the ‘holder.’ We measured this with calipers; given the flexibility of the blade edges there’s a .1 mm margin of error on those numbers.</p>
<p>Efficiency was a more qualitative assessment of how quickly and easily we could get a baby-bottom-smooth shave with a razor system as a whole. A smooth shave is achievable with each razor, but some will get you there with fewer passes or a more gentle shaving angle.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008CF6KMC/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Feather &#8211; Artist Club SS</a> razor is a truly great piece of gear. Sleek curves and modern materials remind you that this is a razor born in the era of injection-molding and wind tunnels, but the balance and smooth pivot remind you of the long tradition of folding straight razors.</p>
<h3>Design and quality</h3>
<p>The handle of the Feather &#8211; SS, while not as shiny as Parker’s or as traditional-looking as the Monsieur Charles, is a great design. You’re going to be holding the shank of the metal blade-holder more than the plastic handle, though, and that’s also carefully shaped to give you enough material to hold onto.</p>

<p>The texturing on the shank of the Monsieur Charles is just a bit easier to hold with wet hands, but the Feather still has a grip that inspires more confidence than the sometimes-slippery thin steel of the Parker and Equinox razors. If you find any razor slippery, shower-shavers claim that rubbing your fingers on an alum block can help you grip through even the messiest water and shaving cream.</p>

<p>Hands-free injecting and disposal of blades is just one more sign of the careful thought and attention that went into this design. The razor clamps the blade with a spring-loaded mechanism, but everything slides apart in one step for easy cleaning.</p>
<p>Blade loading isn’t perfect: despite the blade magazine’s peg-and-socket positive alignment system (undoubtedly inspired by the bygone Schick Injector magazines with their metal-tab “key”) the blades don’t always line up perfectly. If you squeeze the blade holder open with the blade pointed up, though, the blade will always settle exactly where it needs to be.</p>
<p>An innovation to the actual shaving performance of this razor is the cross-section of the blade holder: rather than a wedge, there’s a very slight “hump” on the side just before the blade, which is designed to help you stretch the skin and get a perfect angle of attack relative to your hairs. The system isn’t like a safety razor, but it is a relatively easy straight razor to shave with given how mind-bendingly sharp the blades are.</p>
<p>The shaves from this razor are good, and it’s easy to mow down all the leftover stubble on a second against-the-grain pass. Around the mouth and chin, though, this isn’t a razor that will forgive mistakes. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00279RGRM/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Feather Professional blade</a> will sail through bumps or slice into your skin just like it does with stubble. (As you can imagine, many straight razor enthusiasts grow mustaches and beards.)</p>
<h3>Blade options, with some help for beginners</h3>
<p>Feather’s Artist Club line includes the option of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YJ8N08/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pro Guard</a> blades with a foil guard that will make the shave a bit milder and help prevent the possibility of draw-cut slashes. Impeding the sharpness of the razor is kind of like putting training wheels on a BMX trick bike, but the guard may help you relax and concentrate on learning how to shave with scary-sharp blades.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title">An option for beginners</div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/feather-pro-guard-blades-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/feather-pro-guard-blades-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/feather-pro-guard-blades-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/feather-pro-guard-blades-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/feather-pro-guard-blades-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/feather-pro-guard-blades-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/feather-pro-guard-blades-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/feather-pro-guard-blades-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/feather-pro-guard-blades.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>An Option for Beginners: Feather - Pro Guard Blades</h3><p>The foil guards on these blades help tame Feather's razor while you learn your technique.</p><a href="" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>On the flip side of the learning curve, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00279RGRM/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Feather’s Professional Super</a> blades are thicker and wider, so the edge protrudes 0.2 mm farther from the razor body and will give you a more aggressive shave for extra-coarse hair or long stubble. Think of this as putting a turbocharger on a motorcycle: it’s kind of insane, and probably nobody needs it, but it’s cool that these exist.</p>
<p>In the middle of the range are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00279RGRM/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Feather’s Artist Club Professional</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0724YV49P/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Professional Light</a> blades. We tested the “Pro” blades. The light blades stick out 0.6 mm less and are thinner, so they should give a milder shave.</p>
<h3>Other razors like the SS</h3>
<p>Feather’s Artist Club line includes a few other razors, from the older plated-brass RG model (now harder to find) to the polished-steel DX. The RG and DX are more conventional “wedge” profiles, lacking the “skin stretching hump” of the SS model, and the DX can be ordered with stabilized teak wood handles instead of the autoclave-proof plastic of the SS. For a first-razor pick, the SS has all the right features and is a bargain. Each design is also available in a non-folding <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0060QYUP4/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“Kamisori”</a> model if you don’t care about maintaining western-tradition balance characteristics or folding it for safe storage.</p>
<p>Feather has a few direct competitors in the Asia-Pacific barbershop market: KAI cutlery (owners of Shun, Kershaw and Zero Tolerance knife brands) makes a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002HD68K4/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“Captain” series</a> that’s very similar to Feather’s high-end razors and uses blades that are cross-compatible; KAI doesn’t have any solid distribution for the razors or even the blades in the U.S., though.</p>
<p>Even rarer is the Schick &#8211; ProLine, which is reputed to be a compatible razor at a bargain price. They’re difficult to find but sometimes show up on ebay or international retail sites like Rakuten. Sam Seong and CJB also make budget-priced razors that are compatible, and those are a bit easier to find on Ebay. Feather remains the best buy, though if you find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003G9Z04I/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KAI Captain “mild” blades</a> for a good price they’re supposed to be very good in the Feather SS.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A straight razor is only as good as the sharpness of its edge, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008CF6KMC/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Feather &#8211; Artist Club SS</a> is paired with a line of disposable blades as sharp as you will ever find.</li>
<li>For those whose hands shake at the thought of blades this sharp, there is a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YJ8N08/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">safety-guard version of the blades</a> that’ll help build confidence.</li>
<li>The materials and construction on this razor are modern, but it accomplishes all the best goals of the straight razor tradition.</li>
<li>Hands-free loading and blade disposal are icing on the cake, and it’s easy to see why so many professional barbers and stylists love this razor.</li>
</ul>

Parker has been making safety razors in India since 1973, and started offering a line of straight-edge razors with the SR1 in 2009. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8SFFVO/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parker &#8211; SRX</a> is the evolution of the SR1 design, built with a one-piece handle rather than two separate pieces riveted together; the blade-holding section of the razor is identical across the Parker SR line.</p>

If you already use a DE safety razor, this straight will take your old-dog blades and teach them scary new tricks.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8SFFVO/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Parker has made a solid, well-finished tool for barbers and individuals who want to get the very most out of the world’s most popular blade system. If you use a safety razor that takes double-edge blades, then this is a great way to try out the straight-edge-shaving experience without sinking any money into blades you might decide not to use.</p>
<p>Blade retention is simple but robust: open the clip, separate the two halves of the blade holder (there’s a thumbnail cutout at the tip to make it easy) and place the blade’s v-shaped cutouts against the two posts. Slide the holder back together and pop, everything is solid. The locking clip that folds over the back almost seems unnecessary.</p>
<p>The finish here is mirror-polished steel with clear, crisp, black-inked engraving. The look is retro, but with a touch of sophistication. It’s not quite as sleek as the non-reflective coating and sculpted handle on Feather’s razor, but it has a bit more character.</p>
<p>Parker’s design for the “shank” or “choil” behind the blade is great. While this razor is thinner than the Feather and Personna, the shape encourages your fingers to grip just at the balance point of the razor. If you’re a shower-shaver, you may miss the grip-enhancing ‘jimping’ ridges on the Feather and Personna, but we were very happy with this design.</p>
<p>Blade exposure for this razor is less than the Feather or Personna, but with some careful practice it was still easy to get a close shave on the cheeks and neck. Around the mouth and chin, the slightly-steeper angle did mean a few more “weeper” cuts when shaving against the grain than we got with the Feather Artist Club blades. Even after a solid week of shaving with this razor, it doesn’t always give a blood-free shave on the most sensitive areas of the face. (On the cheeks it’s perfect.)</p>
<p>Availability of double-edge blades, as we mentioned at the top of the article, is better than for any other blade type. Almost anywhere in the world that sells razors and shaving supplies will have double-edge blades, and the list of great brands is too long to get into.</p>
<p>We tried the five Shark blades Parker included and found them good, but not exactly great. Our tester prefers <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BDM0XZG/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Feather’s ultra-sharp Hi-Stainless blades</a> in his safety razor, and they work well here. The Derby blades included with the Equinox razor rank even lower for initial sharpness, and we don’t like the way they pull a little bit instead of cutting effortlessly.</p>

<p>The one problem we had with Parker&#8217;s razor is a consequence of the otherwise-fantastic one-piece metal handle. Without pins to stabilize it, the handle is vulnerable to mis-alignment by bending or aggressive squeezing.</p>
<p>The razor we received was very slightly skewed, so that the blade holder rubbed against one side of the handle when folding it in. This misalignment wasn’t serious enough to cause any problems, and it was quite easy to fix by inserting a table knife into the handle and tweaking it to one side.</p>
<p>The misalignment did hurt the quality and design score for the razor, and if the pristine look of the one-piece handle isn’t something you care as much about, then the slightly-older handle designs in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002PQZEHQ/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">riveted steel</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002OXJ6II/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">black</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NBUFF74/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">white plastic</a> won’t have this vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8SFFVO/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parker &#8211; SRX</a> is a beautiful razor. Its weight and grip balance the small blade perfectly for precise work.</li>
<li>If you already use double-edge blades in a safety razor, then this holder will allow you to try occasional straight-razor shaves without buying different blades or worrying about maintenance.</li>
<li>While this razor has a beautiful polish that will make it easy to keep clean, the one-piece handle is surprisingly soft and vulnerable to bending.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000PD79GA/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Monsieur Charles razor</a> has a unique position as half-new, half-old; one part standard, one part proprietary. It takes blades that, while uncommon, are very similar to (but not compatible with) the once-popular Schick Injector series. This razor is sold for stylists trimming hair at salons, but it looks and feels closer to an antique straight razor than anything else in this lineup. Even the name has something charming about it: nobody seems to know who Mr. Charles is, but he must be an interesting guy.</p>
<p>The blade fits securely on retaining studs as part of a sliding-tray-style holder, making this one of the better-designed systems. There’s no chance of the blade shifting or being loaded improperly. Unlike the Feather, though, you do have to pick up the blade and drop it carefully into place.</p>
<p>Sadly, the blades are only half the length of the razor, which means you often scoop up shaving cream without doing any shaving. The blades are otherwise very efficient; it was easy to get a smooth across-the-grain shave even on heavy stubble.</p>
<p>Ranking this razor was tricky. It’s an efficient design, but the half-length blade is a bit obnoxious. We left the efficiency rating at five because it cuts so well, but note the awkwardness.</p>
<p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006PQD7I/?tag=ybdraz-20">Personna blades</a> are sharp and long-lived. Most report five to 10 shaves out of these blades before they start pulling instead of cutting, which is much better than the longevity of the thinner double-edge blades. Even ‘expensive’ double-edge blades are a better value, though, so long as you get more than a few shaves out of each edge.</p>
<p>Sadly, you’re also not going to find the blades anywhere but online or a few specialty shaving shops: even the beauty supply places we called hadn’t heard of them. We were mislead by online reviews into thinking that Schick injector blades would fit, but after a talk with <a href="https://www.westcoastshaving.com/">Erik at West Coast Shaving</a>, we got the facts sorted out.</p>
<p>Ironically, you can fit Personna’s Mini Hair Shaper blades into a vintage or reproduction Schick injector razor, but you can’t inject them into the safety razors without the “key” that’s been left off of Personna’s blade magazine. (You can even see the empty space left for it in the molded-plastic packaging.) The price is good compared to other Injector-system blades, so Injector collectors sometimes re-load these blades into old Schick magazines.</p>
<h3>Equinox &#8211; Professional Straight Edge Razor</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-7740 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/equinox.jpg" alt="equinox razor" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/equinox.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/equinox-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/equinox-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/equinox-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/equinox-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/equinox-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/equinox-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/equinox-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/equinox-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/equinox-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/equinox-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/equinox-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0118BJ0PA/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Equinox straight razor</a> is listed as Amazon’s best-seller in the category, but it’s for all intents and purposes a clone of Parker’s SR1 design. The handle is built differently and the edges aren’t as carefully sculpted to fit your fingers, but it holds a blade the same way and gives a very similar shave.</p>
<p>Don’t let the photoshopped images on Amazon fool you; the finish here is rough. If you want a razor that looks and feels good on close inspection, buy the Parker or Feather.</p>
<p>If you’re experimenting with a straight razor on a whim, then the cost of entry here is very low. You can probably find cheaper razors on eBay, but this is as cheap as you’ll get with Prime shipping, with a pack of 100 blades for the price. (We should note here that Derby blades are not very sharp, and you’ll probably prefer the shave from a sharper blade like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FGI0I2Q/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Voskhod</a>. Tastes vary, and the Derby blades are nearly free, but 100 blades is a commitment. There&#8217;s an even less-expensive bundle up on Amazon now with a pack of what must be even cheaper blades, but we didn&#8217;t try them.)</p>
<p>We noticed that if you close the Equinox all the way, the corner of the blade can touch the back of the handle that it rests in. On Parker’s razor, the retaining ‘cap’ stops the blade from folding that far into the handle; just another example of the little details you pay extra for.</p>

<p>Razors used to be a very personal, very meaningful part of daily routine. Like the chair you sit in or the car you drive, your razor says something about what your attitude and habits are. <strong>If a modern cartridge razor is comparable to a luxurious but boring high-tech SUV, then the straight razor is a race bike: built for precision handling and unmatched performance.</strong></p>
<p>Like riding a motorcycle to work, buying a straight razor is going to be a dramatic change in routine for most people who choose to do so. It takes time and practice just to make it through a full-face shave without a spot or two of blood, but that practice builds a very real knowledge of your own face, hands and personal limitations.</p>
<p>If you try enough safety razors you might find one with a design that suits your face and hair type and can get you this caliber of close, smooth shave. The straight razor doesn’t set any limits or hold you back from perfection.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008CF6KMC/?tag=ybdraz-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Feather &#8211; Artist Club SS</a> razor aims to give you all the tools you need to achieve that perfection with minimal worry over rust, blade degradation, or other distractions. Rinse and shake this razor dry, and slide in a new blade at the beginning of the week or any time your shave feels less than perfect.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Budgeting for a shaving brush review is tricky. The best brushes, some would say, must surely be those that use hand-picked knots of “silvertip” badger hair and cost hundreds of dollars. Our tester for this review owns a custom-made silvertip brush, and he likes it a lot.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have a new generation of synthetic-bristled brushes that are as soft as (if not softer than) those very best badger-hair brushes and cost less than $30.</p>
<p>Our research delved into the reports of enthusiasts and experts in the wild world of wet shaving. Communities like BadgerandBlade.com or theShaveDen.com (not to mention the always-dramatic discussions at r/wicked_edge) are full of reports and discussions of the best brushes.</p>
<p>Professional reviews from the crew at <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://sharpologist.com/2015/06/best-shaving-brush.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharpologist.com</a>, as well as blog posts and a host of YouTube reviews and podcast episodes from the most enthusiastic of enthusiasts deepened our knowledge of the terminology and technology of brush-making.</p>
<p>Customer feedback ratings, as always, steered our selections toward the final contenders: When we looked for brushes that are on the budget end of the spectrum, we tried to find cheap brushes that at least <em>most</em> buyers say they like.</p>
<p>We settled on buying four synthetic brushes from well-known sellers and four of the best-reviewed and most popular animal-hair brushes. We picked brushes that represent value purchases rather than handcrafted luxury, but tried to find a good range of pricing.</p>
<p>We considered including horse hair brushes in this review, but while there are some contenders, none of them really managed to compete on performance or quality. The place where horse hair generally makes sense is if you want a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008MMITQK/?tag=ybdshvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">natural-hair brush with long hairs</a> that’s softer than boar and cheaper than badger, but we don’t think they represent a better value for most shavers — especially since bigger brushes encourage over-use of your cream or soap. Horse hair also has a reputation for a bad smell that takes a long time to fade, and reports of shedding are prolific.</p>
<p>The black and white synthetic fiber used in Fendrihan’s brush represents a new generation of brushmaking. Synthetic fibers have been developing at an ever-increasing rate, and in the last year so-called “tuxedo” brushes have been all the rage among those with access to custom-made brushes using experimental fibers. There are a few other places you can get a brush that looks like this: <a href="https://www.maggardrazors.com/product/maggard-razors-24mm-black-white-synthetic-shaving-brush-black-handle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maggard razors</a> was the first retailer to offer the style. Fendrihan is an established vendor, though, and Amazon has their brush available to a wide audience with all the Prime perks.</p>

<h2 id="why-a-brush">Why use a shaving brush?</h2>
<p>Opinions vary about exactly how important a shaving brush is to achieving the very best shave. Some claim that the brush lifts and scrubs your stubble hair to prepare it for the razor, while others say that if you take a hot shower before you shave you’ve done all the preparation that can possibly be done.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.badgerandblade.com/forum/wiki/History_of_the_shaving_brush" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Historians don’t seem to know exactly when brushes were first used for shaving</a>, but it was probably by the French, and they probably did it mostly to avoid having a barber rub a cake of soap directly on a client’s face. (This prevents social awkwardness when you’re shaving an aristocrat, but it also helps keep the soap clean.)</p>
<p>As time passed, the creamy, thick lather that a brush produces became more and more an expected part of shaving. We can’t say a brush is a <em>necessary</em> part of a great shave, but once you get the hang of it lathering shaving soap might be one of the most enjoyable parts of a daily shaving routine.</p>
<p>If you want to use the very best in hard shaving soap, which will often give you more shaves-per-dollar than canned gel, a shaving brush is pretty much required to get the best performance from the soap.</p>
<p>Loading just the tips of a wet brush helps you get hard soap off the puck and avoids waste created even with soft shaving cream. The brush then makes a lather (whipped like egg whites in a separate lathering bowl or directly on your face) that brings out the very best qualities of the soap.</p>

<p>Natural fibers used to be the <em>only</em> viable bristles for a good brush. Those hairs vary in length, diameter and even in the softness of the tips (which <em>will</em> be scrubbing your face).</p>
<p>Real hair has two unique properties: it absorbs water (which can help you get the right amount of water into your shaving cream or soap), and it gets softer with time, as the ends of each hair begin to split. On the down-side, it’ll take longer to dry out the brush, and along with “shedding” from a new brush, animal hair often has a distinctive (and sometimes unpleasant) smell.</p>
<p>There are ethical considerations to make when you’re purchasing animal products, too: Badgers and boars are almost certainly confined and killed before their hairs are clipped off.</p>
<p><strong>Badger hair</strong> has long been sought after for brushes of all types, preferred by painters, makeup artists and barbers. Good badger hair is soft, strong and has almost exactly the right amount of flexibility for a brush you’ll mash into your face.</p>
<p>This hair is graded by suppliers and manufacturers, but the grading labels are a bit tricky.</p>
<p>While “Pure Badger” is a promise that the badger hair is real, and “Best Badger” is almost certainly going to be better hair than that, in higher grades the names can mean anything and everything. People will tell you different grades come from different parts of the badger, but they can’t even agree on which parts go with which names. More expensive brushes like “silvertip” or “super badger” should certainly be softer than &#8220;pure,&#8221; but when comparing one maker to another there’s no hard and fast rule.</p>
<p>We don’t think anything above $40 is a good value unless you’re a devoted enthusiast seeking the <em>ultimate</em> brush. Even among the “pure”-grade brushes, though, there is a difference between <a href="https://youtu.be/rSmpcZOtthk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hairs carefully packed in a bulb-shaped “knot”</a> and those hairs simply bunched together and clipped to shape.</p>
<p>Parker says <a href="http://www.parkershaving.com/c/shaving-brushes/pure-badger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on their website</a> that their “pure badger grade is comparable to many of the brushes that other companies market as ‘best badger’ and ‘fine badger.’” (What a headache!)</p>
<p>In the long run, while badger hair grades mean <em>something</em>, you generally have to try a brush to know what you’re getting.</p>
<p><strong>Boar bristles</strong> are mostly collected from pigs or hogs. (There&#8217;s not much agreement on what to call the animals themselves, so we try not to spend too much time thinking about the inconsistency there.) The hair is thick, absorbs plenty of water and is quite stiff and springy.</p>
<p>Boar hair is popular among those who want a brush that has a ton of “backbone” to massage and exfoliate the face at the same time as whipping up soap into a smooth and protective froth. The downside is that it’s rougher than badger, though it will break in and get softer over time. Every once in a while, enthusiasts who like the firmness of a boar brush will <a href="https://www.badgerandblade.com/forum/threads/breaking-in-a-boars-hair.171574/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debate the merits</a> of accelerating the break-in period with cold water and hair dryers.</p>

<p><strong>Synthetic fibers</strong> used to mean, basically, toothbrush bristles; not very pleasant. In those days pretty much the only people who wanted synthetic fibers in a shaving brush were vegans because they didn’t have a choice. (The Body Shop has sold a house-brand synthetic brush for decades, though it’s not soft enough to make our list of finalists.)</p>
<p>In the last several years, though, brush makers have discovered a new generation of carefully-engineered bristle fibers from big-name industrial producers like BASF and Dupont. These fibers were probably first designed for painters, but they work very well for shaving brushes.</p>
<p>Manufacturers and retailers don’t divulge much about where their bristles come from (much less who assembles the brushes), but French brush maker Plisson is widely regarded as the first to sell synthetic fibers soft enough to really compete with badger hair. Plisson doesn’t seem entirely interested in U.S. sales, and the brushes that once showed up in L’Occitane stores have not been re-stocked.</p>
<p>Fortunately, North American purveyors at Italian Barber found a similar source (if not the same source) for the fiber, and the “<a href="https://www.badgerandblade.com/forum/threads/razorock-plissoft-synthetic-brush-first-impression.469676/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plissoft</a>” brush was born. Others have followed suit, and we now have nearly every shaving specialty retailer selling their own super-soft synthetic brush, all available at an astonishing value.</p>
<p>Based on what we’ve learned from contacting designers, vendors and a contact at Yaqi Brush Product Co., the fibers in our favorite two synthetic brushes probably come from a BASF facility, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FG8M5NK/?tag=ybdshvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Satin Tip</a> might use a Dupont fiber. The diameter of the fibers and crimping may have been tweaked for each design, but they have similar properties compared to animal hair.</p>
<p>Omega is using a synthetic fiber that, wherever it comes from, is much thicker and stiffer. It’s soft enough to use, about as soft as broken-in boar hair, but it&#8217;s not nearly as velvety as the other synthetics.</p>
<p>Natural hair is pretty durable, but the hairs will weaken and break over decades of use. A synthetic brush will probably last for as long as you will if the glue holds it in the handle.</p>
<h3>Size and Loft</h3>

<p>The way a brush maker chooses to size a “knot” of fiber and set it into a handle will play almost as important a role as the fiber itself, especially now that synthetic fibers have leveled the playing field for softness.</p>
<p>Many have noted the way fibers that are limp on their own can get a usable <strong>backbone</strong> if packed into a knot with the right diameter and set at the right depth inside the handle socket. On the flip side, a fiber like badger that’s well-known for good performance can be floppy and unsatisfying in a too-small knot or with too much length.</p>
<p><strong>Diameter</strong> is measured at the base of the knot, and <strong>loft</strong> is the length of hair that comes out of the handle. Since gluing technique sometimes makes fibers shorter in the center of the knot (a “glue bump”), that’s where we measured for our chart.</p>
<p>24 mm is the median-knot diameter we were aiming for, as it gives you enough brush to quickly whip up a lather and cover your whole face. Giant 30+ mm brushes are becoming more and more popular, but a brush that big only really makes sense if you need enough lather to cover a bigger area like your scalp. On the other end of the scale, a 20 mm brush is a little bit less luxurious and takes longer to whip up lather, but if you’re only shaving part of your face it might help you to avoid lathering soap you won’t actually use.</p>

<p>We used these eight brushes for daily shaving with a variety of soaps and creams (including the lather-friendly creams from our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-shaving-cream/" rel="noopener">shaving cream review</a>). We spent the most time lathering Van Der Hagen &#8211; Unscented Luxury shaving soap, a good baseline for quality of lather that didn’t hide the smell of the stinkers.</p>
<p>We also tested Barrister and Mann’s artisan-made tallow formula with all the brushes, but a high-end soap like this one lathers so easily we didn’t consider it much of a challenge.</p>
<h3>Softness</h3>
<p>We asked a few volunteers to help us blind-rank the brushes from softest to prickliest. Note that natural fibers will get softer over time, especially boar hair and clipped hair like Perfecto and Viking use, but in general the ultra-soft tips of the new synthetic brushes are softer than any natural hair can ever get.</p>
<p>Some say that they enjoy the “scritchiness” of natural hair when rubbing soap into their skin, and we wanted to make sure we were judging other characteristics just as carefully as softness; it’s difficult to argue that softer is worse, though.</p>
<h3>Backbone</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7780" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/testing-backbone.jpg" alt="testing a shaving brush" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/testing-backbone.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/testing-backbone-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/testing-backbone-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/testing-backbone-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/testing-backbone-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/testing-backbone-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/testing-backbone-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/testing-backbone-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/testing-backbone-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/testing-backbone-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/testing-backbone-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/testing-backbone-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Shavers who use hard soap and lather directly on their faces will often complain if a brush is too floppy. The term “backbone” isn’t rigorously defined, and we haven’t seen anyone test for it in a controlled way, but it’s an accepted value among enthusiast reviewers.</p>
<p>We used a very precise and accurate benchtop scale to measure the pressure required to spread apart the bristles of each brush. The pressure will rise as more weight is put on the handle until the fibers “break” apart, which is the point at which the softness and stiffness of the hair-tips is in full effect.</p>
<p>There’s a complex relationship at work here between the flexibility of the fiber, the diameter of the ‘knot’, how densely-packed the fibers are, the way the fibers rub against each other and the length of the fibers. There’s no “best” backbone number but as a point of reference: Many have complained that some small badger or synthetic brushes (like the Satin Tip or Perfecto) don’t have enough, while others will say that boar bristles have too much.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s plenty of room for individual preference, but we were very pleasantly surprised with the way the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0731KPG72/?tag=ybdshvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fendrihan</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017V3DFGO/?tag=ybdshvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fine Accoutrements</a> brushes behaved. A good badger brush like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002RJC1HC/?tag=ybdshvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parker’s</a> performs very well, while the other badger brushes were quite floppy.</p>
<h3>Water retained</h3>
<p>We soaked the brushes in hot water, and then shook them out, two sharp flicks for each brush. (We tried the routine a few times to make sure we were getting reliable results.) We compared the ‘wet’ weight against the dry weight of each brush to determine approximately how much water the bristles can trap.</p>
<p>The number of grams of water retained in the bristles tells you something about how much water you’ll need to add when you start lathering your soap, but it’s also an indicator of density: The denser the hair, the more water will be retained.</p>
<h3>Bowl lathering</h3>
<p>We ranked the brushes for how easily and effectively they lathered soap in a bowl. (This is not entirely unlike making whipped cream or meringue with a whisk.) The most important factors here are how easy the brush is to hold, how long the fibers are and how effectively the fibers splay out as you apply the foam to your face (or legs, or whatever else you’re shaving).</p>
<h3>Face lathering</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7700" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/brush_actionshot-2.jpg" alt="lathering soap on the face" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/brush_actionshot-2.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/brush_actionshot-2-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/brush_actionshot-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/brush_actionshot-2-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/brush_actionshot-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/brush_actionshot-2-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/brush_actionshot-2-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/brush_actionshot-2-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/brush_actionshot-2-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/brush_actionshot-2-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/brush_actionshot-2-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/brush_actionshot-2-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We ranked the brushes for how well they performed when building foamy lather directly on the face. This method of applying soap means every factor is under scrutiny.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, softness is very important, but the amount of resistance the fibers give is important too. If you’re just “mopping” the soap around with floppy bristles you won’t get much lather. Boar brushes are often preferred for this method because they’re stiff (some like the way they massage and exfoliate while lathering).</p>
<h3>Quality</h3>
<p>There’s a big difference between a good cheap brush and a lousy cheap brush. We docked points for smelly hairs (yes, the smell washes out, but it can be pretty gross), cheap handles and, worst of all, shedding.</p>
<p>We expect a few hairs to come out of a brush when it’s new, but even after using these for four weeks, the Vikings Blade brush in particular will still release multiple hairs during a shave. (It&#8217;s not a cheap brush, either.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0731KPG72/?tag=ybdshvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fendrihan</a> is a well-established purveyor of shaving and grooming supplies in Canada and the U.S., and they’ve always been a great place to get brushes from the high-end European makers. When they chose to put their name on a synthetic brush with a black-and-white knot, we had to try it.</p>
<h3>What makes synthetic hair so great?</h3>
<p>As with most of the new-generation synthetic brush fibers, this is soft to a degree that’s hard to describe. When it’s dry, if you rub your finger across the white tips, you’ll barely feel them. When loaded with soap, all you’ll feel is the lather moving around your face.</p>
<p>Softness is now a solved problem for synthetic hair. Some European brush makers have been selling ultra-soft synthetic brushes for a while; sellers of reasonably-priced brushes have sourced comparable fiber and caught up in the last few years. What has still been up for debate, though, is whether the fibers were too limp for effective use in a shaving brush. The engineers and designers went back to the drawing board and returned with a new fiber configuration.</p>
<p>The “tuxedo” synthetic hair has taken the world of shaving brushes by storm. In 2016, some brush makers did a group buy, and the fiber started showing up among artisans like Envyshave and Wolf Whiskers. Soon, Canadian brushmaker and supply-seller APShaveCo on Etsy began offering ready-to-purchase inventory, and eventually, <a href="https://www.maggardrazors.com/product/maggard-razors-24mm-black-white-synthetic-shaving-brush-black-handle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maggard Razors</a> came along and exploded the brush&#8217;s availability.</p>

<p>Heralded as an answer to all the limpness of the Plisson-style synthetic brush, this is a bristle that matches the softest possible tips with just the right amount of spring.</p>
<p>Our researcher happened to already own an APShaveCo “Tuxedo” brush when we started working on this review, so he was intrigued when he saw <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0731KPG72/?tag=ybdshvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fendrihan’s Black and White Synthetic shaving brush</a> show up in search results. (Especially at such a great price and with Prime shipping on Amazon.) As a new product, the volume of buyer feedback for this Amazon listing falls far below the threshold we usually set, but for an exciting new product from a known vendor we were willing to take a chance, and we’re glad we did.</p>
<h3>Shaving performance</h3>
<p>Fendrihan chose to set the fiber extending farther from the handle than most brush makers, and that seems to have actually increased the amount of “backbone” stiffness. It’s not nearly as stiff as a boar brush, but it’s a tiny bit stiffer than the other “tuxedo” brushes we’ve seen, and it’s certainly not limp.</p>
<p>The length of the brush also makes whipping up lather a bit easier, and if you splay the tips all the way out, it spreads the soap around your face nicely. This isn’t a specialized face-lathering or bowl-lathering brush, but it does a good job with both.</p>
<p>Water retention is also great: Synthetic brushes will always hold on to less water than natural hair, but with a longer loft Fendrihan’s brush won’t dribble away your soap mid-shave. You can pretty much dip this brush in hot water, give it a tap or a few shakes to shed excess water, and get to work on your lather.</p>
<p>When it comes to specific parameters like how long the hairs in your shaving brush are, there are no hard and fast rules: you buy a brush, and you adapt to it. This brush is by no means perfect. A badger brush like the Parker &#8211; Long Loft gives a different experience, bending around the contours of your face a bit more gently; the badger hair isn’t nearly as soft, though.</p>
<h3>Construction and handle quality</h3>

<p>This is a relatively large brush and the heavy handle feels great. The polish on the black acrylic is beautiful, and the shape is reminiscent of a classical-era water pitcher or urn. The shape here seems designed more for looks than comfort, but it’s actually quite easy to grip and secure when you’re whipping up lather.</p>
<p>Shedding is still possible with synthetic fibers, but a well-made brush like this will never lose more than a few bristles. (We didn’t find any loose hairs when shaving or testing.) There is a tiny spot of clear glue seeping out of the handle, which is a bit disappointing given how great the rest of the brush is. You have to look closely to see it, but it’s visible under a bright light where it contrasts with the black bristles.</p>
<p>Compared to a few of the other tuxedo-fiber brushes we’ve seen, the line of black-and-white contrast coloring on this knot appears slightly less uniform. Custom brush makers have taken the look even further with knots like the “<a href="http://envyshave.com/en/shaving-brushes/16-8-ball-brush.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5th-generation Black Wolf</a>”, but at less than $20 (compared to $80 and a long wait for custom production) we have no complaints about the quality or look of this brush.</p>
<h3>Sizing up the competition</h3>
<p>You could buy a brush with similar “tuxedo-themed” fibers from Maggard Razors or one of the pop-up brush makers and resellers on Etsy and Amazon. West Coast Shaving has a huge selection of handle styles to choose from on their site.</p>
<p>You can also get a brush with these fibers <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Men-s-Shaving-Brush-with-Resin-Handle-Synthetic-Hair/2986023_32817162394.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directly from Yaqi&#8217;s factory in China.</a> Yaqi used to sell only in wholesale-sized lots on Alibaba, mostly loose brush knots to handle-making artisans and customized finished brushes to re-sellers like Fendrihan. Now that the secret is out, they&#8217;re even available on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ybdshvb-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=3c1c798d5cdd880456059bb1406e242a&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;index=hpc&amp;keywords=yaqi brush">Amazon</a>, imported and re-sold by Amazon storefronts like West Coast Shaving. We’ve sampled these brushes, and they’re everything you’d expect, but watch out for shipping and duty fees if you&#8217;re using eBay or Aliexpress.</p>
<p>Fendrihan is pricing very competitively, so buying their brush from Amazon is definitely the cheapest way to get one quickly. On top of that, their handle and the way this brush is designed are distinctive and attractive.</p>
<p>This a first-class brush with a unique character you really can&#8217;t get anywhere else, and at an amazing price. Fendrihan went the extra mile and turned a popular new fiber into a brush all their own, and it&#8217;s our favorite of the bunch.</p>

<li>Fendrihan sells great products for discerning buyers. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0731KPG72/?tag=ybdshvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Their Black and White synthetic shaving brush</a> has a signature look that echoes classical-era shapes in modern materials.</li>
<li>While it’s not quite as natural-feeling when moving around your face as badger hair, the amazing softness of the high-tech fiber makes up for that in spades. It’s 100% cruelty-free, too.</li>
<li>There are other brushes around that use similar fiber, but given the unique handle, the price and the availability this is definitely the one we’d buy again.</li>

<p>We almost despaired of finding a badger hair brush worth recommending at a price point lower than $60, but Parker has found a great source for the hair in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002RJC1HC/?tag=ybdshvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this “Handmade Deluxe Long Loft 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush&#8221;,</a> and they’re offering it at a very good price. (Even more so when you factor the included stand, which would cost you at least a fiver on its own.)</p>
<h3>What makes this a better badger brush?</h3>
<p>Buying a badger brush can often feel like a gamble. The natural qualities of the fiber are ideal in many ways, but it takes careful selection of the <em>right</em> hairs to make a really great brush. Cheap badger hair is often scratchy, smelly and set loosely in knots that are limp and shed every time you shave.</p>
<p>“Pure” badger is often the lowest grade available, but Parker has bucked the naming convention (they call their cheaper bristles “black” badger), and this is definitely the “best” grade of hair you’ll find for under $50.</p>
<p>The softness of the hair in this brush would have once been considered excellent. The hairs have natural tips, meaning that the shape of this knot has been carefully laid out rather than shaped with clippers. The scale has shifted with the advent of amazingly soft synthetic brushes, but this is still a nice brush to use.</p>

This isn’t as soft as our top pick, but it’s a great brush in its own right. </p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002RJC1HC/?tag=ybdshvb-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The difference in softness compared to the other badger brushes we tested is noticeable, especially when swirling and pressing the hairs on your skin while the brush it wet. This is the softest natural hair we found inside our budget; “Silvertip” hairs will be softer, but at a price that becomes hard to justify when the brush still isn’t as soft as a much more affordable synthetic.</p>
<h3>Construction and handle quality</h3>
<p>The quality of the rest of this brush is very good, too. The handle is made of resin and metal. It’s heavy at the base and feels solid, but the design makes sure it isn’t too slippery the way some metal handles sometimes are. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LEU8LJM/?tag=ybdshvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parker sells a very similar model in faux horn</a>, if that’s a look you prefer.</p>
<p>We saw a few hairs shed in the first week, but nothing unusual for a natural-hair brush. The hairs remind you that they are from an animal with a faint smell, if you’re a pet owner the smell will probably seem relatively pleasant: clean, but genuine.</p>
<p>The stand isn’t flashy, but it helps keep water out of the hairs to prolong the life of the brush. One of our few complaints about this set of brush and stand is that you almost have to squeeze the brush into the prongs of the stand. It doesn’t always hold the brush exactly vertical, either, without nudging it around to find a center point.</p>

<h3>Shaving performance</h3>
<p>Lathering in a bowl or on the face is exactly how it should be, as all the natural curves and kinks of the hairs move against one another and make billions of tiny bubbles.</p>
<p>Making lofty mounds of thick foam with unscented or Earl-Grey-scented harder soap was very easy, though Fendrihan’s stiffer synthetic brush does make it easier to pick up a hard soap. Taylor of Old Bond Street’s luxurious lathering creams (our pick for <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-shaving-cream/">the best affordable lathering shaving cream</a>) are very easy to “load” into brush tips, and the high-end scents will help if you dislike the faint smell of badger hair.</p>
<p>When you swirl the hairs of this brush around your face, there is a very small amount of poking and roughness from the natural qualities of the hair. It’s not uncomfortable the way the clipped ends of cheaper brushes can be, but it doesn’t exactly massage below the skin the way a stiff boar brush does either.</p>
<p>Basically, this is how shaving brushes have been expected to feel for almost 300 years, and if you didn’t have an expensive silvertip or impossibly soft synthetic brush to compare with, you might never want anything else.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002RJC1HC/?tag=ybdshvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parker’s Long Loft badger brush</a> with chrome and black handle looks great and uses excellent badger hair.</li>
<li>The price is moderately high compared to synthetic brushes like our top pick, but Parker is still giving you the traditional shaving experience for less than $40.</li>

<h3>Fine Accoutrements &#8211; Stout 24mm Shaving Brush</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-7796 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Runnerup2-Fine.jpg" alt="Fine Stout" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Runnerup2-Fine.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Runnerup2-Fine-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Runnerup2-Fine-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Runnerup2-Fine-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Runnerup2-Fine-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Runnerup2-Fine-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Runnerup2-Fine-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Runnerup2-Fine-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Runnerup2-Fine-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Runnerup2-Fine-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Runnerup2-Fine-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Runnerup2-Fine-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017V3DFGO/?tag=ybdshvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“Stout” 24mm shaving brush</a> is very much like the other synthetic brushes we tested, but designed to excel specifically at lathering shaving soap directly on the face.</p>
<p>Fine Accoutrements started out on Etsy as a way for founder Todd Cerami to sell an affordable formulation of his favorite aftershave in scents he loves. He’s branched out into a number of shaving products aimed at frugal-but-hip enthusiasts, and this brush is a great example of that business model.</p>
<p>Mr. Fine seems to have based his “Stout” brush on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chubby-Badger-Shave-Brush-Simpson/dp/B003B3UAEY/?tag=ybdshvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Simpson “Chubby” design</a>, much beloved by those who prefer face lathering. This one will cost you much less than a Simpson, and with modern super-soft fibers, it is, for all intents and purposes, a better brush in every way.</p>
<p>The quality of the bristles is, as with most of the new synthetics, excellent. Soft tips with a good amount of resistance; the biggest difference between this brush and the Fendrihan really is in how the fibers are set in the handle.</p>
<p>These fibers are short, set deep into the handle, so they have a ‘backbone’ stiffness that’s very good for loading a hard soap and building up lather on your face. If the hairs were longer they might be too floppy, but that’s pure speculation. In this configuration, the brush works well</p>
<p>While this is an amazing brush for face lathering, those who like to whip up lather in a bowl whisk-style will probably prefer our top pick. The Stout’s shorter loft and handle can still whip up lather, but it’s not quite as easy to maneuver in the bowl as Fendrihan’s longer brush.</p>
<p>Fine Accoutrements seems to have styled their brush line after <a href="http://oldschoolshavingbrushes.com/other_manuacturers/other_ever-ready.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">antique Ever-Ready</a> brushes, and it matches Fine Accoutrements’ stacking soap bowls and other shaving products. If that’s a style you like, and face lathering is your preferred way to shave, then the price of this brush might be a bargain.</p>
<p>Because the Stout costs so much more than Fendrihan’s longer brush, though, and because it’s not as versatile, the Stout didn’t end up ranking #1.</p>
<h3>Omega &#8211; &#8220;Pro 49&#8221;</h3>

<p>Boar brushes have many fans, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004HJ6CFM/?tag=ybdshvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Omega &#8211; Professional 10049</a> (dubbed “the Pro 49” by its fans) is a frequent recommendation. They were, once upon a time, an amazing value compared to badger, and once you get used to how stiff and scratchy they are, they work quite well. In the era of softer-than-soft and cheaper-than-cheap synthetic brushes, boar is losing ground.</p>
<p>For about the cost of a good sandwich, this is not a bad brush, but it smells like mothballs for a week, and it will shed a few hairs. (On the bright side, it doesn’t smell like a pig!) This handle is nice to hold, but it’s hollow plastic, not the dense bowling-ball-like acrylic resin of the better synthetic brushes.</p>
<h3>Omega &#8211; S-Brush</h3>

<p>This is an interesting brush: like boar, but not like boar. Many reviewers note that that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BEJJLX8/?tag=ybdshvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Omega’s S-Brush</a> is “soft”, but it’s not anywhere near as soft as the other synthetics we tested. If you like exfoliating your face with a shaving brush, this is a vegan-friendly way to do so. It’s a good size for a travel brush, too.</p>
<p>On the whole, though, there never seemed to be that much reason to use this brush with all the others at hand. If you have beard and you only shave around the edges, a smaller brush like this will waste less soap; that’s probably the best reason to buy it.</p>
<p>Strangely, this brush also smells like mothballs when it’s new. Omega must be treating all their brushes with something before shipping. The smell goes away after you wash it out, but it’s a bit surprising to find in a synthetic-bristle brush.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FG8M5NK/?tag=ybdshvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“The Purest</a>” is not the cheapest of the synthetic brushes we tested, but it probably should be. That&#8217;s not to say this is a terrible brush. Synthetic fibers are pretty much perfect, and this brush will do the job. Compared to our top pick, though, Satin Tip has not packed very much into this knot: with less density, it’s a tiny bit scratchy and disappointingly floppy.</p>
<p>There’s also the disappointment of a cheap plastic handle. The soft-touch coating isn’t bad, but it isn’t really very good, either. It reminds you of a cheap smartphone accessory more than a handcrafted artifact of a bygone era.</p>
<p>If you get this brush in a gift set, it will work for you and is certainly worth hanging onto as a travel brush. We wouldn’t seek it out, though.</p>
<h3>Vikings Blade &#8211; Dark Stallion Luxury Badger Brush</h3>

<p>There’s a lot to hope for in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GDZJ4BQ/?tag=ybdshvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Dark Stallion</a>; the “Vikings” at Vullion group in Australia have put together some shaving products that look great.</p>
<p>Sadly, the performance of this badger brush did not meet the high expectations set by the hefty handle and marketing. Compared to the other high-price brushes we tried, it’s not very soft. Worse, it smelled quite bad and sheds more than the ten-dollar brushes. (The Vikings spend more time drinking mead than preparing badger hair, apparently.)</p>
<p>The best thing that can be said about this brush is that the knot of hair is glued into a metal cup. This unscrews easily from the quite-nice handle, which might make it easier to <a href="http://www.thegoldennib.com/wet-shaving/badger-hair-knots.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replace the knot with something worthy of Scandinavian pride</a>.</p>
<h3>Perfecto &#8211; 100% Original</h3>

<p>This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LDYFGFQ/?tag=ybdshvb-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Perfecto</a> brush was not as bad as we’d feared, but it’s not a good brush. It will do the job, but the hairs are floppy, and they do smell at first — not just like a wet dog, but like a wet dog that got into the glue out in your workshop.</p>
<p>If it were softer this might have placed higher than the Viking brush. Despite all the problems that brush had, this one is still less pleasant to stroke across your face. Buy a synthetic or a boar, but don’t spend even $10 on cheap badger hair.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter a combined 48 weeks of careful comparison in blind tests, five intrepid gentlemen helped us test 12 top products to select <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C8XGF63/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cremo &#8211; Original Concentrated Shave Cream</a> as the best shaving cream.

Our runner-up is the classic British brand <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00432GALY/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Taylor of Old Bond Street</a>.</p>

<p>The number of shaving products on the market is staggering. On one end of the scale, the major health and cosmetics brands have shaving product lines worth billions. On the other end, there are also limited-quantity batches of artisan soaps made for shaving aficionados.</p>
<p>Even the line between the world of big-budget-Superbowl-brand shaving products and the “prestige” market is blurring. Proctor and Gamble expanded on their Gillette offerings by purchasing a chain of boutique barbers called “the Art of Shaving”, now complete with wood-handled Fusion razors, expensive magazine spreads and movie tie-ins.</p>
<p>Narrowing that broad spectrum to a set of products worthy of our recommendation wasn’t easy.</p>
<p>Our senior researcher for this project has been “wet shaving” with brush and soap for the last 16 years, tinkering with everything from antique straight razors to the Headblade. He’s a shaving nerd to his core.</p>
<p>Recommendations and opinions about shaving products <em>abound</em> on the internet. A diverse cast of characters has devoted their time to shaving info: guys like <a href="http://straightrazorplace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">straightrazorplace.com</a>’s Lynn Abrams, all the Youtube shaving-how-to celebrities, podcasters, wiki editors and helpful forum commenters. For this review we compiled long lists of popular products and combed the forums for information about regional availability of everyone’s favourite tubes and tubs.</p>
<p>The creams we included were selected for reputation (based on Amazon reviews, online comments, as well as a few of the other non-enthusiast comparison reviews that weren’t just advertisements), availability and price.</p>
<p>Availability was weighed heavily. If you have a choice of three scents at a local retailer you can smell them yourself; even if you get to pick from a list of a dozen scents on an e-tailer’s website, there’s a risk you’ll dislike what shows up on your doorstep.</p>

<p>We talked to a chemist from UC Irvine and did some research into the ingredients of shaving products. We learned that the primary functions of shaving cream are actually pretty basic.</p>
<p>Shaving cream helps get water into your hair, making the hair cells swell into bigger targets for the edge of the razor to hit. Shaving products also provide lubrication for the blade of your razor as it slides across your skin, so it doesn’t cause irritation. Typically, they includes some moisturizing and pH balancing ingredients to keep your skin feeling its best after the blade is gone.</p>
<p>It turns out that the base ingredient which does these jobs the best is good ol’ soap. “Shaving oil” provides lubrication and keeps the blade from digging into skin, but it doesn’t do anything to make hairs easier to cut.</p>
<p>All shaving creams are based on a soap or detergent of some type, but since those ingredients dry out your skin, the other ingredients can make a big difference. Glycerine, for example, is a byproduct of the fat-to-soap transformation and is often mixed back in with the final soap products because it helps keep water molecules around and hydrates your skin.</p>

<h3>Hard soap</h3>

It’s hard to say precisely when barbers started to use soap instead of oil for shaving, but the oldest manufacturer, De Vergulde Hand in the Netherlands, has been making shave soap for over 460 years. Colgate and Palmolive started out with soap sold for shaving, and Williams “Mug Soap” is still quite readily available 176 years later.</p>
<p>“Hard” soap is rolled or “milled” (often &#8220;triple-milled&#8221;) to squeeze air and water out at the end of the soap-making process: a cake of dense soap will maximize the number of shaves you get per ounce. Shaving soap will also extra moisturizers compared to something like bath or hand soap, and it&#8217;s designed to froth into a rich, dense lather.</p>
<p>You <em>could</em> just rub a hard cake of soap onto your face, but you really need time and practice with a shaving brush to make lathering up an enjoyable part of your day.</p>
<p>We considered including hard shaving soaps in this lineup, but comparing creams you can apply with your hands to hard soaps that you need a brush for is a different sort of review.</p>
<p>However, if you’d like to give it a go, there are plenty of decent brushes (<a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-shaving-brush/">check out our review</a>) that won’t break the bank. Buy some cheap-but-reliable <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arko-Shaving-Soap-Stick/dp/B002A5OLHQ?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Arko soap</a> and check out the lathering how-to resources offered by enthusiast communities like <a href="https://www.badgerandblade.com/forum/wiki/Getting_started_wetshaving" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Badger &amp; Blade</a>. In a week or so, you’ll be lathering up mounds of white foam and ordering samples of more soaps just to see what they smell like.</p>
<p>Soap is often a better value than cream (with eight to 10 months of shaving in a four-ounce puck). However, if you start lining up with other enthusiasts for limited seasonal releases from artisanal soap-crafters or trying new pairings of soap and aftershave, you’ll wind up with enough value-friendly soap for three or four lifetimes. (We tell our wives that it’s still cheaper than being a micro-roasted coffee snob or a Swiss-watch enthusiast.)</p>
<h3>Lathering shaving cream</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-7501 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lathering.jpg" alt="lathering shaving cream" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lathering.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lathering-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lathering-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lathering-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lathering-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lathering-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lathering-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lathering-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lathering-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lathering-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lathering-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lathering-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
About 100 years ago, shaving soap manufacturers like Colgate and Mennen made shaving more convenient with extra-soft soap packaged in a tube. The biggest change is that these creams are pre-mixed with water and have even more glycerine and oil, typically enough that you can spread it on your face right out of the tube or jar.</p>
<p>Other manufacturers jumped aboard the trend, and even well-established soap makers like Taylor of Old Bond Street began selling easy-spreading “cream” soap.</p>
<p>Even with these creams, there’s some advantage to using a brush to get as much rich, foamy lather as possible. But, unlike hard soap, it’s not so difficult to get a great shave if you just rub a dab of cream into your skin with wet hands. (That’s how our testers used them, though we used a brush for the pictures to demonstrate lather in a more controlled way.)</p>
<p>The drawback to this kind of old-school formula is that if you don’t use enough water, these creams can be too thick for easy rinsing.</p>
<h3>“Non-lathering&#8221; shaving cream</h3>

<p>If you don’t care about old-timey barbershop lather on your face and just want to get through a shave already, this might be what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>While non-lathering creams use a familiar set of ingredients to get water into your hairs, they’ll typically use fewer foam-inducing detergents or soaps, and even higher ratios of additives like oil and glycerin. These are modern formulations generally not trying to specifically please the cadre of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/latherporn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagrammers posting pictures of shaving lather</a> every morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Non-lathering&#8221; is a bit of a misnomer, though. Except for the shave butter, all of these products are still soap- or detergent-based and will make some lather if you work them vigorously. Some lather <em>very well</em>.</p>
<p>The clearest distinction we can make is that you won&#8217;t have to add as much water to thin out and spread a &#8220;non-lathering&#8221; or &#8220;brushless&#8221; cream, and using a brush doesn&#8217;t provide <em>as much</em> of an advantage with these products for that reason.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve used a brush in our demonstration pictures to show just <em>how</em> foamy each sample is in a more uniform way, but our testers weren&#8217;t using brushes for the shaving data we collected.</p>
<h3>Canned shaving cream</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-7504 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/canned-cream.jpg" alt="canned shaving foam" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/canned-cream.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/canned-cream-610x343.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/canned-cream-768x432.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/canned-cream-300x169.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/canned-cream-295x166.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/canned-cream-885x498.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/canned-cream-360x202.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/canned-cream-375x211.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/canned-cream-414x233.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/canned-cream-320x180.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/canned-cream-300x169@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
Introduced in 1949 by Carter-Wallace (the company behind Arrid antiperspirant), “Rise” shaving cream heralded a sea-change in shaving: lather in a can! No soap, brush or basin required! (Or such is the claim.)</p>
<p>Sure enough, there’s plenty of water and soap/detergent in that can of foam. After all, most recipes are around 80% water. The basic mode of action is the same as in any lathering shave product, but aerosol cream uses propellant (a compressed gas, like isobutane) to create the luxurious foam as it comes out of the can.</p>
<p>“Gel” shaving products are basically the same thing, but stored and dispensed as a “semi-solid micro-emulsion.” Basically, this means that added volatiles or solvents keep the soap in gel form until you spread it around, at which point everything but the water/soap/moisturizer mix evaporates and makes tiny foamy bubbles. It’s a neat trick, but it’s basically still just extra-thick shaving foam.</p>
<p>Aerosol delivery has been an unmitigated, run-away-freight-train success. Even some of the old standby shaving soap brands, like Proraso and Tabac, are available in aerosol cans.</p>
<p>The biggest drawback to aerosol delivery is that, while it’s convenient to have the can do all the work of lathering, massaging soap and water into your stubble might make the hairs easier to shave (though some dispute that claim) and will definitely exfoliate your skin and clean your pores.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important attributes to look for</h2>
<h3>Performance: close shaving vs lubrication</h3>
<p>Shaving-cream reviewers will sometimes talk about “cushion” and “glide”, but neither of those qualities is well-defined. You can be sure, though, that with some combination of bubbly foam and lubricating fats, the best shaving cream should help keep your razor from scratching or scraping off your skin while it mows down stubble. Gels tend to have more lubricating and hydrating ingredients, but you can typically find a range of additives (along with a range of scents) in both foam and gel cans from the same manufacturer.</p>
<p>Creams that use more oils and emulsifiers to lubricate and moisturize can clog your razor. You should be able to shave most of your face before you need to rinse, and that should only take a few swishes in a basin.</p>
<p>These qualities are part of a balancing act; you don’t want a watery/airy cream that won’t protect your skin, but you don’t want a greasy paste left inside your razor, either. Some razors are more vulnerable to clogging (Gillette’s Fusion clogs faster than the Mach 3, for example). How frequently you rinse, whether you try to shave against-the-grain to get extra-close, and how long/thick your stubble is will also make a difference.</p>
<h3>Skin feel</h3>
<p>Cocoa butter, shea oil, lanolin, aloe, glycerine and other ingredients help moisturize skin after most of the skin oil has been washed and scraped away during a close shave. Other additives like menthol, eucalyptus and witch hazel will tone and soothe skin. (Note that excessive use of ‘toning’ botanicals can irritate some sensitive skin or lead to allergic reactions, as was the case with Proraso and Nivea for one of our testers.)</p>
<h3>Economy</h3>
<p>While there are plenty of amazing products out there that will get you a great shave, we also wanted to find a top pick that’s relatively affordable. As with many products, a more expensive up-front purchase might wind up being cheaper in the long run. (Probably the biggest problem with canned shaving cream is that it’s very easy to dispense far more than you need for one shave.)</p>
<p>We estimated usage based on manufacturer guidelines and our own testing results; your actual use of the products may vary.</p>
<h3>Availability</h3>
<p>The best shaving cream in the world isn’t going to help you get a good shave if you use it up while you’re traveling and can’t find any more locally. Likewise, it can be frustrating trying to choose a product based on a picture when one of its most important qualities is the scent — being able to smell a cream in the drug store is a big bonus.</p>
<h2>A word about ingredients</h2>
<p>This is a list of some key ingredients in each product, noted in the same order as they appear on the product ingredient lists.</p>
<p>When picking a shaving cream for sensitive skin, use your best judgement with regard to the “best” ingredients. Fragrances, botanical oils and soaps can all cause irritation if you’re sensitive to a particular compound. We can’t point to a shaving cream that will be 100% irritation-free for all people, but we did tally all of our testers’ responses about dryness, irritation and redness for you to reference.</p>
<p>Many advocates of traditional or “wet” shaving are quick to describe the difference between ingredient lists on their favorite soap and those of the popular “canned goo” products. The implication is always that simpler is better, and chemicals with complex names are inferior, if not harmful.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the simplest ingredient list of all the products we tested was for Barbasol: water, soap, detergent, propellant and fragrance. Some of the “scary” ingredients like <a href="https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/706639/TRIETHANOLAMINE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">triethanolamine</a> (used to balance the PH of soap ingredients) show up in both “canned goo” like Edge gel and high-end creams like Taylor of Old Bond Street.</p>

<p><strong>Soap</strong></p>
<p>Ingredients like stearic acid (historically from animal fat, sometimes isolated from plant oil) and sodium hydroxide (lye) are all part of the soap-making “saponification” process, producing soap chemicals like the very common sodium stearate.</p>
<p>If you see a familiar plant name worked into a list of chemical ingredients (like “sodium sheabutterate” or “sodium sunflowerate”) it’s soap from the same process as tallow soap, but with a different oil.</p>
<p><strong>Detergents</strong></p>
<p>Detergents like sodium lauryl sulfate (“SLS”) or isethionates are usually made from more ‘industrial’ ingredients than the old-world tallow and lye soaps, but they do the same job. The biggest effective difference between old-style soap and modern detergent is that detergents don’t bind to the minerals in hard water the way soap does, which means you’ll get more consistent foam and less scummy mess if you live in a hard water area.</p>
<p><strong>Botanicals and other additives</strong></p>
<p>Botanical extracts (from plants with non-medicinal beneficial properties) can soothe irritation and provide extra moisture for dry skin.</p>
<p>That said, the most frequent complaints we saw in our blind test are probably related to all-natural botanical ingredients: one of our testers got a rash from both Proraso and Nivea creams, which contain eucalyptus and chamomile respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Other chemicals</strong></p>
<p>Parabens and sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) have made many lists of “ingredients to watch out for,” despite reassurances from most <a href="http://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/imports/alerts.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">researchers</a> and <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_sccp/docs/sccp_o_074.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regulators</a> that the compounds are quite safe at the concentrations we see in products like shaving cream.</p>
<p>Parabens used to be common, but the social media buzz has mostly convinced manufacturers that switching to other preservatives is worth any added expense. Interestingly, Aveeno is the exception here, still using a few parabens to prolong shelf life and prevent bacterial growth.</p>
<p>Sodium laur<em><strong>eth</strong></em> sulphate has mostly been phased out of use because of concerns over <a href="http://www.davidsuzuki.org/what-you-can-do/queen-of-green/faqs/toxics/whats-the-difference-between-sodium-lauryl-sulfate-sls-and-sodium-laureth-sulfat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dioxane contamination risks</a>. Sodium laur<em><strong>yl</strong></em> sulphate is a related detergent made without that risk; it’s in many of the creams we tested (especially the canned products.) The most substantive complaint about SLS is that it’s an irritant, but other soaps are also irritants. Don’t apply shaving cream to your eyes, no matter how friendly the label seems.</p>
<p><strong>Vegan ingredients</strong></p>
<p>We found vegan labels on a few of the products, but the most popular soap base, stearic acid, is often taken from animal fat. Glycerin (a byproduct of that soap) has the same story. The same compounds <em>can</em> be derived from plant oils: when a brand like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K7I4BQ4/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pacific Shaving Company</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004DU1Q4W/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kiss My Face</a> makes vegan shaving cream, they have to go a step farther in specifying ingredient <em>sources</em> with suppliers.</p>

We selected six testers, each with his own unique shaving history. Their hair types varied from thin Caucasian to wiry Afro-Caribbean, and a full spectrum of shaving practices is represented.</p>
<p>We distributed samples of all ten products in generic containers (or painted-over labels, in the case of aerosol cans.) Testers shaved as they normally would, with the same razor and pre-shave preparation they’re used to. Though, if any participants were not showering or getting their faces good and wet before shaving, we encouraged them to try doing so before testing any of the products.</p>
<p>Each product was tested for at least a week of shaving, with a different product on each side of the face to get a better comparison.</p>
<p>Notes were taken on daily shave results (including a tally for nicks, irritation and dryness) and we asked for summary feedback on slickness, ease of rinsing, skin feel and closeness.</p>
<p>After they’d tried all of the products for at least a week, we asked our testers to try their old shaving product again before voting on the whole batch: our table shows voting scores after tallying five first picks, five runners-up (worth half a point), and five worst product votes. (There were some ties in the worst-product category that led to half and quarter-votes.)</p>

<p>Cremo’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C8XGF63/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“Astonishingly Superior” Original Concentrated Shave Cream</a> is in many ways like a traditional shaving cream, but formulated for a modern market where most people have never seen a shaving brush or a razor without lubricating strips. The instructions on the side of the tube give excellent results, and the “90-day supply” claim is accurate if you don’t go overboard and squeeze out more than you need.</p>
<p>Cremo is relatively thick compared to something like Kiss My Face, but it’s still easy to apply. A reasonable analogy is canned gel; Cremo is similar to other creams, with more protecting and moisturizing ingredients, but the main difference is the mode of delivery.</p>

This price is for two tubes!</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C8XGF63?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>While Cremo does lather (stearic acid is the third ingredient), it’s harder to whip into a stable foam than something like Proraso or Taylor of Old Bond Street; then, after a minute or so Cremo goes transparent on your face. Rub or brush in a bit more water and it will foam up again. Lather or not, it gives a great shave.</p>
<p>The concentrated blend of soap, detergents and oils will leave behind a film that still re-foams if you rub your face with wet hands after a first pass with the razor. This does mean that it clogs the razor more than the thinnest creams if you put it on thick. However, on an aggressive and easy-rinsing razor like a Mach 3, it doesn’t cause any problems and it provides helpful protection.</p>
<p>The original formula we tested is nearly unscented, but it has a slight, clean citrus aroma (think lemon, maybe a hint of bergamot). A few of our testers said it was their favorite scent of all the samples.</p>
<p>If you want to get a little bolder, Cremo now comes in four new scents: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NA0UN40/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sandalwood</a>  and “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CKC8O9Y?th=1?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cooling</a>” (with peppermint, menthol and tea tree oil) for men who want a bit of tingle after a shave and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N5YGOW1/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lavender Bliss</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003FVWRCK/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coconut Mango</a> scents for women who want a botanical vibe. In 2018, Cremo started selling an exclusive <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Cremo-Astonishingly-Superior-Shave-Cream-Bourbon/278889023">Bourbon scent at WalMart</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C8XGF63/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cremo &#8211; Concentrated Shave Cream</a> is unlike anything else on the market, easy to apply yet lubricating, like a high-end soap lather.</li>
<li>This stuff is easy to find, smells subtle-but-great and comes in other scents if you want something bolder.</li>
<li>A six ounce tube should easily outlast two cans of aerosol cream! TSA-approved travel sizes are also available.</li>

<p>This is the top end of our testing range. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00432GALY/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Taylor of Old Bond Street Shaving Cream</a> isn’t the most expensive cream out there: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001020DV8/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Castle Forbes</a> is award-winning shaving cream made in an <em>actual castle</em> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000684Z70/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Truefitt &amp; Hill</a> are barbers for the British Royals. But at double the price (or more), we don’t think those products represent a worthwhile upgrade for any except the most discriminating shaving connoisseurs.</p>
<p>Taylor’s is a family-owned barber and hairdresser establishment in the St. James district of London, but they also sell a line of men’s grooming products and fragrances. If you’re looking for a classy scent in your shaving products, these folks definitely have something for you.</p>
<p>While it’s relatively expensive, this is also the thickest, densest cream we tested. It’s about the consistency of whipped butter. Since it’s so concentrated, it needs a lot of water to make it shaveable. (With a shaving brush it’s pretty easy to get the ratio.) Even starting with a small dab of cream on your cheeks and massaging generous amounts of water into your face, you’ll get a great shave.</p>

Luxury feel and scents, but available at a reasonable price.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00432GALY/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Beard-wearers note: if you rub leftover Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving lather into your facial hair you <em>might</em> never buy beard oil again: the cocoa-seed butter makes this a great conditioner.</p>
<p>How our testers felt about this cream seemed to depend entirely on how much water they expected to add. In our blind test those who tried shaving without enough water found Taylor of Old Bond Street mediocre (it’ll clog some razors quickly if you’re not thinning it out), but everyone agreed that it makes the skin feel soft and smooth with great protection from nicks and irritation.</p>
<p>The scent we provided our testers is the modern, floral-earthy-citrus <em>fougère</em> scent of the “Jermyn street” collection, which aims to be allergen-free and refreshing for sensitive skin.</p>
<p>At last count there are 12 scents in the company’s regular production line (as well as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ODCJBAQ/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">certified-organic fragrance-free</a> option.) Grapefruit and avocado are very popular “botanical” scents, while citrus-laden “Eton College” and the perennial heat of Sandalwood are also very popular among enthusiasts. (“Almond” smells like cookies, which some people will love.)</p>
<p>This dense cream loves to lather, so the 5.6 oz. tub is enough cream to supply your luxurious shaving experience for four months if you can limit yourself to ¼ teaspoon per shave. (That makes for an expense of around $42 per year if you shave nearly every day.) It is easy to use more than you need, though.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, this isn’t a buy that will make you feel like you got a bargain or even a more efficient shave. This is the kind of personal-care product that rewards a slow, relaxed pace in your routine, transforming drudgery into luxury.</p>
<p>Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream makes you think about trying sample packs and ordering other scents for special occasions, or buying a premium hand-made shaving brush to make your morning even more luxe.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Taylor of Old Bond Street makes shaving cream for people who want a luxurious shave with great scents that leaves skin soft and supple.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Taylor-Street-Shaving-Cream-Sample/dp/B01M3ULTIQ/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mail-ordering a sample pack</a> is probably the best way to find the scents you like most (unless you live near a specialty shop).</li>
<li>This cream might be your first step down the rabbit hole of Shaving Cream/Soap Acquisition Disorder; if you’re not careful you might buy more than you can ever use.</li>

<h2 id="other-finalists">The other creams we tested</h2>
<h3>Aerosol shaving creams/gels</h3>
<p>We intended to pick a recommended canned shaving cream, but none of these rose to the top. Among the four, each has a selling point: Edge is the most protective, Nivea gives the closest shave, Aveeno strikes a balance that garnered a few “favorite product” picks (though some found it drying) and Barbasol was an underdog favorite of one tester and is by far the most economical. None of them performed better overall than Cremo.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0032ANCVE/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Edge &#8211; Shaving Gel</a> is the biggest single line in shaving cream, and if you’ve been shaving for more than a few years in North America there’s a good chance you’ve used one of their gel products.</p>
<p>If you really want a canned product, but want more protection than old-school foam offers, this is probably your best buy. It performs very much like Aveeno’s “Therapeutic” gel (they both note colloidal oatmeal as a key ingredient), but Edge typically sells for a dollar less per can (maybe even less if you get it on sale). Between the two, Edge seems to protect a bit more, while Aveeno gets you a closer shave.</p>
<p>Edge has an innocuous scent (similar to Aveeno, but a bit stronger) and lathers generously. However, it’s easy to spray out far more than you actually need. If you were very careful in how much you used, you could probably get the 40-70 shaves Edge claims out of a seven-ounce can.</p>

<p>Aveeno introduced their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000536EY/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shave Gel</a> in the 1990s to complement a line of oatmeal-enriched skin creams. It’s a popular shaving product among those who started out with something from Edge or Gillette, but experienced irritation or other problems, like ingrown hairs and shave bumps.</p>
<p>Aveeno’s gel is slick stuff, providing plenty of lubrication and moisturizing. The scent (no fragrance, just the smell of the ingredients) is very mild and neutral; you won’t smell like a barber shop after using it, but you won’t smell like a perfume counter or a fruit stand either. One tester said it was his favorite smell!</p>
<p>Availability for this product is great, but economy not so much. This is definitely targeted at people who anticipate having problems with any other product and will pay double or triple the price of a basic canned cream to avoid those problems with a trusted brand.</p>
<p>Many of our testers already used shaving gel in their day-to-day routine, and Aveeno managed to place above Edge in blind testing for lubricating slickness that gives close shaves. However, they typically felt Edge left skin feeling better. (Aveeno had more hits on the “dryness” count.)</p>
<p><strong>Nivea Men &#8211; Sensitive Shaving Foam</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-7510 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nivea-shaving-foam.jpg" alt="Nivea aerosol shaving cream" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nivea-shaving-foam.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nivea-shaving-foam-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nivea-shaving-foam-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nivea-shaving-foam-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nivea-shaving-foam-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nivea-shaving-foam-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nivea-shaving-foam-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nivea-shaving-foam-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nivea-shaving-foam-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nivea-shaving-foam-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nivea-shaving-foam-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nivea-shaving-foam-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Nivea’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DWGZM0C/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sensitive Shaving Foam</a> is the aerosol version of the well-regarded tube formula that we also tested, probably better known outside the U.S. (Drug stores here tend to only carry the canned gel formula, but we’ve seen the foam at Rite-Aid.)</p>
<p>This is a good shaving cream; it works like a good cream should and doesn’t get in the way of your razor. Plus, botanical ingredients help soothe irritated skin. Most liked this cream slightly more than Barbasol (it helps the razor glide a bit more), but nobody picked it as a favorite.</p>
<p>Notably, in our blind test, Nivea’s canned cream tied or fell behind the tube-based manual-lathering cream in every category except ease of rinsing. The tube contains extra oils that make it a bit slicker and more moisturizing and, of course, doesn’t use aerosols to create the bubbles.</p>

<p>Both cheap and readily available, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.target.com/p/A-16600514#lnk=sametab">Barbasol</a> is about as simple and honest a product as you can get. The can is red, white and blue, and smells like a barbershop. Despite the fact that Barbasol uses SLS along with the stearic acid in their soap formula, our most sensitive-skinned tester had no problems with this cream and chose it as his favorite.</p>
<p>If you’re prone to irritation and drying caused by the propellants used in canned shaving cream, this won’t be a good choice for you. Some people also don’t like the smell. That said, there are typically a few other Barbasol scents available to sample at your local drugstore, and there’s nothing really wrong with this stuff; it’s about as solid a baseline as you can get for a canned shaving cream.</p>
<p>With the biggest can at the lowest price, even if it is 80% water it’s hard to argue for a better value in shaving. You could probably get away with buying six dollars worth of Barbasol cream in a year, maybe less if you find it on sale. Some guys even claim crazy results like 255 days of shaving out of the $1.36 10 oz. can.</p>
<p>As a bonus, every time you get a new can of Barbasol, you may catch yourself checking to see if there are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4MUBQNbTYo">smuggled dinosaur embryos hidden inside.</a></p>
<p>Note: Barbasol is one of those cheap and plentiful products that is sometimes <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005FNVINA/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">horrifyingly expensive on Amazon</a>. At press time, the six-pack price is still the same as what you&#8217;d pay at the drugstore, but the single-can price is marked up heavily.</p>

<p>Van Der Hagen has been around as a soap supplier for a while, but they’ve jumped on board the upgrade-your-shave train with a full line of soaps, creams, a razor-and-brush set and this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Van-Hagen-Shave-Butter-Ounce/dp/B00OX5ZDI2/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“Shave Butter”</a> (most of which you can find at your local big-box discount retailer).</p>
<p>Unlike their shave soap, VDH targeted their Shave Butter at a person who doesn’t want to use a traditional brush, but is interested in a more skin-care-focused experience than canned foam. (Instructions on the tube even say you can rub it into your skin as an aftershave balm instead of rinsing it off.)</p>
<p>This stuff is not too thick to apply directly; it actually feels runny compared to some other creams, but you won’t feel your razor singing through hairs. Adding water and swirling it around your face does not produce <em>any</em> lather or foam, even with a brush.</p>
<p>Shave Butter is not an especially protective cream; this formula seems to go all the way past the lubricity end of the scale into shave-oil territory. Razors that plug easily will need frequent vigorous rinsing when you use this stuff, and while it helps moisturize it didn’t seem to do anything to stop nicks. This could be because of the extra aggression required to get a close shave.</p>
<p>The scent of this product seems to come mostly from the plant oils and maybe a hint of vanilla; it’s a lot like shaving in the same room as a batch of fresh cookies.</p>
<p>This ranked second-last for performance, but for leg-shaving in the shower (where dryness might be a bigger concern than protection against nicks), we got some very positive feedback. Then again, it might be the cookie-baking scent.</p>

<p>This is a love-it-or-hate-it product. Like the above shave butter, this stuff isn’t intended to lather. (Though as you can see, it does make some foam if you work at it.) Trader Joe’s has mixed their “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002URZUZG/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Honey Mango Cream Shave”</a> to a relatively concentrated gel-like consistency.</p>
<p>While this has all the right ingredients to protect your skin from a razor and keep you irritation-free, it’s not any good at getting you a closer shave. It’s hard to rinse, and despite all the moisturizing additives, none of the testers felt it did anything special for their skin.</p>
<p>If you really want to lather this stuff, it will foam up with a shaving brush — but the foam is ‘bubbly’ and thin. Basically all of the advantages it has when smeared on will disappear quickly when it’s thinned out; in that sense it’s a lot like the Van Der Hagen shave butter, but more difficult to apply.</p>
<p>And then there’s the scent. If Honey Mango is the smell you’re going for, this is sweet and tropical like a cocktail on the patio. Most of our testers hated it, but (again) plenty of women like the idea of a big tube of concentrated, fresh-smelling shave goop.</p>
<p>The main thing this “cream shave” has going for it is price: our local Trader Joe’s was selling the eight-ounce tube for $3.99. Since it’s relatively thick, that makes it the most economical tube-based product we tested. (Given that it’s so much more goopy when applying, though, we’re pretty sure you’ll wind up washing as much of it down the drain as any other product.) If you don’t have a local Trader Joe’s, paying inflated prices online is definitely not recommended.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004DU1Q4W/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kiss My Face &#8211; “4-in-1” Moisture Shave</a> is not a traditional shaving product, but it’s been around for 30 years and has a devoted following. 100% vegan and cruelty-free, this stuff aims squarely at people who want great shaving performance without any second-guessing about ingredients or ethics.</p>
<p>KMF is a bit harder to find than our top pick, but it’s often on the shelf at Whole Foods and Walgreens, and we found it at Albertsons in California. We only saw the unscented “moisture shave” formula when we did see it on the shelves.</p>
<p>While there are no fragrance ingredients, this does smell like salad oil. Most of the scented formulas that you can find online are said to have only very, very mild fragrances; the lavender or “Natural Man” versions are reportedly the only ones with a lasting scent.</p>
<p>As far as performance goes, KMF is easy to spread around (one of the thinner creams in the roundup) but lathers pretty easily with wet hands. If you’re using a shaving brush, it takes quite a bit of product to get a good foam building, probably three times what you’d use for a traditional wet shaving product like Proraso. (The above photo demonstrates what you get with one pump, lathered and unlathered.)</p>
<p>KMF is easier to apply than Cremo, but it doesn’t really reward any further effort. Once you get the hang of how Cremo reacts to water and agitation you can get a closer shave than with KMF, and better protection leading to less irritation. Our testers found that Cremo left the skin feeling softer, too.</p>
<p>KMF is well known among shaving nerds as a good product for a quick shave, and many use it as a “superlather” booster that can turn a cheap hard soap into an amazing shave with additional foam &amp; slickness (especially in hard water).</p>
<p>In our blind test, most had mixed reaction to KMF, some wondering if it was runny because it had gone bad. It performed well, but nobody liked it quite as much as Cremo.</p>

A company that popped up seemingly overnight and is aggressively pursuing the shaving-product market, Pacific Shaving Company puts out a solid product, though <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pacific-Shaving-Company-Caffeinated-Cream/dp/B00K7I4BQ4/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Caffeinated Shaving Cream</a> we tested was the most expensive in our lineup, and more than a bit gimmicky.</p>
<p>PSC invites you to “put caffeine on your mug, not in it.” The cream is supposed to “start your morning off with a kick,” and they claim that the antioxidant properties of caffeine “helps promote healthy skin.” It’s also vegan and cruelty-free.</p>
<p>Though they don’t say anything about lathering on the tube, this stuff is indeed mostly water and soap. Thin and easy to spread, the botanicals (aloe, shea) help it keep up with the pack for post-shave skin-feel and a hefty dose of spearmint extract definitely gives it a unique scent. The caffeine… well, nobody told us they felt especially anti-oxidized. We’ll keep the caffeine <em>in</em> our mugs, thank you very much.</p>
<p>If this were priced competitively, it might be a contender for a runner-up recommendation, but being so thin it’s also not especially protective. You’re far better off spending money elsewhere. This cream would probably cost you $50 per year if you used it every day, double the cost of our top pick. Then again, if you love the minty spearmint scent of toothpaste and have always longed for a way to shave with it, this might be the cream for you.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00837ZOI0/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Proraso</a> is made by Ludovico Martelli S.R.L., a family-run cosmetics/grooming manufacturer that claims to be the oldest in Italy. They’ve been selling this stuff in a tube since 1948. It’s a trusted product that pretty much defines the barbershop shave for several generations of Europeans (and more than a few Americans).</p>
<p>Martelli has refined the Proraso formula a few times, most recently to remove parabens from the recipe. The tingle of menthol and eucalyptus (and the corresponding “Italian barbershop” scent) remains.</p>
<p>Proraso lathers like a dream if you use a shaving brush, and it still gives a great shave if you’re just rubbing it into your face with wet hands. Like most traditional shaving creams, a little of it goes a long way!</p>
<p>Proraso’s limited availability coupled with the unique scent and feel make it hard to recommend sight-unseen; not everyone liked the scent or the menthol-tingle of this cream, and if you’re used to canned shaving creams then applying a lathering cream might take some getting used to. One of our testers hated Proraso.</p>
<p>This might be the easiest traditional shaving product to find in some parts of the country, but we haven’t seen any locally in California. You can almost always find it at Bath and Body Works with a different label: <a href="https://www.bigelowchemists.com/men/shaving/c-o-bigelow-premium-shave-cream.html">C.O. Bigelow</a> distributes Proraso’s original formula under their own label, and B&amp;BW is a good place to go if you want to sample it.</p>
<p>If you see it on sale in the big tube, it’s worth smelling to see if you want to try it, but we all thought Cremo gave a better daily shaving experience.</p>

<p>Beiersdorf has been making the Nivea line in Germany since 1911, and shaving cream specifically since the 1930s. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NB4VOM0/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nivea’s Sensitive Shaving Cream</a> is all but unavailable in the US these days (most retailers stopped carrying the tubes in the last couple of years, switching exclusively to the canned gel), but it’s widely available at bargain prices in much of the world.</p>
<p>Along with Proraso, this is one of the most trusted products in shaving worldwide. It protects slightly better than Proraso, though it may not be quite as easy to rinse; the lather also isn’t quite as stable as Proraso’s if you want mounds of dense foam that will last for your entire shaving session.</p>
<p>Some didn’t like the feel of the botanicals (chamomile, witch hazel), but on average this cream tied for second place in skin feel. It’s a great shaving cream, with an inoffensive fragrance reminiscent of Noxzema and other skin creams.</p>
<p>If you’re traveling and see this shaving cream for cheap, it’s a good buy. Paying between five and seven dollars for a 3.5 oz. tube on Amazon, though, just doesn’t make sense.</p>

<p>Shaving is a highly individualized part of our lives. We might use different razors or shave during different parts of the day, and we all have hair growing in a unique pattern. We can’t (and probably shouldn’t) all shave like <a href="https://youtu.be/-qSIP6uQ3EI">Mark Herro</a>.</p>
<p>This review only covers one part of the shaving experience; if you’re pondering a razor purchase, don’t worry, we’re working on that review too! But we’ve tried to make sure that our recommendation here will apply to a broad range of shaving styles.</p>
<p>If you do want to dip your toe into the world of luxury shaving products, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00432GALY/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Taylor of Old Bond Street</a> makes a fantastic cream that you can mail order for a reasonable price. It’ll take a bit of practice to get the most out of it, but it really does add a little something special to a shaving routine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C8XGF63/?tag=ybdshvc-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Our top pick, Cremo</a>, isn’t a simple product; it behaves differently than hard or cream soap, but it’s not at all like a shave oil or even a canned gel. (Traditionalists on the forums don’t seem to know what to say about it.)</p>
<p>We wondered what our testers would do without specific guidelines for how to use it; we just told them that some products were highly concentrated and would need generous amounts of water massaged in. The results came in overwhelmingly positive for Cremo. Even among testers who hated most of the other non-aerosol products, Cremo ranked high. It seems that they really did find a way to bring a better shave to everyone, and that is pretty astonishing.<br />
