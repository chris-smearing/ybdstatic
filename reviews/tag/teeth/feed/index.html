				<description><![CDATA[After wearing 16 trays and strips for three weeks, the Sparkling White Smiles custom tray system is the teeth whitening kit we'd still use every day.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter months of research and wearing 16 different trays and strips at work for three weeks, we&#8217;ve chosen the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System</a> as the best teeth whitening kit. This is the one system we&#8217;d keep using every day, with custom-made trays that fit perfectly. The kit even includes enough whitening supplies for months of touch-ups. If you&#8217;re looking for strips, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B1X3I1W/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lovely Smile &#8211; Bright White</a> is a reliable, affordable choice. We also tested some faster-acting products and found strategies for sensitive teeth.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>Teeth whitening products are, for the most part, re-packaged supplies made for dentists to use in-office or give to patients for home treatment under professional supervision.</p>
<p>The one whitening product that&#8217;s &#8220;accepted&#8221; for at-home use by the American Dental Association is Crest&#8217;s Whitestrips line, which is now in its second generation of products and branded &#8220;Crest 3D White.&#8221; This was an obvious place to start.</p>
<p>When we researched the most-purchased products, though, it&#8217;s pretty obvious that most people who want white smiles don&#8217;t mind buying at-home whitening products that aren&#8217;t formally approved.</p>
<p>Over-the-counter teeth whitening kits use low concentrations of peroxide and are not considered dangerous. The FDA does not regulate teeth whitening kits sold in the U.S. Of course, dentists are quick to point out the uncertainty that comes with this lack of regulation. Dentists have access to stronger whitening products and the training to use them safely.</p>
<p>Written reviews of whitening kits are typically vague about product recommendations, and we didn&#8217;t find any comparative reviews that assess kits against one another.</p>
<p>We did find lots of conversation about teeth whitening on the web. The conversation is mostly about how well whitening works, how quickly it works, and whether it&#8217;s safe to do at home. Subreddits like r/dentistry frequently discuss the pros and cons of at-home whitening.</p>
<p>We looked at the top-selling products available at local discount stores and on major online retailers, and after closely scrutinizing 35 different products and whitening systems, we bought 16 different products to test, including five kits, five types of whitening strips, three stand-alone tray kits and three whitening gel products not sold as kits.</p>
<p>Two of the highest-rated gels we bought, from Philips and Opalescence, are labelled for sale through a dentist but still designed for use at home.</p>
<p>After looking at the range available and talking to a dentist, we decided to test the most popular 35-percent strength in most kits to see if our tester had any sensitivity or other reactions. We also tried a few slightly stronger or slightly weaker solutions.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-whiten">How to whiten teeth at home</h2>
<p>Teeth whitening is very complex. Each person has different teeth and different stains, so it&#8217;s nearly impossible to say what success you&#8217;ll have with a particular whitening method. But the treatment itself is very simple, and the differences between products are minimal.</p>
<p>The ways that dentists will whiten your teeth are well-established. Dentists have been testing whitening treatments in their offices and with take-home kits for decades, and the methods haven&#8217;t changed much. The teeth whitening kits you can buy for yourself are, for the most part, the same thing you&#8217;d get from a dentist.</p>
<p>Whitening teeth involves bleaching built-up organic compounds like tannins from your teeth. This is more than just scrubbing a film off the surface: Whitening products actually remove stains from within the enamel.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>There are two compounds commonly used to achieve this bleaching: hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide. Unstable oxygen-rich molecules in these compounds quickly break down many (but not all) stains.</p>
<p><b>The two molecules are so similar because about 35 percent of carbamide peroxide </b><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/hydrogen-peroxide-urea" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>breaks down directly into hydrogen peroxide</b></a><b>, so the bleaching action is basically identical. </b>Carbamide is more stable in storage, which also makes it take longer to reach its maximum potential effect.</p>
<p>The big debate in teeth whitening is over the best way to evenly apply those peroxides to your teeth — and only to your teeth. Whitening strips stick a peroxide-laced gel onto the front of your teeth, while gel-filled trays can hold a stronger solution in place with a (low) risk of your swallowing it or burning your gums.</p>
<p>Toothpaste with peroxide can also help whiten teeth, though it&#8217;s in such a low concentration that you might never notice any gradual change.</p>
<h3>Charcoal teeth whitener</h3>
<p>Whatever you do, don&#8217;t try to scrub your stains off with an abrasive charcoal powder or use household cleaners in hopes of getting quick results. According to <a href="https://jada.ada.org/article/S0002-8177(17)30412-9/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies of popular products</a>, charcoal teeth whitener toothpaste is usually abrasive enough to do more harm than good. Gentle natural-alternative tooth polishes can be fine as a detergent-free way to keep your teeth clean, but don&#8217;t sacrifice your enamel to get a whiter smile.</p>

<p><b>Whitening strips:</b> The most basic and easiest type of whitening product, these strips of gel usually contain hydrogen peroxide and stick firmly to the surface of your teeth.</p>
<p><b>Trays:</b> If you want to keep a stronger solution of peroxide in better contact with all your front teeth, a tray keeps it on your teeth.</p>
<p>There are four types of trays available:</p>
<p><b>Universal-fit trays:</b> If you don&#8217;t want to go through the trouble of molding a tray to the shape of your teeth, this style will do the job and keep whitening solution or other dental products on your teeth, but they&#8217;re usually not comfortable to wear for more than a few minutes.</p>
<p><b>Heat-moldable trays: </b>These trays are made from a heat-moldable EVA plastic (related to what&#8217;s in a hot glue stick.) When you heat the tray in almost-boiling water, it becomes soft enough to take an impression of your teeth, and you can usually get a perfect fit. Once it’s cooled, you could trim the tray if you want, but the plastic is quite thick. These trays will warp if you rinse them in hot water or leave them in the sun, and then they&#8217;d need to be re-molded to fit.</p>
<p><b>Custom-made trays: </b>These trays are made by a dental service laboratory to fit exactly over plaster copies of your teeth, and excess tray material is trimmed back to the gumline. Your dentist&#8217;s office can make impressions of your teeth and handle the order, but we found many mail-order labs that will sell you a kit to make impressions at home.</p>
<p><b>Disposable Trays: </b>This is a new type of product from Opalescence. Their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IU5EDKK/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GO system</a> uses waxy, moldable trays that come pre-filled for full-coverage whitening without having to squirt any peroxide gel out of a tube.</p>

<p>Whitening strips are some of the most popular whitening products on the market, and for good reason: Starting with the introduction of Crest &#8211; Whitestrips in 2001, at-home whitening went from scary to dentist-approved.</p>
<p>The Crest line of whitening strips from Procter and Gamble is still the only at-home bleaching brand with the <a href="https://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/ada-seal-products/category-display?category=Bleaching+Products" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Dental Association&#8217;s Seal of Acceptance</a>. That means they&#8217;ve paid a lot of money to run patient trials to show that the product works as described and is safe.</p>
<p>One downside to whitening strips is that the peroxide-carrying gel isn&#8217;t able to fill in all the nooks and crannies of your smile: If you have overlapping or crooked teeth, the strips are likely to whiten the forward-facing parts and leave other parts untouched.</p>
<p>The other downside to whitening strips is that manufacturers use vague terms to describe the strength of what you&#8217;re buying. Percentages of active carbamide or hydrogen peroxide are always listed for gel-and-tray systems, but the concentration of active ingredients are rarely listed on whitening strips.</p>
<h2 id="side-effects">Who should avoid teeth whitening?</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.ada.org/en/member-center/oral-health-topics/whitening" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADA&#8217;s summary of clinical trials</a>, sensitivity and gum irritation are the primary known side effects of whitening. These side-effects will subside, but for a weeks-long course of treatment you&#8217;ll want to know what you&#8217;re in for.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got cavities, whitening could put hydrogen peroxide directly in contact with the nerves and blood vessels in your roots, so if you have any suspicion of decay, you should definitely get a check-up before whitening.</p>
<p>If your gums are irritated already — even just from eating something like popcorn — you&#8217;ll be more likely to feel a sting from the whitening gel if you get it on your gums. Some of the kits we tested recommend rinsing with salt water before a whitening treatment to determine if your gums will be hyper-sensitive to the peroxide.</p>
<p>Another warning we saw in whitening directions is about uneven whitening: Mineral deposits will not bleach at the same rate as the rest of your enamel. Likewise, if you&#8217;ve got veneers, partial prosthetic teeth or anything other than tooth enamel in your smile, whitening products will only bleach your real tooth surfaces.</p>

<p>The sad reality is that quick-acting whitening products are also more likely to make your teeth hurt. Studies have shown a <a href="https://www.cda-adc.ca/jcda/vol-65/issue-4/201.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">64-percent rate of complaint</a> among patients with a fairly low concentration of 10-percent carbamide peroxide (or 3.6-percent hydrogen peroxide) which still takes 2 to 3 days of hours-long treatment to show any results.</p>
<p>When we asked officemates about their experiences with teeth whitening (whether at a dentist&#8217;s office or at home), we got similar feedback: Not everyone will have problems with tooth pain after whitening, but many people do.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vanhaywood.com/uploads/articlespage/NGVB%20Limit%20Indic%20JapUKTB06.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Dr. Van Haywood</a>, increasing the strength of the peroxide solution doesn&#8217;t give a linear increase in whitening performance, which means that doubling the strength won&#8217;t necessarily whiten twice as fast. But the effect on sensitivity does increase more directly, so if you&#8217;re trying out at-home whitening you&#8217;ll probably want to stick with a lower-strength product and plan to use it for longer.</p>
<p>The good news, is that you don&#8217;t sacrifice overall results with weaker solutions: Teeth will only whiten a certain amount with these treatments, so using extra-strong products just gets you there more quickly.</p>
<p>Many dentists will suggest a sensitivity-fighting toothpaste like Sensodyne, which contains fluoride and potassium nitrate, both of which <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11820045" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been shown in studies to help reduce sensitivity</a> without reducing the effectiveness of whitening gels. We found suggestions on Reddit that you should start brushing with a sensitivity-fighting toothpaste (or massaging it into your teeth) even weeks before you start bleaching.</p>
<p>Some whitening gels we tested already have potassium nitrate and fluoride in the gel, including the two big-name products we tested: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0141J993Y/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Zoom DayWhite</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00147X6DQ/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Opalescence &#8211; PF</a>. The less-expensive all-in-one at-home kits did not have these ingredients.</p>
<p>Philips also adds a re-mineralizing &#8220;amorphous calcium phosphate&#8221; solution in their whitening gel that’s designed to help restore the surface of your teeth. This is the main reason we found to buy the more expensive whitening gel; in most other ways they&#8217;re identical to other carbamide or hydrogen peroxide solutions on the market.</p>
<p>If you want to stick to the more commonly available whitening products, you can still help reduce sensitivity with a specialized toothpaste containing stannous fluoride, potassium nitrate, Amorphous Calcium Phosphate (ACP) or Colgate&#8217;s proprietary &#8220;pro-argin&#8221; treatment. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078HQ48JX/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sensodyne&#8217;s fluoride-and-potassium</a> product is the best-known over-the-counter brand in the U.S., but ask your dentist about specialized products that might suit your particular sensitivity.</p>
<p>Nova-min is another compound that has worked very well in clinical trials, but after GlaxoSmithKline bought the rights in 2012, they&#8217;ve basically removed it from the North American market. You can buy Nova-min toothpaste from overseas, if you&#8217;re willing to pay a premium. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EF39784/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Here&#8217;s an Amazon listing for the import Sensodyne formula</a>.</p>
<h2 id="one-day-results">Can you whiten teeth in one day?</h2>
<p>Ideally, a tooth whitening system would work instantly. Few of us plan what we&#8217;ll look like at important meetings or in photographs much more than a week in advance, much less a month’s worth of hour-a-day treatments.</p>
<p>As we mentioned above, the downside to using stronger concentrations of whitening agents is sensitivity, but there&#8217;s another factor to remember: Whitening results vary, and you might not get any better result with an expensive in-office treatment than you would with a take-home kit.</p>
<p>If your dentist offers in-office &#8220;power bleaching&#8221; treatment, you&#8217;ll probably have access to the latest in light-activation tools and stronger concentrations of whitening product than you&#8217;d be comfortable using at home. If you really only have one day, a dentist will be able to give you reliable and safe results.</p>
<p>If you have the time, however, a long-term treatment should be just as effective (and much more affordable) than in-office options.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s one major hurdle to testing whitening products: Everyone&#8217;s results will be different. No two smiles are alike, and you can&#8217;t know if the stains that you have will be as easy to remove as another person&#8217;s. We tested with a single subject who has mildly sensitive teeth and no cavities or gum problems.</p>
<p>That said, there&#8217;s a reason all of these products use hydrogen peroxide (and carbamide peroxide, which breaks down to become hydrogen peroxide) as their whitening agent. It&#8217;s been proven to work, and it&#8217;s predictable. Every whitening system designed for effective at-home use is based on peroxide bleaching.</p>
<p>We bought 13 different whitening products, and our tester used them over the course of three months, focusing mostly on differentiating ease of use rather than the effect of the active ingredients.</p>
<p>We tested the activity of the peroxide gels in a coffee-stain test to make sure that these kits aren&#8217;t including fake or watered-down supplies, but it&#8217;s impossible for us to say anything more conclusive than that about results.</p>

<p>First, we laid out each kit and compared the instructions given. We found that the guidance from each product was similar, though some kits were definitely more thorough.</p>
<p>Instructions for shaping the mouthguard were almost always more detailed than instructions for applying the whitening product itself. Instructions for using whitening strips, which we admit are a fairly simple type of product to use, were almost non-existent.</p>
<p>We were expecting some clarification or guidance related to how long to use each product, but in most cases the recommended treatment times included wide ranges and seemed almost arbitrary. If you leave the bleach on your teeth longer, you&#8217;ll get more of an effect, but these suppliers are wary of making promises.</p>
<p>Standout instructions came with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System</a>, which is a good thing since a mistake mixing silicone putty and taking an impression could result in a wasted kit. Thankfully, Sparkling White Smiles also offers an extra tray’s worth of impression putty.</p>
<h3>Ease of molding process</h3>
<p>Timing is important with two-part silicone putty, since it hardens within a minute of mixing, but the heat-molded trays in the other kits required watching for signs that the walls were beginning to droop and acting immediately. One tray left in for a few seconds too long stuck to itself (like the instructions warned) and required a complete do-over.</p>
<p>Most kits include spare heat-moldable tray materials, just in case. Instructions for the kits were adequate, with no real stand-out winners. The timing for when to remove the tray from the hot water, when to put it in your mouth, and keeping all the edges from sticking together was surprisingly complex but manageable.</p>
<h3>Fit and comfort</h3>
[table id=288 /]
<p>Our tester used each tray-style kit to make impressions of his teeth. For most of the heat-shaped trays, the fitting process was repeated once or twice to get a comfortable and secure fit that wouldn&#8217;t leak whitening gel out or saliva in.</p>
<p>The trays from the Sparkling White Smiles lab were, of course, the best-fitting. The quality of fit from the shape-it-yourself trays was surprisingly good, despite our tester&#8217;s lack of experience with the process. Thinner material, like the AuraGlow and Cali White trays used, was easiest to shape.</p>
<p>We tested three other generic heat-formable whitening tray products to see if there was any difference between what&#8217;s included with whitening kits and other popular options. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nova White</a> is the only company selling trays that are notably different, with thicker, textured plastic that curls rapidly if you let it get too hot. With some practice, the thicker plastic allows for an excellent fit.</p>
<p>Two kits we tested included universal-fit trays that don&#8217;t require heat-molding. Cali White includes this as an option along with two trays you can heat-mold, but the highly-rated <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079SNKQJX/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MySmile &#8211; Teeth Whitening Kit</a> only has a universal tray.</p>
<p>After trying two days of whitening with the giant trays, we don&#8217;t recommend them at all. This is definitely one-size-fits nobody, and for our tester, having a giant piece of plastic wedged in his mouth only led to uncomfortable half-hour sessions dealing with excessive saliva.</p>
<p>If heating the custom-fit trays scares you off, then whitening strips or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IU5EDKK/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Opalescence &#8211; GO</a> system are better options.</p>
<h3>Bleach strength</h3>
<p>We tested the strength of each solution on a piece of paper dyed with concentrated coffee.</p>
<p>The big surprise with this test is that whitening strips and some of the thicker gels are basically inactive unless they get wet. On dry paper, they had almost no bleaching effect at all. But after we washed the residue off the paper from the first test, we started to see bleaching in those areas.</p>
<p>The relative difference in activity between the different solutions, which range from an equivalent of 6-percent hydrogen peroxide up to 15 percent, was hard to see in this test. The difference in effect was more noticeable between thick and thin gel than it was between strong and weak concentrations.</p>
<p>Based on what we&#8217;ve read about the effects of peroxide bleaching on different people, it seems like a weaker solution over a longer period of time will have the best outcome. This means more time with the trays in your mouth, and also more days before you start expecting results, but usually less pain from sensitized teeth.</p>
<p>That said, the common 35-percent carbamide peroxide gel included in most over-the-counter kits is popular for a reason. You should see some results in a week, even with half-hour daily whitening sessions.</p>
<h2 id="led-whitening-kits">Does LED whitening do anything?</h2>
<p>LED lights is the most polarizing part of over-the-counter whitening systems. It&#8217;s obviously an effective marketing strategy for companies like HiSmile and Express Smile Atlanta capitalizing on celebrity instagram endorsements.</p>
<p>Three of the kits we purchased included lights: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072LF2356/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cali White &#8211; Deluxe Whitening System</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079SNKQJX/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MySmile &#8211; Teeth Whitening Kit</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M63SQTI/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Crest &#8211; 3D White Whitestrips with Light</a>.</p>
<p>Theoretically, these lights could possibly make a small difference by heating up the peroxide and drying out your enamel.</p>
<p>Note that the ADA does list the whole Crest &#8211; 3D White line as &#8220;accepted,&#8221; but <a href="https://www.ada.org/en/member-center/oral-health-topics/whitening" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they also clearly state</a> that from their reviews of published research they don&#8217;t think light-activation makes a difference.</p>
<p>The lights included with over-the-counter kits aren&#8217;t even close to the equivalent of a light-activated treatment at your dentist&#8217;s office. Those machines use a laser or other high-wattage system, not 50 cents worth of cheap LED emitters. Even those expensive in-office light systems might not be making much of a difference, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4178330/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some studies show</a>.</p>

<p>We tried these three LED systems for a few sessions, to be thorough, but then we tried some control tests on paper and an eggshell. Masking off part of the test surface with foil to see if the light was making a difference, our tests showed no change in whitening with the light, even after 10 repeated treatments.</p>
<p>Our tester was happy to put all the LED parts back into the boxes and go back to whitening with just trays and gel. Taking a selfie with a strange device hanging out of your mouth is kind of cute, but it&#8217;s awkward enough wearing just trays or strips every day.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System</a> is a professional-grade whitening setup at a price that&#8217;s almost impossible to beat. For about the same price as a few boxes of Crest &#8211; Whitestrips, you get truly custom-crafted whitening trays and a generous supply of carbamide peroxide gel.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever had orthodontic work done, you probably know the teeth impression procedure: A dental assistant has you bite down on a plastic tray filled with silicone putty, then after the putty solidifies they send away the impressions to make castings of your teeth. After that, they can more easily make dental devices that fit the exact shape of your teeth.</p>
<p>Lab-made whitening trays use exactly that same procedure, but in the age of next-day shipping, you can get trays made without an office visit and at a much lower price. Yes, you have to mix the putty yourself, but that&#8217;s one of the few differences between this kit and getting trays made at the dentist.</p>

<p>Mixing and molding the impressions of your teeth with the included putty is a straightforward procedure, and the instructions included are thorough. The two pieces of putty are a little bit firmer than silly putty, and the colors make it easy to see when you&#8217;ve mashed them together long enough to mix. You then have a few minutes to press your teeth into the putty with the provided tray and wait for it to harden.</p>
<p>If you have difficulty making one set of impressions, Sparkling White Smiles includes enough putty to make one extra impression, and they&#8217;ll walk you through the process if you run into major trouble.</p>

After you send in your impressions these trays will get back to you in a few weeks, and then you'll have a complete at-home whitening setup just like your dentist would sell you.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Once you make your impressions, drop the trays and address form in the mail and your completed trays will be mailed back to you in two weeks. If you&#8217;re in more of a hurry than that, Sparkling White Smiles also offers rush shipping for $22. You have to include a check or credit card info for express service or spare trays.</p>
<p>You can also order a custom-fit soft night guard that&#8217;s thicker than the whitening trays for an extra $46. The whitening trays are thin, so if you&#8217;ve got a major teeth-grinding problem, you might want to shell out for the dedicated guard. $46 isn&#8217;t cheap, but this is still much less than paying most dentists to have a guard made.</p>
<h3>The rest of the kit</h3>
<p>Based on the trays alone, the relatively high cost of the Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System might make the popular mold-it-yourself tray kits like AuraGlow a more obvious option. With enough gel for 50 treatments, though, the $80 we paid for this system was well worth it.</p>
<p>The gel included with the Sparkling White Smiles kit is 22-percent carbamide peroxide. That&#8217;s weaker than many popular kits, which isn&#8217;t a bad thing. Many dentists recommend concentrations as low as 10 percent for at-home treatment, with much longer treatment times to ensure maximum effectiveness. The instructions suggest treating for 30 minutes twice daily with this solution, which is more tray time but less risk of tooth pain than other systems.</p>
<p>Other manufacturers selling the same strength of product, like Opalescence, suggest up to two hours of treatment time with this strength of solution, but it&#8217;s best to consult your dentist if you have specific questions about finding the right treatment regimen for your teeth.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>If you want the very best at-home whitening system, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System</a> gets you a professional fit for less than $100.</li>
<li>Mailing in impressions of your teeth is an extra step, but that&#8217;s still a lot quicker than making two dentist appointments.</li>
<li>The fit and feel of these trays is perfect, and taking impressions went smoothly.</li>
<li>Sparkling White Smiles includes enough 22-percent carbamide peroxide gel for about 50 treatments.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B1X3I1W/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bright White strips from Lovely Smile</a> are, as far as we can tell, identical to most other whitening strips on the market. The active ingredient is a small amount of hydrogen peroxide, and the strips themselves are thin and adhere well to teeth.</p>
<p>Lovely Smile suggests applying these thrips for 15 to 30 minutes during your first go, and for one hour per day after that. The kit contains enough strips for two weeks of whitening treatments, the same treatment length as Crest Whitestrips.</p>
<p>As we hope has been made clear, there&#8217;s no way to say exactly how effective any particular treatment will be for your teeth, but these strips are a low-risk way to start.</p>
<p>As with any whitening strips, the biggest problem is applying them carefully and evenly. It seems the peroxide in these strips is weak enough that they&#8217;re not likely to cause any harm, but you wouldn&#8217;t want to stick them to your gums every day. If you do find your gums sensitive after using strips, the irritation is temporary and should go away quickly.</p>
<p>Some dentists recommend trimming whitening strips so that they&#8217;re only a wide as you need to cover your most visible teeth, since nobody can tell how white your molars are. Excess strip material means more chance it&#8217;ll be touching your gums or even the roof of your mouth on the inside. The Lovely Smile strips are as easy to trim as the other brands are, and it&#8217;s reassuring that the pieces you&#8217;re throwing away aren&#8217;t as expensive.</p>

Hydrogen peroxide is a proven ingredient for strip-based whitening, and the menthol helps you know if you've applied them correctly.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B1X3I1W?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The only drawback to Lovely Smile strips in particular is the hour-long recommended treatment time: strips are pretty easy to get used to compared to trays, but by the time an hour is up you&#8217;ll be ready to get them out of your mouth. The Crest &#8211; Glamorous White and Solimo strips have instructions for half-hour treatment times.</p>
<p>A tingle from the menthol additive in these strips is also a good indicator that you’ve started dissolving the gel in your saliva or that it&#8217;s stuck to your gum tissue instead of your teeth.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re done with your daily hour of strip-wearing, you&#8217;ll definitely want a place to rinse and brush your teeth. A paper towel works in a pinch to wipe the gel off, but it&#8217;s very sticky stuff. Most of the strips we tested were the same in this regard.</p>
<h3>The drawbacks of whitening strips</h3>
<p>As with any product like this, the sticky gel on the Lovely White strip has to touch your tooth enamel to whiten it. If you&#8217;ve got irregular teeth that overlap or otherwise prevent even contact, strips could inadvertently whiten only some parts of your teeth. Trays are a much better way to go in that case.</p>
<p>If you want the assurance that comes from the American Dental Association seal of acceptance, you&#8217;re going to have to spend about double the price of these strips to get the guarantees of Crest&#8217;s famous white strips. The results you get from the Lovely White strips should be the same.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re turned off by the lesser-known brands recommended above, you&#8217;re in luck: You can buy the same whitening products online that your dentist will sell you, usually at a much lower cost. Our pick is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0141J993Y/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Zoom Day White</a> system. This product doesn&#8217;t come with trays, but that&#8217;s easy to address with off-the-shelf heat-molded trays like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this affordable set from Nova White</a>.</p>
<p>Zoom is a whitening system that&#8217;s been used by dentists since the 1990s. Philips bought Zoom from Discus Dental in 2010, and it&#8217;s now one of the top systems used in dental offices.</p>
<p>We picked Zoom over other high-concentration formulas for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, Philips uses hydrogen peroxide rather than carbamide peroxide, and it should work better in short treatment sessions for most people than the equivalent concentration of carbamide peroxide.</p>
<p>Second, Philips includes a remineralization and sensitivity-fighting formula in this package. Potassium nitrate is the same active ingredient used in sensitivity-numbing toothpaste, and Amorphous Calcium Phosphate (ACP) should help restore the surface of your tooth enamel.</p>
<p>Yes, you can get these sensitivity treatments in a toothpaste, but if you&#8217;re already spending half an hour every day putting fancy goop on your teeth, why not kill two birds with one stone?</p>
<p>Even buying it on Amazon, Zoom isn&#8217;t exactly a bargain. Compared to the rock-bottom price of 47 cents per treatment when you&#8217;re buying generic carbamide gel and heat-molded trays, or a cost of $1.60 per treatment for the perfect fit you get with the Sparkling White Smiles kit, the $3.87 per-treatment cost of the Philips system (including a $10 for a separate set of trays) is steep. But it&#8217;s comparable to the cost of some popular all-in-one kits, and you&#8217;re getting sensitivity treatment along with the higher-strength whitening solution.</p>

If you're looking for the fastest results you can get without booking an expensive hyper-bleach at your dentist, this is a good alternative.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0141J993Y?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The downside to buying professional-grade whitening gel on the internet is that these items aren&#8217;t actually intended to be sold direct-to-consumer. That is, they&#8217;re intended to be sold to you by a dentist, not by a dental supply warehouse running an Amazon store.</p>
<p>This whitening gel is designed for at-home with the guidance of a dentist, and the instructions are written that way. Also, Philips won’t give you a refund as Crest will if you aren&#8217;t happy with your results.</p>
<p>That said, 14-percent peroxide is still low compared to the products dentists will use for one-day whitening treatments. This stuff will sting if it gets on your gums, but it&#8217;s not dangerous unless you put it in your eye.</p>
<h3>Affordable, high-quality trays: NovaWhite</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23497" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite.jpg" alt="Philips - Zoom with Nova White trays" width="2000" height="1335" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-1000x668@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-768x513.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-885x591.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-810x541.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-1000x668.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-320x214.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-885x591@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-320x214@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re buying the Philips &#8211; Zoom gel by itself, you&#8217;ll also need trays. This is the trickiest part of at-home whitening: Heat-molded trays included in most kits are good enough, but they&#8217;re not foolproof.</p>
<p>Our pick for a stand-alone tray to go with Zoom refills is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NovaWhite heat moldable trays</a>: They conform very well to your teeth and they&#8217;re a bargain at less than $10 for a set of four.</p>
<p>That said, the NovaWhite trays do curl over just a bit more quickly when you&#8217;re heating them in hot water than some of the other trays. We found these to be excellent trays for a low price, but plan on shaping both pairs of trays to get the best fit, and follow the instructions about heating time carefully.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to use name-brand whitening gel like your dentist will sell you, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0141J993Y/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Zoom Day White</a> is one of the best.</li>
<li>Philips tempers the strength of this 14-percent peroxide solution with sensitivity-fighting potassium nitrate.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s also a calcium-restoring gel in this solution</li>
<li>Zoom also comes in lower concentrations, but this is our pick for a fast-acting whitening solution.</li>

<h3>AuraGlow &#8211; Radiant Effects</h3>
<p>If you want a complete kit that provides good value, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7Y5P9D/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AuraGlow &#8211; Radiant Effects whitening kit</a> is popular for a reason. The trays included in this kit were a little bit easier to heat and mold than most, with good instructions that resulted in a good fit the first time with no tweaking necessary.</p>
<p>After making seven complete sets of kits, we rank this set close to the top. AuraGlow&#8217;s trays give you a little more leeway when you&#8217;re trying to decide if it&#8217;s time to pull them out of the water. The tray material doesn&#8217;t just curl over and stick to itself if it&#8217;s in the hot water two seconds too long.</p>
<p>Your results may vary, of course, with do-it-yourself heat-molded trays. That&#8217;s why we picked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System</a> as our top choice. The thicker, softer plastic of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NovaWhite</a> trays also felt just a little bit tighter overall once we tweaked them with a re-heat and a second attempt at getting a perfect fit.</p>
<p>The gel that comes with the AuraGlow kit isn&#8217;t any worse than what comes with the Sparkling White Smiles kit; it&#8217;s a bit stronger, but you should be careful about keeping it off your gums either way. At $1.50 per application, this set is about half the cost of buying Philips &#8211; Zoom refills and a set of trays, without any of the fancy additives included there.</p>
<p>Compared to the cost of the very least-expensive products available, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004BLXG5U/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SensAllis gel refills</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nova White trays</a>, this kit looks more expensive. Buying the most economical supplies comes out to one third the price-per-application of an AuraGlow kit, though you might never use up all that gel.</p>
<p>On the whole, the AuraGlow kit makes the most sense if you intend to stop whitening after using the one month of included treatments. A month of 35-percent carbamide should theoretically get you all the improvement you&#8217;re likely to see, but results vary.</p>
<h3>Cali White &#8211; Deluxe Whitening System</h3>
<p>If you just have to have a selfie with an LED light for your Instagram story, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072LF2356/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cali White &#8211; Deluxe Whitening System</a> is the LED-bundle kit we&#8217;d pick over the others we checked out.</p>
<p>For about $5 more than AuraGlow&#8217;s kit, Cali White includes a universal-fit tray, which is actually much more awkward than it looks. The included heat-moldable trays are practically identical to the trays included with AuraGlow&#8217;s kit, and you get the same amount of carbamide peroxide gel.</p>
<p>Cali White goes out of their way to promote the benefits of baking soda, cranberry seed extract and aloe in their whitening gel, but it&#8217;s still carbamide peroxide doing the work.</p>
<p>The LED light included is kind of neat, but so far as we can tell it doesn&#8217;t speed up whitening in any way. We tried it, and it&#8217;s more annoying than it could possibly be worth.</p>
<p>Overall, the Cali White kit isn&#8217;t a bad buy for the trays and peroxide gel, but there&#8217;s no reason to pick it over the AuraGlow system.</p>
<h3>Opalescence &#8211; GO</h3>
<p>The take-home universal-fit <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IU5EDKK/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Opalescence &#8211; GO</a> system is unique in that it offers many of the advantages of both tray systems and whitening strips.</p>
<p>This product includes a universal-fit tray that&#8217;s pre-filled with Opalescence hydrogen peroxide gel, but it&#8217;s a moldable wax tray. You put the plastic holder over your teeth, squeeze the tray to fit just right, then remove the plastic.</p>
<p>Sadly, this isn&#8217;t as easy as it sounds. The trays are quite large to fit a wider range of mouth sizes, which means you need to carefully judge how far up and back to move them before you can squeeze them into shape.</p>
<p>These trays have far more gel than we&#8217;ve seen suggested by any filling instructions in other kits — there&#8217;s even gel for the inside of your back molars, just in case your date is shining a flashlight into your mouth.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re squeezing gel around as you mold the tray to fit your teeth, and this is Opalescent&#8217;s thick glue-like gel, not the watery stuff most kits come with. It&#8217;ll stay in place fairly well, but it&#8217;s not as easy to wipe off your gums.</p>
<p>Once you get the hang of how these trays work, they can be made to fit very well. Opalescence is popular with dentists, so if you have questions about strength or timing your regular dentist might be more likely to give you advice. It&#8217;s not as comfortable using this system as strips or custom-made trays, but it&#8217;s better than non-molded trays.</p>
<p>On the whole, we&#8217;re not sold on the value of this product. It&#8217;s not really harder to learn how to fit a heat-molded plastic tray than these waxy trays, and this product is far more expensive than anything else we tested.</p>
<p>At nearly $6 per set of trays, the best reason to go with this system is if you want to share a package with someone for a quick week of touch-up whitening, or you really hate the idea of squeezing hot plastic into your mouth.</p>

<h3>Solimo &#8211; 10-day kit</h3>
<p>Direct from whatever factory makes all of these strips for everyone, Amazon brings you their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CNW4LN5/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Solimo-branded 10-day whitening kit.</a> With the same active ingredients as Crest &#8211; 3D White Whitestrips and the slightly less-expensive Lovely Smile strips, the main reason to pick this set would be if the Lovely White 14-pack is out of stock. The differences between the products are minimal.</p>
<h3>Crest &#8211; 3D White Whitestrips</h3>
<p>We tested both the 3D White <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001OOLLVS/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glamorous White</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M63SQTI/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">&#8220;With Light&#8221;</a> packages, and the differences are, again, minimal. In our control test to check peroxide-bleaching activity, these strips gave very similar results on coffee stains. The main difference is the taller, narrower strip you&#8217;re given for your bottom teeth in the Glamorous White packages, and of course the $34 LED light.</p>
<p>Crest&#8217;s &#8220;With Light&#8221; package also comes with directions that suggest using the strips for a full hour, rather than Glamorous White’s half-hour. It&#8217;s possible that the hydrogen peroxide solution is weaker in the “With Light” package, but Crest might also be using the difference in directions to suggest better results from the more expensive kit.</p>
<p>The LED light from Crest, as in the other kits, showed no effect on the activity of the peroxide in a controlled bleaching test. It&#8217;s possible it could warm your teeth slightly, but it&#8217;s a very small and low-power light source.</p>
<p>The one edge Crest has over the other strip-type whitening kits is that they&#8217;ve spent a lot of money getting the necessary research in place to earn the <a href="https://www.ada.org/en/press-room/news-releases/2017-archives/june/crest-3d-white-glamorous-white-whitestrips-to-receive-ada-seal-of-acceptance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Dental Association&#8217;s Seal of Acceptance</a>. While that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean this system is better than other whitening products, it does mean that it has been proven to work safely in a lot of tests.</p>
<p>Crest (owned by Procter and Gamble) is the only consumer-sale whitening product manufacturer that has successfully applied for the Seal on a whitening product. They&#8217;re in a similar place to P&amp;G&#8217;s Oral-B <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-electric-toothbrush/">electric toothbrushes that we tested</a>: This brand proven, but that doesn&#8217;t mean other brands are selling ineffective products. The ADA won&#8217;t tell us if a company has ever paid up and still failed to earn the Seal on an over-the-counter product.</p>
<h3>Lumist</h3>
<p>The whitening strips from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BFWQEZG/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lumist</a> are the most unique of all the strips we researched. Rather than have just a plastic backing on a sticky peroxide-carrying gel, Lumist makes their backing more formable and stretchy. You can mold these strips around tooth features that the other strips will just bubble and crease on, ironically making Lumist a more three-dimensional solution that Crest&#8217;s so-called 3D Whitestrips.</p>
<p>Lumist uses 20-percent carbamide peroxide in these strips, which makes them faster-acting than other strips and potentially as quick as a tray and gel solution. The price of the Lumist strips is the weak point, though; at $6 per treatment, they’re almost as expensive as the stronger and more comfortable-to-wear Opalescence &#8211; GO trays.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Whitening your teeth at home is a bit like changing your own oil: it&#8217;s not for everyone, but nearly anyone can learn how to do it if they&#8217;re motivated. It&#8217;ll also save you some money.</p>
<p>For the best results, you want a set of plastic trays that will be comfortable to wear for a half-hour to an hour at a time. These trays should also conform exactly to your teeth, keeping the whitening solution on your enamel and off your gums.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System</a> gives you the precision and quality of a tray your dentist could sell you, but without the overhead of paying for an in-office assistant to mix the silicone putty. Along with excellent trays, you get an all-inclusive package with enough whitening gel to last for months.</p>
<p>If $80 is more than you can afford to spend on whiter teeth, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B1X3I1W/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lovely Smile &#8211; Bright White</a> whitening strips will get you two weeks of basic treatment for less than $20. You can expect to see a basic improvement in shade with this system, and whitening strips are recommended by even the most cautious dentists.</p>
<p>If you need speedy results, we like the higher-concentration, fast-acting hydrogen peroxide offered in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0141J993Y/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Zoom Day White</a> system. This solution comes with sensitivity-fighting and mineral-restoring compounds mixed in, so the extra sensitivity from faster-acting peroxide should be minimized. You&#8217;ll need to buy trays like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">these from Nova White</a> separately, though.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e asked a family to test and rank the performance of twelve highly-rated electric toothbrushes.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been going to regular dental checkups in the last decade or so, you&#8217;ve probably been told to buy an electric toothbrush. When our researcher asked his dentist which brand was recommended after a checkup a few years ago, he said very simply that they&#8217;re all pretty good.</p>
<p>/r/Dentistry provides some great discussion about the need for good technique even with a superior toothbrush. It&#8217;s clear that people tend to favor one of the two most popular brands — Oral-B and Philips — but that preference isn&#8217;t based on one obvious preference or another.</p>
<p>After reading reviews from sites like Wirecutter, Techgearlab, and Dentaldorks, it became apparent to us that the differences between brushes would be tricky to test. Consumer Reports, one of the most trusted institutions in unbiased product comparisons, has completely given up testing and recommending specific brushes.</p>
<p>The leading brands are easy to spot; they have TV commercials and YouTube celebrities promoting them. We were curious about up-and-coming contenders, though. There are dozens of other companies making brushes, but are any of them good? Our final list includes three best-selling underdog models that offer features that compete with the big brands.</p>
<p>After noting that heads on kid-specific models were mostly identical to the &#8220;sensitive&#8221; replacement heads made for the &#8220;big&#8221; adult handles, we decided to test brush systems that would work for a whole family rather than testing an entire “for-kids” category separately.</p>
<p>After eliminating obsolete models and closely scrutinizing reviews of the 23 most popular models, we narrowed that list to a set of 12 contenders that we hoped would provide a diverse range of test results.</p>
<p>We included an under-$10 AA-battery-powered brush mostly to calibrate our expectations for midrange brushes, and decided to spring for a pair of ultra-premium brushes just to see what that kind of money can get you.</p>
<p>We decided not to test subscription services this time around, mostly because the new kids on the block seem very similar to the big brands without actually competing on price. (Goby, for example, is more expensive than Oral-B, with fewer features.)</p>

<h2 id="sonic-vs-oscillating">Sonic vs. oscillating toothbrushes</h2>
<p>There are plenty of ways you <i>could</i> make a toothbrush work, from direct-drive gears to ionic plaque removal, but there are two popular types that are easy to find and proven to work:</p>
<p><b>Sonic toothbrushes</b> use a motor to move bristles very quickly with pulses of vibration, somewhere from 250 to 350 pulses per second. (The Sonicare Essence is a middle C at 261 Hz if you check it with a tuner.) A pulse is usually counted as both a back-and-forth stroke, so around 516 strokes per second (&#8220;31,000 brush strokes per minute&#8221;) is a common advertising claim. The vibrations definitely move the bristles, but less than a sixty-<br />
fourth of an inch to either side.</p>
<p><b>Oscillating toothbrushes</b> are almost exclusively made by Oral-B. Rather than vibrating like the sonic types, or spinning the brush head in one direction like a polishing tool, these heads spin in a back-and-forth motion that mimics very quick manual brushing. The brush head rotates back and forth about 125 times per second, with about a quarter-inch of brush movement each cycle.</p>

<p>So, which is better? <a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD004971/ORAL_different-types-of-powered-toothbrushes-for-plaque-control-and-healthy-gums" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cochrane Oral Health reported in 2010</a> that out of 17 trials with 1369 participants, they found no evidence that one type of brush was better than the other.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dentalcare.com/-/media/dentalcareus/research/pdf/triumph/biesbrockjclindenttriumphse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One 2007 study found</a> that the smaller Oral-B heads had an advantage over the larger heads used by Philips, while according to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25597787" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this review in the journal of periodontology</a> and <a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD002281/ORAL_poweredelectric-toothbrushes-compared-to-manual-toothbrushes-for-maintaining-oral-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another review by Cochrane</a>, some of the slight edge that Oral-B has in broad reviews of studies is probably because oscillating heads are tested more often.</p>
<p>Philips claims that their Sonicare system can dislodge and clear gunk (and even plaque) in places that a moving toothbrush bristle can&#8217;t. By all indications, it&#8217;s a system that works: The studies they&#8217;ve chosen to publish on their own site try to show that when you tally all the oscillating-vs-manual and sonicare-vs-manual results, Sonicare is slightly better at removing plaque and keeping gingivitis at bay.</p>
<p>The biggest differences, then, are going to be very personal. Some find the loud, rattling head on the Oral-B brushes to be annoying, while people with ticklish mouths may find the vibration of the sonic brushes unbearable.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Two-minute timer:</b> This is the most important feature of an electric toothbrush, arguably even more important than the motorized bristles. A two-minute timer will encourage most people to brush for the right amount of time, and if it&#8217;s built into the toothbrush you won’t forget it the way you might with an app or countertop timer.</p>
<p><b>Quad pacer:</b> This is an additional feature of better toothbrush timers: Rather than simply notifying you of when two minutes is up, a pacer tells you when you&#8217;ve spent 30 seconds on one quadrant of your mouth. When you&#8217;re using the coaching apps on your phone, Oral-B and Philips actually further divide this with separate timers for your front teeth and each side.</p>
<p><b>Pressure sensor:</b> This feature is designed to warn you when you&#8217;re pressing the toothbrush into your teeth and gums too much, a mistake that can cause gum problems like receding gumlines.</p>
<p><b>&#8220;Smart&#8221; coaching tools: </b>The most expensive brushes include features like a position sensor that tracks exactly how long you brush a particular part of your mouth. They&#8217;ll also track bad habits like excessive pressure.</p>
<p><b>Brush heads for braces: </b>Oral-B and Fairywill sell specialized tips for working around braces, bridges, crowns and other tricky spots. Note that most sonic-type brush makers claim you won&#8217;t special tips if you&#8217;re using a brush with sonic cleaning action, since it can dislodge some material even without direct contact. Which is the best electric toothbrush for braces? After testing a wide variety of types, we&#8217;re confident all of the sonic types work a little bit better than oscillating types, but beyond that there&#8217;s not much difference.</p>

<p><b>Heads for sensitive gums:</b> Softer bristles are better for nearly everyone. In order to get approval from the American Dental Association, brush heads have to use fairly soft bristles that will help avoid gum problems. We found that most of the heads shipped with electric toothbrushes are fairly soft, but the &#8220;sensitive&#8221; heads are also typically a little bit smaller, which we found makes them easier to get around back molars and other tricky spots.</p>
<p><b>Storage for brush heads: </b>In a few cases, the charging stand includes a place to keep spare brush heads. If you&#8217;re sharing a brush handle with a partner, or if your dentist advises that you use a specific accessory head in addition to a regular head, this definitely comes in handy.</p>
<h2 id="ada-seal">Is the ADA seal of acceptance an important feature?</h2>
<p>We looked at brushes listed as &#8220;approved&#8221; by the American Dental Association. They don&#8217;t list many brands, but that&#8217;s partly because it&#8217;s an entirely voluntary standard; a manufacturer has to submit their brush, then prove their marketing claims through expensive clinical trials. Electric toothbrushes only started showing up on the list in late 2017.</p>
<p>To get a direct comment on the real meaning of their list, we reached out to the ADA to learn more about the approval process and the difference between an approved and non-approved brush. They directed us to <a href="https://www.ada.org/en/science-research/ada-seal-of-acceptance/how-to-earn-the-ada-seal/general-criteria-for-acceptance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this page that lists the requirements</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;To qualify for the Seal of Acceptance, the manufacturer of a manual toothbrush must provide evidence that:</p>
<ul>
<li>All toothbrush components are safe for use in the mouth.</li>
<li>Bristles are free of sharp or jagged edges and endpoints.</li>
<li>Handle material demonstrates durability under normal use.</li>
<li>Bristles won’t fall out due to normal use.</li>
<li>The toothbrush can be used without supervision by the average adult to provide a significant decrease in mild gum disease and plaque.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike standards that have easily measured numbers attached to them, like efficiency rating for <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-window-air-conditioner/">air conditioners</a> or clean air delivery rate for <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-air-purifier/">air purifiers</a>, this is a fairly simple pass or fail.</p>
<p>When we asked the ADA if any toothbrush has ever been submitted that&#8217;s bad enough to fail, ADA content specialist Mike Bittern said, &#8220;The list of manufacturers that apply for their products to receive the Seal of Acceptance is confidential information the ADA does not share.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even that requirement to use clinical trials to show a decrease in gum disease is fairly loosely enforced: Oral-B, for example, submitted all of their brushes in one batch with a confusing array of studies to support them, while Philips only submitted one model (and not even their most expensive model).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s safe to assume that the &#8220;average adult&#8221; can get a significant benefit from using just about any toothbrush, seal or not.</p>
<p>If the ADA were making recommendations for a specific kind of electric brush mechanism, or approving a specific brush attachment, we might be inclined to weigh the ADA seal as a more important benefit. As it is, we didn&#8217;t let the lack of a seal stop us from testing or recommending non-ADA alternative brands.</p>

<p>One important question we set out to answer was &#8220;what&#8217;s the difference between a $20 toothbrush and a $200 toothbrush?&#8221;</p>
<p>We were expecting to see more in the way of specific claims and obvious quality differences, but that&#8217;s not what we found at all. The distinctions that set top-of-the-line brushes apart from lowly entry-level models are special touches, but most of them don&#8217;t translate to any difference in your oral hygiene.</p>
<p><b>Bluetooth connectivity</b> is one feature that stood out as carrying the biggest premium and also the least pay-off. Maybe the most significant difference you get with Bluetooth is toothbrush updates: There was every month for the Philips &#8211; DiamondClean; we can&#8217;t decide if that&#8217;s good or just annoying. Practically speaking, Bluetooth serves as a way for manufacturers to make sure you only get the high-end features of their system when you spend more money on a Bluetooth-enabled brush.</p>
<p><b>Position sensors</b> tell you what parts of your mouth you spend the most or least amount of time on. Sensors record in 12 specific zones only (right/front/left in top/bottom inside/outside) but that&#8217;s probably as many zones as we want to track anyhow. The position sensor also tells the app if you&#8217;re scrubbing back and forth too much instead of letting the motor do the brushing.</p>
<p><b>Brush head tracking </b>on the Philips brushes uses a tiny RFID chip on each brush head to help the toothbrush know when you&#8217;ve replaced worn-out bristles, and even to switch modes automatically if you buy a specific head for something like whitening or gum care. It&#8217;s nifty to automatically see all your brush heads in the app, but mode switching is pretty easy with the button and the colored indicator bristles already help you see when the brush is ready to retire.</p>
<p><b>Fancy storage cases and chargers </b>are probably the most obvious perk of buying a high-end brush. Oral-B gives you a place to put four brush heads on the 3000 and the 8000, and the 8000 also comes with a travel case with a USB charge port and smartphone stand built-in for using your app on the road. Philips gives you a decent travel case with the 5100 and all DiamondClean models, and the trademark drinking glass charging stand is standard for the DiamondClean line, but the travel charger and brush holders are reserved for the super-premium DiamondClean 9750 kit.</p>
<p><b>Countertop timers and coaching devices</b> used to be included in Oral-B&#8217;s high-end brush models, but they&#8217;ve been replaced entirely by smartphone apps. If you want a quad-timer display to visualize your brushing progress and pressure feedback without connecting a smartphone or tablet, you can still buy the old Oral-B SmartSeries 7000 for a small discount compared to the new app-only model.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>To find out how well they perform in real-world conditions, a family of three tested these twelve brushes for four months. They compared plaque removal, battery life, clever (and silly) design features, noise and vibration concerns, storage and charger options, and cost of ownership. They also compared Bluetooth-connected apps for the high-end brushes from Philips and Oral-B.</p>
<h3>Evaluating modes and features</h3>
[table id=178 /]
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, for most of us adding more modes to a toothbrush increases the confusion more than the value. The sad truth is that while extra control is nice, none of these features are really worth spending a lot of money on.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s our take on the common features that the big brush makers use to distinguish between their different price levels:</p>
<p><b>Pressure sensor:</b> This is the main feature you pay for in a $40 brush compared to a $25 brush. The pressure sensor will change the brush speed and flash a light to let you know when you&#8217;re pressing too hard.</p>
<p>In theory, this is a built-in coaching tool that helps stop you from wasting time or damaging your gums. In practice, we found it pretty easy to figure out how much pressure to use, and the pressure sensors that were calibrated to a lighter touch would always go off when brushing around the back molars.</p>
<p>We were a bit surprised to find out that if you bear down a little bit too much with the Greater Goods &#8211; Balance it will basically stop brushing. The manufacturer says that this isn&#8217;t intentional, but it works about as well as the pressure sensor on the less expensive Oral-B or Philips models.</p>
<p><b>Adjustable power levels and specialized modes:</b> More expensive brush handles in the $70 price range can change the speed or strength of their brushing action to deliver more aggressive (or more gentle) scrubbing.</p>
<p>Among brushes from Philips and Oral-B, you get more control when you pay for a more expensive brush. The $200 Philips &#8211; DiamondClean Smart has specific customization for the strength of vibration within every mode, and we&#8217;ll admit that level of control was appreciated while our mouths were getting used to the sonic tickle.</p>
<p>The biggest distinction among multimode brushes is how you switch settings: A dedicated mode button is simple and sensible, while brushes without the button (like the Oral-B &#8211; Pro 3000) force you to cycle through every mode even when you&#8217;re just turning the brush on or off.</p>
<p>Among lesser-known manufacturers, four or five modes is standard fare, even for a budget-priced brush. Since the major difference we found is comfort, we tried not to give excessive weight to the presence of these modes. The fact that Greater Goods included a mode switch, though, made it stand out.</p>
<p><b>Bluetooth and position sensors: </b>This is the feature that you really have to shell out for. On the most expensive brushes, a Bluetooth connection to the app allows the companion app to track where in your mouth you scrub too quickly or with too much pressure.</p>
<p>We were fascinated by the sophistication of this kind of record and a bit baffled about who would really benefit from all that information.</p>
<p>If a detailed record of how much time you spend brushing your inside-upper-left molars compared to your lower incisors is exactly what&#8217;s been missing from your life, Philips and Oral-B can both deliver. We liked the Philips app a bit more than Oral-B&#8217;s system, but they&#8217;re both capable.</p>
<h3>Cleaning Performance</h3>
[table id=177 /]
<p>We looked for ways to rank daily brushing effectiveness, but after our lead tester tried a few different methods to measure results, we started to realize that these kinds of raw performance tests aren&#8217;t really representative of what&#8217;s important about a toothbrush.</p>
<p>The most effective method for evaluating brush performance is to use dental disclosing tablets; this is basically bright colored dye that stains plaque and tartar on your teeth so you can see it. You&#8217;ve probably been through this routine with your dentist: Brush as normal, chew the tablet, and see what you missed.</p>
<p>The problem with using disclosing tablets to rank brushes is that the tablets demonstrate flaws in the brusher more than the brush. We found that the biggest difference between our test samples wasn&#8217;t that some brushes are better, but that our tester&#8217;s results got better over time with <i>every</i> brush as he started paying close attention to what he was missing.</p>
<p>We even went so far as to use acrylic model teeth and a piece of textured nylon to test the brushes in more controlled conditions. But the real lesson was a simple one: The best way to get cleaner teeth is to find out what&#8217;s missing with your current technique.</p>
<p>We need to be crystal clear on this point: You&#8217;re still going to need to practice with an electric toothbrush to get really great results. No brand or type of brush is a magic bullet, and if you&#8217;re expecting a brush to restore a receding gumline or whiten your teeth all by itself, you&#8217;re going to be disappointed.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, dentists have been repeating the same line to us for years: buy any electric toothbrush (seriously, it doesn&#8217;t matter which one) and use it for two minutes twice per day. If you want to maximize plaque removal, gum health or any other specific benefit, the most productive thing you can do is show your dentist how you&#8217;re brushing and get feedback on how to improve.</p>
<h3>Testing softness</h3>
<p>One of the two qualifications for a toothbrush to earn approval from the American Dental Association is that it needs to have soft bristles. The days of wire-stiff toothbrush bristles are over: Brushmakers are using the same nylon filament as before, but with thinner shafts for more flexibility.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a small trade-off here: More flex means less scrubbing and a shorter life before the bristles are worn out, but the reduced risk of receding gums is definitely an outcome we&#8217;re happy with.</p>
<p>We tested softness on ripe tomato skins and hard-boiled eggs. None of the toothbrushes damaged the tomato, but the sonic-type toothbrushes quickly started breaking apart the hard-boiled egg. Oral-B&#8217;s oscillating scrubbing motion should be more gentle on extra-sensitive gum tissue than the competing sonic-type brushes, but only barely. This also means they&#8217;re slightly less efficient at breaking up food between your teeth, but again, only barely.</p>
<p>The bigger concern for sensitive mouths will be ticklishness. If the idea of your teeth resonating in musical tones makes your jaw quiver, Oral-B is definitely the safer bet.</p>
<h3>Battery test</h3>
<p>After running each brush for a week of testing and battery charging, we topped them all off at a full charge and then ran them until they would no longer brush.</p>
<p>One note on these tests: Oral-B&#8217;s brushes use old-fashioned nickel-metal-hydride batteries, while every other brand uses lithium ion. This accounts for a big difference in expected battery capacity, and the results aren&#8217;t surprising once you learn that.</p>
<p>The Fairywill and Brio brushes both showed amazing improvements in capacity over the other designs. That said, even the worst performer (the Oral-B &#8211; Pro 3000 at 44 minutes) will give you three weeks of brushing, and the no-fuss wireless charging stands all work very well to keep your brush at the ready.</p>
<h3>Cost of ownership</h3>
[table id=176 /]
<p>Without a clear performance metric to hang a ranking on, and with so many options to choose from, the cost of buying a toothbrush and replacing the heads became a more and more important factor to consider. We calculated the total cost of ownership for each brush over three years to account for the inevitable death of rechargeable batteries.</p>
<p>When you add a second person buying replacement heads, that cost becomes even more important.</p>
<p>The Philips Sonicare heads are very nicely made, but all of the cheaper competitors we tested claim to be using the same Dupont Tynex nylon (which has been the gold standard for toothbrush bristles since it was invented in the 1930s.)</p>
<p>When Oral-B sells their replacements for one quarter the price of a Philips brush package, you start to question the sanity of adding microchips to disposable toothbrush heads. Sonicare is a premium brand for Philips, and they seem intent on milking that for all it&#8217;s worth.</p>
<p>We factored the brush head replacement cycle on these brushes at four times per year, but bumped the Greater Goods system up to six times per year, since the bristles they ship with are softer than average and will wear more quickly. If you switch to medium bristles, they should last about as long as any of the other bristles; they&#8217;re a better-than-average value either way.</p>
<h2 id="best-for-kids">Finding the best electric toothbrush for kids</h2>
<p>We intended to test and recommend a specific model for kids three years and up, but it ended up being more tricky than that.</p>
<p>Our tiny tester definitely felt that the sonic brushes were &#8220;more tickly&#8221; than the oscillating heads from Oral-B, but the noise of those brushes was just as intimidating. Our parent/toddler team wound up using most of the brushes manually, without turning them on.</p>

<p>The Philips &#8211; Sonicare for kids brush heads are easier to maneuver in a small child&#8217;s mouth than the equivalent Oral-B &#8211; Sensitive brush head. The Philips head is smaller and narrower than other brushes, and that&#8217;s a good thing; Oral-B sticks with their standard size, and it&#8217;s still a bit tricky to get behind molars in tiny mouths.</p>
<p>Oral-B does make a few other sizes and shapes for their &#8220;Stages&#8221; series, but finding and buying them is a mess. (And many are actually bigger than the standard sensitive head.) The electric brush head replacements get mixed in with the manual brushes in store listings, and finding the brush head with the color and character design that matches your kid&#8217;s handle is infuriating. Local retailers we checked had a good selection of character choices when purchasing the Oral-B brush handles, but no replacement heads.</p>
<h3>Brushing apps for kids</h3>
<p>All of the kids toothbrush apps we tested were really just timer apps. They add value in two ways. First, apps make the brushing experience more exciting. Second, they track your routine and reward you for keeping good habits.</p>
<p>Oral-B has the &#8220;<a href="https://oralb.com/en-us/products/compare/disney-magic-timer-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disney Magic Timer</a>&#8221; app. When brushing, you &#8220;scrub away&#8221; bubbles from a static image of the characters on your branded toothbrush, which was fairly entertaining for our tester.</p>
<p>Philips, on the other hand, built their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCMSV0tHW8I" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sonicare for Kids</a> app around a virtual pet: &#8220;Sparkly&#8221; needs its teeth brushed to stay happy, and you get treats and accessories to feed and customize your &#8220;pet&#8221; after you brush. This is the feature that our test toddler really went for: surprise rewards for brushing.</p>
<p>Sadly, your Sparkly doesn&#8217;t get the good stuff (clothes and accessories) without the overpriced <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YAR7ZL6/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bluetooth-connected kid-specific brush handle</a>. Otherwise, the Sonicare for kids app works quite well with any old toothbrush.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re just looking for a toothbrush with smaller, softer bristles and control over the vibration speed, the Greater Goods &#8211; Balance is our pick.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re ready to spend $40 on a Sonicare for Kids brush handle, it does unlock special accessories for your kid&#8217;s &#8220;Sparkly&#8221; pet in the app, but there&#8217;s nothing else about that brush to justify the price tag.</p>
<h2 id="best-value">Top pick: Greater Goods &#8211; Balance</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mode-switching2-sm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WWCX7GN/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greater Goods &#8211; Balance</a> would be a competitive entry at $50 or $90, but the fact that it&#8217;s a great sonic-type brush selling for less than $30 makes it an easy pick for best value.</p>
<p>After three months of testing, we started to realize that we were never going to find an overall winner that would be perfect for everyone. Some people won&#8217;t like the vibration of sonic brushes, though others will definitely appreciate how much quieter they are. Some people will be better off with smaller brush heads, while others will benefit from more efficient brushing with a bigger head. Some people will want to use a variety of modes for things like gum massage and deep cleaning, while others will just be annoyed by the complexity.</p>
<p>Greater Goods has found a good middle ground in just about every category we considered, and the bonus perks aren&#8217;t cumbersome or gimmicky.</p>
<p>The standout feature for Greater Goods at a sub-$30 price point is the quad pacer. The brush makes a cheerful little buzzing pulse as a reminder to move to the next part of your mouth every thirty seconds. No app required! <b>The Balance is the only budget-priced brush with a quad pacer, and this feature is one of the most effective ways to improve your brushing routine. </b></p>
<p>The charger is a compact wireless-charging stand, just like most brushes we tested. Unique at this price point is a battery status light that turns red when you&#8217;ve got about six brushing sessions left. It also indicates when it&#8217;s charging and when it&#8217;s full; the competitively-priced Oral-B &#8211; Vitality doesn&#8217;t have <i>any</i> battery lights.</p>
<p>The battery is big enough for almost a month of brushing between charges, but the toothbrush is still cheap enough that you won&#8217;t be as frustrated when you need to replace it in two or three years when the battery stops working. (And it will; They all will.)</p>
<p>The Greater Goods brushes are on the smaller side, which is better in our experience than having a head that&#8217;s too big. The bristles are soft, maybe even softer than the bristles Philips is using. Greater Goods also sells <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XDFSWZP/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">medium</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077GF68XC/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">firm bristles</a> if that&#8217;s your preference. Our dentists have always encouraged us to go for softer bristles when we have a choice, but the optional firm-bristle replacements will last longer.</p>
<p>Confirm with your dentist about what&#8217;s best for you, but softer bristles make this the best electric toothbrush for receding gums.</p>

At this price, it's a bargain.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WWCX7GN/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>There&#8217;s a textured-silicone tongue scraper on the back of the brush head; it&#8217;s not an especially aggressive scraper, but not bad for a back-of-the-toothbrush design.</p>
<p>The four different modes Greater Goods offers are distinct enough to be meaningful, but as with the other brushes we&#8217;re skeptical that the faster vibrations are really any better at whitening. If the vibration is too much at first, it&#8217;s nice to have the option to use the &#8220;sensitive&#8221; mode. The feature that really stands out is mode switching with a dedicated button; usually that only shows up on much more expensive brushes.</p>
<p>The plaque-cleaning performance of this brush in our daily brushing and simulation tests is exactly what we&#8217;d expect from a sonic toothbrush: slightly better than the Oral-B oscillating system at clearing away sticky material.</p>
<h3>So, why not some other cheap brush?</h3>
<p>Greater Goods has a few unique features: a mode button makes turning the brush on and off much less annoying, and the brush heads are a little bit nicer and have a tongue-cleaner built in. This makes it the best cheap electric toothbrush we found.</p>
<p>Greater Goods isn&#8217;t the only company selling this particular brush design. Just looking at Amazon, you&#8217;ll see that brushes from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072P165L8/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mornwell</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072YVWBXH/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aquasonic</a> appear to be coming off the same production line with a different colorway and packaged with different accessories.</p>
<p>We spoke with Patrick Kohm, operations manager at Greater Goods, and he didn&#8217;t divulge anything about their manufacturing partners on the record, but a timeline is pretty revealing. Greater Goods launched their new Balance toothbrush design in early 2017. Shortly thereafter, Risun Tech founded the Mornwell brand to sell oral care products direct from their manufacturing plant.</p>
<p>We like the design either way, but Greater Goods has a real telephone support team that&#8217;s located stateside.</p>
<p>This brush won&#8217;t automatically make you better at cleaning hard-to-reach spots than any other brush, but we like that it doesn&#8217;t trip you up with a clunky interface or confusing options. This is a great brush at a great price, and in our interactions with Greater Goods customer service, they seem like a company on track to do even more great things in the future.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sonic-type Greater Goods &#8211; Balance has the timer and pace reminder features you need to reinforce good brushing habits.</li>
<li>Adjustable power levels and soft bristles are a win for gum health and sensitive teeth.</li>
<li>A dedicated mode button makes the optional modes less annoying to use than other affordable models.</li>
<li>All this top-tier functionality is squeezed into a sleek and minimalist design.</li>
<li>Greater Goods is a US company providing real support, but they&#8217;re competing for the lowest price point.</li>

<p>If you don&#8217;t want a sonic-type toothbrush, or if you need a specialized brush head for a unique problem you&#8217;re facing, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003UKM9CO/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oral-B &#8211; Pro 1000</a> is a great choice. Oral-B offers the largest selection of brush head types, and the Pro 1000 is the best value in their lineup.</p>
<p>Compared to the smooth, quiet bumblebee hum of other electric toothbrushes, the Oral-B design sounds like a cross between a power drill and a clattering dishtray. The oscillating brush snaps back-and-forth in much larger semi-circular movements than the sonic-power brushes do, and that&#8217;s the trade-off. Since the bristles move more slowly over a larger distance, they&#8217;re still effective at removing plaque without buzzing your entire jaw from the inside-out.</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/oral-b-closeup.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Oral-B&#8217;s other big win is the sheer variety of tools they offer: Iif you need an interdental tip to clean a tricky gap, plus a polishing cup to make the most of your whitening toothpaste, plus a soft brush that you can give your kids, Oral-B has you covered.</p>
<p>Oral-B&#8217;s replacement brushes are also available at a much lower cost than most of the competition <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L5M26DQ/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">when you buy in a 10-pack</a>. By comparison, Greater Goods is competitive even in a three-pack, which is one reason they won our best value pick, but we didn&#8217;t find the Philips Sonicare replacement heads any cheaper than $8.33 each (and you need to buy them at Costco to get that price.)</p>

<p>While you&#8217;ll probably regret skipping the features and buying a cheaper Oral-B model, we also consider the Pro 1000 the most expensive toothbrush most people should buy. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DT0K6J2/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pro 3000</a> just adds two extra brush modes, and you&#8217;ll need to cycle through all the modes every time you use the brush (whether you use them or not).

<h3>Compared to other Oral-B brushes</h3>

The battery life on the Pro 1000 is a bit disappointing: Like all the Oral-B brushes, it uses a nickel-metal-hydride battery. Run time is 44 minutes, though. That&#8217;s plenty if you always put the brush back on the charging stand between uses, but when the competition gives you more than double the battery life at half the purchase price, you start to wonder what you&#8217;re paying for.</p>
<p>Oral-B has stuck to their gun with the oscillating toothbrush heads that made them famous. If the idea of a buzzing sonic-type toothbrush in your mouth is a turn-off, we think this is easily the best buy in the oscillating brush category. The heads are about half the price of <a href="https://www.goby.co/products/electric-toothbrush/midnight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the competing Goby subscription system</a>, and you can buy them nearly anywhere.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Oral-B &#8211; Pro 1000 doesn&#8217;t tickle your mouth like a sonic-type brush.</li>
<li>Oral-B makes brush heads with every feature you can imagine, from interdental tips to polishing cups.</li>
<li>This model has all the essential features at a reasonable price.</li>
<li>Oral-B&#8217;s oscillating design works, but doesn&#8217;t seem to clean quite as well as the sonic-type brushes.</li>
<li>The 44 minutes of battery life is adequate, but not competitive.</li>
</ul>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XT1KDSD/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; DiamondClean Smart Series</a> is the flagship of the Sonicare fleet, and the model 9300 (also called HX9903 depending where you look) gets you the premium features that set this sonic toothbrush system apart.</p>
<p>Bluetooth is the backbone feature for every premium toothbrush currently on the market. Philips tracks every sensor on this brush and records when and how you&#8217;re using it with the smart-device app.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to use an app every time you brush, there&#8217;s really not much reason to buy a brush that costs more than $40. If you do want to use an app, we think the Sonicare app is the best, and this very nice toothbrush will make the most of it.</p>
<p>Another unique feature of the Sonicare system is the replacement heads: The 3-series heads all have unique ID tags that let the brush and the app know which mode they&#8217;re designed for. They also track how long you&#8217;ve been using a specific head, so you can get automatic reminders to replace them even if you&#8217;re using multiple head types or sharing the brush handle with your family.</p>
<p>Automatic mode switching is a great feature, because there are a lot of modes available: Clean, White+, Deep Clean+ and Gum Health all correspond to a specific Philips brush head, but you can manually set any mode you like. You can also choose from three power levels within each mode.</p>
<p>Adjustable power levels are the most compelling feature of this brush, because it offsets the biggest liability of the Philips Sonicare technology: the tickling sensation you get when the brush is vibrating against your teeth, gums or cheek 260 times per second.</p>
<p>We interviewed friends who are long-time users of the Sonicare system, and they all claimed they didn&#8217;t notice the vibration anymore. If you&#8217;re worried about how your teeth will respond in the beginning, adjustable power levels will help you ease into it.</p>
<h3>It is really better for brushing?</h3>
<p>We mostly tested this brush with the standard clean mode, and it tied for first place in our peanut-butter-cleaning test. We&#8217;re not going to say that it will remove more plaque from your teeth than another brush would; that depends on your technique. But this is the most power and versatility you can get.</p>
<p>The battery life for the Philips &#8211; DiamondClean was actually 30 percent lower than the other Philips models. This could be because the brush never turns off its Bluetooth transmitter. Still, it&#8217;ll brush your teeth 57 times without recharging — that&#8217;s almost double the battery life of the Oral-B &#8211; Genius 8000.</p>
<p>Philips&#8217; Sonicare system is quieter in every case than the Oral-B system, but the premium DiamondClean is just a little bit quieter on the standard clean mode than the other Philips brushes. It&#8217;s not a dramatic difference, but the brushes seem to have fewer and fewer parts buzzing around inside as you climb the price ladder.</p>

<h3>Premium design and accessories</h3>
<p>The premium feel of this brush is for all intents and purposes a design feature. The body is a little bit slimmer and sleeker than the lower-priced brushes, and the available color schemes cater to people who appreciate fine designer goods.</p>

The price tag and cost of replacement heads definitely took this brush out of the running for overall winner, though.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XT1KDSD/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XT1KDSD/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DiamondClean model 9300</a> we tested comes with a pebble-grain-wrapped travel case that holds the handle and two brush heads. If you pay another $60 for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSH2RNQ/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">model 9500</a>, you also get USB-port charging in your travel case so you don&#8217;t have to take your stand on the road. These cases aren&#8217;t explicitly designed to prop up a smartphone the way Oral-B&#8217;s case is, but the slot for the handle works fairly well.</p>
<p>The wireless charging stand (a standard feature in all electric brushes nowadays) also comes with a nice, heavy water glass that fits securely on top. This has basically become a signature feature of the DiamondClean brushes, and it&#8217;s definitely a unique touch. There&#8217;s also a clear plastic adapter for the charging stand if you don&#8217;t want to use the glass.</p>
<p>If you jump to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C799HF6/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">even more expensive model 9750</a>, you also get an exclusive glass countertop stand for four brush heads. The price is within spitting distance of $300, so it only really makes sense if you&#8217;re really, really proud of those $12 brush heads.</p>
<h3>Should you really buy this?</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;re mostly looking for a sleek brush with top-tier cleaning performance, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WWCX7GN/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greater Goods brush</a> gets you the same sonic cleaning performance the DiamondClean does. We like the Greater Goods brush heads, but here&#8217;s a twist: The various Philips Sonicare brush heads mount securely and work just as well on the Greater Goods handle. The arbor they mount on isn&#8217;t identical, but it&#8217;s got all the same key dimensions for the retaining clip to work.</p>
<p>If you love glass and copper-tone accents, Philips is the way to go. (We&#8217;re just a bit saddened that there aren&#8217;t brush heads to match the lunar blue handle. Blue and black? Seriously?) As with <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-electric-shaver/#the-other-finalists">Philips&#8217; high-end shaver</a>, it&#8217;s beautiful product that doesn&#8217;t make sense for most people to buy.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Philips &#8211; DiamondClean model 9300 is the Bluetooth-connected sonic brush that looks, feels and performs like a luxury product.</li>
<li>Philips&#8217; smart app works with a position sensor, brush sensor and head sensor to do something special with that connected advantage.</li>
<li>This brand tied for best cleaning performance in the lab, but that might not matter at all. (And it tickles.)</li>
<li>You could even drink your expensive scotch out of the swanky charging stand glass. That&#8217;s worth the price, right?</li>

<h3>Oral-B &#8211; Genius 8000</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KTII3DS/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oral-B &#8211; Genius 8000</a> is a good toothbrush. All the features you could ask for are here, and more. The travel case even has a built-in USB charge port for your phone!</p>
<p>The great ideas often weren&#8217;t followed through, though. For example, the charger doesn&#8217;t put out enough amperage to charge a modern phone or tablet: iPads and phones sometimes started charging, and sometimes didn&#8217;t. &#8220;Near-miss&#8221; pretty effectively sums up many features on this high-end brush.</p>
<p>We were sorely tempted to give the Genius 8000 top spot in the premium category. The features are competitive: easy and programmable mode switching, a great selection of brush heads, and position and pressure tracking to make sure you&#8217;re not over- or under-brushing certain areas.</p>
<p>The Oral-B&#8217;s price is a bit better than the Philips system, too, both for the brush handle and for the replacement heads. The Oral-B is loud and clunky, though, compared to the soft hum of the Philips Sonicare technology. The app is good enough, but not quite as easy to navigate or set up as the Philips app.</p>
<p>The built-in charger in the case is a cool feature that almost makes this the best electric toothbrush for travel, but you&#8217;ll also be more likely to need that charger. Oral-B&#8217;s 64 minutes of battery life are pathetic compared to the 114 minutes we got from the Philips &#8211; DiamondClean. Thankfully, this brush has a three-segment display so you can actually see the battery level.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re really compelled by the value of the specialty brush heads Oral-B offers, the Pro &#8211; 1000 gets you into that system at a much more reasonable price point and has all the essential features.</p>
<h3>Philips &#8211; Sonicare Essence</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QZ67ODE/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Sonicare Essence</a> is the cheapest way into the Sonicare lineup, and that makes it a brush worth checking out, but at the end of the day there&#8217;s not much that makes this a good value.</p>
<p>The Essence gets the same good cleaning results that the other Sonicare brushes do. The DiamondClean was a little bit better in a lab test, but we think you&#8217;d be hard pressed to tell the difference between the Essence and the other brushes if they&#8217;re all on the basic cleaning mode.</p>
<p>What separates this brush from the rest of the lineup is the heads it uses. This is an old system that uses a massive threaded collar to hold the tip and its magnetically coupled drive shaft in place. It&#8217;s much more bulky and complex than the main Philips system, and still expensive at $35 for a year&#8217;s replacements, but that&#8217;s compared to $60 for the premium heads.</p>
<p>For that savings, you sacrifice every feature. There&#8217;s no quadrant-pacing timer, much less a pressure sensor or variable power levels.</p>
<p>Philips has already released a replacement for this model, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019K7DPG4/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Essence+</a>. The Plus model takes the same brush head as the rest of the Sonicare brushes rather than the bulky old screw-on heads, but just like the Essence it&#8217;s missing all the other features.</p>
<p>Sadly, the Essence+ is often selling for almost the same price as the much better 4100 model. If you&#8217;re really in love with the Philips brand but you want a bare-bones brush, this older Essence model is typically a much better value.</p>
<h3>Philips &#8211; Sonicare 4100 and 5100</h3>
<p>The Philips &#8211; Sonicare series is comprised of dozens of models and combo packs. We tested both the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078GVDB19/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Four Series model 4100</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078GVH2VH/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Five Series model 5100</a> because they represent the two clear feature changes: The 4100 adds a quad pacer and pressure sensor to the more basic models, and the 5100 adds a &#8220;gum care&#8221; mode and manual mode switching.</p>
<p>In both cases, we were underwhelmed by these features, especially when compared to the Greater Good &#8211; Balance. If the pressure sensor and mode switch were only adding a $20 premium to the price then these brushes might be worth seeking out; after our tests, though, we&#8217;re not convinced the pressure sensor really helps, and even after paying three times the price of the entry-level brush you&#8217;re going to keep on shelling out more for the $8-$12 brush heads every two or three months.</p>
<p>The &#8220;smart&#8221; features (like the ID-chipped brush heads) make some sense when you&#8217;ve got a Bluetooth-connected app tracking every datum of your brushing life, but those perks are missing on these brush handles.</p>
<p>The batteries are better than average, at 154 minutes for the 5100 and 180 minutes for the 4100, but that in no way justifies the sticker price.</p>
<h3>Oral-B Pro 3000</h3>
<p>The Oral-B Pro 3000 is in an awkward place in Oral-B&#8217;s lineup.</p>
<p>Like the midrange Philips, the features here are hard to justify: A gum care and sensitive mode are both great ideas, but it&#8217;s hard to say exactly who will need them, and for how long.</p>
<p>The Bluetooth on this brush is not a well-developed feature, either. It lets you start and pause the smartphone app&#8217;s timer in perfect sync with the built-in timer on the brush, but without a position sensor you don&#8217;t really get anything else from the app that you wouldn&#8217;t also get with a manual brush.</p>
<p>The main reason to buy this brush is if you love the Oral-B oscillating brush heads and want to program a gum massage into your weekly brushing routine. Bluetooth will let the app control that on the schedule that you or a dentist creates; it really is only automating a simple button press, though.</p>
<p>The other feature that comes with this brush, but not the 1000, is a countertop case that holds spare brush heads for your family or special-purpose brush heads. You can buy <a href="https://www.fix.com/parts/toothbrush/braun/fix10275996/brush-head-storage-67040225/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the same official stand</a> for about $15, or a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071DJ8WWL/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">very similar imitation</a> for about $10.</p>
<p>Forty-two minutes of battery is sufficient, but shameful in a $75 toothbrush. On the whole, the lower cleaning power compared to sonic toothbrushes and the louder motor of the oscillating design makes this a really tough model to recommend.</p>
<p>If the lack of a dedicated mode switch is the only thing you think is missing, you can get that (and some extra modes) for about $15 more in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O8ODHOA/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oral-B &#8211; Pro 5000</a>. After spending a few months with a range of Oral-B models, we&#8217;re pretty sure most people will be fully satisfied with the features of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003UKM9CO/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pro 1000</a> at half the price.</p>
<h3>Brio &#8211; SmartClean</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OJHCCP6/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Brio &#8211; SmartClean</a> seems like a brush that was built to order around a feature set, rather than being carefully designed and improved after testing.</p>
<p>The SmartClean checks most of the essential feature boxes, except a pressure sensor and a mode switch. It has three modes: normal, soft and massage. These are sensible to include, but without a mode button you&#8217;re cycling through all of them every time you start and stop the brush. The white plastic body is hard and shiny where every other brush has a grippy texture.</p>
<p>If this brush were $30 rather than the consistent $68 it sold for when we tested, it would be a competitor for the top pick. At this price, it&#8217;s up against the Sonicare 5100. Brio gives you double the battery life and cheaper brush replacements, plus a brush holder on the charger rather than the travel case that comes with the 5100. It&#8217;s also a little bit quieter than the midrange Philips models. It doesn&#8217;t seem to clean as well, though, and there&#8217;s no pressure sensor.</p>

<h3>Fairywill &#8211; FW-507</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06VWD8NY3/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fairywill &#8211; FW-507</a> feels and looks lower-grade than the other brushes we tried. It&#8217;s a popular model on Amazon that seems to share a production line with a number of other brands.</p>
<p>The USB-compatible charge cable is an interesting feature that may come in handy once in a while, but wireless toothbrush stands make far more sense unless you&#8217;re constantly travelling.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a bad toothbrush, really, but the lack of a mode switch makes the five modes more annoying than they&#8217;re worth. Fairywill squeezed the longest run time out of this big rechargeable battery, but a convenient charging stand is a far more important feature for most people.</p>
<p>The Fairywill replacements were the only brush heads we didn&#8217;t like. They&#8217;re not bad, per se; the bristles appear to be the same soft Nylon used by the rest of the industry, and the shape and size are about right. The way they attach to the handle is a big, hollow mounting shaft with a twist-lock retention mechanism. Again, not awful, just not as simple or easy to clean as other systems.</p>
<h3>Oral-B &#8211; Vitality</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078Y357PS/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oral-B&#8217;s Vitality model</a> is an entry-level electric toothbrush that should be attractive for offering access to Oral-B&#8217;s great brush heads for a low up-front cost. But, when compared to other budget brushes, it&#8217;s a bit disappointing.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s missing? Nearly everything. There&#8217;s not even a charge light to let you know if your charger is plugged in. The lack of a pacing timer is not uncommon for the entry-level model in a big brush maker&#8217;s line, but when <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WWCX7GN/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greater Goods</a> is offering that feature at the $25 price point, this brush is hard to recommend.</p>
<p>The Vitality has a larger-than-usual battery for Oral-B&#8217;s line. It actually runs for 17 days worth of brushing, about a day longer than Oral-B&#8217;s flagship brush. This is still 12 days short of the average we found among other brands. It&#8217;s also a quieter brush than some other Oral-B models, but on the whole we think the Pro 1000 is a worthwhile upgrade if you want the Oral-B heads.</p>
<h3>Oral-B &#8211; 3D White</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008I2IKI6/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oral-B &#8211; 3D White</a> is a strange duck. Oral-B clearly recognizes that their brand is strong enough to sell cheap AA-battery-powered toothbrushes.</p>
<p>The 3D White&#8217;s cleaning performance in our peanut butter test was pretty good, partly because the head is so much bigger than the other Oral-B heads. That said, it&#8217;s actually a bit less efficient at brushing in most actual mouths, since it can be tricky to maneuver that big head.</p>
<p>Battery life is kind of amazing: 305 minutes of constant run time on the included AA alkaline.</p>
<p>That said, this brush fails to meet the basic qualifications that advance most electric toothbrushes ahead of stone-age manual-power brushes. There&#8217;s no timer at all, let alone a quad pacer. If we were picking a tool to clean grout lines, this would be a contender for best value of the bunch. As a toothbrush, it&#8217;s just a gimmicky waste of time.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The best brush is one you&#8217;ll actually enjoy using for two minutes, twice every day. Anything more or less than that is probably not going to make a big difference for your teeth and gums, but it&#8217;s a very good idea to schedule a checkup with your dentist so you can talk about technique.</p>
<p>Our favorite brush, then, has all the essential features to make that happen. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WWCX7GN/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greater Goods &#8211; Balance</a> has a two-minute timer with 30-second pacing reminders that help you get every tooth, while the soft bristles and adjustable power modes mean it&#8217;ll let you ease into a new routine. (You can change to harder bristles, too, if you want stronger scrubbing and longer bristle life.) It does all this for less than half the cost of the competition.</p>
<p>The Balance doesn&#8217;t have Bluetooth. But if you really want to record your brushing habits, the data-collecting features of apps we tested work manually with any toothbrush.</p>
<p>If you really prefer moving bristles to buzzing sonic toothbrushes, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003UKM9CO/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oral-B &#8211; Pro 1000</a> still has a quad pacer and pressure sensor, plus it gives you access to affordable specialty brushes. It&#8217;s double the cost of our top pick and it&#8217;s pretty loud, but for sensitive mouths this is a less intimidating option.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re really sold on the idea of a Bluetooth-connected app that will track how long you brush each part of your mouth and let you schedule a customized routine of automatic gum massage, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XT1KDSD/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; DiamondClean</a> is a premium brush that does look and feel like a luxury item.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>hrough over 20 hours of use, consulting with a dentist with 22 years’ experience and water flossing after over 80 meals, we found the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010NNIZQE/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> h2ofloss &#8211; hf-8</a> to be the best water flosser. It proved the most effective, and it can be used by multiple family members with differing gum sensitivity. The h2ofloss also has the biggest water reservoir as well as the widest variety of pressures to choose from. The<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HFQQ0VU/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Waterpik &#8211; WP-660</a> was a close runner-up.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>When we started researching water flossers, the first thing we did was speak with <a href="https://www.yoursmileourpassion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Roxanna Baghai</a>, a dentist in Southern California who has been practicing for over 22 years. We asked about the debate between water flossing and standard flossing right away. Dr. Baghai emphasized the importance of standard flossing, advising that “Waterpiks don’t replace flossing. Flossing is always a must. They (the water flossers) should always be used as an adjunct to flossing.”</p>
<p>So, we pressed further to see if water flossers actually help to reduce plaque, bacteria and the likelihood of gingivitis. She said, “Absolutely! Absolutely, they still work towards that because they still break up the food from setting in there between the teeth. The Waterpiks are also good for bridges, which is when two teeth are connected, and good for gaps.”</p>
<p>With this clearer understanding of the benefits of water flossing, we went through various websites and forums to find the features that consumers search for in a water flosser. We looked for reputable review sites (like Consumer Reports and Wirecutter) but came up empty-handed: none of the big-name publications have reviewed water flossers. So we took other measures, looking through the more detailed reviews of the products on Amazon’s bestseller list. We also went through the website of one of the most well-known manufacturers out there (<a href="https://www.waterpik.com/oral-health/blog/countertop-cordless-best-waterpik/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Waterpik</a>) to see what they had to say about flossers in general.</p>
<p>Once this was all done, we ordered a combination of the best water flossers. We tested both corded and cordless models for those of you who are on the go or don’t want to sacrifice any bathroom counter space. We pitted them against one another to find the best through a series of objective and subjective tests.</p>

<h2 id="why-a-water-flosser?">Why would you need a water flosser?</h2>
<p>If you’re like 60% of Americans, according to the <a href="http://www.ada.org/en/publications/ada-news/2014-archive/october/survey-finds-shortcomings-in-oral-health-habits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Dental Association</a>, then flossing is not something you do every day. So, we put in the work to determine which water flossers can most easily be added to your morning routine. Even though our dentist consult told us water flossing should be used in addition to normal flossing, she also said that “using [only] water flossers is absolutely better than nothing.”</p>
<p>One of the main benefits of a water flosser is that it is quick and easy. All you need is water (and an outlet if your flosser is corded).Water flossers basically break up the formation of plaque and bacteria so they don’t lead to cavities and gingivitis. Keeping the bacteria and plaque at bay can also promote better breath, cleaner teeth and a great smile.</p>
<p>And for some of the biggest annoyances that traditional flossing can’t seem to circumvent, a water flosser is the perfect alternative (though Dr. Baghai insists that flossing is still important). These annoyances include braces, a permanent retainer, crowns and bridges. In short, if you don&#8217;t floss, then water flossers are something you should consider because it is much easier and faster than traditional flossing and promotes overall dental hygiene and health.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>What to look for in a water flosser is largely dependent on your needs. For instance, if you have braces, then you are going to want a water flosser that has a special attachment or tip that is specific to braces. That being said, we found that you can do almost as good of a job with the standard tip. If you have sensitive gums, then you are going to want a water flosser with a variety of pressures that includes low pressure and possibly massage.</p>
<p><strong>Cordless vs. corded:</strong> This is usually the first differentiator to consider. The cordless water flossers are meant to be used for travel because they are very small in comparison, are easily packable for your travels and have the water tank as the handle.</p>
<p>Corded water flossers, on the other hand, are usually going to give you a wider variety of tips, a bigger difference between pressure settings and much larger reservoirs. Corded flossers are better for everyday use. They will take up a bigger spot on your bathroom counter next to your sink, which also provides a great visual cue that reminds you to water floss!</p>
<p><strong>Pressure:</strong> We all have different preferences and gum sensitivities. If you are going to be sharing the water flosser among your family, it is better to find one that has a wide range of pressures. If you have sensitive gums, then perhaps one with a softer setting and a massage setting, like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HFQQ0VU/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Waterpik &#8211; WP-660</a>, would be good for you.</p>
<p>If you have tough gums and wide gaps between your gums and teeth, then you will require more pressure to get rid of food and break up plaque. This is also where the different types of tips come in handy. We found that having some sort of bristle on the end is very useful.</p>
<p><strong>Different tips:</strong> All of the water flossers come with a standard tip, which is like an angled straw that narrows to a cone shape at the end. Some include special tips, like the “Plaque Seeker Tip” on the WP &#8211; 660, which is best for implants, crowns and bridges. It has the same sized hole as a standard tip and is equipped with three sections of quarter-inch long bristles to aid in the clearing of food.</p>
<p><strong>On/Off switch on the handle:</strong> This makes for much easier use. There are different types of on/off switch. For instance, some have all of the different pressures on the handle and others have only an on or off setting. One water flosser (the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nicefeel-Water-Flosser-Irrigator-Pressures/dp/B073CGMC1K/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nicefeel &#8211; FC168</a>) has a button that must be manually held down to stop it from squirting, ‘on’ and ‘off’ are only on the base. Needless to say, we got wet the first time we used it. We prefer the simple on/off switch.</p>
<p><strong>Water reservoir:</strong> The amount of water the reservoir holds is key. For example, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HFQQ0U6/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WP &#8211; 72</a> holds 1,000 ml, which is 167% of the normal 600 ml reservoir. We found this very convenient. Though filling up the reservoir in a compact model once or twice a day isn’t the end of the world, a larger reservoir is ideal if you can spare the counter space.</p>
<p><strong>Footprint size:</strong> The sizes of most corded water flossers don’t differ too much. As a general rule, bigger capacity means a larger footprint. That said, the average-capacity <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Belmint-Professional-Grade-Countertop-Water-Flosser/dp/B01AV4Z6K8/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Belmint</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HFQQ0VU/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Waterpik &#8211; WP-660</a> take up about three-quarters of the space that the others do. As expected, the 1,000 ml Waterpik &#8211; WP-72 takes up the most space.</p>
<p><strong>Noise level</strong>: Nobody wants to buy a product that is incredibly loud, especially as water flossing may take place in the morning when your family members are sleeping. Our results, however, show the sound to be between 55 and 65 decibels from six feet away: a pretty quiet sacrifice for good dental hygiene.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We grouped the testing into four categories: cleaning performance, ease of use, water pressure and capacity, and flossing tips.</p>
<h3>Cleaning performance</h3>
<p>It’s always nice to see the stats, but what really matters with products like water flossers is that they work. Do they get the food out of your teeth? Are they kid friendly? We kept notes on our experience with each water flosser after (almost) every use.</p>
<p>We used each flosser for about a week in order to get a feel for them and see what aspects might not be obvious from our controlled testing. We also started flossing daily so that we could understand the difference between water flossing and traditional flossing. The former is much easier to do (and a lot more fun, even though that novelty wears off).</p>
<p>Even the lower settings on the water flossers get most of the food out. But when there is some really tough stuff, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010NNIZQE/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">h2ofloss &#8211; hf-8</a> comes in handy because you can adjust the pressure in-hand. There is less pain with water flossing compared to traditional flossing, and even though you have to fill the machine up every couple of days, this only takes about 10 seconds.</p>
<h3>Ease of use</h3>
<p>We found it easiest to control water flossers that had a simple on/off switch on the handle instead of pressure-setting controls. It is easier to choose your setting before you turn it on or off. This way, you also avoid inadvertently switching between pressures as you are using the flosser or trying to turn it off.</p>
<p>Some of the water flossers that have pressure settings on the handle also have an off setting, or a pause setting. However, that requires more movement of the switch than does a simple click from on to off. That said, our favorite overall water flosser had the pressure selector on the handle, so it’s not a deal-breaker.</p>
<p>One of the things we found that made the water flossing experience more enjoyable is when we had the most control over the product. That means the least amount of mess and the most amount of water going down the sink. (Note: some of the products take getting used to, like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nicefeel-Water-Flosser-Irrigator-Pressures/dp/B073CGMC1K/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nicefeel</a>, which is automatically turned on and requires the button to be pressed down to pause the squirting.) Additionally, we looked at how easy it was to refill the tank. We’re happy to say: all the flossers have very easy-to-remove reservoirs.</p>
<h3>Water pressure and capacity</h3>

<p>Water pressure is an integral part of cleaning performance because a higher pressure allows for a better clean. So, we put each flosser at a specific height and angle to see how far each shot water on all of its different settings.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where we really had some fun. Initially, we thought the water flossers wouldn&#8217;t shoot water more than a few feet. However, when we plugged in the first one, the water shot out with way more power than expected — at that point we knew there would need to be some outdoor evaluation.</p>
<p>We put each water flosser four feet above the ground and shot the stream parallel to the ground to see how far (in feet) each water flosser shot on both the low and high settings. Three water flossers tied in terms of power (or distance) on their highest settings. However, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010NNIZQE/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">h2ofloss &#8211; hf-8</a> displayed the widest range of pressures going from 11 feet to 24 feet, which means it is also great for sensitive gums.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9916" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/water-tank-comparison.png" alt="water tank comparison chart" width="2000" height="1716" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/water-tank-comparison.png 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/water-tank-comparison-610x523.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/water-tank-comparison-1500x1287.png 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/water-tank-comparison-768x659.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/water-tank-comparison-885x759.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/water-tank-comparison-300x257.png 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/water-tank-comparison-295x253.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/water-tank-comparison-1000x858.png 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/water-tank-comparison-360x309.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/water-tank-comparison-375x322.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/water-tank-comparison-414x355.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/water-tank-comparison-320x275.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/water-tank-comparison-768x659@2x.png 1536w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/water-tank-comparison-300x257@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We also checked the reservoir capacity of each flosser, as well as the amount of time it took to empty the reservoir. The average reservoir size is around 600 ml, which lasts for about two to three uses. We were surprised to find that some of the manufacturers understated how long the water would last by about 30 seconds per tank. However, the H2o matched its claim to the second.</p>

<p>We rated each of the water flossers based on number of included tips and if they did the job they claimed to do. We found that a decent number of the brands that claim multiple tips are just giving the consumer multiple of the standard tip. This is good if you are sharing the water flosser among family members, but not as good if you need tips specifically for braces or crowns.</p>
<p>Even though the generic tip is good for most circumstances, it is nice to have a selection. The periodontal and orthodontic tips proved especially useful as the former is great for permanent retainers and the latter when working with sensitive gums. To change a tip on any of the flossers, all you do is push in a button and switch out the current tip.</p>

<p>So, if you have all of these extra tips, where are you supposed to store them? We also judged the water flossers on the tip-storage they provide. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nicefeel-Water-Flosser-Irrigator-Pressures/dp/B073CGMC1K/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nicefeel &#8211; FC168</a> particularly impressed us with their tip storage as there are two compartments: one is seamlessly integrated into the base of the flosser with a clear plastic that protects your tips from dust and the other is part of the lid.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010NNIZQE/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">h2ofloss &#8211; hf-8</a> puts to rest nearly every excuse to avoid flossing (and it was our favorite flosser). Whether you have sensitive gums or very hard-to-reach crowns, this water flosser provides you with the pressure you need to keep your teeth clean and your gums healthy. We loved the way you can lower the pressure on the handle when approaching a sore spot in your mouth (wisdom teeth coming in), and then turn it right back up to remove that stuck piece of food elsewhere. We found this to be our go-to flosser because the pressure is very natural to control and was effective every single flossing.</p>

This flosser gives you over two cleans per tank and is great for a family due to its wide range of pressures and assortment of tips.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010NNIZQE/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Something that really sets the h2ofloss apart is its compartment and stand for the extra tips. Some of the other brands will give you several tips, but nowhere to store them! With a collapsible stand that holds seven tips, you will never be left looking for the right one. Happily, the tips are also color coded, so it is easy to share the machine with family members.</p>
<p>Another specialty tip that is included is the periodontal tip, which is meant to be used for implants because of their increased required maintenance. We found that this tip can be used for everyday use as well and is especially good for permanent retainers or very small hard-to-reach spots.</p>
<p>With the second biggest water reservoir, the h2ofloss &#8211; hf-8 takes over two minutes to use up all the water when the water flosser is on its highest setting. The h2ofloss is also extremely quiet and waterproof.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We love the controls on the handle of the h2ofloss &#8211; hf-8 water flosser. You can easily switch from off to five different pressures while the machine is on, giving you all the control you need in your hand.</li>
<li>With an 800-ml reservoir you get 150 seconds of use on its highest setting, which is more than enough time to do multiple cleans.</li>
<li>With five different options to choose from, the h2ofloss has the widest range of pressures of any flosser we tested. This means that it works for both sensitive gums and that piece of cracker that is lodged in between your teeth.</li>
</ul>

<p>We loved the automatic ‘pacing’ reminder system on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HFQQ0VU/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Waterpik &#8211; WP-660</a>, as it allows you to zone out during your morning bathroom routine. The quality of flossing is high and it gives you control of the water flow from the handle.</p>
<p>With a more average-sized water tank than the h2ofloss, the WP-660 can be used for about two minutes on “high” before running out of water. The manufacturer claims 90 seconds, but they’re just being modest! In our pressure test, the WP-660 provided a wide range, which makes it a versatile flosser. It has four useful specialty tips: an orthodontic tip, periodontal tip, plaque tip and toothbrush tip.</p>

<p>Although they give you all of these convenient tips, there is very limited space to store them. On the upside, something this water flosser has that the best pick is lacking is a 30-second and one-minute timer, which allows you to stay on track and not over-floss. There is also a hydro-pulse massage mode that is unique to the WP-660, which is perfect for sensitive gums or for those who are just getting started. Compared to the normal stream, it halves the amount of water used with its quarter-second pulses.</p>
<p>A quick note on the control: there is an on/off switch on the handle of the water flosser that gives you easy command (and keeps the water from spraying where you don’t want it). The pressure settings are on a easily-visible knob on the base of the machine. All you have to do is select your preferred pressure and floss away!</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Waterpik &#8211; WP-660 has a knob on the side of the machine that gives you 10 pressure settings to choose from. It is the only water flosser that has a separate massage setting that gives your gums intermittent breaks.</li>
<li>Tip selection is second to none: in addition to three standard tips, there is an orthodontic tip, periodontal tip, plaque tip and toothbrush tip.</li>
<li>Pressure control is completely intuitive and gives you ultimate control over how hard or soft you need it. There’s also an easy-to-use on/off switch on the handle of the water flosser.</li>

[Update: although it&#8217;s still available in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XD8TWCR/?tag=ybdfloss-20">dark blue</a> color from SmarToiletries, it looks like the original white color is available from company rebranding this item, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OQFH0OY/?tag=ybdfloss-20">ToiletTree Products</a>.</p>
<p>It was very easy to choose the winner of this category. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XD8TWCR/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SmarToiletries &#8211; STO-PO2016</a> is the only cordless flosser that we’d really use. It requires minimal effort, looks clean and is a nice in-between size that allows for simple travel, while still maintaining a big enough reservoir for a nice clean. It has comparable pressures to the corded flossers, which is more than enough to end your toothpick struggles.</p>

It may be small, but it gets the job done.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XD8TWCR/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>We like that it uses a charging mechanism as opposed to batteries because, well, sometimes batteries are hard to come by in a messy drawer. The SmarToiletries has one of the best handles because it has an on/off switch and you can change the pressure setting.</p>
<p>If you have an average-sized dopp kit, the SmarToiletries will fit in nicely. So, you can take it on trips and keep your teeth and gums healthy and happy. Since the reservoir allows for 45 seconds of water flossing or 30 seconds on high pressure, you’ll have more than enough time to get that annoying mustard seed out of your permanent retainer. Also, refilling it is intuitive and only takes a couple of seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At just over seven inches in length, the SmarToiletries &#8211; STO-PO2016 is a perfect choice for an on-the-go water flosser because it gives you all power you need for a good clean and has easy-to-use settings on the handle.</li>
<li>You’ll have 30 seconds of high pressure to get those seeds out of your teeth. You can even floss in the shower, thanks to a waterproof design.</li>
<li>The SmarToiletries is beautifully designed and so simple to use that you will have no excuse to avoid flossing.</li>

<h3>Belmint &#8211; BEL-WF</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Belmint-Professional-Grade-Countertop-Water-Flosser/dp/B01AV4Z6K8/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Belmint &#8211; BEL-WF</a> is extremely solid. It’s also the best-looking flosser, which did make it that much easier to adapt to. At the end of the day, that’s what we really want, and if you are trying to get your kids to use it then this may be your best bet. It’s not quite as powerful as some of the top water flossers, but the difference is small. It still provides the usual pressure settings necessary to get most jobs done.</p>
<p>Some very innovative thinking took place in the design of this flosser: the lid doubles as a dust-proofer and storage for up to four tips, so it keeps the both the countertop clutter-free and the water inside clean. The Belmint is akin to the Waterpik &#8211; WP-660 (the runner-up) in many respects: it has an on/off switch on the handle and a knob you turn to choose the strength of the stream. It also has a couple minutes’ water tank capacity, and there is a timer with thirty-second warnings.</p>
<p>This flosser is great for those with sensitive gums because it offers the lowest pressure out of the flossers and uses the least amount of water on that pressure. The Belmint &#8211; BEL-WF can be used for over seven minutes on its lowest setting, which is the longest out of any product we tested (even though it has an average-sized tank). Another fun little feature that the Belmint has, which kids may like, is a magnetic holder for the handle.</p>
<h3>Nicefeel &#8211; FC168</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nicefeel-Water-Flosser-Irrigator-Pressures/dp/B073CGMC1K/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nicefeel &#8211; FC168</a> has the best extra-tip storage of any product we tested. And, yes, that means Nicefeel gives you multiple useful tips (not just a bunch of standard tips). It has an orthodontic tip, periodontal tip and plaque tip that can either be stored inside the lid of the water reservoir or in a stand on the side of the water tank. This is a perfect product for a family, as it is a shareable product that includes three color-coded standard tips.</p>
<p>This water flosser is not for those with sensitive gums. Although there are 10 pressure choices (which is standard), the difference between low and high is minimal as all of the pressure is pretty high. Regardless, you can use it on ‘high’ for about two minutes, which is easily time enough to get the job done even if you have tough crowns or braces.</p>

It is powerful and comes with multiple tips for those with permanent retainers, crowns or bridges.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nicefeel-Water-Flosser-Irrigator-Pressures/dp/B073CGMC1K/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The reason this water flosser is harder to control than the rest is because it only has a pause button on the handle, as opposed to an off switch, making it susceptible to slipping and spraying everywhere. Contrary to what you may think, the automatic setting is ‘on’. So you have to manually push the button down when you want the water to stop shooting out, or press the master switch on the base. There is a lifetime warranty and a one-year money back guarantee on this flosser.</p>
<h3>Waterpik &#8211; WP-72</h3>
<p>You could keep a couple goldfish in this tank, it’s so big! Okay, we’re kidding, but the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HFQQ0U6/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Waterpik &#8211; WP-72</a> is about one and a half times bigger than the others. Unfortunately, there is no lid to keep dust from getting in the water like every other water flosser we tested. (Though this may not be a problem in your bathroom.)</p>
<p>The tank does flip over and double as a cover to the flosser, which makes it very compact if you plan on taking it somewhere with you. If you aren’t worried about dust settling in the tank, then the generous amount of water might last you three or four days between filling.</p>
<p>It comes with two standard tips and a periodontal tip, which, like we’ve said, comes in handy for things like a permanent retainer. It can reach those really small and hard to reach spots in between your teeth. There are six different pressure settings, but no on/off mechanism on the handle. Sure it’s easy enough to press the switch on the base, but we prefer control on the handle.</p>
<h3>ProFloss &#8211; 4190</h3>
<p>The best way to describe the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ginsey-Home-Solutions-4190-Waterflosser/dp/B001MUBL50/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ProFloss &#8211; 4190</a> is that it’s unconventional. There is no reservoir and there are no pressure buttons. Instead, it is a direct attachment to your faucet. All you do is unscrew the aerator on the bottom of your faucet and screw in theirs. Its aerator has both internal and external threads, so it will fit onto most faucets.</p>
<p>It’s not too hard to put on (assuming your aerator is not stuck on there like ours was). It only takes about a minute and from there all you have to do is pop in the spiral-cord and you’re all set. The pressure is adjusted the same way you’d adjust the pressure of your faucet while washing your hands.</p>
<p>Because there’s no water tank, there is an endless supply of water, but you will have an enlarged aerator attached to your faucet. You don’t need access to power of any type, just a faucet with running water. It’s also incredibly small and easy to pop in your toiletry bag or keep in your bathroom drawer. Not too bad for less than 20 bucks.</p>
<h3>Panasonic &#8211; EW-DJ10-A</h3>
<p>Another “not-by-the-book” water flosser is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027LSEPS/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; EW-DJ10-A</a>. In order to save space, the top portion of this flosser slides down into the reservoir as the water level drops. At first glance this is a good design idea because it seems efficient.</p>
<p>However, even though the on/off switch is on the handle, it is not easy to switch off the flosser. As one part of the flosser slides over the switch, it becomes covered. So if you want to stop halfway through, it requires two hands: one to hold the flosser and one to uncover the switch. It can be hard to tell when the water is done, so take care when you take it out of your mouth so the thing doesn’t run wild.</p>
<p>It gets easier to control over time as you know what to expect and how to bend your face down towards the sink when you take it out, but that’s a lot to have to adapt to. Also, the shape is not very ergonomic.</p>
<p>Also, a little side note, if you are having trouble accessing the batteries on this flosser, try using a nickel.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The fight for the top was a tough one this time around. Both the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010NNIZQE/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">h2ofloss &#8211; hf-8</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HFQQ0VU/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Waterpik &#8211; WP-660</a> are phenomenal water flossers. Ultimately, though, the h2ofloss came out victorious with an ability to store all of its extra tips, a wider range of pressures and a cost around two thirds of the price of the Waterpik.</p>
<p>The WP-660 was the best in category as far as extra tips go, with four different specialty tips that can cover all of your needs from cleaning crowns and implants to braces and permanent retainers. The best cordless was a no-brainer, as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XD8TWCR/?tag=ybdfloss-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SmarToiletries &#8211; STO-PO2016</a> puts the other two cordless flossers we tested to shame and even rivals the pressure of some of the corded flossers. In the end, though, the h2ofloss &#8211; hf-8 gave us everything we were looking for in a water flosser.<br />
