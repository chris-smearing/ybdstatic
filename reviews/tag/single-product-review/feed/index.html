				<description><![CDATA[Scrub Daddy has sold millions of units since being featured on Shark Tank. Our in-house testing indicates that it is worthy of the hype.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>ack in 2012, Aaron Krause “entered the tank” on ABC’s hit television show Shark Tank and gave one of the most successful pitches the show has seen to date. Lori Grenier, the shark known for holding more than 100 patents, her expertise and star presence on QVC, said she instantly knew the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J420JEC/?tag=ybdscrub-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Scrub Daddy</a> was a “hero.” Based on our own research and testing, we agree it’s the best sponge  on the market.</p>

<li><a href="#the-bottom-line">The bottom line</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Since being broadcast on Shark Tank, sales of Scrub Daddy have exploded. They are now available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J420JEC/?tag=ybdscrub-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>, as well as retail locations including Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Walmart. In addition to the original and iconic yellow smiling Scrub Daddy, the brand now includes several other product lines as well.</p>
<p>As of early 2016, sales of the Scrub Daddy had already exceeded 10 million units and $50 million in sales, and show no indication of slowing down.</p>
<p>With all the attention the Scrub Daddy received thanks to its appearance on Shark Tank, we wanted to find out whether or not the hype associated with the Scrub Daddy was really earned.</p>
<h2 id="what-sets-scrub-daddy-apart">What sets the Scrub Daddy apart from other sponges</h2>
<p>When selecting the products we wanted to test for our comprehensive <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-kitchen-cleaning-sponge/">best kitchen cleaning sponge</a> review, the Scrub Daddy started off at the top of our prospective list, alongside longstanding brand names like Lysol and Scotch-Brite. This is noteworthy in and of itself, since Scrub Daddy has existed as a brand for only a few years.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, the Scrub Daddy stands out for its friendly aesthetic. If you’re walking through the sponge aisle in a retail store, the Scrub Daddy will stand out for its bright and attention-grabbing packaging.</p>
<p>Beyond the packaging, the design and performance of the Scrub Daddy is what really makes this product stand out.</p>
<p>The Scrub Daddy is the only sponge among our finalists that is able to be both hard enough to clean a BBQ grill and soft enough to be a scratch-free cleaning solution for delicate pots, pans, and plates.</p>
<p>The Scrub Daddy is made from a synthetic (and proprietary) material which turns hard in cold water and soft in warm water. This functionality is what makes it possible for the Scrub Daddy to be both a hard scrubber and a soft sponge.</p>
<p>The design of the Scrub Daddy is unique as well. There are few consumer products on the market that are able to take something as simple as a smiling sponge and utilize each of those facial features (eyes, mouth, hair) into specific and useful features.</p>

<h2 id="how-scrub-daddy-performs">How the Scrub Daddy performs</h2>
<p>In our test of the best kitchen cleaning sponges, we tested the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J420JEC/?tag=ybdscrub-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scrub Daddy</a> alongside seven other sponges using a series of tests. Here’s how the Scrub Daddy performed across each of those tests:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3163" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data.png" alt="Sponge Data" width="880" height="586" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-610x406.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-360x240.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-375x250.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-414x276.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-295x196.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-180x120.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-320x213.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Data-360x240@2x.png 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Rinsability</h3>
<p>One of the main selling points of the Scrub Daddy is its ability to rinse clean. In our own testing, we found this claim to be very accurate. Running the Scrub Daddy under warm water leaves the sponge soft enough to squeeze out any flakes or material, while the temperature of the water and texture of the sponge itself helped facilitate the removal of excess waste.</p>
<h3>Scratch test</h3>
<p>While the Scrub Daddy is capable of scraping surfaces as tough as a recently used BBQ grill, it is still capable of cleaning more delicate surfaces – such as the nonstick coating of a pan – without causing scratches.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that all but one of the sponges we tested were able to clean a variety of surfaces without producing any scratches. However, the Scrub Daddy does stand out a bit thanks to its ability to alternate between a heavy scrubber and a scratch-free sponge.</p>
<h3>Ergonomics</h3>
<p>Ergonomics is another area where the Scrub Daddy really stands out from the competition. That’s because the smiling face of the Scrub Daddy is more than just an aesthetic decision.</p>
<p>The shape of the Scrub Daddy makes it perfect for most hands, and fingers can be put through the eyeholes to further improve the grip. The Scrub Daddy’s mouth is also great for cleaning silverware and even some cooking utensils.</p>
<p>The “hair” on the top of the Scrub Daddy also make cleaning glasses easier as well.</p>
<h3>Drying time</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3153" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time.png" alt="Sponge Drying Time" width="880" height="579" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-610x401.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-360x237.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-375x247.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-414x272.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-295x194.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-180x118.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-Drying-Time-320x211.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Bacteria and other pathogens love wet environments. That’s why a sponge that stays wet for extended periods of time can breed dangerous levels of bacteria.</p>
<p>The Scrub Daddy was the fastest of our finalists to dry, but still required 7.9 hours to completely dry. While that might seem like a long time, the Natural Sea Sponge, TVTimedirect Microfiber Sponge, and Superior Performance Ultra Sponge took more than 26 hours to fully dry.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-didnt-like">What we didn’t like about the Scrub Daddy</h2>
<p>Overall, the Scrub Daddy is an excellent sponge, and easily the best kitchen sponge we tested. That being said, there were a couple of things we didn’t love about it.</p>
<h3>Absorbency</h3>
<p>The most significant thing we noticed was that the Scrub Daddy, while versatile, is not particularly great for cleaning up spills. The Scrub Daddy tied for last place in our absorbency test, and was only able to hold about three tablespoons of water.</p>
<p>To compare, the Natural Sea Sponge held 15 tablespoons of water, and the Lysol Multi-Purpose Scrub Sponge held 5 tablespoons.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3152" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency.png" alt="Sponge absorbency" width="880" height="579" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-610x401.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-360x237.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-375x247.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-414x272.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-295x194.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-180x118.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sponge-absorbency-320x211.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Of course, Aaron and Lori (owner and primary investor of the Scrub Daddy brand) have come up with a solution to the absorbency issue, with the development of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RZT81HI/?tag=ybdscrub-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sponge Daddy</a>.</p>
<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>The other thing we noticed was that the Scrub Daddy is a bit more expensive to use than other sponges. That, in conjunction with the fact that the Scrub Daddy does tend to start breaking down after a month or two of heavy use means you’ll be paying a slight premium to use the Scrub Daddy.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a high-quality, versatile, hygienic sponge, the Scrub Daddy should top your list. While the Scrub Daddy does tend to be a little more expensive than other sponges on the market, for most people the cost is more than worth it to use a sponge as powerful as the Scrub Daddy.</p>

<p>The Dyson AM07 will blow you away — both literally and figuratively. Its innovative design allows it to move more air without making a lot of noise, and the understated-yet-bold styling makes this a fan people want to own.</p>
<p>However, Dyson has made it clear that their luxury positioning is no joke.  The price of this model is so far beyond the point of diminishing returns that it’s hard to recommend for anybody other than a cooling connoisseur (those exist?).</p>

<p>To determine the true cooling power of the five units, we used an anemometer to measure the wind speeds generated off each when sitting approximately two feet from the unit.</p>
<p>We did this because the units have varying opening sizes and true total distribution of air, which warranted looking at the total output. This way, we can measure if the fan is actually capable of cooling a room and not just you. The two-feet height is about waist level, and depending on the person, four feet is chest/face level when sitting.</p>

<p>The Dyson AM07 tied for top place, generating consistent air flow over the full height. Other fans had higher peak airflow in specific places, but lost a lot of power at the edge of the airstream. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LA1FIHS/?tag=ybdam07-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Seville Classics</a> was the only fan capable of pushing as much air at the top of the fan, though it had to run faster to do so.</p>
<p>Next, we looked at noise level, measuring the sound pressure level of noise (in decibels on an A-weighted scale) generated by each fan on the highest setting. If you&#8217;re considering using the fan as a bedside unit, this is an important attribute.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I8R4VZC/?tag=ybdam07-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Dyson AM07</a> really showed its engineering excellence in this area, capably generating its consistent, smooth airflow without much noise. The difference between the Dyson and the more powerful Seville on this loudest setting is equivalent to the difference between normal conversation and using a hair dryer.</p>

While it's not <em>library</em> quiet, it doesn't generate enough noise on lower settings to bother most consumers.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LA1FIHS/?tag=ybdam07-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>However, on the grand scheme of things, the Seville isn’t really loud. It’s not going to remind you of a library, but it probably won’t bother you, either. One great thing about a high-output fan is that you don&#8217;t have to sit right next to it to take benefit of the high-speed airstream. The attributes Dyson is banking on is the seven decibels of sound difference, and we didn&#8217;t find it a compelling difference.</p>
<p>After noise levels, we tested the fans for degrees of oscillation. In addition to the total area the fan air covers, a fan’s ability to move also improves its performance in cooling multiple people — and a room overall.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2597" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-oscillation-dyson.png" alt="tower-fan-oscillation-dyson" width="879" height="387" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-oscillation-dyson.png 879w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-oscillation-dyson-610x269.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-oscillation-dyson-360x158.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-oscillation-dyson-375x165.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-oscillation-dyson-414x182.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-oscillation-dyson-295x130.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-oscillation-dyson-180x79.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tower-fan-oscillation-dyson-320x141.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The Dyson performed as you expect, with 90 degrees of oscillation coverage that allows it to sit in a corner and move air through the whole room. A few models, including our top pick, the Seville, had slightly more range, but the difference isn&#8217;t noteworthy.</p>
<p>Finally, we tested the Dyson&#8217;s energy usage against the field using a KillAWatt monitor. The Dyson, while not an energy hog by any means, didn&#8217;t perform any better than the field. For context, the difference in usage for the lower-end models would at best result in a savings of a dollar or so per month if you are using the fans heavily.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-down-dyson">Breaking down the Dyson AM07</h2>
<p>In addition to its cooling power and rotation, there are other things about the Dyson that impress. The controller feels a lot like an Apple remote in terms of comfort, size and aesthetics, and it&#8217;s by far the best option amongst the finalists. But on the negative side, it means there&#8217;s a good chance it&#8217;ll end up in your couch cushions.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2669 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fans_Dyson-Controller.jpg" alt="Photo Credit Kimberly Lostroscio" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fans_Dyson-Controller.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fans_Dyson-Controller-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fans_Dyson-Controller-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fans_Dyson-Controller-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fans_Dyson-Controller-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fans_Dyson-Controller-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fans_Dyson-Controller-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fans_Dyson-Controller-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fans_Dyson-Controller-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fans_Dyson-Controller-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>However, Dyson does have an impressive feature to counteract that &#8212; the unit is magnetic, and the remote sticks to it when you place it on the top of the fan.</p>
<p>The bottom of the unit also functions as the all-purpose control if you don&#8217;t happen to have the remote handy. You can cycle through all ten fan levels by holding the power button.</p>

<p>The Dyson is an amazing fan, but for most people, you don’t pay $400 for a Dyson AM07 because you really want the cooling power. You pay $400 for a Dyson because you’re a tech geek who loves amazing products and must have the best possible product on the market.</p>
<p>Or maybe you pay $400 because you want to impress. When you have house guests over, you want to start a conversation. Or to be cool (in multiple ways). The Dyson is capable of doing all of those things.</p>
<p>When you think about the Dyson as a standalone fan in a vacuum, it’s not worth anything close to its $400 price tag. But if you’re willing to think more about what the Dyson stands for, and what it says about you, you can see how some people are willing to chalk up the cash to pay for it.</p>

<p>Overall, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I8R4VZC/?tag=ybdam07-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Dyson AM07</a> is an incredible act of engineering. Most of us can’t begin to comprehend how the Dyson manages to generate the air flow it does &#8212; and most of us never will &#8212; but it does. And it looks amazing. And it works.</p>
<p>Still, after all that, it’s almost $400, and a comparable, amazing unit, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LA1FIHS/?tag=ybdam07-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Seville Classics UltraSlimline</a>, is only $60. So if you’re thinking more with your rational mind, instead of the wow-that’s-shiny mind, the Seville will be your pick. And if your wow-that’s-shiny mind comes first, there’s no fan shinier than the Dyson AM07.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Although a great thermometer, we came to the conclusion that the Thermapen shouldn't be the top choice for most people. It's an amazing product, but not really worth its $100 price point. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e took an in-depth look at nine of the best digital meat thermometers on the market, including the expensive-yet-popular <a href="https://www.thermoworks.com/Thermapen-Mk4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ThermoWorks Thermapen</a>. While the Thermapen is certainly among the best, we found there are better options for most homes, such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F59K0IW/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lavatools &#8211; Javelin PRO</a>. Read on to check out our review of the Thermapen, or take a look at our full review of the nine <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-digital-meat-thermometer/">best digital meat thermometers</a> on the market.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="finding-the-best">Finding the best digital meat thermometer</h2>
<p>We used a series of tests to rank each of the nine thermometers and determine which one was the best overall. These tests included the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temperature accuracy in freezing water</li>
<li>Temperature accuracy in boiling water</li>
<li>Temperature stabilization in tempered dark chocolate</li>
<li>Temperature stabilization and accuracy in a thick rib-eye steak</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as several other tests and metric comparisons.</p>
<h2 id="stand-out">What made the Thermapen stand out</h2>
<p><strong>The Thermapen sits at the very top of the price range</strong> for all of the digital thermometers we tested. While we aren’t quite sure that it’s worth the $100+ cost, there were still plenty of things we liked about the Thermapen.</p>
<h3>Temperature range</h3>
<p>The Thermapen led the field in the temperature range it could handle. During our testing, it was able to measure temperatures as low as -60°F, the lowest of all nine thermometers we tested (by about 20 degrees).</p>
<p>On the high end, the Thermapen was comparable to the other two top thermometers in this metric: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/EatSmart-Precision-Thermocouple-Thermometer-Technology/dp/B00KVLPUB2/?tag=ybdigsu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eat Smart thermometer</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/iDevices-IKT0002P5-Kitchen-Thermometer/dp/B00IJ1SQV2/?tag=ybdigsu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iDevices thermometer</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2328 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_temp-range.png" alt="digital meat thermometer temperature range" width="880" height="805" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_temp-range.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_temp-range-610x558.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_temp-range-360x329.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_temp-range-375x343.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_temp-range-414x379.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_temp-range-295x270.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_temp-range-180x165.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_temp-range-320x293.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>While this wide of a range isn’t needed by everyone &#8212; including those who are just using the thermometer to cook steak &#8212; it does add to the overall versatility of the thermometer, and is a significant value add for those who need to measure a wide range of temperatures in the kitchen.</p>
<h3>Ergonomics</h3>
<p>None of the thermometers we tested were particularly difficult to handle. However, one thing we really liked about the Thermapen was the fact that <strong>the display would automatically rotate depending on which direction the thermometer was being held</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead of needing to turn our head sideways to read the temperature, we could easily read the temperature from any direction.</p>
<p>According to the ThermoWorks website, this is a technology they have patented, which means if you want to look at your digital thermometer without looking sideways, you probably need to go with the Thermapen.</p>

<h3>Temperature speed</h3>
<p>The Thermapen was among the top performers among our instant-read finalists when we tested the speed with which each could find the correct temperature.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2329 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_instant-read.png" alt="digital thermometer read speed" width="880" height="659" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_instant-read.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_instant-read-610x457.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_instant-read-360x270.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_instant-read-375x281.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_instant-read-414x310.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_instant-read-295x221.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_instant-read-180x135.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thermometers_instant-read-320x240.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The Thermapen came in second place when measuring the temperature of ice water, boiling water, and steak. It also came in third place for measuring the chocolate. While these numbers aren’t particularly outstanding, they should be more than sufficient for most kitchen applications.</p>
<h2 id="what-not-liked">What we didn’t like about the Thermapen</h2>
<p><strong>The most significant thing we disliked about the Thermapen was the cost</strong>. At more than $100 (including shipping, tax, etc.), the Thermapen commands a significant premium over other digital food thermometers in the market, including the other 8 finalists we tested.</p>
<p>While a high price isn’t in and of itself a disqualifier, we felt that, in conjunction with the Thermapen’s performance, it is difficult to justify the cost of the Thermapen for most consumers.</p>
<h3>Good, but not the best</h3>
<p>As we mentioned above, the Thermapen performs reasonably well. That being said, it is neither the fastest, nor the most accurate thermometer we tested.</p>
<p>One of the major selling points that ThermoWorks uses to justify the cost of the Thermapen is the fact that <strong>it utilizes a “thermocouple” sensor instead of a “thermistor” sensor</strong>. This is supposed to increase the speed and accuracy of the thermometer.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Both the Javelin PRO and the Eat Smart thermometers performed better in each of those categories some of the time.</p>
<p>If the price point of the Thermapen were in the $40-60 range, we’d feel much more comfortable recommending it. However, for the price, we simply don’t think that it&#8217;s worth it &#8212; not when we consider our other finalists.</p>

<p>As we mentioned, the Thermapen performs well, but not as well as our top pick — specifically, the Lavatools &#8211; Javelin PRO.</p>

The probe is made from food-grade stainless steel, and its magnetic back makes it easy to store. Priced around $50, it comes with a three-year warranty.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F59K0IW/?tag=ybdthrm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<h3>Temperature range</h3>
<p>The Thermapen has a larger temperature range on both the high and the low end when compared to the Javelin PRO.</p>
<p>On the high end, the Thermapen works up to temperatures close to 600°F, while the Javelin PRO is effective up to about 475°F. On the low end, the Thermapen is functional in temperatures as low as -60°F, compared to the Javelin PRO which stops functioning at -40°F.</p>
<p><strong>Winner: Thermapen</strong></p>
<h3>Temperature accuracy</h3>
<p>Both the Thermapen and the Javelin PRO were essentially comparable with regard to temperature accuracy.</p>
<p>In our freezing water test, both thermometers registered 32°F, which is precisely correct. In our boiling water test, both thermometers registered 210°F, which is 1.5 degrees off from the correct measurement (at our elevation, water boils at 211.5°F).</p>
<p><strong>Winner: Tie</strong></p>
<h3>Temperature read speed</h3>
<p>Both the Lavatools Javelin PRO and the ThermoWorks Thermapen were among the best performers across this category.</p>
<p>However, the Thermapen was faster on three of the tests (ice water, boiling water, and steak), while the Javelin PRO was faster in the chocolate test.</p>
<p>While the edge does go to the Thermapen, it’s important to note that both thermometers were able to produce accurate readings very quickly. We consider the Thermapen’s edge to be marginal in real-world applications.</p>
<p><strong>Winner: Thermapen</strong></p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>The price of these products does change from time to time. However, in general the price of the Thermapen is about double what you’d pay for a Javelin PRO. At the time of testing, this meant spending $50 versus spending $100. Unless you’re working in a professional or commercial kitchen, the marginal improvements of the Thermapen are probably overkill.</p>
<p><strong>Winner: Javelin PRO</strong></p>
<h2 id="should-you-buy">Should you buy a Thermapen?</h2>
<p>While the <a href="https://www.thermoworks.com/Thermapen-Mk4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thermapen</a> is undoubtedly an excellent product, overall we found the value to be unequal to the price for most buyers. It is possible that some of the Thermapen’s value is in it’s longevity, and we will conduct long-term testing to see if that’s the case.</p>
<p>Based on our testing data and 30+ hours of use gave us a pretty clear indication that the Thermapen does not offer the best value, unless you have a specific need for a very wide temperature range (which reaches well below freezing), or if you really need to shave an extra second or two off your (already quick) reading.</p>
<p><strong>Unless there is a specific feature that the Thermapen offers that you must have, we think that the <a href="https://www.thermoworks.com/Thermapen-Mk4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lavatools &#8211; Javelin PRO</a> performs better, costs less, and is an overall better value.</strong></p>

				<description><![CDATA[The Vitamix S30 is a great personal blender -- its just not worth the $250+ you'll pay for it if you're using it for those reasons. If you want a real, more versatile blender, upgrade in size. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter spending 40 plus hours testing the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-S30-Personal-Blender-Black/dp/B00JS8S2IC/?tag=ybdvita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vitamix S30</a> and six of <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-personal-blender/">the best personal blenders</a> on the market, we’ve come to the conclusion that for most, the S30 is not worth the price tag. For the value, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0163K1Z3G/?tag=ybdvita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NutriBullet 900</a> is a comparable if not better product at a third the price.</p>

<li><a href="#who-should-buy">Who should buy the Vitamix S30</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing about the Vitamix S30 made us think it wasn’t a great blender. Amazing power, nice features, portable, and relatively easy to clean. But there was also little that made us conclude that it was also worth $350+, especially when there were similar personal blenders on the market that compared nicely.</p>
<h2>The Vitamix reputation</h2>
<p>Vitamix is known for their world-class blenders. And world-class they are… especially at the family sized <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.vitamix.com/">Classic and Next Generation levels</a>.</p>
<p>It’s my estimation that the personal blender line Vitamix has created, in the S30 and the S55, is an effort to appeal to the single-serve segment of the market, while also retaining the luxury brand identity they’ve established. They do, but when creating a product at $350, it only really “fits” in the bigger blender area in terms of features and need… and that’s where I think this segment of their product line breaks down.</p>
<p>When we tested the Vitamix S30 against six of the best personal blenders available, it not surprisingly <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-personal-blender/">lived up to reputation</a>. We created a static, consistent blending test across the seven blenders, inserted the ingredients in the same order, and tested time to even blend.</p>
<p>These were the ingredients we tested:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1045" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blender_INGREDIENTS-1-1.jpg" alt="Blender_INGREDIENTS (1)" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blender_INGREDIENTS-1-1.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blender_INGREDIENTS-1-1-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blender_INGREDIENTS-1-1-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blender_INGREDIENTS-1-1-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blender_INGREDIENTS-1-1-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blender_INGREDIENTS-1-1-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blender_INGREDIENTS-1-1-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blender_INGREDIENTS-1-1-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blender_INGREDIENTS-1-1-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blender_INGREDIENTS-1-1-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The Vitamix powered through the mix, generating the third best time in our sample. However, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0163K1Z3G/?tag=ybdvita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NutriBullet Pro 900</a>, priced at a third the cost, managed to blend the mix in a third the time:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1093" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-2.png" alt="blender-time" width="880" height="609" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-2.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-2-610x422.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-2-360x249.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-2-375x260.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-2-414x287.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-2-295x204.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-2-180x125.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-2-320x221.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>To be fair, in the instruction guide, the Vitamix recommends starting for a bit on the 1-2 blending speed level and then ramping up to 10. We did that, but it was still surprising to have it get blown away so significantly by the NutriBullet.</p>
<p>In other areas, the Vitamix either leads or close to leads the pack. It’s relatively quiet, has a good sized blending cup (with a bigger option the other blenders didn’t have), and has significantly more features in the speed modes and pulse option no other blender did.</p>

<p>The extra features <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-S30-Personal-Blender-Black/dp/B00JS8S2IC/?tag=ybdvita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vitamix offers</a> also come with a cost &#8212; size. Out of its personal blender counterparts, the Vitamix will take up the most room on your counter. It’s by no means gigantic, but it is one the largest blenders in the single-serve niche.</p>

<p>If you’re considering the S30, you probably want a power-packed personal blender. Our recommendation is actually to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0163K1Z3G/?tag=ybdvita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">go with the NutriBullet</a>, which offers a more enjoyable product at a third the cost.</p>
<p>The NutriBullet has more blending power and is slightly easier to clean than the Vitamix. On the negative side, the NutriBullet only has a one year warranty compared to the Vitamix’s impressive five year warranty. If we’re being fair and assume the NutriBullet might break once over the five years, you’re still paying half the cost of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-S30-Personal-Blender-Black/dp/B00JS8S2IC/?tag=ybdvita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Vitamix S30</a>.</p>
<p>And if it breaks twice, the comparison is getting a lot closer, but with two one year warranties to back it up, you’re probably likely to get the similar long-term value at around half the price.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-S30-Personal-Blender-Black/dp/B00JS8S2IC/?tag=ybdvita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Vitamix S30</a> is still an amazing product for the right person. To me, it fits perfectly into the need set of a young professional with a kid or two, who wants to be able to make on-the-go smoothies and also have the option to make bigger ones with the 40 ounce container if the need arises.</p>
<p>Similarly, said professional should probably have or be starting to develop some passion for cooking/precision, and want to utilize the speed and pulse functions to create thicker or smoother smoothies or other ingredients, such as pesto, that the NutriBullet can’t compete with.</p>
<p><strong>In essence, we’d best describe the Vitamix S30 as an entry-level performance blender for the on-the-go smoothie lover.</strong></p>
<p>If that’s not you, check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0163K1Z3G/?tag=ybdvita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the NutriBullet</a>. You can also consider the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Decker-PB1002R-Fusion-Personal-Blender/dp/B00LU2HXTI/?tag=ybdvita-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black &amp; Decker Fusion Blade</a>, our best pick under $30, a solid choice for a fraction of the cost.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[The dōTERRA Petal diffuser is an excellent product overall, and stands out because of its small footprint.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ver the course of more than 40 hours, we tested several of the best essential oil diffusers on the market. This included the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NZFGLHS/?tag=ybdpetal-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">dōTERRA Petal Diffuser</a>, which was one of our favorites overall thanks to its ability to diffuse a significant amount of essential oil per hour, as well as its durable aesthetically-pleasing design.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="why-buy-diffuser">Why buy an essential oil diffuser</h2>
<p>There are a number of reasons why someone might consider purchasing an essential oil diffuser. First and foremost, essential oil diffusers can be used with any of the hundreds of different essential oils available on the market &#8212; many of which have distinct and pleasant scents.</p>
<p>Essential oil has been used for aromatherapy for thousands of years, and in recent years, essential oil aromatherapy has become increasingly popular as well. This is due largely to growing knowledge about the benefits of essential oils, including lavender (for relaxation) and peppermint (for settling your stomach and increasing alertness), among many others.</p>
<p>For most of their history, essential oils were diffused passively, which meant putting the essential oils in a jar with wooden reeds that would absorb and diffuse the essential oil slowly over time. However, active essential oil diffusers make it possible to diffuse a significantly larger amount of essential oil over the course of several hours, producing a more significant and effective scent.</p>
<p>Essential oil diffusers are a great addition to a living room or bedroom and are a safe and cost-effective alternative to candles.</p>
<p>Essential oil diffusers are also well-suited for businesses. While yoga studios and massage parlors are the most obvious candidates, the wide variety of scents available make it possible for almost any business to use essential oils to their advantage.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-liked">What we liked about the dōTERRA diffuser</h2>
<p>We tested seven of the most popular essential oil diffusers on the market, and the dōTERRA diffuser came in a very strong second place.</p>
<p><a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/unnamed.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2273 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/unnamed.png" width="880" height="480" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/unnamed.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/unnamed-610x333.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/unnamed-360x196.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/unnamed-375x205.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/unnamed-414x226.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/unnamed-295x161.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/unnamed-180x98.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/unnamed-320x175.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></a></p>
<p>One of the things we noticed right away was the superior build quality of the dōTERRA diffuser. Unlike many of the essential oil diffusers on the market &#8212; including a few of the finalists we tested in our office &#8212; the dōTERRA diffuser is built from high-quality plastics and materials. Not only does this ensure that the dōTERRA diffuser will work reliably for years, but it also makes the diffuser an appropriate addition to more upscale environments.</p>
<p>Operation of the dōTERRA diffuser was simple as well. In addition to being the quietest essential oil diffuser we tested, the dōTERRA diffuser only has two buttons: one for turning on the mist (in increments of one, two or four hours) and a button to turn the light on and off. Once activated, the diffuser permeates the room very quickly, almost tying our top pick overall, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MPV4738/?tag=ybdpetal-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smiley Daisy Hibiscus Diffuser</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we liked that the dōTERRA diffuser only turns on when water is inside and automatically turns off if the water is fully depleted, regardless of how much time is left on the preset timer. Preventing the diffuser from running dry should have a significant impact on the longevity of the dōTERRA diffuser.</p>
<h2 id="what-not-liked">What we didn’t like about the dōTERRA diffuser</h2>
<p>Almost all of the essential oil diffusers we tested came with a small water pitcher which could be used to fill the essential oil diffuser. Notably, the dōTERRA diffuser did not come with a water pitcher included.</p>
<p>While this certainly isn’t a dealbreaker, we found it to be considerably more convenient to fill up diffusers with a water pitcher included, since the pitchers were usually sized to perfectly fill the water reservoir.</p>
<p>Another thing we didn’t like about the dōTERRA diffuser was that it produces less vapor than our top pick, the Hibiscus diffuser. Based on our calculations, the dōTERRA Petal diffuser produces about 37.5 milliliters of vapor per hour, while the Hibiscus diffuser produces between 50 and 58 milliliters per hour.</p>
<p>Finally, the dōTERRA diffuser is more expensive than most of the other essential oil diffusers on the market, including the Hibiscus diffuser. While the price is by no means excessive, we still had to take it into account when comparing units.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-better">Is there a better essential oil diffuser on the market?</h2>

<p>The dōTERRA Petal diffuser is an excellent product overall, and we are confident in recommending it to anyone who is looking to buy an essential oil diffuser. That being said, the Petal diffuser does perform slightly worse and is more expensive than our overall pick, the Smiley Daisy Hibiscus diffuser.</p>

<p>The dōTERRA diffuser also stands out for its compact footprint, which is significantly smaller than the Hibiscus diffuser. If you are working with limited space, the dōTERRA diffuser is an even more compelling option.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for an all-day essential oil diffuser, the dōTERRA Petal might fall a bit short as well. With a maximum run time of only four hours, you’ll have to replace the water and essential oil at least once or twice to make it through an entire day.</p>
<p>If you want an essential oil diffuser that can last all day, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VKER63E/?tag=ybdpetal-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pure Enrichment PureSpa Deluxe</a> was our top pick for all-day essential oil diffusing. In our testing, the PureSpa lasted between eight and 10 hours. This means that the PureSpa should last for all (or most) of a full work day and should even last all night if you turn it on before going to sleep.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if you are looking for a high-quality diffuser that will match the decor in almost any home or business, the dōTERRA diffuser is worthy of your consideration. However, depending on your preferences, there are other options that might be a better fit.</p>
<h2>Should you buy the dōTERRA essential oil diffuser?</h2>
<p>If you are in the market for an essential oil diffuser &#8212; and are comfortable with the $60 price of of the dōTERRA <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NZFGLHS/?tag=ybdpetal-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Petal diffuser</a> &#8212; you can buy confidently with the knowledge that the dōTERRA diffuser is well-made and is effective in living rooms as well as in more highly trafficked offices.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[The NutriBullet comes with a ton of hype, but for the most part, it delivers. It took first in our test of the best personal blenders.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e researched and tested six of the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-personal-blender/">best personal blenders</a>. After logging 40+ hours putting our contenders through the grinder, we’re confident the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0163K1Z3G/?tag=ybdnbpro-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NutriBullet Pro 900 Series</a> is the best personal blender on the market. It combines impressive blending power, affordable cost and perhaps most importantly, fun, in one exquisite and effective package.</p>
<p>The marketing campaign of the NutriBullet claims that it can revolutionize your health. We’re not quite as certain about that, but if you look at the NutriBullet only as a personal blender, it’s amazing. And due to that, said amazement may drive you to make smoothies more&#8230; which may directly impact your health. So, there may be something to it&#8230; but it’s on you to get there.</p>
<p>Unlike other reviews, we not only took a look at the NutriBullet Pro 900 Series in isolation, but also<br />
compared it to the other high-rated blenders in order to decide it’s the best choice for most smoothie aficionados.</p>

<h2 id="standalone">The NutriBullet as a standalone</h2>
<p>Before jumping into how the NutriBullet compares, let’s first just talk about the NutriBullet inside and out. Before coming across the product, I had been using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-51101BA-Personal-Blender/dp/B00KVZ27UA/?tag=ybdnbpro-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach’s cheaper personal blender</a> for 18 months plus. It did the job, but pretty much that only. Upon opening and using the NutriBullet for the first time, I realized what I had been missing.</p>
<p>First, the helpful recipes and how-to guide NutriBullet includes immediately sparked me to order healthy accompaniments to my previously boring fruit-and-protein only mixes of the past 18 months. Without doing anything, I was inspired by the NutriBullet to make nutrient balanced smoothies that not only tasted better, but were better for me, too.</p>
<p>Next, after using the NutriBullet for the first time, I realized the next step of enjoyment &#8212; blending. The NutriBullet’s 1.2 horsepower motor tore through the ice, frozen fruit, and protein powder I included, delivering a delicious smoothie in record time.</p>

    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/NutriBullet_animated.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Once you’re done blending, the 32 ounce top is easily removable, allowing you to enjoy the bullet on the go. And when you’re done, cleaning is a cinch, too, as the blender cup and motor are separate… unlike many other blenders.</p>
<p>At just under $100, it’s a high priced blender. But it delivers similar quality to blenders two and three times its cost, such as the Vitamix S30, which <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/nutribullet-vs-vitamix/">we tested it against</a>. And after pairing it against options in the $30 range, we realized it’s worth the price jump.</p>
<h2 id="other-blenders">The NutriBullet Pro 900 vs. other blenders</h2>

<p>We tested the NutriBullet Pro 900 against six other products over 40+ hours in our test of the best single-serve blenders. In doing so, it won on almost every metric tested.</p>
<p>We blended an identical list of ingredients on each blender: four ice cubes, one cup mixed frozen fruit, ¼ cup oats, ⅓ cup protein powder, seven almonds, and 1 ½ cup almond milk, and then tested the time to even blend.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1091" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-1.png" alt="blender-time" width="880" height="609" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-1.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-1-610x422.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-1-360x249.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-1-375x260.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-1-414x287.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-1-295x204.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-1-180x125.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-time-1-320x221.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The NutriBullet beat the group average by almost 50 seconds and the next best competitor by 18. There’s no doubt, the 900-watt NutriBullet motor gives it a significant edge in terms of processing power.</p>
<p>After that, we compared blenders across several important attributes. Ease of cleaning, cup size (if you wa a lunch, not just a snack), opening circumference (to make it easy to make shakes and not spill over your counter), and noise.</p>
<p>The NutriBullet won or broke even on pretty much all of them, showing it as a leader amongst the group as a blending option. Click the image below to see it full size.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1160 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-chart-nutribullet.png" alt="blender-chart-nutribullet" width="1000" height="521" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-chart-nutribullet.png 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-chart-nutribullet-610x318.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-chart-nutribullet-885x461.png 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-chart-nutribullet-360x188.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-chart-nutribullet-375x195.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-chart-nutribullet-414x216.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-chart-nutribullet-295x154.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-chart-nutribullet-180x94.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blender-chart-nutribullet-320x167.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>If there are any faults to the NutriBullet, the warranty is one that comes up. Ideally, it would have longer than a 12 month warranty, and its expensive counterpart, the Vitamix S30, features a five-year guarantee.</p>
<p>The NutriBullet has occasionally received some negative reviews about breaking down, but after testing similar models (that also broke down), it doesn’t seem out of line with the industry standard.</p>
<p>Also, as a blender, it has great efficiency as a personal or single-serve option. However, if you’re looking for a blender that blends smoothies for your entire family, you might find the 32 ounce max lacking.</p>
<p>It also comes with a 24 ounce top as a supplement, but it doesn’t come with a big mixer you can pour out to everyone in your family of five. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-S30-Personal-Blender-Black/dp/B00JS8S2IC/?tag=ybdnbpro-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Vitamix S30 is a better option</a> in that case, offering a 40-ounce blender for bigger meals.</p>

<p>There are several great models in the sub-$30 price point, such as the <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/BLACK-DECKER-Fusionblade-Personal-Blender-Red-PB1002R/39791213" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker</a>, our pick for the best model in that range. The Black+Decker has a 275 watt motor and is definitely effective for efficient blending… so if you’re on the fence or unable to spend almost $100 on a blender, that’s a great pick.</p>
<p>The main difference between the Black+Decker and the NutriBullet is the pure power of the bullet, and also subtle improvements in cleaning ability and cup size. The Black+Decker also has a two year warranty despite a much lower price point.</p>
<p>The Black+Decker will blend your smoothies. The NutriBullet Pro 900 will blend your smoothies in seconds and inspire you to make more while doing it.</p>
<p>And as mentioned previously, you might have a large family and want more blending room out of your blender. Or you might want more features &#8212; the S30, for example, offers blending speeds and a pulse option the NutriBullet does not. You’ll most certainly need to pay more to get there, though.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a personal blender and have a couple bucks to spend, the NutriBullet Pro is a worthy investment. You’ll make more smoothies in less time, get inspired to make better ones, and overall, probably come away as a slightly healthier person.</p>
<p>If the budget’s tight and you’re confident in your own self-motivation, the Black+Decker Fusion Blade is an awesome pick, too. And if your family demands non-stop smoothies, consider the Vitamix S30 for maximum versatility and reliability.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[No water filter pitcher is better at removing all unsafe solids than the ZeroWater pitcher. However, it still came in second in our overall rankings due to slow filter time and average taste.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ith more than 30 hours spent testing water filters in our office, we came to the conclusion that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0073PZ6O0/?tag=ybdzwsolo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater &#8211; 10-Cup Pitcher</a> is the <em>best</em> water filter pitcher for those who are interested in having the safest and purest water available in the water pitcher market. For those who don’t want to go through the hassle and expense of installing a reverse-osmosis system in their kitchen, ZeroWater filters are the next best thing.</p>
<p><strong>During our testing, we found that</strong> <b>ZeroWater filters differ from every other filter on the market</b>. Unlike filters from brands like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004GNGID0/?tag=ybdzwsolo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita</a> and PUR, ZeroWater filters actually deionize the water, leaving it almost completely devoid of all inorganic matter, including heavy metals like lead and chromium.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that other water filters, like Brita, PUR, and MAVEA also remove heavy metals. However, according to authoritative sources like the Water Quality Association and <a href="http://info.nsf.org/Certified/DWTU/Listings.asp?Company=1K760&amp;Standard=053">NSF International</a>, ZeroWater is more effective at removing these elements than any other filter.</p>
<p>You can take a look at our full <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">review of the best water filter pitchers here.</a></p>

<h2 id="why-important">Why filtering water is so important</h2>
<p>Some might think that using a water filter is an unnecessary luxury, and that municipal tap water is more than sufficient. After all, municipalities claim that tap water is safe to drink, so is a second stage of filtration really necessary?</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that there are a significant number of benefits associated with using a water filter on your tap water.</p>
<p>First and foremost, it’s true that tap water in <i>most</i> &#8212; <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/24/health/flint-water-lead-cdc-report/">but not all</a> &#8212; municipalities is safe to drink when it leaves the treatment plant. <b>However, tap water travelling through (often aging) pipes can pick up </b><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/tips/water.htm"><b>unsafe levels of lead</b></a><b> and other unhealthy metals</b><strong> &#8212; particularly when the water is sitting in those pipes for an extended period of time.</strong></p>
<p>It’s also true that using a water filter pitcher, such as the ZeroWater filter, is not the <i>only</i> way to filter tap water. However, it is more affordable than expensive filtration installations, such as a reverse-osmosis system. It is also more effective than using filters installed directly onto a faucet.</p>
<p>In terms of convenience, a portable water filter pitcher that fits on your refrigerator shelf and is able to filter water comparably to a reverse-osmosis system is certainly one of the most compelling options currently on the market</p>
<h3>Finding the best water filter</h3>
<p>During our research, we found that there were three primary factors which should weigh most heavily on your choice of water filter:</p>
<p>The <b>water quality produced </b>by the filter is arguably the most important consideration when choosing a water filter pitcher. After all, filtering out harmful materials is the fundamental reason for purchasing a water filter pitcher &#8212; so it should do that job effectively.</p>
<p>The <b>ergonomics of the pitcher</b> are important as well. More specifically, a water pitcher should be easy to hold and carry, and the lid should fit snugly so that pre-filtered water doesn’t spill out when carrying the pitcher from the sink back to the refrigerator.</p>
<p>Finally, the <b>water should taste “good”</b>. Taste is largely an individual preference, however at the very least your filtered water should taste clean. The removal of chlorine and other metals can contribute significantly to water taste.</p>
<p>Some would say that the amount of time a filter takes to filter water matters as well. Ultimately, we think this should be a fairly minor consideration, since you’ll typically already have the pitcher filled with water when it’s actually time to drink.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-different">What makes ZeroWater filters different</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-924" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1.png" alt="TDS total dissolved solids ZeroWater reading" width="880" height="608" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1-610x421.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1-360x249.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1-375x259.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1-414x286.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1-295x204.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1-180x124.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TDS-reading-1-320x221.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The ZeroWater filter works differently than the other water filters you can buy. For the most part, water filter pitchers use activated carbon and an ion-exchange resin, which causes contaminants like chlorine and metals to attach to the filter &#8212; allowing purified water to flow through.</p>
<p>ZeroWater is different because it utilizes a 5-stage filtering process, which includes an ion exchange stage and activated carbon stage. <b>Ultimately, ZeroWater filters produce water that is almost entirely devoid of harmful contamin</b><strong>ants, and produces water similar to the water produced by a reverse osmosis or distillation process.</strong></p>
<h2 id="what-we-liked">What we liked about the ZeroWater pitcher</h2>
<p>There were a lot of things we really liked about the ZeroWater filter. For starters, ZeroWater is so confident in their ability to remove <i>all</i> dissolved solids that they include a total dissolved solids (TDS) meter with the pitcher itself. And yes, it <i>does</i> read “000”.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-923 size-large" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ZeroWater_TDS03-1024x683.jpg" alt="ZeroWater TDS Reading 000" width="1024" height="683" /></p>
<p><b>We also like the fact that the filters don’t need to be presoaked before they are ready to g</b><strong>o &#8212; a notable advantage over several of the other leading brands.</strong></p>
<p>The ZeroWater pitcher is also quite ergonomic. In addition to being easy to hold, there is a spout on the bottom of the pitcher, which makes it easy to pour water into a cup without taking the entire pitcher out of the refrigerator.</p>
<p>ZeroWater also helps reduce the environmental impact of their filters by offing a recycling and rebate program. While speaking with the CEO of ZeroWater, Doug Kallam, he told us that the filters are able to be completely recycled and recharged, which means essentially nothing ends up in a landfill.</p>
<p>In addition to processing the recycling of their filters, ZeroWater also offers a <a href="http://www.zerowater.com/docs/ZeroWaterRecycling.pdf">$10 rebate coupon</a> for every two filters that are mailed back to them. This is primarily to offset the cost of shipping, however there should be a few dollars leftover to help buy your next batch of filters too.</p>
<p>ZeroWater also occasionally offers discounts to their customers, so make sure to subscribe to their mailing list if you’re interested in getting a better price on your ZeroWater filters.</p>
<h3>ZeroWater’s place in the market</h3>
<p>While conducting our research to determine the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">best overall water filter pitcher on the market</a>, we had an in-depth conversation with the CEO of ZeroWater, Doug Kallam. He explained to us that ZeroWater is by no means the largest company in the water filter market, nor do they wish to be.</p>
<p>Doug explained that the water filters used by ZeroWater are more complex and, by their very nature, more expensive to produce than water filters from other brands. He explained that ZeroWater’s goal is to provide the best quality water for the sub-segment of the market whose biggest priority is water quality, and <i>not</i> cost or speed of filtration.</p>
<p>In that sense, ZeroWater has been successful, and is the 2nd largest pour-through water filter brand in the market, behind only Brita.</p>
<h3>How long do ZeroWater filters last</h3>
<p>Like most of the major brands of water filters, ZeroWater is certified by <a href="http://info.nsf.org/Certified/DWTU/Listings.asp?Company=1K760&amp;Standard=042">NSF International</a> to remove inorganic matter, metals, pesticides, and volatile organic compounds. <strong>One downside to the ZeroWater filter is the fact that, because it filters water so effectively, </strong><strong>the filters themselves can be used up more quickly than other filters &#8212; further increasing the cost to use ZeroWater filters.</strong></p>
<p>ZeroWater filters are rated to remove 18,000 milligrams of dissolved solids before needing to be replaced. This means that the quantity of dissolved solids in your local tap water will have a <i>dramatic</i> impact on the amount of water that can be filtered.</p>
<p>According to ZeroWater, most consumers in the United States will be able to filter between 25 to 40 gallons of water per filter, assuming that the total dissolved solids (TDS) in their tap water falls between the typical range of 51-200.</p>
<p>ZeroWater also says that municipalities that have particularly high TDS &#8212; specifically 500 or higher &#8212; will notice that their ZeroWater filters will filter significantly less water before needing to be replaced.</p>
<p>We tested our ZeroWater filter using San Diego tap, which had a typical reading right around 480. Despite ZeroWater’s warnings, we were actually able to get between 15 and 20 gallons per filter. Of course, your mileage may vary.</p>
<h2 id="compare-to-others">How do ZeroWater pitchers compare to others?</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-918" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Water-Filters_Equipment-1024x683.jpg" alt="ZeroWater in front of other water filter pitchers" width="1024" height="683" /></p>
<p>Overall, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0073PZ6O0/?tag=ybdzwsolo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZeroWater 10-Cup Pitcher</a> compares very favorably when compared to other water filters on the market. While you will pay more (and wait longer) for each cup of water, the quality is simply unparalleled.</p>
<h3>ZeroWater vs Brita</h3>
<p><b>In our testing, ZeroWater clearly beat Brita</b>. However, there is a reason that Brita has the lion’s share of the water filter market. In addition to being in the North American market for nearly three decades, Brita also offers one of the least expensive filters that also happens to be one of the fastest to filter water.</p>
<p>In fact, of the five water filters we tested, Brita was the fastest:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter.png" alt="how long to filter water" width="880" height="590" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter.png 880w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-610x409.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-360x241.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-375x251.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-414x278.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-295x198.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-180x121.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-long-to-filter-320x215.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>If you want the least expensive water filter that is also quick to filter water, you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004SU18/?tag=ybdzwsolo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">give Brita a shot</a>. Otherwise, consider a different option.</p>
<h3>ZeroWater vs PUR</h3>
<p>We were surprisingly disappointed by the PUR water filter during our testing. Water filtered through the PUR filters we tested took <i>significantly</i> longer than the other filters to test.</p>
<p>The taste of the water was polarizing as well. While some people like the way PUR water tastes, most in our tests simply didn’t.</p>
<h3>ZeroWater vs MAVEA</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002U50QQQ/?tag=ybdzwsolo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MAVEA Elemaris 9-Cup Water Filtration Filter</a> was the only pitcher that we felt beat out ZeroWater. While the ZeroWater filter does filter out a greater number of dissolved solids, we felt that the MAVEA pitcher was slightly better overall.</p>
<p>The ergonomics of the MAVEA pitcher and the affordability of the replacement filters (which also have a recycling program) were among the reasons we picked MAVEA as a better overall pick.</p>
<p>That being said, if you want the purest water, ZeroWater is still the way to go.</p>
<h2 id="should-you-buy">Should you buy a ZeroWater pitcher?</h2>
<p>Even the CEO of ZeroWater admits that ZeroWater is not for everyone.
