					<description><![CDATA[All of these “best of the” article avoid discussing the elephant in the room - the most common failure of hand blenders and its cause:  the internal drive shaft’s connection gear that engages the motor.  If this connection gear is made of anything other than stainless steel, it’s just a matter of time until it will fail.   

If the author only did more research by scouting the reviews on Amazon and quantifying the reviews, this problem becomes obvious and would have then become one of, if not the most, important factor in determining the ranking.    

It is really disappointing that no article makes mention of this.  If the author really had these blenders physically with him, he could have easily checked each blender’s internal shaft.]]></description>
