					<description><![CDATA[For the accuracy of these thermometers, check out the charts for freezing and boiling water temperature accuracy. For speed of reading, compare the times to read on the chart at the top of the testing section.
Tor roasting these thermometers are all accurate enough, but we actually checked them with roasted chicken recipes to see if that translated to easy use in real-world kitchen scenarios. (You&#039;re right that the times don&#039;t prove much, but we wanted to record all the test details for posterity.) 
It would be nice if there were always a concrete tests that could &quot;prove&quot; the superiority of one product over the others; but it&#039;s usually a lot more complex than that. We hope that the data we&#039;ve provided and the impressions from real-world cooking tests can help steer you to a thermometer that will work for you, even if the Javelin Pro or the Taylor aren&#039;t what you want.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not understanding the different times it took for the in oven ones to come to temperature in the chicken. Were they chickens much different sizes? If it took one of them an hour and twenty minutes to get to 174 and the other 2 an hour and 30-35 minutes to reach only 165 then either something is inaccurate or the chickens were completely different sizes, in which case I wouldn&#039;t see the point in listing how long it took without the size of the chicken. Could you please verify...I am making a large prime rib for Christmas and accuracy is really the most important.]]></description>
