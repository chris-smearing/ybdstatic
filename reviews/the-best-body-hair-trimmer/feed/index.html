					<description><![CDATA[Hi Raunak,
Vega doesn&#039;t have much distribution here in the US, so this is the first I&#039;ve heard of them. Hopefully our description of important features can still help you figure out if they&#039;re giving you what you need. If you find a trimmer that you really like, we&#039;d love to see a follow-up comment!]]></description>

we&#039;re working on reviews of hair clippers and beard trimmers that will include products from barber-oriented companies like Andis and Wahl. 
For body hair trimming, we&#039;ve found the larger trimmers too big to be convenient, though they&#039;re definitely powerful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve used the Bodygroom Pro but sometimes it nicked skin in the sensible areas. The Bodygroom series 1000 has 2 heads that trim at 0.5 mm and 3 mm. I use the 0.5 mm on the sensible areas and don&#039;t have any nicks and it trims very close(like a 1 day of stubble).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Alex, we looked into the Delicates Trimmer but it seems like that&#039;s only distributed in Europe. Reviews on it looked mixed, so not sure it would have even made our finalists: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Remington-BHT250-Delicates-Body-Trimmer/dp/B00OCG085U

The Bodygroom Series 1000 is the lowest-end model in the Bodygroom Series. It doesn&#039;t have a pivoting head and doesn&#039;t seem ideal for chest hair, which is the main reason we didn&#039;t test it in our group as an overall option. However, given the quality of the other Bodygroom model we tested, if that&#039;s not a need of yours, it seems like an attractive option at a much cheaper price.]]></description>
