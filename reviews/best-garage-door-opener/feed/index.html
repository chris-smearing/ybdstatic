					<description><![CDATA[I replaced my Chamberlain/Liftmaster with Sommer for one simple reason: Sommer is built like a tank with all metal drive parts.  Chamberlain/Liftmaster still rely on plastic drive parts, which is the reason I had to replace my Chamberlain/Liftmaster openers.  Current price premium of $50 for the Sommer is more than fine, especially if you don&#039;t to replace.  I paired with the Sommer external keypad, which is also built like a tank being a chunk of aluminum, and the gogogate2.


I agree, the manual can be difficult, but I didn&#039;t use it.  Sommer posted an easy to follow installation video.  Supposed to install with two people to make things easier, but I installed both garage doors alone, so it is an easy setup.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi! 
Liftmaster openers are made by Chamberlain, so if you&#039;re looking at the same features they&#039;re identical. The closest equivalent to the package we tested would be the 8365W-267, except that it&#039;s a chain drive. (Liftmaster belt-driven units don&#039;t include the keypad and spare remote.)

Chamberlain/Liftmaster/Craftsman are solid and reliable, just make sure you get a package with the accessories you want. The B550 on Amazon is a great price for a Wi-Fi-enabled model, but if you don&#039;t need that then the Home Depot link above is usually $10-$20 cheaper.]]></description>
