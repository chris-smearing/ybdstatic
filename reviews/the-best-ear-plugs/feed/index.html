					<description><![CDATA[Andrew, high frequency sounds are the easiest to block so any of these picks should work well! (Probably best to stay away from musician-targeted earplugs, since that&#039;s the opposite application.)
At a given sound pressure (&quot;volume&quot;) level, the lower the frequency, the more energy is moving with the pressure waves. So even cotton balls will do a pretty good job taking the edge off high-frequency sound at 70dB; you should definitely invest in plugs that you&#039;ll like wearing all day, though.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you! I’ll try them. I did get the Bose noise-cancelling headphones for the plane, but I’d still like something for sleeping.

Oh my, you have to get 200 of them at Amazon! A bit excessive for one trip. The only other source they list are industrial businesses--so they must be good, eh?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’ve tried many and read many reviews. I think there must be variation in effectiveness. I’ve never found much relief from any earplugs and find them all uncomfortable, even painful. I have very small ears (ear canals) and am wondering if there are any that come in sizes--for children maybe? 

On Amazon, opionions are all over. Some say the earplugs are nearly miraculousin creating silence, others say the “help”. I have found that some noises are even worse with earplugs in--motel refrigerators for example. I’m going to try noise-cancelling earbuds for my next (10 hr) flight.]]></description>
