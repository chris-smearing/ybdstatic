					<description><![CDATA[Anything made out of stainless steel isn&#039;t a &quot;stone&quot; -- they should be called &quot;whisky steels&quot;.

As to the actual stones, I&#039;m a little shocked to find that they&#039;re being made of soapstone.  Besides being a notoriously soft stone, likely to crumbling around the edges and leaving sand in your drink, OSHA has deemed the material &quot;immediately dangerous to life and health&quot;, and the CDC has listed it&#039;s primary component -- talc -- as a suspected carcinogen.  Why not use something like greywacke, a much more durable and stable mineral, which has been used for centuries as brewing stone?
But the real bottom line is, why use anything in the glass at all?  If you want your Scotch chilled, keep it in a wine cooler for a few hours before serving,  It&#039;s easy to keep it at 50ºF (you don&#039;t want it much colder than that anyway), without adding any foreign substances to the glass.

And a small wine cooler can be had for the cost of a couple of sets of high-end stones.]]></description>
