					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment!
I saw the TBS Maca Root cream recently, and it does look like a great deal and very protective. (I lathered a sample, but haven&#039;t shaved with it.) Too bad it only comes in one scent!
I&#039;ll definitely try to get that product in if we find a way to re-run these tests with users who know how to use shaving brushes. Hopefully we can do a soap review some day, too, though that&#039;s another can of worms entirely... There are just too many good shaving products out there!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article. Lots of good information here.  I used Edge Gel for many years prior to discovering Traditional Wetshaving.  I like to use a pump of KMF Unscented over VDH Soap for a &quot;Superlather,&quot; as Mantic59 calls it.    I will have to try TOBS, as that price point is not too bad.  CO BIgelow was my first traditional cream, and it lathers wonderfully.  I also used to use JM Fraser&#039;s Original which was a bargain for the amount, and it has been made in Canada since the 1950&#039;s.  My all time favorite is The Body Shop Maca Root Shaving Cream which is available at shopping malls in any major city.]]></description>
