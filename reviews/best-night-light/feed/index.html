					<description><![CDATA[Me and my wife spent a lot of time to find the right night lamp for our baby room. We found really great deal on amazon it’s called “ledgloriole”. Very nice decor lamp with touch button so you can change the brightness. By the way it doesn’t have a bulb inside, only a small led lamps which you never have to change. Baby loves it also we can always use it when watching TV. It’s not advertising just recommendation because I know how hard to find the right quality lamp.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for directing me to this product.  I like that it has a motion detector activation and it has red spectrum.  The smart phone part is not really essential though.  I just need a red spectrum motion activated night light without bells and whistles.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I personally think people should sleep in darkness. However with small children needing to go pee in the middle of the night I would want a nightlight that comes on when they get out of their bed that is red spectrum and goes off after they get back into bed or leave the room.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My goodness. what a horrible review. As a product designer who has done many night lights and invented my own smart night light called Aumi.. this &quot;round&quot; up is seriously lacking. 
check out the Aumi smart night light. waaaaaay better than all of these.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Cecil, it kind of depends on how you&#039;ll use it. Some places in the house will always be too dark for the light sensor so the light will always remain on. The motion sensor could be a better fit in those cases. In places where natural light will reach it though, it can be nice to have a light that turns on/off automatically even if the cost to run these is very little.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great round up! My toddler recently started being fearful at bedtime and I&#039;ll soon need a nightlight for changing newborn diapers, so this was very helpful.

I don&#039;t know if you&#039;d consider them nightlights, (they only stay on for 45 minutes) but the Cloud B constellation animals are super popular with kids. Most people opt for the Twilight Turtle, but it uses blue/green/amber lights. The ladybug and some of the mini animals have a red option. It&#039;s the only thing that got my toddler sleeping again so I thought it was worth mentioning for any other desperate parents out there!]]></description>
