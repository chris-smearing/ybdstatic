					<description><![CDATA[The KeyRinger XL works with a two-device system: One you keep on your keys, the other you keep in a place you&#039;ll always be able to find it. If you lose your keys, the device you still have will send out a loud, high-pitched sound that the other half is always listening for, and it&#039;ll &quot;call back&quot; with its own sound so you can locate it. 
If the screeching sound isn&#039;t a no-go, it&#039;s a system that works very well within a house. It also chirps (like a smoke alarm) when it&#039;s time for a new CR2032 (coin-cell) battery.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am looking for something for my elderly mom who is now dealing with declining memory loss. Neither of my parents have a smart phone.So this means I have to look at the ones with transmitters, right? If I put the app on MY phone, that won&#039;t work, because that means the tracker is by nature blue tooth activated (I live 30 miles from them). Am I thinking this thru correctly? I like the idea of the app to see where the wallet or keys were last noted, but....Any help is appreciated!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great question! Tile designs their program around product replacement (a huge discount on a mail-in, and supposedly an easy swap-out in store at Best Buy) but we&#039;ll reach out to them about what your options are for batteries that die early.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The reviews on Amazon are dreadful for the Tile. Generally, they say that the finders work pretty well....for a couple of months. Then they die, even though the company promises a year of working. I went to Amazon to order, but when I read the reviews I looked for stories such as these that rate the finders, but nobody seems to look at whether these things actually last. Do you think you could test that aspect?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t waste your money on the tile. We bought five fro the family. All were &quot;pre activated&quot;, none of the tile applications loaded properly on the iphones we have and there is no real support for these things. 
I will live with lost keys and just find them like I used to. Waste of time.]]></description>
