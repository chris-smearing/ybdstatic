					<description><![CDATA[These single-cup brewers are perfect for people who are too lazy to use a conventional coffee or tea maker. The negative environmental impact of all that non-recyclable plastic is enormous. If you would care to look into the scientific literature that shows how the oceans are being polluted at astounding levels by plastics introduced into the waste stream you would not buy something as stupid as one of these machines.]]></description>
