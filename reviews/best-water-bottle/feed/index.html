					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your note, Megan! We&#039;re working on an update and it looks like the Polar Bottle is going to be a good alternative. It&#039;s a push-pull valve, not as easy to sip from as the Camelbak, but should be leak-proof for a long time: https://amzn.to/2SDugRS]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One thing to consider for sports water bottles is ability to drink a large amount of water quickly- compressibility of the bottle to allow both mouth suction and manual squeeze to assist in 2 big gulps rather than 5 small ones which require air /water exchange between sips which is time-consuming and throws off your breathing if you are in the middle of an intense spin class or if your son has 2 seconds to grab a swig during a soccer game. Camelbak makes a great one (podium chill insulated) with a twist open / close spout.  Occasional leaks from the screw top but o/w great. I was hoping you could recommend a bottle with the same squeezability but less leakage.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I picked up a SOMA water bottle a few months back, I should have found this article then! It might not have as good as insulation as these, but it sure looks nicer :)
