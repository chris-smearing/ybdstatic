					<description><![CDATA[I found this article very helpful.  I&#039;ve been doing a lot of research on laundry detergent and you provided so much information, all in one place, that answered multiple questions that I was having a hard time finding answers to.  LOVED it!  All the tables comparing each detergent on price, pH, etc. were great.  I don&#039;t know how you could have done a better job.  :-).]]></description>
