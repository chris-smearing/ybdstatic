					<description><![CDATA[Just got a reply from the guy who took it after the review: it&#039;s 15&quot; according to the Apple measurement app, so give or take a half-inch. I hope that helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m curious about the height you list for the OXO-- their website lists it at about 17&quot; and here it&#039;s listed as 15&quot;... Which is a big deal for me, since 15&quot; will slide comfortably in and out for use underneath my cabinets, but 17&quot; will not... Can I get a confirmation? Thanks! Love the in-depth review!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rich, thanks for the comment! 
ZeroWater&#039;s system uses the same filtration technology that car detailers use for spot-free rinses. There&#039;s definitely a markup to get it in a convenient countertop pitcher, but if you want to get minerals out there&#039;s nothing else like it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Raunak,
Vega doesn&#039;t have much distribution here in the US, so this is the first I&#039;ve heard of them. Hopefully our description of important features can still help you figure out if they&#039;re giving you what you need. If you find a trimmer that you really like, we&#039;d love to see a follow-up comment!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Michelle, 
YoungLiving and DoTerra do a great job of convincing people that they&#039;re worth the extra money, and the fact that you develop a relationship with your local &quot;independent distributor&quot; isn&#039;t a small part of the good will. If you&#039;re turned off by MLM, of course, it has the opposite effect. 

We had to choose, and our writer chose not to include MLMs.

Having participated in the organic certification process for an avocado grove, I understand your skepticism about sustainability:  there are loopholes. But, there are always loopholes. 

At the end of the day we have to trust that these essentials are what the manufacturers say they are; GCMS testing is basically the only way to verify that the oils contain the expected active compounds (and not synthetics), so we were careful to collect data on how frequently these distributors test. We have to trust the distributors, the distributors have to trust the processors, and the processors have to trust the farmers, and the farmers have to trust and care about the plants and methods that they make their livelihood from.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The KeyRinger XL works with a two-device system: One you keep on your keys, the other you keep in a place you&#039;ll always be able to find it. If you lose your keys, the device you still have will send out a loud, high-pitched sound that the other half is always listening for, and it&#039;ll &quot;call back&quot; with its own sound so you can locate it. 
If the screeching sound isn&#039;t a no-go, it&#039;s a system that works very well within a house. It also chirps (like a smoke alarm) when it&#039;s time for a new CR2032 (coin-cell) battery.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While this article has lots of interesting details in points about the importance of how you use essential oils, the information about do terra and young living is false.  Young living has specific oils that are listed as  ingestible and they market them that way.  Also they make a big deal about being FDA compliant and not claiming to heal or fix any pathologies, only support your body so it can do what it&#039;s supposed to do. I&#039;ve used young living for years and they&#039;re pretty much the only company I would trust and I have tried some of these other oils on your list , organic is not  Always the best. The seed to seal guarantee from young  living is what pushed me over the edge to choose them over the others I researched. They encourage their customers to take part in harvest for some of their larger farms, they are extremely transparent when it comes to origin and the care taken from the planting of the seed come out the time of year it&#039;s planted, when it&#039;s cultivated,  And I could say  20 other things about them that put them in the front of the oily industry. This review that you have is based on what things smell like for crying out loud, and whether something&#039;s organic or not. Being sustainable is more important to me than being organic, so you are not depleting the wild. Lavender is grossly over harvested for example . I want a company who is involved in the entire process from the seed to the sealing of the oil,  Is transparent and honest about origin, and encourages teaching and education about the products which YL is awesome about. So my point being yl should be on this list,  They use the word therapeutic grade because it is.  Anti microbial and anti bacterial  are therapeutic results from using oils.  I can&#039;t say, take  Oregano To cure that sinus infection, but I can say take oregeno to support your body&#039;s natural defenses and help kill the infection. 
 Knowledge is power , so be informed when buying oils that is all but make sure the information you&#039;re getting is properly researched and there are quantifiable ways to back it up.]]></description>
