<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>Our tester, like many who witnessed the heady days of unreliable technological advancement in the 1980s, is skeptical of electronic stud finders. Early stud finders he used were frustrating, to say the least.</p>
<p>We assessed how far the world of electronic stud finding has come by talking to contractors as well as checking internet discussion on the subject. While most grizzled veterans of kitchen cabinet installation projects will tell you a dozen tricks they think are more accurate than electronic stud finders, there are a few sheepish pros and DIY types who will admit to finding better stud finders and being happy with the accuracy.</p>
<p>After checking both reviews from Wirecutter, This Old House and Popular Mechanics, we looked for YouTube reviews of our top picks and confirmed we had found the latest models with the top features.</p>
<p>After checking retailer review scores, we bought the top six electronic scanners that either met a budget of $30 or $70, with higher expectations like electrical and metal scanning from the more expensive group.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve used rare-earth magnets to find studs around the office before, but we bought the highest-rated magnetic stud finders in order to see if the extra features they include really make them better stud finders. An entire package of <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Magcraft-Rare-Earth-1-4-in-x-1-in-Rod-Magnet-6-Pack-NSN0719/204721325" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">big neodymium magnets</a> can often be had for the same price or less.</p>

<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Electronic vs magnetic stud finders: </b>Magnets don&#8217;t stick to wooden studs, but they do stick to the screws that hold your wall up. An electronic stud finder will check for the density change from the actual stud anywhere along its height, while you may have to sweep a magnet back and forth over a large part of the wall before you find one of the screws.</p>
<p><b>Metal scan mode:</b> This mode will look for metallic objects in your wall, rather than wood. In most cases this will be a good way to double-check that you&#8217;ve found a stud by looking for drywall screws, but on an advanced stud finder like the Bosch &#8211; GMS120 you also get a determination if the metal is non-ferrous (like a copper pipe) rather than steel.</p>
<p><b>Deep scan mode:</b> When your wall is covered with lath and plaster or stucco this mode will help you find studs more accurately than a regular stud finder could.</p>
<p><b>Live circuit detection: </b>An electricity detection mode will tell you if you&#8217;ve got energized, un-armored electrical wires in a spot you intend to put a screw or nail.</p>
<p><b>Battery type:</b> most stud finders use a 9V battery type, but one brand we tested uses AA or AAA batteries, which are less expensive and more likely to be in your cupboard already. Rechargeable A-type batteries are also much more common and last longer than rechargeable 9V types.</p>
<p><b>Calibration mode:</b> Basic stud finders require you to start your search over a known-empty section of wall if you want to get accurate detection of studs, while more expensive devices automatically calibrate as you use them.</p>
<p><b>Stud marking features:</b> Holding the stud finder in your dominant hand can make it tricky to mark the center of a detected stud with a pencil. Zircon&#8217;s popular models include a pencil marker in the stud finder itself to make marking easier, while others design the body of the stud finder to facilitate precise marking when you find a center.</p>
<h2 id="how-to">How to use a stud finder</h2>
<p>There are a few key steps you need to understand before you&#8217;ll have success with most stud finders. Here are some details about stud finders you should know before you try to use one to mount a TV bracket or shelf.</p>
<h3>Calibration</h3>
<p>Most stud finders start with a calibration step: The sensor checks how dense your drywall is so that the device doesn&#8217;t give you false positives. Most devices do this calibration step on power-up when you hold down a button, so you need to hold the stud finder against your wall in a place where you&#8217;re pretty sure there is no stud. (About a foot away from a corner is usually a good place to try.)</p>
<p>If you get strange readings, like detected studs that are too close together or no studs at all, try calibrating in a different starting spot to see if you accidentally calibrated on top of an object inside the wall.</p>
<p>Better stud finders like the Zircon &#8211; MultiScanner and Bosch &#8211; GMS120 will automatically re-calibrate as you move around the wall, which makes them less likely to give false readings. Franklin Sensors scanners like the ProSensor T6 use a different method: These models have an array of sensors constantly checking against each other, which makes calibration unnecessary. None of the stud finders are fool-proof, though.</p>
<h3>Knowing what to expect</h3>
<p>Drywall installations use 48-inch-wide pieces, so a wall will almost always have studs evenly spaced inside that length. Sometimes you can even see the intersecting angles of different sheets or finishing lines if you look carefully at a large section of wall or shine a flashlight along it.</p>
<p>Studs are typically 16 inches apart, sometimes 24 inches apart and only rarely at any other spacing. You should look first at 16-inch intervals from the corner of the room; you can also check baseboards for nail marks that should indicate where the studs are.</p>
<p>Features like electrical outlets or light switches also show you stud locations, since they&#8217;re almost always nailed to a stud before wall surfaces go up.</p>
<p>In most rooms you should be able to use those facts and listen to the sound of a tap on the wall to figure out where most of your studs are, even without a stud finder. A stud finder can help confirm your guess before you make a hole, though.</p>
<h3>Sweeping the wall</h3>
<p>Standard practice is to start by calibrating your stud finder somewhere you don&#8217;t expect a stud and then move in a horizontal line across the place you need to find one.</p>
<p>As the stud finder approaches the edge of a stud, you&#8217;ll see an indicator that it detects a change in density. Mark this point with a pencil on a piece of masking tape or a post-it note.</p>
<p>As the stud finder crosses the stud, most will show you an indicator when you&#8217;re over the center. You should mark this point the same way you did the edge.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;re past the stud on the other side, come back around slightly higher or lower than your first line, and mark the other edge and get another reading of the center.</p>
<h3>Connect the dots</h3>
<p>After three passes you should be able to determine a precise stud center line by drawing a vertical line through your marks with a level for reference, but you can probably get it on the first try if you&#8217;re seeing clear readings. When you&#8217;re happy with the consistency of the marks you&#8217;ve made, you can measure and mark the exact height of the fastener you need to install.</p>
<p>After you finish finding all the anchor points you need for a project (or after you pick up <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-drywall-anchors">some drywall anchors</a> for holes you need where studs don&#8217;t line up) then you&#8217;re ready to make the final marks with a level and get out the screw gun or drill.</p>
<h3>Instant scans</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got an instant stud finder like the Franklin Sensors T6, you can skip all of the sweeping and just move the stud finder around until you see a clear three-light indicator that indicates the position and rough size of a stud.</p>
<h3>How to find a stud in a plaster wall</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25337" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Plaster-wall-2.jpg" alt="Test on a plaster wall" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>Lath-and-plaster wall surfaces are trickier than drywall. The surface itself is thicker and denser, so the sound of a hollow opening behind the wall isn&#8217;t as distinct when you tap on the wall. Plaster is also much less consistent than the perfectly-flat gyprock boards in newer construction.</p>
<p>Because the plaster and wood covering are denser and less even compared to drywall, you&#8217;ll need to use a stud finder with a deep scan mode that adjusts the output or sensitivity.</p>
<h3>The magnet trick</h3>
<p>Fortunately, even plaster wall surfaces still use metal fasteners holding them to the studs, so you can usually find studs with a <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Magcraft-Rare-Earth-1-4-in-x-1-in-Rod-Magnet-6-Pack-NSN0719/204721325" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">strong neodymium magnet</a> or a purpose-built magnetic stud finder like the Studbuddy.</p>
<p>Sweep in a zig-zag pattern up and down the wall until you find a single metal detection point, then look for other spaced-out points along a vertical line to confirm that it&#8217;s a stud with fasteners. From there you should be able to more quickly find the next stud locations by measuring 16 inches away.</p>
<h3>How to find a stud in the ceiling</h3>
<p>A ceiling is usually just drywall with a texture applied, and stud spacings are usually the same. There are a few tricky aspects to finding ceiling studs, though.</p>
<p>First is the fact that you&#8217;re working directly over your head. This can lead many people to lose their balance or even to feel vertigo. It&#8217;s important that you have a safe, steady platform or step ladder to stand on when you&#8217;re working on a ceiling.</p>
<p>Wearing eye protection is even more important than usual, since you&#8217;ll probably knock dust or ceiling texture into your face.</p>
<p>Another obstacle is that ceiling texture itself, lumpy &#8220;popcorn&#8221; texture especially. This stuff will make it very difficult to slide a stud finder back and forth across the surface of the ceiling. Using a piece of paper or thin cardboard can help, but unless you tape or tack the paper to the ceiling it can make the over-your-head one-hand sweeping motions into an ordeal.</p>
<p>A good deep scan mode helps make up for the extra gap created by the texture, but in our tests it was better calibration accuracy that made the biggest difference in eliminating false positives on a popcorn ceiling.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We used each of these devices to check for studs in four different areas with multiple passes. Most of those tests were behind half-inch drywall, including two checks in a wall we knew had a copper drain pipe and electrical wire inside. One test was on an exterior stucco wall with steel lath, and one more was on a ceiling with popcorn-type texture. We also did some follow-up checks on plaster walls after our depth and stucco tests returned surprising results.</p>
[table id=318 /]
<h3>Ease of use and speed</h3>
<p>We tested all of the stud finders to see how easy they were for untrained users to pick up and use. Factors like complicated calibration or scan-mode selection options resulted in docked points, while scanners that built confidence with quick, clear readings were given bonus points.</p>
[table id=317 /]
<h3>Depth test</h3>
<p>We also did a check for depth calibration using a piece of half-inch foam over the drywall to see what happens when walls are thicker than normal.</p>
<p>The air gap and stucco or plaster walls are the only tests we tried that foil the Franklin Sensors stud finders, while the other devices with deep scan modes passed these tests almost as easily as they did on a regular wall.</p>
<h3>Electrical wire detection test</h3>
<p>We tested the ability of these stud finders to see live circuits around live receptacles and switch boxes, and with an extension cord behind a mock-up testing wall.</p>
<p>All of the stud finders with live wire detection features were able to see an energized extension cord behind a piece of drywall. But in the walls in our tester&#8217;s home and office, live circuits didn&#8217;t trigger the device. That&#8217;s almost certainly because those wires are run through an armored jacket, which grounds out any electromagnetic field the device would be able to sense. Even a household circuit-breaker panel wasn&#8217;t enough for the stud finders to see through normal shielding.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a huge problem for most of us; building codes keep electrical wires away from the edge of a stud, and it&#8217;s pretty easy to tell if you do happen to screw something into an armored cable that the stud finder misses.</p>
<p>The live circuit detection feature is nice to have for the rare situations where it could save you from accidentally hammering or screwing into un-armored wire between studs in houses where you&#8217;ve only got bare Romex wire in the walls, but it&#8217;s not an essential feature.</p>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re using one of these sensors, you should always turn off circuits running through a wall you&#8217;re drilling into.</p>
<h2 id="best-drywall">Best on Drywall: Franklin Sensors &#8211; Prosensor T6</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25334" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/FranklinT6-solo.jpg" alt="Franklin Sensors - T6" width="2000" height="1333" /><br />
If you want an accurate picture of where studs are behind your drywall, but you don&#8217;t want to practice a methodical back-and-forth sweep to get it, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B071LF2BRY/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Franklin Sensors &#8211; Prosensor T6</a> is an inexpensive option that works flawlessly in drywall.</p>
<p>This is a different kind of electronic stud finder. Instead of using one or two sensors and telling you when the reading changes as you sweep the tool across the wall, Franklin designs their tools with more sensors that read a larger area simultaneously. The T6 covers a three-inch-wide section, compared to the seven-inch width of the more expensive T13.</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>The Prosensor T6 is a textbook definition of a measuring tool that&#8217;s very accurate but not at all precise. You don&#8217;t actually get a true center-line indicator, just three lines (with an inch in between) that wiggle back and forth a bit as you slide across a stud location. Even with wider or narrower objects we tested, the T6 is programmed to give you a vague one-inch &#8220;right here&#8221; indication rather than ever trying to show a precise outline.</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/T6-marking.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Since finding the precise center of a stud isn&#8217;t usually important, this process gives you exactly what you need, and quickly: If you get three lights, the center light is within a half-inch of a stud center, and you&#8217;ve got at least a half-inch of room beside it before the edge of the stud. If you slide the T6 one way or the other, the indicators will shift over to follow the stud, so if you mark the two &#8220;middle&#8221; lines you see you&#8217;ll have a very accurate target about a third of an inch wide.</p>
<p>Both the Franklin Sensors T6 and T13 show plenty of false-positive lights as you sweep over the wall, just like other stud finders; the difference with these &#8220;instant read&#8221; models is that when it can get a clear reading on a stud, you know for sure because of the telltale three lights that track as you move it slightly from side to side. On other models, you&#8217;d have to track a new sweep over the area to double-check a false reading.</p>

<h3>Not as good in plaster</h3>
<p>Our only real reservation with this recommendation is that the Franklin Sensors design isn&#8217;t very good at finding studs in thick plaster or metal-backed stucco. They claim that these sensors are deep-scanning, but in lath-and-plaster walls the T6 only sometimes works accurately.</p>
<p>The Franklin Sensors stud finders don&#8217;t have any other features, either. There&#8217;s no metal detector (though they&#8217;ll find metal studs well enough based on density) and no live electrical wire detector.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the T6 uses AAA batteries, which are much less annoying than the 9-volt type other electronic stud finders use.</p>
<p>Upgrade to the T13 if you want a built-in level, pencil holder and 8-inch ruler; the extra width doesn&#8217;t make it more accurate or precise.</p>
<p>For mounting shelves the price and simplicity of this device are unbeatable. Magnets will be almost as reliable, but the T6 is quicker in drywall.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>To find studs accurately and quickly behind drywall, the Franklin Sensors &#8211; T6 is excellent.</li>
<li>While the T6 won&#8217;t give you a precise center line, it always gives a reliable target for your screw or nail.</li>
<li>The AAA batteries are much less expensive than the usual 9V in other tools.</li>
<li>All this in the least-expensive stud finder we tested.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-plaster">Best for plaster: Zircon &#8211; Multiscanner 740</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25330" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Plaster-wall.jpg" alt="Zircon - 740" width="2000" height="1333" /><br />
For those who expect precision and versatility along with accuracy, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AHYDWNK/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zircon &#8211; Multiscanner 740</a> is a great example of all the technological advancements available in a traditional electronic stud finder.</p>
<p>Zircon is the original patent licensee and most prolific maker of electronic stud finders, and the 740 is one of their top models. It still relies on a methodical back-and-forth sweep, though, and so it&#8217;s slower to use than the instant-read Franklin Sensors &#8211; Prosensor T6.</p>
<p>Of the two Zircon models we tested, the more expensive 740 was clearly working harder to earn its keep. The extra scan modes for metal and electrical wiring are notable, but the superior calibration accuracy is what really sets this scanner apart. Whether in drywall, ceilings, plaster or stucco, this deep-scanning sensor got the clearest detections overall.</p>
<p>The Zircon also self-calibrates as it&#8217;s scanning, so you don&#8217;t need to worry about starting in the wrong location and getting false readings.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AHYDWNK/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Zircon-cta-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Zircon-cta-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Zircon-cta-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Zircon-cta-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Zircon-cta-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Zircon-cta-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Zircon-cta-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Zircon-cta-180x180.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Zircon-cta-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Zircon-cta.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>All the Features: Zircon – Multiscanner 740</h3><p>If traditional sweep-scan stud finders are what you prefer, Zircon designs this self-calibrating version to work more quickly and accurately than the rest. It’s not as simple to use for quick estimates as the T6, but the Zircon does help you mark a more-precise center line.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AHYDWNK/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean the Zircon is foolproof. We still got false positives with this stud finder, and the red light indicator and precision pencil marking system are not actually telling you where the exact center of a stud is every time. It&#8217;s just better than most comparable tools.</p>
<p>The two-part hinged design is both a blessing and a curse: You don&#8217;t have to hold a button down, it just uses pressure against the wall as a power switch instead. That means it&#8217;s more susceptible to turning on in a tool bag, and it&#8217;s frustrating when you&#8217;re working on uneven wall surfaces or especially when trying to skim along a textured ceiling.</p>
<p>The live wire detection worked well in our fake-wall tests with an extension cord, but the armored cable used inside many home walls isn&#8217;t detected. If you know you have un-shielded Romex in your walls, this feature might be worth buying for.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a device that works well on all wall types and helps you quickly mark center line estimates, this is a worthwhile upgrade.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Zircon &#8211; Multiscanner 740 was the most precise scanner we tested.</li>
<li>Four scan modes let you find more than just wooden studs.</li>
<li>The deep-scan mode is tricky to activate, but works better than anything else in stucco or concrete.</li>
<li>A built-in marking device will save you time on big projects.</li>
<li>Not as quick or easy to use as our top pick.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-magnet">Best magnetic stud finder: Studbuddy Plus</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25339" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Studbuddy.jpg" alt="Studbuddy Plus" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>A magnetic stud finder relies on a tricky cheat to help you find studs: Instead of scanning for the wood inside your wall, it just sticks to the fasteners which hold your wall to the studs. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TK4QCYB/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Studbuddy Plus</a> uses two very strong magnets and an easy-to-grip housing to make sweeping the wall easy.</p>
<p>One great perk of the Studbuddy Plus is that it also has a built-in spirit level. You can switch from finding a stud to marking a level horizontal shelf line without pulling out a second tool, and that saves a lot of time.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TK4QCYB/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/stubbuddy-cta-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/stubbuddy-cta-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/stubbuddy-cta-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/stubbuddy-cta-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/stubbuddy-cta-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/stubbuddy-cta-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/stubbuddy-cta-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/stubbuddy-cta-180x180.png 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/stubbuddy-cta-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/stubbuddy-cta.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Magnet: Studbuddy Plus</h3><p>The Studbuddy Plus is a good multi-purpose tool, but it's still an affordable option for finding studs in nearly any wall. You could by a pack of neodymium magnets instead, but not for much less money.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TK4QCYB/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Compared to the other magnetic designs we tried, the Studbuddy Plus doesn&#8217;t try to show you the precise centerline of a stud at all. The width of the plastic body is just under an inch and a half, so if you trace a line on either side you&#8217;d have a rough outline of the stud underneath.</p>
<p>Because screw heads are on the edge of drywall sheets rather than centered on the stud, though, your lines will usually be a half-inch offset from the true stud underneath.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s still good enough for most jobs, just don&#8217;t rely on the vertical lines you can draw with this tool to show you the limits of where a screw can go. Magnets don&#8217;t usually stick on the exact center of a screw head anyway, so you should never rely on a magnet for that without marking a bunch of the zig-zagging screws and finding a center line between them.</p>
<p>The Studbuddy Plus is a multi-purpose tool that adds a handy level to all the strengths of other magnetic stud finder designs. This is the first magnetic finder we&#8217;ve seen that actually gives you more functionality than a set of bare magnets would.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Studbuddy Plus in an inexpensive magnetic stud finder that does more than the rest.</li>
<li>This is a bit easier to grip and sweep back and forth than other magnets.</li>
<li>Studbuddy integrates a bubble level into this stud finder, so you can finish your job quicker.</li>
<li>It doesn&#8217;t have a notch or indicator for marking precise center lines.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-other-finalists">The other finalists we tested</h2>
<h3>Bosch &#8211; GMS120</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25332" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Bosch.jpg" alt="Bosch" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>With an even more advanced set of wall-scanning tools than even the Zircon Multiscanner, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004TACMZ8/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bosch &#8211; GMS120</a> does it all. You get the wood, metal and electrical scan modes you&#8217;d expect, but the GMS120 will also detect metal objects like fasteners while you&#8217;re in the other scan modes, and it can even distinguish between steel and copper.</p>
<p>Knowing that you&#8217;ve found a copper pipe instead of a screw head is a pretty great perk, and could save you from costly mistakes. The accuracy wasn&#8217;t that impressive, though, so it&#8217;s not as quick to use overall</p>
<p>We like most Bosch tools, like the impressive GLM 50C that won top place in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-laser-measuring-tool/">laser distance meter review</a>. On this stud finder Bosch has included thoughtful options like a mute button and a big pencil-marking guide, and this is still less expensive than the Zircon, but the accuracy and consistency were just not good enough to beat the other top two stud finders.</p>
<h3>Franklin Sensors &#8211; ProSensor T13</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25335" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Franklin-T13.jpg" alt="Franklin Sensors - T13" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>Everything we liked about the Prosensor T6 is also true of the bigger <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DHVJWKP/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Franklin Sensors &#8211; ProSensor T13</a>, but the increased price makes it a hard sell. You&#8217;re paying three times more for a wider sensor, but the T6 is already more than wide enough to work effectively.</p>
<p>You do get a level, ruler marks and a pencil holder in the T13, which might save you time. But is it worth $40 more? For that much you could buy the T6 and a couple of StudBuddy Plus magnets with built-in levels, and you&#8217;d still have change left for <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-mechanical-pencil/">a nice mechanical pencil.</a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to spend $60 on a stud finder, you&#8217;ll probably be miffed that it doesn&#8217;t find electrical wires or work better than this in stucco or plaster.</p>
<h3>Zircon &#8211; SS70</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25331" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Zircon-SS70.jpg" alt="Zircon - SS70" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>Zircon&#8217;s highly-developed stud finders are good at the side-to-side sweep detection method. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AHYDXGQ/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zircon &#8211; SS70</a> is slightly less accurate than the bigger 740, and it doesn&#8217;t work as well through difficult surfaces like metal-lath-backed stucco.</p>
<p>For $29 this is a good stud finder once you get the hang of the back-and-forth sweeping. It also has a live electrical-circuit detector that could be useful if you&#8217;ve got unshielded wire it will actually find. But the Franklin Sensors T6 costs less, is much quicker to use and is less likely to give a confusing reading.</p>
<p>Vivreal &#8211; VIVSF-01<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25329" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Vivreal.jpg" alt="Vivreal" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>If you want a metal-scanning mode on a stud finder for less than $30, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B9VKWSL/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vivreal &#8211; VIVSF-01</a> is not a bad pick. This is decidedly last-generation stud finder technology, though, with a power-on calibration time of 10 seconds. It&#8217;s also the least-accurate stud finder we tested with false positives all over the place.</p>
<p>If you do enough sweeps back and forth you&#8217;ll be able to find the real center of a stud with this model, and it performed better on stucco than our top pick in deep scan mode, but it&#8217;s not a tool we&#8217;d want to use every day. If you can only spend $25, get the Franklin T6 and a big package of magnets instead (or both).</p>
<h3>Other magnetic stud finders we tested</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25333" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CHHanson.jpg" alt="CH Hanson Stud 4 Sure" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>The least-expensive option we tested was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000IKK0OI/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CH Hanson &#8211; Stud 4 Sure 03040</a>. Buying this stud finder is probably less expensive than buying a pack of rare-earth magnets to build your own, and it has a good, strong pair of magnets spaced slightly wider than the Studbuddy&#8217;s set.</p>
<p>If you wanted to mark five or six screw locations and average them out to get a best-possible guess at a precise stud center, the Stud 4 Sure has a small indicator that helps you make more consistent marks than the Studbuddy. The level is too small to be useful for anything other than keeping your marks more-or-less in line with the screw heads you find.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25338" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Studball.jpg" alt="Studball" width="2000" height="1333" /><br />
The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JV3JNE6/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rack-A-Tiers &#8211; Studball</a> is a great design solution to the problem of covering larger areas of wall quickly: Rather than embedding a magnet in a block of solid plastic that you slide back and forth, this design uses a tail of stretchy silicone so you can swing the magnet around quickly without missing your marks. The silicone coating also helps keep the magnet from marking up your wall.</p>
<p>This works well to speed up how quickly you can sweep over a wall for screw heads, and we&#8217;d love to have a dozen of these when marking studs for a big project, but it&#8217;s not worth the extra $5 over other magnetic options.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After spending years tapping on walls and using bare magnets, we&#8217;re happy to say that the latest stud finders really are better than they used to be.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B071LF2BRY/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Franklin Sensors &#8211; Prosensor T6</a> is claimed to be an instant stud finder, and it really is much quicker to use than the old side-to-side sweep type. It isn&#8217;t as reliable in thick plaster or stucco, but for interior walls it&#8217;s an amazing tool at an affordable price.</p>
<p>If you need better scanning in thick wall surfaces, or extra metal and live electrical circuit detection modes, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AHYDWNK/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zircon &#8211; Multiscanner 740</a> gives the most reliable results we&#8217;ve ever seen in a traditional electronic stud finder.</p>
<p>For many people, using a strong magnet to find screw heads under paint will be enough to get the job done. If you&#8217;re looking for the best way to use this trick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TK4QCYB/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Studbuddy Plus</a> is easy to slide around and has a built-in spirit level for lining up that shelf or bracket once you find the stud.</p>

It's not as good as more expensive deep-scanning stud finders in thicker plaster, but even at this low price it still beats the top contenders in regular half-inch drywall. It's much quicker than hunting for screws with a magnet, too.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071LF2BRY/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>

</ul>
<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>Before selecting backpacks to test, we thoroughly researched the different types of carry-on backpacks and read up on recommendations from travel bloggers. We also consulted with a seasoned flight attendant, who advised that the most important features in a carry-on are light weight, good quality materials and plenty of zippered organizing pockets both inside and out.</p>
<p>Based on what we learned, we made a list of features that comprised the ideal carry-on backpack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exterior dimensions (width plus length plus height) totaling 45 linear inches or less, to comply with standard domestic carry-on requirements.</li>
<li>A capacity of roughly 40 liters, and no more than 45 liters. (An interior volume of 40–45 liters roughly equates to 45 total linear inches.)</li>
<li>Bags with clamshell or panel-loading openings, so packed belongings can be seen clearly and accessed easily.</li>
<li>A well-padded, easy-to-access laptop compartment with at least a 15-inch capacity, preferably positioned against the back plate (the most efficient location, in terms of weight bearing).</li>
<li>Zippered pockets for storage.</li>
<li>A streamlined exterior without too much bulk.</li>
<li>Multiple handles (for lifting the bag in and out of overhead bins).</li>
<li>Comfortable, stowable shoulder straps and a breathable back panel. Bonus points for a sternum strap and hip belt.</li>
<li>Exterior and interior compression straps.</li>
<li>No wheels (to lessen weight).</li>

<p>With these standards in mind, we hunted for potential backpacks to test that aligned with our desired features, reading through trusted review sites, Amazon reviews and YouTube video reviews. Aiming for affordability, we also weeded out any contenders priced over $100.</p>

<p>We packed each backpack with a laptop and enough clothing, toiletries and other supplies for a four-day trip. We then tested and judged them using the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Backpack capacity</li>

<li>Laptop compartment</li>
<li>Comfort during wear</li>
<li>Carrying comfort</li>
<li>Exterior design</li>

<p>It was a very close call between the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J24H6MO/?tag=ybdcaron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AmazonBasics &#8211; Carry-On Travel Backpack</a> and our runner-up. Ultimately, the AmazonBasics backpack won out in a few key areas: its comfort level, laptop compartment and compression straps.</p>
<p>With an ultra-cushy back plate and well-padded mesh straps, the AmazonBasics pack was the most comfortable to wear on our backs for an extended period of time. Though its optional waist belt is nothing to write home about, its sternum strap felt solid and stabilizing. The back of the bag also has a strap to secure it to a suitcase’s telescoping handle.</p>
<p>The backpack’s poly exterior features built-in compression straps, one deep front pocket and a larger front compartment with mesh pockets and plenty of interior organization. The bag also comes with a padded shoulder strap that can be clipped on to wear the pack like a messenger bag.</p>
<p>The AmazonBasics bag’s lockable laptop compartment is the most well-padded and protected of all of the backpacks we tested and is elevated above the bottom of the pack to guard against impact.</p>

<p>You won’t find any bells or whistles inside the main clamshell compartment — just simple compression straps and a zippered mesh pocket in the top lid — but you will find plenty of space. The bag is already roomy and expands further to allow for even more packing space inside. Unfortunately, the top mesh pocket doesn’t span the full width of the lid, falling short by about 5 inches and limiting valuable packing space.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>With a plush back plate and shoulder straps, the AmazonBasics &#8211; Carry-On Travel Backpack is the most comfortable of all the backpacks we tested.</li>
<li>Its laptop compartment is well-padded and elevated above the bottom of the bag.</li>
<li>The backpack features a spacious interior that’s expandable, though the top lid’s mesh interior pocket is puzzlingly narrow.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GTBP3Y7/?tag=ybdcaron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">eBags &#8211; eTech 3.0</a> is a well-made bag with a high-quality dobby polyester exterior and large, sturdy ergonomic zipper pulls. Though the bag’s back plate is just as well-padded as the AmazonBasics backpack, its shoulder straps are slightly less plush than its rival’s.</p>
<p>The backpack offers two shallow front pockets and a larger organized compartment, plus a deep, slim pocket perfect for magazines and other in-flight reading material. The eBags’ laptop compartment is noticeably less padded and not as well protected as the one in the AmazonBasics backpack, but it is lockable, elevated above the bottom of the bag and lined with soft felt.</p>
<p>The eBags pack’s main clamshell compartment is roomy and practically identical to the AmazonBasics interior. The eBags backpack has a leg up in this area, with a mesh top compartment that extends all the way to the edge of the lid to make full use of the space available. The eBags’ top and side handles are also cushier and more comfortable to carry than those on the AmazonBasics bag — something to keep in mind if you plan to carry your bag less like a backpack and more like a suitcase.</p>

<p>Like the AmazonBasics bag, the eBags pack has a streamlined exterior, though it may err too far on the side of minimalism: It only includes one exterior compression strap that’s detached from the bag. To us, this feature seems unwieldy and more trouble than it’s worth to put on and take off every time you want to access the pack’s compartments.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The eBags &#8211; eTech 3.0 is made of high-quality materials, with strong ergonomic zipper pulls and a cushy back plate, though its shoulder straps are not as well-padded as those on the AmazonBasics bag.</li>
<li>The eBags interior is basically twinning with the AmazonBasics, though the former offers more interior mesh pocket space.</li>
<li>Though it isn’t as well-cushioned as the AmazonBasics, the eBags backpack’s laptop compartment is lined with soft felt, offers moderate cushioning and is positioned above the bottom of the bag for protection.</li>

<p>Made of “splash-resistant” nylon, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F255JP9/?tag=ybdcaron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Inateck</a> is an excellent, high-quality travel pack that happens to have a less spacious main compartment than our winning backpack and runner-up.</p>
<p>The Inateck is generous with its padding, offering a very well-cushioned lockable laptop compartment, back plate, straps and carrying handles. Though a side shoulder strap is not included with this bag, it does have an adjustable water bottle holder and handy elasticized rain cover.</p>
<p>The Inateck is also the only backpack we tested with little zippered pouches sewn into its straps, large enough to hold credit cards, ID, cash, lip balm, etc. We also loved the horizontal zippered compartment at the base of the back plate, which would be ideal for storing valuables during wear.</p>

<p>The only panel-loading backpack in the bunch, the Inateck lacks interior compression straps, but it does include a vinyl pouch for toiletries and two mesh interior pockets in its main compartment. On its exterior, there are two front slash pockets (one of which has interior pockets and sleeves) and sturdy compression straps.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The “splash-resistant” nylon Inateck features quality construction and durable materials, though it offers less interior packing space than the AmazonBasics and eBags backpacks.</li>
<li>The Inateck’s padding is luxurious throughout, with a well-protected laptop compartment and cushioning for comfort.</li>
<li>The Inateck features a rain cover, a vinyl storage pouch and zippered pockets in the shoulder straps and against the back plate.</li>

<p>With its roomy interior, cushy shoulder straps and bonus features like a USB port, detachable toiletry pouch and customizable interior dividers, we were ready to rank the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QBB5QQD/?tag=ybdcaron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">eBags &#8211; TLS Mother Lode Weekender</a> at the top of our list — until we opened the laptop compartment. Unfortunately, the bag’s flimsy “laptop sling” is unpadded and not nearly secure enough. We were also disappointed that the bag’s back plate was so poorly padded — a missed opportunity for both carrying comfort and laptop cushioning.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QDWZ8KV/?tag=ybdcaron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dinictis</a> is an okay bag that left us feeling lukewarm. Its laptop compartment is barely padded and unfortunately located in the front of the bag. Dinictis was also stingy with its back-plate padding. We did like the backpack’s expandable water bottle holder and the zippered plastic compartment for toiletries inside the main compartment.</p>
<h3>Hynes Eagle</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25669" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hynes-solo-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07432ZH6M/?tag=ybdcaron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hynes Eagle</a> design was very similar to that of the Dinictus. Not only was its laptop compartment sparsely padded and located in the front of the bag, it also rested directly on the bottom of the pack, providing no protection from impact. The backpack’s materials felt a little flimsy compared to our winners, though this bag does get points for its large zipper pulls and expandable water bottle holder.</p>
<h3>G4Free</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25668" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/G4-solo-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>At the bottom of the totem pole is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H2SFNT3/?tag=ybdcaron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">G4Free</a>, which was not up to the standard of the other bags we tested. The G4Free doesn’t have a dedicated laptop compartment; travelers would have to stow their computers inside the main clamshell compartment or in the back sleeve, where the backpack’s straps are meant to be stored. The bag’s compression straps also failed us, loosening as soon as we let go of them.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Our winning carry-on backpack, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J24H6MO/?tag=ybdcaron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AmazonBasics</a>, won us over with its large interior capacity, quality laptop compartment and cushioned comfort. We also liked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GTBP3Y7/?tag=ybdcaron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">eBags &#8211; eTech 3.0</a>, which is just as roomy and offers a well-padded back plate and ergonomic zipper pulls.</p>
<p>Our recommendation for light packers is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F255JP9/?tag=ybdcaron-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Inateck &#8211; Travel Backpack</a>, a luxe, comfortably cushioned backpack with a well-padded laptop compartment and clever features like a hidden zippered compartment positioned against the back during wear.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e tested seven top-rated distance meters, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015FCJTEA/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bosch &#8211; GLM 50C</a> won a permanent place in our toolbox as the best laser measuring tool. Beyond the expected features, including solid Bluetooth compatibility, this meter wowed us with extra perks like a tilt sensor and an easy-to-use graphical interface. We also found two other winners: If you specifically need AutoCAD compatibility, Leica steals the prize with the Leica &#8211; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8HNPSK/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DISTO D2</a>, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N9TPP4V/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TackLife &#8211; HD60</a> is a great choice for under $50.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>Our writer for this review has been using laser distance measures at work for five years, mostly while rigging speaker and projector installations as an audio-video technician at convention centers and other event venues. He&#8217;s also used laser distance meters to generate computer-based layouts for home renovation projects. He uses his laser distance measure on most of his projects for Your Best Digs, everything from measuring edge angles on <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-kitchen-knives/">kitchen knives</a> to measuring how far a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-leaf-blower/">leaf blower</a> can throw a weighted box.</p>
<h3>Expert input:</h3>
<p>We also interviewed other professionals who use measuring tools daily:</p>
<p>Victor Millares is a project manager with <a href="https://www.vikingenviro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viking Environmental Group</a> and uses laser measurers every day to estimate asbestos and lead abatement jobs.</p>
<p>Christina Younger is an architect working at <a href="https://www.gensler.com/offices/newport-beach/projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gensler in Newport Beach</a>, and she primarily transfers site measurements from Leica measuring tools into building information software like RevIt or into AutoCAD.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcellus-wesley-06987716" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marcellus Wesley</a> is a director of operations for audio-video service provider PSAV at a conference center in Anaheim, California, with seven years of experience flying projector screens and speaker arrays. Marcellus typically designs his shows in VectorWorks.</p>
<h3>Competitive price range</h3>
<p>After looking at the full range of offerings from the market leaders — Bosch, Leica and Hilti — we narrowed our search down to the meters that will provide extra functionality for common indoor tasks, but stay inside a reasonable budget. Two of our experts have had expensive meters stolen from job sites and said they would make do without rarely used features or the most prestigious brands to avoid repeating that heartache.</p>
<p>We tested four models in the $80–$150 range and three in the under-$50 price range. All had excellent average review scores from buyers, though we did go with a newer DEWALT meter over an older, better-reviewed model that&#8217;s discontinued.</p>

[table id=312 /]
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
[table id=314 /]
<p><b>Stake out: </b>When you need to place a feature like a wall stud, light fixture or shelf support at precise, regular intervals, stake-out mode will help you mark those spots at the distances you set. Bosch gives you some wiggle room with an indicator of where your mark is on the inch-and-a-half-tall screen as you slide the tool past, while Leica just tells you how much farther you have to go to land on the next mark with the back of the tool.</p>
<p><b>Painter mode: </b>Most of these tools will let you measure the height and length of a wall and then show you the area, but the better meters also let you add or subtract other areas — add up all the walls, subtract windows and doors — to give you a total wall area for paint coverage estimates.</p>
<p><b>Indirect height measurement: </b>If you remember the Pythagorean theorem, you know that you can check the length of a line by measuring two other lines in a right triangle. Laser measurement tools typically include a mode that calculates the result for you automatically, which can be very handy if you want to know the height of a building feature you can&#8217;t quite reach.</p>

<p><b>Level and tilt sensors:</b> When you&#8217;re measuring walls it helps to know when you&#8217;re actually holding the meter level so you don&#8217;t add extra length by measuring an angle. The Bosch takes this even further, giving you a precise tilt measurement. You&#8217;ve got an excellent tilt sensor on most smartphones these days, but having a laser level, angle finder and tape measure in one tool is very convenient.</p>
<p><b>Unit Reading Options: </b>This is the number of different options you&#8217;re given for seeing the displayed results of a measurement. All the meters offer a foot-inch-fraction mode to replicate what you&#8217;d get from an old-fashioned tape measure, but the better meters offer other modes like inch-and-fraction readings or decimal readings (see below).</p>

<p><b>Decimal readout: </b>This feature is, of course, always available for metric units. But many professionals in North America (even tradespeople in Canada working on residential projects) use inches and feet for measuring rooms and building materials. Just because you measure ceiling height in feet doesn&#8217;t mean you want to be stuck entering fractions in your design software or converting them to add measurements together. Decimal readouts for feet are available on all but two of the meters, and both of our runner-up picks let you see decimal inches.</p>

<h3>Laser advantages</h3>
<p><b>Convenience and range:</b> A laser distance measure is more compact than a tape, and it&#8217;s infinitely faster. But the biggest advantage is when you&#8217;re measuring distances longer than your arm span or across a gap. With a laser, you don&#8217;t even need to be able to touch the point you&#8217;re measuring to, so long as you&#8217;ve got a clear view of it.</p>
<p><b>Easy calculations:</b> The laser is dominant in measuring indoor spaces, making it simple to calculate how much paint you need for a giant wall or how much air volume a heating system needs to move. Estimators nearly all carry one, even if the contractors they work with stick to the old metal tape.</p>
<p><b>Precision: </b>Tape measures aren&#8217;t inaccurate, but the way we use them often involves rounding to a convenient fraction and even adding up multiple rounded measurements. Lasers will always give you a measurement down to the smallest fraction or decimal available, and the accuracy is just as good as a tape.</p>
<h3>Tape advantages</h3>
<p><b>Easier for simple measurements:</b> If you&#8217;re just spacing out picture frames or centering a large bedroom mirror before you drill holes for <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-drywall-anchor">drywall anchors</a>, a tape might be less hassle to work with than a laser. Still, if you have a corner of the room to measure from, a laser with a built-in level and a &#8220;stake-out&#8221; mode for marking evenly spaced distances can do the job very quickly.</p>
<p><b>Surface measurements:</b> A laser lets you down if you want to measure along a surface rather than between objects. Marking a board for miter-saw cuts, for example, is far easier with a tape. Lasers are also pretty bad at measuring uneven terrain like grass. You can use stakes, post-it notes or masking tape to create targets for the laser to shoot, but a tape measure can just hook onto a corner or lie on the ground.</p>
<p><b>Bright sunlight: </b>If you&#8217;re working with a hand-held meter on an outdoor job, you need to keep track of the laser dot by setting up your measurements carefully and resting the meter on stable objects. A tape will nearly always work flawlessly, so long as it&#8217;s long enough for the job.</p>
<h3>Other measurement tools</h3>
<p>Augmented reality programs on your smartphone are now able to create impressive room maps with just motion sensors and cameras, but none of them are precise enough to give you a layout you can rely on for important jobs. With the right combination of software and a Bluetooth-connected laser distance measure to verify critical dimensions, however, you can get the best of both worlds.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We ran each of these tools through day-to-day tasks for contractors, insurance estimators and home improvement hobbyists. Our tester created a room layout for his home office with each device, then put up a picture or shelf, measured distances of cabinets, estimated the length of a network cable run and calculated wall area of a bathroom renovation.</p>
<p>We checked the outdoor usability of each tool side-by-side, checked accuracy in a calibration test and tested the Bluetooth connection of three models on an Android smartphone.</p>
<h3>Basic use tests</h3>
[table id=313 /]
<p><b>Outdoor visibility:</b> None of these meters is ideal for outdoor use at long ranges, since they don&#8217;t have viewfinders to show you exactly what they&#8217;re pointing at when you lose track of the dot. Brighter lasers still make a difference at short ranges or even indoors on sunny days, though. We also highly recommend picking up contrast-enhancing red glasses like this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00093DJ4M/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">pair from DEWALT</a> to help you track a red laser dot in sunlight.</p>
<p><b>Screen readability: </b>If you&#8217;re in a tight corner or working outside, you need to be able to see what measurements you&#8217;re getting without moving the meter. We checked readability from every angle and ranked the tools against each other. Screens with a high-contrast display won this competition easily.</p>
<p><b>Minimum distance:</b> We also checked the minimum distance each tool can measure, listed on the chart above in inches. Other than the Bosch &#8211; GLM 20, they were all able to see a wall at less than 2 inches, but the Leica was able to read about 3/16&#8243; closer than the others.</p>

You pay a bit more for the versatility, but there's a reason disto is practically a generic term for these tools.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8HNPSK/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p><b>Maximum distance: </b>After trying to set up a few outdoor concerts with a standard laser, it became clear that a viewfinder like you&#8217;ll find on the $300 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BNSYP4M/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bosch &#8211; GLM 400</a> is essential if you want an accurate distance for anything other than the side of a building.</p>
<p>Useful hand-held range was about fifty feet before hand movement made measurement impossible, and as you go farther, visibility of the dot in daylight is the biggest limitation.</p>
<h3>Bluetooth compatibility</h3>
[table id=315 /]
<p>To assess how useful Bluetooth features are, we looked first at the manufacturer-provided apps to see if they would meet the needs of a contractor, realtor or estimator taking notes about the size of a room or a specific feature in a room. Next we tried connecting to four popular insurance computer-aided drafting (&#8220;CAD&#8221;) and room planning apps.</p>
<p>The DEWALT &#8211; DW099S is a great example of a Bluetooth tool that meets basic needs but completely fails to live up to its potential. DEWALT&#8217;s own app (actually a sub-page of a tool management app) only allows you to fire the laser remotely or make measurement markings on a photo. We searched for third-party app support and found nothing else that worked with this meter, even among apps that supported older DEWALT models.</p>
<p>Bosch and Leica both give you a layout drawing app to work with. Leica&#8217;s DISTO Plan is good for quickly sketching a basic room and reviewing it, while Bosch&#8217;s MeasureOn is comparable in sketch mode but also offers a detailed plan mode with options for wall thickness, electrical outlet locations and drop ceilings. Bosch even gives you a complete estimate of materials and wall surface for your projects within the MeasureOn app.</p>
<p>A PDF summary export from these apps is going to be good enough for most of us as a reference or for manual transferring dimensions to other software, but Bosch offers file export for the ProCore system and Leica offers a paid unlock for saving .DXF and .DWG files.</p>
<p>Leica was the clear winner on compatibility: Software developers go out of their way to make their apps work specifically with Leica&#8217;s DISTO brand. Leica also offers Windows software that will let you capture Bluetooth measurements in nearly any design or drafting application.</p>
<p>Bosch is arguably better-known among contractors than Leica, but support for the GLM 50C was spotty. Leica is the only brand supported by AutoCAD or TOTAL, the apps we heard the most about from professionals. Both of our top picks worked perfectly in Magic Plan and Floor Plan Creator, two top apps.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a top-class distance meter for the jobsite, or even If you&#8217;re just working on home projects, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015FCJTEA/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bosch &#8211; GLM 50C</a> takes the prize with excellent features in a compact, affordable package.</p>
<p>Bosch added a lot of great perks to this device that&#8217;s competing with entry-level lasers from the other big names. The color screen is easy to read, and it also allows you to control the device with a graphical menu system — much easier to use than the basic four-line alphanumeric display on all the other meters.</p>
<h3>Unique functions</h3>
<p>A tilt sensor is the real blockbuster value in this package. With an angle readout in the default measuring mode, you don&#8217;t have to second-guess how horizontal the line is that you&#8217;re shooting. You can make sure that vertical measurements are plumb and even use the level mode to get your new TV or projector bracket level to a tenth of a degree. Bosch also gives you a clever indirect-height mode that uses the tilt sensor instead of relying on you making a 90-degree base measurement.</p>

<p>The most unique feature of the Bosch isn&#8217;t even the tilt sensor, it&#8217;s the stake-out mode for construction projects. Instead of marking your 16-inch studs or cabinet widths at the back end of the meter as on other devices, you see a visual depiction of the mark on the LCD screen.</p>
<p>A mark on the screen doesn&#8217;t let you use the back edge of the tool for making your mark, but it&#8217;s much quicker this way. As you slide the meter along the line you&#8217;re marking intervals on, you have a few inches of wiggle room around each point where you can see the mark on the screen, instead of needing to get the tool nudged to exactly the right spot before making your mark. Bosch&#8217;s interface also makes inputting the interval length for this mode much easier than on Leica&#8217;s two-button system.</p>
<p>Bosch&#8217;s painter-friendly wall-area mode saves time by only asking you to set room height once, then it lets you add as many wall lengths as you need to get a total area. Sadly, you can&#8217;t subtract a window or door area in this mode, but it&#8217;s still a great time-saver for quick estimates. There are regular area- and volume-calculator functions as well, and you can add or subtract in those modes.</p>
<p>Bosch also includes a tripod mount, which most of us won&#8217;t need, but it makes the Bosch even more versatile. You could even use this as a laser-layout marking system, if you&#8217;ve got a trustworthy tripod head to swivel the laser in a perfectly flat plane. This isn&#8217;t survey equipment, but it&#8217;s good for quickly setting the height of cabinets or lining up picture frames.</p>

<p>Bosch&#8217;s Bluetooth support is good, but not perfect. If you need to send numbers to AutoCAD, Revit, VectorWorks or TOTAL, get the Leica. The one advantage Bosch offers pro users is export from the MeasureOn app to the ProCore building management suite. MeasureOn is a pretty detailed floor-plan app on its own, but most professionals will probably only use it to store measurements and build a floor plan somewhere else.</p>
<p>We ran into one hitch with Bluetooth: It turns out that the laser doesn&#8217;t send Bluetooth measurement values the same way in the default &#8220;real-time measurement&#8221; mode, and you have to switch to the other aim-and-press &#8220;length&#8221; mode with some apps.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>As a measuring tool you can use every day on the jobsite or for home projects, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015FCJTEA/?tag=ybddisto-20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bosch &#8211; GLM 50C</a> is an excellent value.</li>
<li>The graphical display makes extra settings and modes much easier to find and use.</li>
<li>This tilt sensor and tripod mount are usually only found on much more expensive tools.</li>
<li>At $200, this would be a competitive tool, but it&#8217;s often selling for closer to $110.</li>
<li>Bosch&#8217;s smartphone app is good for basic, accurate room drawings.</li>
<li>Bosch&#8217;s Bluetooth compatibility is a bit lacking compared to Leica if you&#8217;re using pro-grade software.</li>

If you weren&#8217;t expecting to see a Bosch take the top spot in this review, you were probably expecting to see a Leica. In a world where the Bosch GLM 50C didn&#8217;t offer the unique features that come along with the graphical display, Leica would have this in the bag with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8HNPSK/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DISTO D2</a>. &#8220;Disto&#8221; is practically a generic term for laser distance measurers — and for good reason.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re setting up a show in a convention center and need more indoor range than the Bosch offers, or if you are using Bluetooth-connected apps that only support Leica&#8217;s tools, then the DISTO D2 is definitely worth the $40 difference. It&#8217;s a less-flexible stand-alone tool, but it integrates into more complex measurement jobs better.</p>
<h3>Entry-level excellence</h3>
<p>The DISTO D2 is a very basic model compared to the rest of Leica&#8217;s offerings. For a tilt sensor and tripod mount like the Bosch has, you need to spend more than $300 for a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DRQK533/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DISTO X3</a>, and $400 gets you the X4 with a zoom viewfinder for outdoor measurements, which compares to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BNSYP4M/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bosch&#8217;s $300 GLM 400</a>.</p>
<p>Leica&#8217;s interface is the real disappointment after using the Bosch meter. The four-line LCD means modes like stake-out are especially clunky, since you need to set the interval distance by scrolling with just the plus and minus keys. You can&#8217;t even change measurement units without relying on the quick-start guide to tell you the key combination you need — plus and minus at the same time in this case.</p>
<p>The flip-out reference leg for lining up perfect outside corner references is the one feature of the Leica that we missed when going back to the Bosch. The lack of a tripod mount and level indicator makes that a wash, depending on your project.</p>
<p>If you are going to be using the Leica at maximum range, don&#8217;t forget to use the timer feature, which helps you keep the beam on distant targets by eliminating vibration from the button press.</p>
<h3>Better Bluetooth compatibility</h3>

<p>Buying the DISTO D2 makes perfect sense if you use a Bluetooth-connected app that expects Leica hardware. Compatibility with AutoCAD and the widely-used appraisal suite TOTAL is essential if you&#8217;re working in those systems every day, and you&#8217;ll probably never use the digital angle finder or stake-out function for those kinds of projects anyhow.</p>

With the very best Bluetooth compatibility, Leica is going to be an essential purchase for some professionals. The D2 doesn't have all of the features of the Bosch, but it's competitive.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8HNPSK/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The DISTO Transfer Windows software allows you to drop measurements from the tool directly into software like RevIt or VectorWorks on a Bluetooth-capable PC. We tested this in SketchUp, and after some careful setup it entered measurements just as if we&#8217;d typed them. If you prefer working in full CAD drawings to smartphone sketches but can&#8217;t afford more expensive survey gear, this is an excellent option.</p>
<p>Skip the free DISTO Sketch app entirely; it&#8217;s very limited. Leica&#8217;s main measuring app, DISTO Plan, works well with the D2 for drawing a room plan including basic door and window features. The fact that you need the more expensive X3 or X4 to use Leica&#8217;s fast-and-easy Smart Room drawing workflow is annoying. DISTO Plan is easy to work with, but not as easy as Magic Plan or Floor Plan Creator, two of the best room-design apps we tried.</p>
<p>Note that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M5CW7CT/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DISTO D1</a> will still give you Leica&#8217;s Bluetooth connectivity for even less than the Bosch, but your interface is down to one button and you lose all the built-in calculation functions.</p>
<p>If you need the extra measuring range or the specific software support, the Leica &#8211; DISTO D2 is an excellent measuring tool that fills some gaps between the Bosch and much more expensive tools.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Leica &#8211; DISTO D2 is a relatively affordable handheld tool from a top survey instrument maker.</li>
<li>Leica gives you more range than most of us could possibly use with a handheld tool.</li>
<li>If you need compatibility with top CAD apps, this is an easy pick.</li>
<li>You may miss the angle finder or tripod mount of the Bosch, and Leica&#8217;s interface is not as easy to use.</li>

If you just need a tool that tells you the length of a wall so you can write it down, it&#8217;s hard to argue against the value of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N9TPP4V/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tacklife &#8211; HD60</a>. This is a well-rounded tool that doesn&#8217;t skimp on options, and it&#8217;s the easiest dot to see in full sunlight.</p>
<p>The Tacklife is a clone of other tools, to be sure. But it&#8217;s just as accurate as the other meters — at any distance you&#8217;d be able to hand-hold them, anyhow. The bubble level indicators are useful to keep you from shooting a wildly sloped line, but they&#8217;re not accurate or precise enough to replace even a smartphone-app-based level.</p>

This is actually the brightest laser we tested, the screen is easy to read, and the calibration was practically identical to the more expensive models.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N9TPP4V/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Tacklife has a good customer satisfaction record, and we can see why. The interface is similar to most standard laser tape measures, with a bright screen and dedicated buttons for all the important features.</p>
<p>The option to see readings in decimal inches as well as fractions, feet and meters is a nice touch if you&#8217;re going to use the numbers for calculations or numerical input. Other meters in this price bracket only give you decimal readings for metric units.</p>
<p>If sub-inch accuracy of a distance meter is important to you, you should definitely check against a known reference like a tape measure if you buy this device. The calibration on the device we bought, though, was spot-on down to the millimeter. At 10 feet measured between parallel walls indoors, the Tacklife gave an identical reading to the Leica and Bosch, down to a hundredth of an inch.</p>
<p>The features you don&#8217;t get on the TackLife that you can get with more expensive meters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bluetooth connectivity</li>
<li>A fold-out leg for steady corner measurements</li>
<li>Stake-out mode for setting measured intervals</li>
<li>A real tilt sensor</li>
<li>Painter mode for adding up wall area</li>
</ul>
<p>Neither the Bosch nor the Leica has every one of those features at the under-$200 price point, but if you need any of them you should look closely at our top picks. To add just the painter mode at a similar price point, check out the Klein Tools  &#8211; 93LDM65.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N9TPP4V/?tag=ybddisto-20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tacklife &#8211; HD60</a> has most of the features you could ask for at the price of a long analog tape measure.</li>
<li>Indirect, area and volume measurements work the same as on other meters, though you can&#8217;t add or subtract from them.</li>
<li>The laser dot from this meter is the brightest we found, though it&#8217;s still useless at more than 50 feet in sunlight.</li>
<li>Bubble levels aren&#8217;t precise or accurate, but they are useful when taking a quick measurement without a plumb surface for reference.</li>
</ul>

If you&#8217;re looking for a very affordable distance finder with a name you&#8217;ll recognize, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0OJGYT/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klein Tools &#8211; 93LDM65</a> is a good pick with only a few drawbacks.</p>
<p>The screen and interface are excellent, but this meter has the dimmest dot. It&#8217;s fine if you&#8217;re shooting wall measurements, but in sunlight it&#8217;s easy to lose track of, even with contrast-enhancing red glasses.</p>
<p>Most features you&#8217;re looking for, including minimum-and-maximum mode, a painter-friendly area calculator and an extendible reference stick for tricky surfaces like sharp inside corners. You don&#8217;t get the premium options like stake-out mode or an actual right-angle corner brace, but for about $40 this is a good value.</p>
<p>The Klein Tools meter gave the least-reliable outdoor measurements in our tests, but it&#8217;s still within a millimeter of the other tools for indoor readings.</p>
<p>This is a close contender for our budget pick. If you frequently do wall area estimates and you want a tool you can afford to leave in your unlocked toolbox over lunch, this is a good fit.</p>
<h3>Fluke &#8211; 414D</h3>

Fluke is a name that bears no disrespect: Electricians all over the country will sooner fight you than let you say mean things about their yellow-orange multimeters. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008ZCS21E/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fluke &#8211; 414D</a> is well-protected against drops and it&#8217;s good at what it does, but with a whopping $120 price tag this is too spartan to get a recommendation.</p>
<p>The Fluke meter doesn&#8217;t have a backlight for the screen, let alone a corner support leg or tilt sensor.  The basic modes, including addition and subtraction of measured area, are all here, but you can&#8217;t get foot or inch measurements with decimal display.</p>
<p>If Fluke is calibrating these meters to a higher standard than the imitators, it doesn&#8217;t show up in a way that we could find. There&#8217;s a feeling of security that comes with a professional-grade measurement tool made by a company that stakes its reputation on reliability, but that&#8217;s also true for Leica and Bosch. Those brands are giving you much more for your money with their meters, so there&#8217;s not much reason to buy this model unless you&#8217;re a devoted loyalist.</p>
<h3>Bosch &#8211; GLM 20</h3>

If you&#8217;re looking for a literal replacement for a tape measure, with no features other than checking distances, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CG97GR2/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bosch &#8211; GLM 20</a> is a reliable choice.</p>
<p>The GLM 20 isn&#8217;t always easier to use, though, than other more fully-featured options. We liked the simplicity of the one-button interface for basic jobs, but as soon as you need to change the measurement units (by holding down that button when powering up) you&#8217;ll wish you had a more sophisticated device.</p>
<p>This is the least-expensive tool in our lineup, but it&#8217;s not actually any easier to use than the TackLife, which only costs about $7 more. Having the ability to take an indirect height measurement or measure from the front edge of the meter is definitely worth it for the projects we worked on in our tests. If you&#8217;re someone like a camera assistant who only needs estimated focus distance measurements, this bare-bones Bosch meter is a good value.</p>
<h3>DEWALT &#8211; DW099S</h3>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076P96DKY/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DEWALT &#8211; DW099S</a> is not a bad tool by any means, but it misses some key features that we were expecting to see in a Bluetooth-connected measuring tool.</p>
<p>The DEWALT is compact and has a good button layout for all the basic features. The high-contrast screen is one of its best features, earning a tie with the Bosch for easiest screen to read in a dark room or in full sunlight.</p>
<p>There are a few features missing on this meter, however. For example, you get the usual painter-friendly area calculation with add and subtract functions, but no indirect height function. If you remember the Pythagorean theorem you can calculate that yourself, but it seems like an obvious mode to include.</p>
<p>The reason the DEWALT ranks so low on our list is that the app compatibility is poor, but you pay full price for Bluetooth. You can only connect this measuring tool to the DEWALT Connect app, which just has a photo markup function.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re not going to be able to export anything close to a CAD file from this app, but you can take a photo of a wall (or even a pencil sketch of a rom layout) and overlay a quick free-hand outline of wall segments with your finger. DEWALT Connect will then let you easily add the distance readings one segment at a time as you walk around the room. It&#8217;s not the most powerful layout tool, but if you like to sketch a room on paper anyhow, it&#8217;s actually much more convenient than other workflows.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Laser distance measuring tools have come a long way, and we were impressed with the accuracy of even the most inexpensive tools we tested. For taking room or DIY project measurements, these all worked well. If you&#8217;re working outside on a bigger job, you&#8217;d need to spend big bucks to get something with a sight glass or camera for reliable measurements at more than 100 feet.</p>
<p>With the best features in a stand-alone tool, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015FCJTEA/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bosch &#8211; GLM 50C</a> is a replacement for a tape measure, a plumb bob and even a laser level. The graphical interface makes changing modes and settings much easier, and the free Bluetooth-connected app is a good way to draw basic floor plans.</p>
<p>If you want compatibility with AutoDesk or A La Mode software products, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8HNPSK/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Leica &#8211; DISTO D2</a> is the easy choice. Even though this Disto doesn&#8217;t have as many features as the Bosch, the compatibility will be more important for many professional users.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>or college students, a backpack is not just a backpack; it’s a constant on-campus companion and portable locker. To find the best bags for the task, we put five highly rated laptop backpacks through the ringer, loading them up with the average college student’s everyday essentials and testing them for capacity, organization, comfort, support and water-resistance.</p>
<p>We chose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KSYM4Q6/?tag=ybdbpack-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InCase &#8211; Icon</a> as the best backpack for college. It’s a sleek, structured, well-organized backpack made of strong, water-resistant ballistic nylon that has a compartment for anything a student could need on campus. Our runner-up pick is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MTQ663B/?tag=ybdbpack-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fjallraven &#8211; Raven 28</a>, a spacious, durable, water-resistant pack with a classic design that received high marks for comfort.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>To kick off our research, we interviewed college students to find out what they actually lugged around on their backs on an average day. In general, these items included a laptop, tablet, phone, binder, planner, heavy textbook, keys and a variety of pens.</p>
<p>A laptop sleeve was vital: Most students said that while they only carried books when they would need them for class, they rarely left home without their computers. They also preferred plenty of pockets, as well as space for workout clothes in case they decided to hit the gym after class. We also discovered that, in general, they preferred durability and comfort over a “dope” backpack design.</p>
<p>With this info in mind, we set out to find the top-rated backpacks on Amazon with especially high-rated laptop compartments. We also scoured Reddit for backpack recommendations from college students that aligned with our metrics, aiming for durable, high-quality bags under $200 that could endure all four years of college.</p>
<p>First on our list was the InCase &#8211; Icon, a sleek, well-constructed backpack with a plethora of interior compartments and pockets, including a protected laptop compartment. The Timbuk2 &#8211; Spire’s large capacity and quick-access laptop opening impressed us as well. We also wanted to give the Fjallraven &#8211; Raven 28 the old college try, since it had gotten great reviews for its comfort and quality laptop sleeve.</p>
<p>The most utilitarian of the group was the SwissGear &#8211; 1900 ScanSmart, an Amazon darling that got top marks for its large capacity and durability. Rounding out our lineup was the North Face &#8211; Recon, a sportier ripstop backpack that came highly recommended for its roomy design and lasting power.</p>

[table id=311 /]
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Fabric</h3>
<p>When buying a backpack, you’ll most likely be choosing between four of the common fabrics used in backpack manufacturing: nylon, polyester, canvas and ripstop.</p>
<h3>Nylon</h3>
<p><strong>The good</strong>: Known for its durability and strength, nylon is water- and mold-resistant and currently the most popular backpack material choice.</p>
<p><strong>The bad</strong>: Nylon has poor UV resistance, meaning the fabric can weaken when exposed to the sun for extended periods of time.</p>
<h3>Polyester</h3>
<p><strong>The good</strong>: Cheaper than nylon, polyester is recyclable and highly UV-resistant.</p>
<p><strong>The bad</strong>: It’s less durable than nylon.</p>
<h3>Canvas</h3>
<p><strong>The good</strong>: The classic backpack material, canvas is nylon’s predecessor and quite strong and durable. Waxed canvas, which is water-resistant, has been making a comeback with cool-kid brands like Fjallraven and Herschel.</p>
<p><strong>The bad</strong>: Canvas is generally heavy unless it’s blended with synthetic fibers to lighten the weight of the fabric.</p>
<h3>Ripstop</h3>
<p><strong>The good</strong>: Originally developed for parachutes in World War II and made to be especially tough, ripstop is sewn in a grid pattern designed to stop ripping in its tracks.</p>
<p><strong>The bad</strong>: Ripstop is useful for college backpacks if blended with strong fabrics (such as nylon), but it can wear quickly when blended with lighter fabrics, since the lightweight fabric threads and strong ripstop threads wear at different rates.</p>
<h3>Fabric weight</h3>
<p>You’ve probably seen backpack fabrics described cryptically with a number followed by a “D” (such as 600D, 1200D, etc.). The “D” stands for denier, which is a fabric weight measurement. Generally, a higher denier number equals stronger fabric; however, this measurement is only good for comparing weights within one fabric category (for example, a 600D polyester is actually weaker than a 450D nylon).</p>
<h3>Zippers</h3>
<p>When it comes to weather-resistance, your backpack’s zipper makes all the difference. Unless your bag features a truly waterproof zipper (like the TIZIP and YKK AquaSeal), there will always be a chance that water will sneak in. You can help safeguard against this with high-quality zippers and zipper flaps, and also by choosing a bag with less entry points exposed to the elements (such as a roll-top backpack).</p>
<h3>Comfort and support</h3>
<h4>Straps</h4>
<p>Well-padded straps are a no-brainer when it comes to backpack comfort. But what kind of padding is best for all-day comfort? Closed-cell foam, which has closed-off cells to seal off the foam’s interior from air, is flatter and denser than open-cell foam and provides better long-term support. Look for terms like “dual density” and “EVA” in product descriptions.</p>
<p>Also important for comfort is the width and placement of the straps. Wider straps placed farther apart provide better weight distribution, and prevent rubbing on the neck and under the arms. A sternum strap can also help distribute weight evenly across the body. (Pro tip: sternum straps should fall about 1 inch below your collarbone.)</p>
<h4>Back panel</h4>
<p>A padded back panel is important for comfort. However, if the bag’s laptop compartment is located against the back of the bag, you’ll want some rigidity there to protect your computer from impact.</p>
<h4>Laptop compartment</h4>

<p>To protect your computer, you’ll want a laptop compartment with plenty of structured padding and shock protection. A compartment that hovers above the bottom of the bag or has a padded base is best. If the compartment is located against the back of the bag, the back panel should also be heavily protected with sturdy padding. Also consider the size of the compartment; you’ll want to choose one that matches your laptop closely to prevent your computer from shifting around too much.</p>

<p>To test our backpacks contenders, we loaded them up with the supplies our surveyed college students told us they carried: a laptop (ours was a 15-inch), tablet, phone, binder, planner, heavy textbook, keys and a variety of pens. We also threw in a pair of sneakers and gym clothes for good measure.</p>
<p>After packing up the backpacks, carrying them around, testing the accessibility of their compartments and giving them a good rinse in a simulated rain shower, we rated each of the packs. While we kept functionality and comfort top of mind, we did give a few extra points to the backpacks that looked cool as well (these are for college students, after all). We judged the backpacks using the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>How would you rate the capacity and interior organization of the backpack?</li>
<li>How accessible was the laptop compartment, and how well was it padded and protected?</li>
<li>How comfortable did you feel wearing this backpack?</li>
<li>Was it breathable?</li>
<li>How would you rate the bag’s back support?</li>
<li>Were the backpack’s materials durable?</li>
<li>Was the construction high quality?</li>
<li>How well did you like the aesthetic look of the backpack?</li>
<li>Is this pack worth its price?</li>
</ul>

<p>For college students, we highly recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KSYM4Q6/?tag=ybdbpack-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InCase &#8211; Icon</a>. Sleek and compact on the outside, the 17-liter Icon is surprisingly roomy on the inside and superbly organized, with a laptop compartment, separate tablet compartment, two large main compartments, front zippered pocket and fleece-lined top pocket (for sunglasses, phone, keys, etc.).</p>
<p>Within the bag’s main compartments are plenty of zippered and Velcro pockets, pen holders and large sleeves for holding books, binders and papers. There seems to be a designated place for everything in this backpack, which makes it a cinch to find and extract exactly what you need without having to dig around. The only pockets it lacks, unfortunately, are water bottle holders.</p>
<p>Located against the back of the pack, the Icon’s laptop compartment is well-padded and lined with soft fleece to prevent surface scratches. With all of the thought and care that clearly went into the design of this backpack, we were surprised that the laptop compartment isn’t raised up from the bottom of the bag. However, since the bottom of the compartment has a padded flap to soften any impact in that area, it isn’t a dealbreaker.</p>
<p>We were impressed with the Icon’s sturdy construction and standout intuitive design; the other backpacks in our lineup felt floppy and second-rate by comparison. With its solid, square base, the Icon is the only backpack in our lineup that stands up easily on its own, whether it’s empty or filled to bursting. Because of its clean, structured design, the Icon is not bulky and lays relatively flat against the body.</p>

<p>This pack is made of durable materials, with an 840D ballistic nylon exterior, thick cushioning and smooth zippers that seemed incapable of snagging. In our rain-shower tests, water simply beaded up and rolled right off the Icon’s water-resistant surface.</p>
<p>The Icon is also a standout in terms of fit, with three sets of adjustable straps that can be fine-tuned for different heights and body types: shoulder straps, a sternum strap (adjustable both laterally and vertically) and load stabilizer straps on each shoulder to tighten or loosen depending on how much weight you’re carrying.</p>
<p>The Icon’s top carrying handle and shoulder straps are well-padded and comfortable, with cushioning that extends across the trapezius area for additional comfort and weight distribution. The bag’s back plate, while supportive, is made of dense foam that some may find a bit too stiff.</p>
<p>This backpack gets bonus points for its sleek monochrome design, which is sophisticated enough to transition easily from college to the workplace.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The InCase &#8211; Icon is superbly organized with a variety of well-placed pockets and compartments for virtually anything you would want to bring on campus.</li>
<li>The Icon features a well-padded, fleece-lined laptop compartment. Though it isn’t positioned above the bottom of the pack, the compartment base includes cushioning to soften impact.</li>
<li>Made of durable 840D ballistic nylon that’s truly water-resistant, the Icon features high-quality materials throughout, including smooth zippers and thick shoulder cushioning. The foam back plate, though a little stiff, provides good back support.</li>
</ul>

<p>Coming in second place is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MTQ663B/?tag=ybdbpack-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fjallraven &#8211; Raven 28</a>. Unlike its boxy hipster cousin, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G4ZYFXI/?tag=ybdbpack-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fjallraven Kanken</a>, the Raven 28 is a more classically shaped backpack that’s reminiscent of Jansport’s old <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018JIU2C/?tag=ybdbpack-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">standby</a>. As its name suggests, the Raven 28 has a spacious 28-liter capacity. This gives it more breathing room than our top pick, the InCase &#8211; Icon, though considerably less structure (the Raven cannot stand up vertically on its own).</p>
<p>The bag’s back compartment includes a well-padded laptop sleeve partially lined in fleece fabric and positioned above the bottom of the bag, as well as a tablet sleeve. The center compartment is pocketless and cavernous, making it perfect for large items like books, binders and gym clothes. The two front compartments include a good number of open sleeves and zippered pockets for pens, keys and other odds and ends. A small, fleece-lined top pocket is perfect for sunglasses or a phone.</p>
<p>The Raven 28 is made of Fjallraven&#8217;s durable G-1000 fabric (65% polyester and 35% cotton), which is treated with Greenland Wax and touted as water-resistant and quick-drying. However, in our tests the Raven 28’s exterior wasn’t as impervious as that of the InCase &#8211; Icon; though water did bead up and flow off its surface, the G-1000 fabric took longer to dry. Regardless, the items inside the backpack did remain dry.</p>

<p>Unlike the Icon’s three-point adjustment system, the Raven 28’s shoulder straps are only adjustable at one point. However, they are nicely cushioned, and we found the pack comfortable to wear for an extended period of time. The Raven’s back plate is well-padded but not too stiff; some may find it more comfortable than the Icon’s structured back plate. We thought the bag’s leather-top handle could use at least a little padding.</p>
<p>The Raven 28 has a nicely understated look; the only wink to the popular Fjallraven brand is its fox logo, stitched onto a little leather patch on its front pocket. Though not as office-appropriate as the InCase Icon, the Raven 28 is a durable and all-around great campus companion for college students.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The 28-liter Fjallraven &#8211; Raven 28 provides spacious storage and plenty of pockets for on-campus essentials, including a well-padded laptop compartment positioned above the bottom of the pack.</li>
<li>The Raven 28 features strong, durable construction and high-quality, water-resistant materials.</li>
<li>Though not as structured as the InCase &#8211; Icon, the Raven 28 is well-cushioned and comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="others">Other products we tested</h2>
<p>Though the InCase &#8211; Icon and Fjallraven &#8211; Raven 28 stood out as the best backpacks for college students with laptops, the other backpacks in our lineup were high performers as well.</p>

<p>We liked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M480ON4/?tag=ybdbpack-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Timbuk2 &#8211; Spire</a>’s cool rolltop look and well-protected laptop compartment, which was positioned above the bottom of the pack. However, the pack’s single large compartment is quite large and would benefit from more separation and organization. We were also annoyed by the top flap’s hook closure, which was consistently awkward to unlatch, as well as its noisy Velcro flap, which would be disruptive in class and the library.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HNAC7J6/?tag=ybdbpack-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SwissGear &#8211; 1900 ScanSmart</a> is very comfortable and supportive to wear, but we were disappointed with its odd laptop compartment, which only has a single strap to hold our computer in place. It simply didn’t feel secure enough for our 15-inch MacBook Pro.</p>
<h3>North Face &#8211; Recon</h3>

<p>We had similar issues with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07657ZZ4M/?tag=ybdbpack-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">North Face &#8211; Recon</a>, which is roomy and well-constructed with a weak laptop compartment, and lacking the padding and support needed for proper protection. The Recon’s thin fabric also felt too flimsy for carrying a heavy load of electronics and books around campus.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>It’s essential for a college student’s backpack to have a well-protected laptop compartment, as well as a good balance of comfort and durability.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KSYM4Q6/?tag=ybdbpack-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InCase &#8211; Icon</a> has these qualities in spades. An intuitively designed backpack featuring sturdy structure, hardy materials and a wealth of organization pockets and compartments, the Icon is our top pick for college students.</p>
<p>Our runner-up is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MTQ663B/?tag=ybdbpack-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fjallraven &#8211; Raven 28</a>, a classically designed, spacious backpack that’s comfortable to wear and made of durable materials.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We tested ten of the best drywall anchors and found that the E-Z Ancor - Toggle Anchor is ideal for mounting decor without a stud for support.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e found eight of the strongest and most innovative products that will help you install your decor and even moderately-heavy shelves on standard drywall without a wooden or metal stud for support. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2JVJE2/?tag=ybddrwlanch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">E-Z Ancor &#8211; Toggle Anchor</a> is the best drywall anchor for most jobs, with easy self-drilling installation and enough support for moderately heavy loads. If you need maximum strength, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0050SWSWU/?tag=ybddrwlanch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wing-Its &#8211; Master Anchor</a> will hold fast until you pull your wall apart, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001KVMNPI/?tag=ybddrwlanch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Monkey Hooks</a> are great for decorating.</p>
<h2>How we selected</h2>
<p>Everyone who owns a screwdriver probably knows that drywall isn&#8217;t strong enough by itself to support cabinets, flat-screen TVs or large mirrors. But many of us need a way to mount in a specific location without the support of a wooden stud, and few of us can add a brace just for decorating.</p>
<p>Every handyman has different preferences for fasteners, and drywall anchors see a lot of debate. We looked for recommendations from handyman blogs, forums, and publications like This Old House to narrow down what we were expecting from anchors we found.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/lHb-Tcvkn7M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProjectFarm&#8217;s channel on YouTube</a> has an admirable dedication to thorough testing of products like these, so we were eager to check well-reviewed products they didn&#8217;t test and to verify their results.</p>
<p>After compiling a list of all the top recommended anchors, we eliminated basic options that weren&#8217;t at least rated to the strength of an easy-to-use self-drilling anchor like the Toggler &#8211; SnapSkru. We also eliminated options like molly bolts that require extra work for little return in actual strength for a drywall installation.</p>
<p>When multiple vendors made the same product, we picked the option with better reviews, a better price or better availability. (In that order of priority.)</p>
<p>We tested a cast-zinc anchor that is supposed to help in situations where you might accidentally hit a stud, but it fared so poorly in testing (it held half the weight of pop-open plastic anchors) we didn&#8217;t include it in the final list.</p>
<h2>Important features to consider</h2>

<p><strong>Installation type</strong> &#8211; If you&#8217;re handy with a screw gun, you probably won&#8217;t blink at pre-drilling holes, but you can save a lot of time with self-drilling anchors. Hammer-in anchors are also an option, though pushing through the drywall backing paper can tear it and make a weak spot. A sharp awl and a drywall saw can be even easier than a drill, so long as you keep your hole centered.</p>
<p><strong>Support type &#8211;</strong> Pop-open anchors are easy to install and hold well compared to drywall alone, but if you want to hold up a shelf you need an anchor that spreads the weight out. The biggest factor in anchor strength for most applications is how well the anchor spreads tensile load (pulling away from the wall) across a wide area of the inside of the drywall sheet. Look for a two-piece design with a brace inside the wall that clamps down when you tighten your screw through the anchor.</p>
<p><strong>Reusable designs &#8211;</strong> Some anchors will pop out of the wall easily when you remove the screw, but others will require prying or even poking around with wire inside the screw hole to straighten the flip-out anchor so you can pull it out. A few designs are basically permanent, so you need to make a larger hole to remove them.</p>
<p><strong>Hole and flange size &#8211;</strong> If you&#8217;ve got the world&#8217;s strongest anchor but it leaves an ugly plastic flange sticking out past the edge of your shelf bracket, it&#8217;s not much help. Some anchors also require making holes in your wall as big as 3/4&#8243;.</p>
<p><strong>Screw size &#8211;</strong> If you&#8217;ve got a particular bracket you need to bolt to the wall, note the size of the holes and compare your options. A small high-strength machine screw can still work with a larger bracket hole if you add a fender washer, but an oversize screw won&#8217;t go through a small hole unless you get out the drill.</p>
