								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter testing six top designs for power, efficiency and easy handling, we chose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075F8DZQV/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kenmore &#8211; Elite</a> as the best canister vacuum. The unique multi-mode floor head switches quickly between carpets and bare floors, and the power and dust control on this model are competitive with popular dealer-sold vacuums going for double or triple the price. If you&#8217;re not sure about the long hose of a canister vacuum but want more flexibility than an upright, the bagless <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex</a> has the best features from both types.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>After testing <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuums</a>, <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">upright vacuums</a>, <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-car-vacuum/">car vacuums</a> and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vacuums for pet hair</a>, we turned our attention to the prestigious category dominated by thousand-dollar European super-vacuums beloved by enthusiasts (and dealers, if not repair technicians) worldwide.</p>
<p>We thought long and hard about a budget for this review. We read all about Miele, Riccar, Sebo and other well-known makers who have canister vacuums that compete for shelf space at vacuum dealers. Miele is especially notable, since they consistently take top scores in publications like Consumer Reports and even the usually-budget-conscious Wirecutter. We also talked to vacuum dealers and watched them demonstrate these luxury vacuums and rave about their power, longevity and long-term value.</p>
<p>After our pet vacuum tester&#8217;s lackluster experience with his own Miele &#8211; Calima, though, we thought long and hard about how to qualify value for a general review. </p>
<p>Given how well our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuum</a> and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">upright vacuum review</a> winners handle the same situations a canister excels in, we settled on a high-but-comparable $450 price maximum as a first criteria. This eliminated even the least-expensive Miele models with a power head, like the $700 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XHQJKKD/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Compact C2 Electro+</a>. Other high-end brands were even farther out of reach.</p>
<p>We think you should know these prestige brands are out there, and if you&#8217;re researching canister vacuums you&#8217;ve almost certainly heard people rave about them, but none of our team members could imagine spending $700 to $1200 on a vacuum given how good the less expensive brands have become.</p>
<p>Looking for results of vacuum tests that weren&#8217;t specifically dealer-sponsored advertisements, we quickly found that Kenmore is the only major seller of canister vacuums with filtration and carpet-cleaning features we&#8217;ve come to expect in this middle-tier price range.</p>
<p>We also looked at consumer satisfaction numbers from Consumer Reports and J.D. Power, along with retailer customer reviews and YouTube reviews, to pick three more competing designs that could fit into tighter budgets along with the mid-range Kenmore and Shark vacuums.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, a canister vacuum separates the motor and dust receptacle from the tools you hold with a long hose. Most of the weight of the vacuum is in the &#8220;canister&#8221; that follows you around on the floor, so you&#8217;re more free to move around and reach tight places.</p>
<p>Canister vacuums have the advantage in smaller rooms. The low-profile head of a canister vacuum’s pickup tool fits under furniture, and the lower weight makes tight corners less tiring. The drawbacks start when you have to move the canister body while you’re vacuuming.</p>
<p>An upright vacuum, by comparison, really shines if you need to clean up and down a carpeted hall or over a large open space. The cord is usually long enough that you can finish the job without unplugging, and you won’t have to drag a canister along behind you.</p>
<p>Canister vacuums are popular in Europe, and upright vacuums are overwhelmingly more popular among American homeowners. This shift probably comes down to a difference in floor plans, with spread-out wall-to-wall carpeting floorspace favoring uprights versus the bare floors and staircases of old-world architecture.</p>
<h3>Air vs. electric brushrolls</h3>
<p>For cleaning carpet, a spinning brush roller works much better than suction alone by agitating the carpet and sweeping up the dirt and hair as they bounce around. This is a defining trait of most upright vacuums, but you can get a brushroll head for many canister vacuums.</p>
<p>Canisters often come only with air-turbine-powered brushroll tools, though, which means that the flow of air spins a turbine that powers the brushroll. That&#8217;s better than no roller at all on low-pile carpet. However, we found when testing the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">best pet hair vacuums</a> against our writer&#8217;s own air-driven <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S1AGM30/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Miele &#8211; Calima</a> that even expensive turbine heads are poor at picking up hair, and they don&#8217;t have enough power to agitate long-pile carpet.</p>
<p>For this review, we tested two canister vacuums from Kenmore that use motorized brushrolls, and one turbine-powered system from Electrolux.</p>
<h3>A third way: Shark&#8217;s Lift-Away system</h3>
<p>Shark’s “Lift-Away” vacuum design tries to split the difference between a canister and an upright: When you want to separate the bulky motor housing from the floor tools you can just push a button and detach it. The hose is very short compared to a purpose-built canister system, but it has many of the same strengths when you need to vacuum under a bed or on carpeted stairs.</p>
<p>Note that among Shark models, only the more expensive &#8220;powered lift-away&#8221; models like the Apex can run the brushroll motor when the base is detached. We&#8217;ve tested the value-oriented Navigator in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">best upright vacuum review</a> and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">best pet hair vacuum review</a>, but we only compared the more versatile Apex against canister vacuums.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Appropriate floor tools:</b> If you only need to clean bare floors, the most basic sweeping heads will work quite well at picking up dirt. As soon as you need to work on carpet, though, an electric rotary-brush head helps shake out and capture more dirt.</p>
<p><b>Bagged vs. bagless system: </b>Most popular canister vacuums still use bags to capture dirt, despite upright vacuums switching almost entirely to bagless designs. Bags often capture fine dust better, and they can make it easier to dispose of what you&#8217;ve vacuumed up if you don&#8217;t have the option of stepping outside to empty it.</p>
<p><b>Hose length:</b> The length of a hose will determine how much area you can clean before you have to start dragging the motor around.</p>
<p><b>Retractable cord: </b>While the canister design means that you&#8217;ve always got a hose taking up space in the closet, a common convenience on these vacuums is a retractable power cord.</p>
<p><b>Height control:</b> On the plushest carpet, wheels that lift the brushroll head above the ends of the fibers will allow you to continue gliding smoothly even with strong suction power and strong agitation from a brushroll.</p>
<p><b>Onboard tool storage: </b>Specialized tools for detail cleaning are handy to have, but if there&#8217;s no place to keep them on the vacuum itself, many of us will keep them in a box and forget about them quickly.</p>
<p><b>HEPA-class filters</b>: High-efficiency particulate air filters (almost always called HEPA-class) are defined by the U.S. Department of Energy as filters trapping 99.97% of tiny 0.3-micron particles that pass through. If the manufacturer doesn&#8217;t specify HEPA filtration, you&#8217;re almost certainly blowing a lot of fine dust into the air when you vacuum.</p>
<p><b>Sealed-system airflow:</b> Expensive filters are needed to capture allergy-triggering dust, but if your vacuum isn&#8217;t well-sealed, some of that dust will just leak out all the same.</p>

<h3>Cleaning</h3>
<p>The critical tests for a vacuum involve, of course, cleaning floors. But the features that make a vacuum excellent on tile floors may not be as good on wall-to-wall carpet, area rugs or hardwood.</p>
<p>We sprinkled samples of precisely weighed debris samples on carpet, then weighed the bags or canisters of the vacuums after to see how much of the dirt was recovered. On bare floors, we put down the same dirt as well as cereal and tested for scatter and efficient pick up of the biggest pieces.</p>
<p>A powered &#8220;beater&#8221; brushroll makes a big difference getting sand and dirt out of carpet, and it was easy to see the impact of agitation and brushing in the results.</p>
[table id=322 /]
<p>The turbine-powered brushroll on the Electrolux &#8211; EL4021A didn&#8217;t help much, though. It got stuck in longer carpet fibers and was only slightly more effective than the bare-floor tools included in less expensive vacuums. The height control on the Kenmore heads gave the biggest advantage in long-pile carpet, but Shark&#8217;s dual-brush system performed almost just as well.</p>
<p>Too much suction will make it hard to move a vacuum over thick carpet, or even get caught on the edges of area rugs. All of these canister vacuums offer some way to either slow down the suction motor or allow some air to bypass through a vent. That makes them more versatile than even the most prestigious brands in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">upright vacuum review</a> that just got bogged down or stuck.</p>
<h3>Suction</h3>
<p>In order to compare the raw power of these vacuum motors, we plugged them each into a vacuum gauge rig and noted the maximum amount of negative pressure made by the motors.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25539" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test.jpg" alt="Suction test" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The difference in power between the most expensive and least expensive groups is worth noting, but all of these vacuums have enough power to easily pick up heavy sand and debris on all floor types. For carpet, the higher suction numbers won&#8217;t really help without excellent height control, or a more complex brushroll system like the Shark &#8211; Apex uses.</p>
<h3>HEPA filter</h3>
<p>We logged air quality readings with a Dylos particle counter before, during and after our cleaning tests to see how well the HEPA-class filters in some models actually capture dust. These tests weren&#8217;t performed in a sealed room, but the air was cleaned to a baseline level between tests with the Winix air purifier from our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-air-purifier/">air purifier review</a> running for five minutes.</p>
<p>The readings after vacuuming showed even most HEPA-filter vacuums kicking up three times more large dust particles into the air than we measured at the start of the test — on average from 13 up to 48 parts per million (PPM). The worst case was the Bissell &#8211; Zing: Its basic foam filter didn&#8217;t catch much dust, and there was ten times the starting level in the air after vacuuming.</p>
<p>Between its strong airflow and effective filter design, the Kenmore &#8211; Elite made an impressive 20% improvement in air quality compared to starting conditions — a powerful sealed-system vacuum can actually clean your air as well as your floor.</p>

<p>We didn&#8217;t carefully time the vacuuming time on this test, only analyzing the performance while actively cleaning our test carpet. In past tests, we&#8217;ve seen that a good vacuum from Shark or Dyson can clean the air if it&#8217;s left running for a few minutes, but the Kenmore did that even while cleaning the floor.</p>
[table id=323 /]
<h3>Noise</h3>
<p>We tested all of the vacuums from the same distance, at ear-height while moving the vacuums as they would be used for cleaning. We used a meter with an &#8220;A-weighted&#8221; frequency bias, which emphasizes the effect of bothersome high-pitch sounds and is the standard method to measure noise (rather than something like music).</p>
<p>The winner of this test was no surprise. The Shark &#8211; Apex won our pick for <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">best upright vacuum</a> and is the quietest vacuum we&#8217;ve ever used: With the brushroll turned down to bare-floor mode the suction motor puts out 88 dBA, about as loud as the average level of film dialog in most movie theaters. Turning up the brushroll speed for carpet increased the noise to a fairly normal 93 dBA, very close to the same volume as the more expensive Kenmore &#8211; Elite.</p>
<p>By comparison, the air-powered brushroll on the Eureka brought the noise level up to 102 decibels — definitely not something you&#8217;ll want to use early in the morning.</p>
<h3>Storage and ergonomics</h3>
[table id=324 /]
<p>The biggest advantage of a canister vacuum is the long reach offered by the hose, but compared to <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">the best upright vacuums</a> or <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuums</a>, that&#8217;s also a downside when you need to put it in the closet. As a consolation, most of these canister vacuums offer collapsing wands and retracting power cords to keep the storage as simple as possible.</p>
<p>An adjustable-length attachment wand is mostly important for reaching high ceilings or vacuuming on top of furniture with a detail brush, but some shorter or taller people may also find vacuuming the floor easier after adjusting the length of the wand.</p>
<p>Probably the most important factor for ease of use is the location of the vacuum&#8217;s controls. Usually only the most expensive vacuums give you power and brushroll control switches on the handle; less expensive models require you to reach down to the base of the vacuum or tap buttons with your foot.</p>
<h3>Tools and accessories</h3>
[table id=325 /]
<p>One accessory that sets apart the most expensive vacuums is a small powered rotary-brush tool, specifically designed for grabbing pet hair that sticks to furniture. Less-expensive vacuums sometimes include an air-powered version that might be worth trying out, but those are ineffective for tougher jobs like cleaning carpeted stairs.</p>
<p>All models we tested include a detail brush and a crevice tool to get into furniture cracks. The best models also include a place to keep every tool so they won&#8217;t get lost in your closet.</p>
<h2 id="top-pick">Top pick: Kenmore &#8211; Elite</h2>

<p>If you want a top-class canister vacuum with great suction power and a versatile cleaning head that will handle both carpet and bare floors, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075F8DZQV/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kenmore &#8211; Elite 21814 Crossover</a> is our choice.</p>
<p>This has all the strengths of a top-of-the-line canister vacuum system: It&#8217;s lightweight, has excellent organization features for easy storage and a bagged dirt collection system that captures more fine dust and makes disposal easy.</p>
<p>Kenmore gives you all these features for less than $500. Given that the canister vacuums you&#8217;ll find at vacuum dealers will usually cost $800 or even $1200 for a comparable feature set, it&#8217;s a bargain.</p>
<h3>Multi-surface design</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kenmore-crossover-mode.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Rather than having a separate head for carpet and bare-floor cleaning, Kenmore gives you a convertible system called the “Crossover&#8221; head. The bare-floor tool snaps into the carpet head, and it&#8217;s easy to lift out with the press of a foot lever.</p>
<p>The Crossover head is a very good carpet head, with an easy-to-adjust height control and a heavy hardwood agitator brushroll that will help you get dirt out of your carpet. This head is easier to steer on carpet than the less expensive Kenmore design, though not quite as refined as the Shark.</p>
<h3>The most powerful vacuum cleaner</h3>
<p>The Kenmore &#8211; Elite has the best suction power of all the vacuums we&#8217;ve tested — even 5% better than the new motor design in the Apex — pulling minus 23 kilopascals of air pressure. That makes it excellent for getting dirt out of floor cracks and picking crumbs out of your couch.</p>
<p>Moving up the handle, the premium features that set the Elite apart from other canister vacuums in the under-$500 price bracket are handle-mounted control. You can turn the vacuum on and activate or deactivate the brushroll without bending over, and you can also control the level of suction bypass with an easy-to-use slider. This means you&#8217;ve got full manual control of the vacuum, making it easier to move from bare floors to small area rugs to full carpet.</p>
<h3>Best vacuum for allergies</h3>
<p>It’s a high-quality vacuum just by itself, but Kenmore also gives you excellent filtration. We were also impressed by the performance of other sealed systems like the Shark in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">pet hair vacuum tests</a>, but the Kenmore was about 20% better at capturing fine dust.</p>

<p>When you&#8217;ve got a complete line of accessory tools, it&#8217;s important that the vacuum provides a good place to keep them all. Fortunately Kenmore did just that with the Elite, so you don&#8217;t have to hunt in your closet for missing tools when it&#8217;s time to clean your blinds.</p>
<p>Like most good canister vacuums, the Kenmore includes a retractable power cord. There&#8217;s an adjustable-length wand that goes from 43 to 55 inches, both for the comfort of taller or shorter users and for reaching up to the ceiling with the cleaning brush attachments.</p>
<p>The Kenmore &#8211; Elite is designed to sit securely on a stair, and it does that job well. There&#8217;s even an included Pet PowerMate miniature brush head that makes quick touch-up jobs easy. It&#8217;s better for cleaning dog hair off of sofa cushions than it is for a full staircase job, but at least it won&#8217;t stall out on carpet like turbine-powered tools do.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>For the most power and great features, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075F8DZQV/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kenmore &#8211; Elite 21814 Crossover</a> competes with vacuums that cost double or triple this price.</li>
<li>The full-size bare floor head and powered carpet head dock together for quickly changing between floor types.</li>
<li>The included HEPA-class filtration works well enough to clean your air while you vacuum.</li>
<li>It was the quietest of the conventional canisters we tested, even at full power.</li>
<li>This is a big vacuum, only slightly more nimble than an upright.</li>

<h2 id="bagless-pick">Bagless pick: Shark &#8211; Apex</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25538" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo.jpg" alt="Shark - Apex" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We chose to include the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex</a> lift-away vacuum in this roundup of canister designs because it represents a unique set of attributes at an excellent value. This is more closely related to an upright vacuum than a canister, but it&#8217;s one of the few uprights that makes just as much sense for a household that would typically prefer a canister design.</p>
<p>While most traditional vacuums basically force you to switch between a rotary-brush head for effective carpet cleaning and a simpler suction-only head for bare floors, Shark has pioneered the use of a thick, soft roller that captures dirt on bare floors and doesn&#8217;t just throw it around before it gets sucked in. They call this a &#8220;DuoClean&#8221; brush system, and it works effectively on all the floor types we&#8217;ve tried.</p>
<p>The Shark is also more agile than other fully-powered brushroll systems, and it has handle-switched lower-power settings that will keep it from eating up area rugs. For mixed flooring types, this vacuum is just as good as the Kenmore Elite, but you can&#8217;t shed the weight of the brushroll for quicker coverage of large bare-floor surfaces.</p>
<h3>Also the best for pet hair</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/brushspin.mov" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The Apex also features Shark&#8217;s new &#8220;Zero-M&#8221; system, which actively combs out hairs so they don&#8217;t get wrapped around the roller. This makes the Shark &#8211; Apex the best canister vacuum for pet hair, or even for extra-long human hair. You&#8217;ll only ever catch a few strands on the roller, which eliminates the maintenance needed on traditional roller designs.</p>
<p>Bagless designs usually aren&#8217;t quite as good at capturing fine dust, but part of what makes this Shark the best bagless canister vacuum is a HEPA filter that worked better than the rest (including Dyson&#8217;s) in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">review of upright vacuums</a>. Against the tougher competition of bagged canister vacuums, the Apex let more fine dust into the air than Kenmore&#8217;s top-of-the-line sealed bag system did. The difference is only about 20%, and the Shark captured more large dust particles, so we&#8217;re happy with this performance considering the other advantages of the system.</p>
<p>Shark also includes the obligatory mini-power-brush for cleaning dog hair off your sofa. It’s powered by an electric motor so it won&#8217;t just stall out the way cheaper versions of this attachment do if you try to use them on your stairs.</p>
<p>Most of Shark&#8217;s accessories have a handy storage spot, but the various model numbers (we tested the AZ1000W) may include accessory brushes that don&#8217;t have a home.</p>

The soft rollers work well on all surfaces, but the hose is short in canister mode.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<h3>The drawbacks</h3>
<p>There are a few things we don&#8217;t like about the Shark in canister mode.</p>
<p>The lack of wheels for the motor canister unit and the very short hose mean you&#8217;re basically forced to carry the motor around in one hand while you vacuum, rather than towing it behind you as you work through tight spaces. The agility of Shark&#8217;s motorized brush head makes steering with one hand no problem, but if you&#8217;ve got a large room to cover you&#8217;ll definitely want to use upright mode most of the time.</p>
<p>The Shark doesn&#8217;t have a retractable cord. That&#8217;s not the most important feature on a vacuum, but it&#8217;s a standard on canister designs and makes storage easier. Retractable cord systems add weight and the Apex is already a heavy vacuum as it is, but on a premium-tier vacuum, we&#8217;d like to see some innovation beyond the bare-bones wrapping system.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re only interested in a canister vacuum for tricky spots like vacuuming under a coffee table and on the stairs, the Shark &#8211; Apex will handle those jobs well while serving as a full-featured multi-surface upright vacuum the rest of the time.</p>
<p>If you think the short-hose lift-away mode will meet your needs, but you&#8217;re not interested in using it on carpet, and you want to save some money, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Navigator</a> was a runner-up in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">best upright vacuum review</a> and winner of our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">best pet hair vacuum review</a>. It&#8217;s still excellent at cleaning carpets in an upright configuration while giving acceptable performance in lift-away mode on bare floors.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex</a> has more versatility than any other vacuum we&#8217;ve looked at.</li>
<li>Ideal if you only need canister-style flexibility in a few places.</li>
<li>A sealed bagless design and HEPA filter manage dust very well.</li>
<li>Shark&#8217;s new brush design prevents pet hair from tangling.</li>
<li>Soft, powered rollers are excellent on everything from hardwood to carpet.</li>

<p>Choosing a canister vacuum without a powered carpet head was tricky, since the bare-floor cleaning that these vacuums are best at isn&#8217;t particularly complicated. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075PKTS85/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissell &#8211; Zing</a> offers good power at a very affordable price, and it doesn&#8217;t skimp on the details.</p>
<p>The Zing offers basically the same two-mode floor-cleaning head as the other sub-$300 vacuums we tested, with a bristle-down position for gliding across hardwood and tile and a bristle-retracted mode for sliding along low-pile carpet.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t try to use a basic canister vacuum like this for medium-pile or longer carpet; it&#8217;ll just get stuck. You can turn down the suction to make gliding along easier, but at that point you&#8217;re not really vacuuming up much dirt. The Bissell &#8211; Zing did manage to pull slightly more dirt out of our test carpet than the other non-powered heads in our test, but it was a very difficult process.</p>

For bare floors and cleaning tight spots, this is a tool that will get the job done efficiently.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075PKTS85/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Bissell also lacks the HEPA filter featured on more expensive canisters, and it threw five times more dust particles into the air than the closest competition. That said, vacuuming when nobody will be in a room for a few hours, then running an <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-air-purifier/">air purifier</a> or opening a window and using a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-tower-fan/">tower fan</a>, can take care of that problem.</p>
<p>The biggest strength of the Bissell is simplicity. You still get essential features, like a retractable power cord and adjustable-length wand, but the only accessory comes in the form of a clip-on brush and crevice multi-purpose tool.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>For less than $75, the Bissell &#8211; Zing is a compact, effective vacuum.</li>
<li>The bare-floor tool serves its intended function well.</li>
<li>Storage and handling features are surprisingly refined.</li>
<li>This bagged system only has basic dust filtering.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t bother with a vacuum like this for carpet or area rugs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Kenmore &#8211; 200 Series</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25535" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series.jpg" alt="Kenmore - 200 series" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>If you want a powered brushroll for some carpet-cleaning tasks but don&#8217;t need all the other features of the Kenmore &#8211; Elite, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075F4YTVF/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kenmore &#8211; 81214 200 Series</a> canister vacuum is an affordable mid-range option.</p>
<p>For about a $200 savings compared to the Elite, you&#8217;ve given up handle-mounted controls, the bigger bare-floor tool, two feet of hose length, noise reduction, dust capture performance and more agile steering. This isn&#8217;t a vacuum we&#8217;d choose above other designs unless budget were the primary consideration.</p>
<p>Compared to the other sub-$300 vacuums we tested, you still get a motorized height-adjustable carpet head and a powerful suction motor. The small bare-floor head and difficult steering on carpet really handicap this model in most households where a mid-range canister vacuum makes sense, though.</p>
<h3>Electrolux &#8211; EL4021A</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25532" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux.jpg" alt="Electrolux" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J8AYAT4/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Electrolux &#8211; EL4021A</a> is a bagless canister vacuum from a well-regarded manufacturer, but its middle-tier features and performance make it hard to recommend.</p>
<p>Most confusing of the results from our tests were the air quality results for this model: Despite the advertised HEPA filter, this vacuum kicked up just as much dust as the non-HEPA Bissell model.</p>
<p>Electrolux includes a turbine-powered carpet head with this model, and that was also a disappointment. It&#8217;s incredibly loud, and stalls out quickly on anything thicker than tight-knit carpet like Berber. The Electrolux was light and fairly easy to maneuver, but for cleaning performance the Kenmore &#8211; 200 Series has it totally beat.</p>
<h3>Eureka &#8211; Mighty Mite Pet Lover</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25533" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka.jpg" alt="Eureka" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>For those looking at budget vacuums but are still in need of dust filtration, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0019KOFEC/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; Mighty Mite Pet Lover</a> takes a popular utility vacuum design and literally clips an extra filter to the back.</p>
<p>The Mighty Mite isn&#8217;t a bad little vacuum, but the price increase to get the HEPA filter is hard to swallow. Compared to the Bissell &#8211; Zing, you get bigger detailing tools (with some onboard storage) but give up some airflow on account of the filter. You can attach the hose to the exhaust side of this canister for situations when you want a blower, but you&#8217;re better off buying an inexpensive <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-leaf-blower/">leaf blower</a> for most situations where that would be an asset.</p>
<p>The included air-turbine-powered pet-hair brush isn&#8217;t good on carpet, and there&#8217;s no place to store it on the vacuum so most owners will likely lose it quickly.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re seriously considering the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014P3BL5U/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">less expensive Eureka &#8211; 3670h</a> without the $40 filter, look closely at the Bissell &#8211; Zing first. The retractable cord is a worthwhile upgrade for most households.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Canister vacuums aren&#8217;t as popular in North America as upright vacuums, but we&#8217;ve tested and compared them in situations where they make the most sense: Tight quarters, bare-floor cleaning and situations where the extra dust control from a bagged system is a key asset.</p>
<p>With those parameters, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075F8DZQV/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kenmore &#8211; Elite</a> is a clear winner for anyone who also needs to deal with carpeted floors. The power, filter performance, ease of use and flexibility of this system are competitive with the better-known European brands, but at one-third the price.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re covering enough floor that you&#8217;re trying to decide between a canister and upright vacuum, the convertible <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex</a> has most of the flexibility on stairs and in tight spaces as a canister, but is much better on open ground. It&#8217;s easily the best bagless vacuum we&#8217;ve tested.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you&#8217;re looking for an inexpensive canister vacuum with only a bare floor head, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075PKTS85/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissell &#8211; Zing</a> is our budget pick. It doesn&#8217;t have the filter or carpet-cleaning prowess of other vacuums, but it has plenty of power for the price.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We tested ten of the best drywall anchors and found that the E-Z Ancor - Toggle Anchor is ideal for mounting decor without a stud for support.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e found eight of the strongest and most innovative products that will help you install your decor and even moderately-heavy shelves on standard drywall without a wooden or metal stud for support. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2JVJE2/?tag=ybddrwlanch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">E-Z Ancor &#8211; Toggle Anchor</a> is the best drywall anchor for most jobs, with easy self-drilling installation and enough support for moderately heavy loads. If you need maximum strength, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0050SWSWU/?tag=ybddrwlanch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wing-Its &#8211; Master Anchor</a> will hold fast until you pull your wall apart, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001KVMNPI/?tag=ybddrwlanch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Monkey Hooks</a> are great for decorating.</p>
<h2>How we selected</h2>
<p>Everyone who owns a screwdriver probably knows that drywall isn&#8217;t strong enough by itself to support cabinets, flat-screen TVs or large mirrors. But many of us need a way to mount in a specific location without the support of a wooden stud, and few of us can add a brace just for decorating.</p>
<p>Every handyman has different preferences for fasteners, and drywall anchors see a lot of debate. We looked for recommendations from handyman blogs, forums, and publications like This Old House to narrow down what we were expecting from anchors we found.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/lHb-Tcvkn7M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProjectFarm&#8217;s channel on YouTube</a> has an admirable dedication to thorough testing of products like these, so we were eager to check well-reviewed products they didn&#8217;t test and to verify their results.</p>
<p>After compiling a list of all the top recommended anchors, we eliminated basic options that weren&#8217;t at least rated to the strength of an easy-to-use self-drilling anchor like the Toggler &#8211; SnapSkru. We also eliminated options like molly bolts that require extra work for little return in actual strength for a drywall installation.</p>
<p>When multiple vendors made the same product, we picked the option with better reviews, a better price or better availability. (In that order of priority.)</p>
<p>We tested a cast-zinc anchor that is supposed to help in situations where you might accidentally hit a stud, but it fared so poorly in testing (it held half the weight of pop-open plastic anchors) we didn&#8217;t include it in the final list.</p>
<h2>Important features to consider</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/drywall-16-9.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p><strong>Installation type</strong> &#8211; If you&#8217;re handy with a screw gun, you probably won&#8217;t blink at pre-drilling holes, but you can save a lot of time with self-drilling anchors. Hammer-in anchors are also an option, though pushing through the drywall backing paper can tear it and make a weak spot. A sharp awl and a drywall saw can be even easier than a drill, so long as you keep your hole centered.</p>
<p><strong>Support type &#8211;</strong> Pop-open anchors are easy to install and hold well compared to drywall alone, but if you want to hold up a shelf you need an anchor that spreads the weight out. The biggest factor in anchor strength for most applications is how well the anchor spreads tensile load (pulling away from the wall) across a wide area of the inside of the drywall sheet. Look for a two-piece design with a brace inside the wall that clamps down when you tighten your screw through the anchor.</p>
<p><strong>Reusable designs &#8211;</strong> Some anchors will pop out of the wall easily when you remove the screw, but others will require prying or even poking around with wire inside the screw hole to straighten the flip-out anchor so you can pull it out. A few designs are basically permanent, so you need to make a larger hole to remove them.</p>
<p><strong>Hole and flange size &#8211;</strong> If you&#8217;ve got the world&#8217;s strongest anchor but it leaves an ugly plastic flange sticking out past the edge of your shelf bracket, it&#8217;s not much help. Some anchors also require making holes in your wall as big as 3/4&#8243;.</p>
<p><strong>Screw size &#8211;</strong> If you&#8217;ve got a particular bracket you need to bolt to the wall, note the size of the holes and compare your options. A small high-strength machine screw can still work with a larger bracket hole if you add a fender washer, but an oversize screw won&#8217;t go through a small hole unless you get out the drill.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e tested the highest-rated flip chairs to find out which one was the most versatile and comfortable. We chose <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L6YW0YI/?tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Your Zone Bed</a> as the best flip chair.

<h2 id="what-is">What is a flip chair?</h2>
<p>A flip chair is also known as a convertible or folding bed mattress. It’s composed of a repositionable metal frame, covered with a thin layer of polyurethane foam or polyester fiber and encased within a layer of foam that’s generally four inches thick. The frame and foam are fit into a polyester cover, similar to a cushioned patio lounger. The cover is usually removable for cleaning.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23578" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1335" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-1000x668@2x.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-768x513.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-885x591.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-810x541.jpg 810w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-1000x668.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-320x214.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-885x591@2x.jpg 1770w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/flipchair-testing-320x214@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>When laid out completely flat on the floor, the frame can be used as a temporary bed for overnight guests or for kids&#8217; sleepover. The frame is divided into three sections, which allow you to fold it up into a lounger with a head rest or a compact chair that can fit in a small living area or bedroom. Since the folded-up chair has no legs — usually just non-skid feet — it’s usually only about 8 inches up off the floor.</p>
<p>Flip chairs are popular with students who have small dorm rooms or people who live in studio apartments, where space is limited. They’re also great for kids’ sleepovers or for just hanging out and watching television or gaming.</p>
<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected flip chairs to test</h2>
<p>Despite flip chairs’ popularity with students and parents, there aren’t many manufacturers who make them. Some high-end furniture companies sell their version of a flip chair, but they’re more expensive than what you can find online.</p>
<p>Flip chairs are available in several sizes, but we focused our search on the standard size, which is 6-½ feet long when completely flat and 28 inches wide. That&#8217;s narrower than a twin-size bed, but similar to a camping bed. (Some Amazon reviewers of flip chairs actually do take them on camping trips, since they fit inside a tent and are more comfortable than sleeping on hard ground on a pad or sleeping bag.) The standard flip chair size is the one that’s most often purchased for dorm rooms and sleepovers, as it can be easily stored and unfolded when needed.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, flip chairs can be pricey. Although they’re not constructed of expensive materials, and sometimes the foam is not the highest quality, flip chairs can be priced at $200 or higher. We selected four flip chairs that are in the more reasonable $100 range.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L6YW0YI/?tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Your Zone Bed</a> flip chair is very similar to the other flip chairs we tested, but it’s a lot more comfortable. Its metal frame is sandwiched between two thick layers of foam, which cushion the bottom of the flip chair when it’s folded out flat. This extra foam gave an additional measure of comfort when we tested it as a bed. Also, the upper half of the foam is covered with a polyester-fiber mesh that softens the rough texture of the foam.</p>
<p>Much like other flip beds, Your Zone’s ultra-suede cover has two zippered sections: A long middle section and a headrest. None of the flip chairs’ covers have a zipper on the lower third. Consequently, the middle and upper sections can be machine washed, and the lower third can only be spot-cleaned. This section should be less prone to getting stained, but it&#8217;s something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Your Zone has five positions, which are adjusted by lifting the headrest until it locks into place. To unfold it, the headrest is pushed down to the middle section and released. When flat, Your Zone’s frame has a slight curvature that flattens when you lie down. This buckle gives the foam added flexibility, so it feels somewhat like a bed mattress.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L6YW0YI/?tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/yourzonebed-thumb-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/yourzonebed-thumb-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/yourzonebed-thumb-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/yourzonebed-thumb-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/yourzonebed-thumb-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/yourzonebed-thumb-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/yourzonebed-thumb-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/yourzonebed-thumb-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/yourzonebed-thumb.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Most Comfortable: Your Zone Bed</h3><p>A well-priced flip chair made with higher quality materials than other flip chairs, Your Zone Bed was also the most comfy for sleeping, gaming, watching TV or just lounging.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L6YW0YI/?tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>For the next position, the headrest needs to be folded over, creating a pillow (albeit, a hard one), which shortens the 6-½ foot bed by 14 inches. This second position was always the most uncomfortable with all of the flip beds we tested.</p>
<p>Third and fourth positions turn the flip chair into a lounger, which is ideal for watching television or gaming. Both give good back support, but the fourth position is a bit more elevated and more comfortable.</p>
<p>For the fifth position, the headrest is fully upright, and the bottom third folds up and onto the middle section, transforming it into a chair. It’s low to the ground, but Your Zone’s flexible foam has some give to it like sofa cushions, and we found it to be the most comfy for watching TV.</p>
<p>The Your Zone Bed flip chair is priced comparably with the other flip chairs we tested — a little over $100 — but we found it to be better constructed for comfort. If you’re looking for a versatile piece of furniture for a small space or a sleepover, this is the flip chair you should get.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Your Zone Bed flip chair is a versatile piece of furniture that can change from a comfy chair to a temporary fold-out bed anywhere and any time an extra bed is needed.</li>
<li>It’s priced about the same as other flip chairs, but it’s better constructed for comfort.</li>
<li>The Your Zone Bed flip chair is great for a dorm room or studio apartment where space is limited or for kids’ sleepovers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="others">Other flip chairs we tested</h2>
<h3>Best Choice Products &#8211; SKY1814</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VQYBXV4/?tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Best Choice Products</a> flip chair has a substantial frame that resembles a lawn or patio lounge chair. It has a pristine polyurethane foam that feels like memory foam and looks brand new. However, when the flip chair is laid flat into the bed position, the foam has an odd crunchy texture and crackles when it’s pressed down.</p>
<p>Although the Best Choice was comfortable as a bed and as an upright chair, there was no flexibility in its foam or frame, which made every other position uncomfortable. Its small non-skid feet needed to be screwed into the frame, which wasn’t difficult to do. However, the feet are screwed through the bottom of the chair’s cover, so should you ever need to wash it, the feet need to be unscrewed first; a design feature we found inconvenient.</p>
<h3>Giantex &#8211; HW52445GR</h3>
<p>In appearance, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IR61GL0/z/tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Giantex</a> is almost identical to the Your Zone Bed and Best Choice Products. It has five adjustable positions, a removable ultra-suede cover (erroneously advertised as cotton) and is approximately the same length, height and width. Three of its five positions, however, were hard and unyielding — even napping on it was unpleasant.</p>
<p>When we inspected underneath the cover, we discovered that its frame is a metal checkerboard shape, which may account for why it’s such an uncomfortable chair/bed. More disturbing was the condition of the foam: Dirty with debris and wood bits, as though it had been dragged along a factory floor. Clearly, Giantex doesn’t use high-quality foam for its overpriced product.</p>
<h3>Magshion &#8211; FCOF27</h3>
<p>Described as a folding bed mattress, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LS1OXEO/?tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Magshion</a> flip chair is actually just a foldable futon. Its polyurethane foam is divided into three equal sections and covered with a polyester-cotton cover that’s available in sixteen colors. It’s slightly shorter and narrower than other flip beds, and since it has no frame, the Magshion can’t be used as a chair unless you’re leaning up against a couch or wall.</p>
<p>It’s available in five sizes, and although the single size that we tested was $80, the other sizes are absurdly expensive for what’s little more than a lawn-furniture pad.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>A flip chair is a fun and convenient furniture option for a small room or apartment. Although their metal frames are sturdy, the foam will lose its density over time, so we wouldn’t recommend replacing a bed mattress with a flip chair. However, it’s great for short-term use or sleepovers, and we like how the flip chair can be transformed in seconds from a lounger to an upright chair.</p>
<p>The best flip chair that we tested is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L6YW0YI/?tag=ybdflip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Your Zone Bed</a>. Its flexible frame sandwiched between thick foam proved to be comfortable in all of its five adjustable positions. Whether you want to nap, hang out with friends or just lounge around with your dog or cat, the versatile Your Zone Bed flip chair will suit your needs.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e tested the most popular sit-up pillows to find the one that gives you total back support while cushioning you in comfort. Hands down, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073DJFYB1/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Linenspa</a> is the best sit-up pillow for reading in bed, watching television, gaming or any other leisure activity. Stuffed with high-quality shredded memory foam, the Linenspa is both supportive and plush at the same time. Another great choice is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0733ZCSR9/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Milliard</a> reading pillow, which is soft and cuddly but supportive of back muscles as well.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected sit-up pillows to test</h2>
<p>A sit-up pillow really has one purpose: give you back support while you’re reading or watching television in bed or on a couch. But after we read through Amazon consumer reviews, we learned that people also buy sit-up pillows to sit upright in bed after surgery or to help relieve chronic back pain.</p>
<p>The sit-up pillows we decided to test were recommended by reviewers for correcting posture while they were lounging to support back and neck muscles. But the pillows had to be comfortable, too; nobody enjoys sitting against a hard piece of foam.</p>
<p>We chose pillows that were stuffed with shredded memory foam, since it can be both firm and plush at the same time. People who buy a sit-up pillow for back pain often buy a bed wedge pillow, so we tested one of the most popular wedge pillows to see how it compared to traditional sit-up bed pillows</p>

<p>Many of the hundreds of models and styles of sit-up pillows look identical. During our testing we discovered that they’re not all alike. The following features of the best sit-up pillow will help you decide which one is right for you.</p>
<p><b>Size: </b>Most sit-up pillows have a similar shape: triangular with two armrests on each side. If you’re looking for a sit-up pillow that gives you both lower and upper back support, you’ll need one that is as tall as your entire back: The top of the pillow should reach your shoulders at the base of your neck. A shorter sit-up pillow will only support your lower back muscles, and you’ll feel the strain on your upper back muscles after a few minutes.</p>
<p>Two of the pillows we tested are available in several sizes. Before purchasing a sit-up pillow, we recommend measuring the length of your back and comparing it to the height of the pillow. We found that the extra-large size (24 inches) gives better back support to a tall person than the standard size (18 inches) does.</p>
<p><b>Long armrests: </b>Many sit-up pillows have short, stubby armrests that only reach as far as your elbows. Depending on the length of your arms, the short armrests may not even touch your elbows, which means you need to keep your arms elevated when you’re reading. Look for a sit-up pillow that has armrests that reach the base of your wrists. The extra length will support your elbows so you can hold a book and also cushion your arms when you’re watching television or just resting.</p>
<p><b>Materials: </b>All of the sit-up pillows we tested had a polyester cover, usually an ultra-suede or velour. Except for one of the pillows we tested, their covers can be removed and washed.</p>
<p>The best sit-up pillow is stuffed with shredded memory foam, which is often encased within its own separate cover. As we discussed in our reviews for the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-cooling-pillow/#important-features">best cooling pillow</a> and the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-pillow-for-side-sleepers/#features">best pillow for side sleepers</a>, the memory foam should be CertiPUR-certified. <a href="https://certipur.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CertiPUR</a> tests polyurethane foams used in bedding for hazardous contaminants. Look for a label on the sit-up pillow that it’s been CertiPUR certified; otherwise, you could be breathing in toxic gases emitted from the foam.</p>
<h2 id="prepping">Prepping a sit-up pillow</h2>
<p>Many Amazon consumers are surprised that their sit-up pillow isn’t ready for immediate use when it’s delivered. Manufacturers compress the sit-up pillow, roll it and vacuum-seal it in plastic before shipping. When the pillow arrives, it needs to be released from the plastic, laid out flat and, as suggested by instructions, allowed to expand 24 to 48 hours.</p>
<p>We found, however, that the pillows fully expanded overnight. Although it’s not stated, we suspect that the 24-to-48-hour time period is to allow for off-gassing. Memory foam is notorious for its pungent chemical odor, which eventually dissipates. Since the majority of sit-up pillows are stuffed with memory foam, it’s best practice to let the pillow air out — we aired the test pillows on an outdoor patio — for two or three days.</p>
<h2 id="best">Best Sit-Up Pillow: Linenspa</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073DJFYB1/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Linenspa</a> was, by far, the most comfortable sit-up pillow we tested. Stuffed with shredded CertiPUR-certified memory foam, the Linenspa feels supportive and plush at the same time. Imagine your most comfy chair or sofa, and you’ll get a sense of what it’s like to settle into the Linenspa.</p>
<p>We tested the generously stuffed extra-large size, which gave full-back support while we sat in bed. The Linenspa has long (15 inches) and extra-wide (10 inches) armrests — the widest of all the pillows we tested — and they accommodated our forearms all the way to the palms of our hands.</p>
<p>The Linenspa is well made with strong stitching and thick fabric that’s been dyed a richly hued deep blue. (It’s also available in stone gray.) Unlike the other pillows we tested, the Linenspa doesn’t have a zipper for removing the cover. After testing, however, we decided that being able to remove the cover isn’t important, because once it’s been washed, the cover will shrink somewhat and be difficult to stuff the pillow back inside, especially into the armrests.</p>
<p>The Linenspa has a strong handle so we could easily drag it from the bedroom to the living room. We tested it on the couch, and it was slightly less comfortable, because its size takes up half the space of the sofa cushion. But once we shifted our position and sat more upright — as we were supposed to do — we never wanted to leave.</p>

Stuffed with CertiPUR-certified memory foam, we detected almost no unpleasant odors while using it.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073DJFYB1/?tag=sitpil-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Finally, we tried the Linenspa while sitting on the floor. Although the pillow does stay upright on its own, you do need to lean up against something if you want to use it for support. We did this same test with the other pillows, and we simply didn’t find any of them comfortable on the floor.</p>
<p>There was almost no off-gassing from this pillow, and although some Amazon reviewers complain about a heavy dye odor, we detected no strong smells from it.</p>
<p>The Linenspa is priced at $50, which is about average for a quality sit-up pillow. For $10 less, It’s also available in a smaller size, which is about one-third the size of the extra-large. For children and teens that size makes sense. The extra-large is quite heavy to lug around, so the standard size might also be better for the elderly who are bed-ridden.</p>
<p>Unlike the other pillows we tested, the Linenspa feels exceptionally durable. It supports upper and lower back and corrects posture while cushioning you in comfort.</p>
<p><b>Key takeways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Linenspa provides full support to upper and lower back and is also the most comfortable of the pillows we tested.</li>
<li>Its filling is made of shredded CertiPUR-certified memory foam, so it’s safe from hazardous contaminants.</li>
<li>The Linenspa’s armrests are extra-long and extra-wide, so you can rest the entire length of your arm.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the standard size <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0733ZCSR9/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Milliard reading pillow</a> is too small for a tall person, it gives excellent support to middle- and lower-back muscles. It looks and feels like a floppy stuffed toy, so we were surprised at how firm the Milliard was when we propped it against the bed headboard and couch cushion. Although its dangling arms barely extended past our elbows, we gathered them to our sides and comfortably rested our arms on them.</p>
<p>The Milliard is stuffed with shredded CertiPUR-certified memory foam, and if you want a firmer pillow, Milliard will send additional filling upon request. It has a soft polyester velour cover, which can be removed for washing or spot-cleaning.</p>

The standard size is too small for a tall person, but the extra-large size is just right.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0733ZCSR9/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Milliard is available in two additional sizes: petite (14-inches tall) for a child and extra large (24-inches tall) for a tall person. The Milliard runs about $10 more than the Linenspa for the extra-large size, but it&#8217;s also a quality sit-up pillow that we recommend.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Milliard may seem too soft and floppy, but it gives surprisingly good support to middle- and lower-back muscles.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s stuffed with CertiPUR-certified memory foam, so you can feel confident it won&#8217;t emit toxic gases.</li>
<li>The Milliard extra-large size is $10 more than the Linenspa, but it&#8217;s also an excellent option.</li>
</ul>

<h3>mittaGonG</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GJBW5ZM//tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">mittaGonG reading pillow</a> gave good support to the lower back muscles, but because it’s only 20-inches high (the only size available) and not generously stuffed near the top, it can’t reach the upper back or neck. We found the mittaGong comfortable for watching television in bed, because we could lean back against the headboard. However, because of its short armrests, it was tiring to keep our elbows propped up to hold a book up for more than 10 minutes.</p>
<p>The mittaGonG seemed well made with a nice velour case and strong stitching. It’s stuffed with shredded memory foam, but it’s not CertiPUR-certified. Without the CertiPUR certification, you can’t trust what gasses might be emitted from the mittaGonG’s memory foam.</p>
<h3>Hit Notion &#8211; Husband Pillow</h3>
<p>Most reading pillows are known as “husband pillows,” apparently because they provide security, comfort and support. (Recently they’ve been renamed “boyfriend pillows.”) Hit Notion’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WLBH2T/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Husband Pillow</a> is one of the most popular on Amazon and is available in a rainbow of colors. It’s about the same size as the mittaGonG pillow, so it gives good lower-back support. A detachable neck roll is included, and it bolsters the neck but not the upper back.</p>
<p>The Husband Pillow’s armrests were splayed too far apart, so we could only rest our elbows and no other part of our arms comfortably. It’s a well-constructed pillow, and style-wise, we liked the two large buttons that connect the head roll to the top of the pillow. The Husband Pillow is also stuffed with shredded memory foam, and like the mittaGonG pillow, it’s not CertiPUR certified.</p>
<h3>X-tra Comfort Bed Wedge</h3>
<p>The bed wedge is popular with people who suffer chronic back pain, since its wedge shape promotes a completely upright posture and spine alignment. However, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U6HMK78//tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">X-tra Comfort</a> bed wedge is a misnomer, since it was the most uncomfortable of the pillows we tested. The bed wedge is designed solely for the bed; on the couch it was like leaning against a wood plank.</p>
<p>The X-tra Comfort wedge is made of two extra-stiff pieces of memory foam (not shredded, not CertiPUR), covered in a cheap-feeling velour case. The large wedge is intended for back support; the purpose for the smaller wedge is a mystery. The company’s website shows photos of placing the wedges under the model’s knees. We tried it, but elevating legs and feet as illustrated put strain on the lower back.</p>
<p>It’s also suggested that the wedge can be used as a sleeping pillow. Perhaps, if you enjoy sleeping on a rock. There are a number of bed wedges on the market, so pass this one by.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you love reading in bed, binging on Netflix or just lounging around on a lazy Sunday morning, you might be bolstering yourself up with extra pillows, which can strain your back muscles and neck.</p>
<p>We selected the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073DJFYB1/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Linenspa</a> as the best sit-up pillow for providing full-back support and cushy comfort. Its extra-long and extra-wide armrests support your entire arm rather than just the elbow, and it’s the only pillow we tested that was so plush we never wanted to get up. The Linenspa is well made with quality fabric and strong stitching, and at $50 for the extra-large size you’re definitely getting your money’s worth.</p>
<p>We also liked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0733ZCSR9/?tag=ybdsitpil" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Milliard</a> reading pillow, which feels soft and floppy but gives excellent support to the middle- and lower-back muscles. The standard size is too small for a tall person, and though its extra-large size is $10 more than the Linenspa, it&#8217;s also a great option for providing full back support in bed or on the couch.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter testing five vacuums in three different apartments and running controlled tests side by side, we&#8217;ve determined that the Shark &#8211; Apex is the best upright vacuum. This predator is at the top of the food chain with quiet power and effective cleaning on more surfaces than most other upright vacuum cleaners. The entry-level Shark &#8211; Navigator is also a good value at about half the price, and the Dirt Devil won a spot among our top picks with compact maneuverability.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>After spending the last year researching and testing selections for task-specific categories like <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">the best vacuums for pet owners</a>, <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum/">handheld vacuums</a> and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuums</a>, we were ready to tackle a more general overview of the vacuum market.</p>
<p>We read comparison reviews by traditional publications like Wirecutter and Consumer Reports, but we also sunk hours into the endless testing footage available from vacuum enthusiasts on YouTube. We also investigated the latest buzz on the r/vacuums subreddit.</p>
<p>Vacuum cleaners, like many appliances, are often sold with different model numbers or packages at different retailers. Even finding the most recent models or determining differences between model numbers is sometimes nearly impossible. Our researcher compared specs on 18 different models for Shark alone, and that&#8217;s just the currently available models.</p>
<p>We included Shark&#8217;s perennial classic, the Navigator, since it&#8217;s their best value in terms of power for dollar and is still readily available. We also included the new Shark &#8211; Apex AZ1002, a model with all of Shark&#8217;s latest bells and whistles at a correspondingly higher price.</p>
<p>Selecting a worthy competitor for the Apex was tough. Every review of the Shark vacuums praises their relative maneuverability, while Dyson vacuums (though powerful) tend to be considered clunky by comparison. We selected the Dyson &#8211; Ball Multi Floor 2 rather than the larger, heavier, more expensive Animal or Cinetic models. (Some reviews actually show the Multi Floor to be more powerful than the Animal.)</p>
<p>Shark and Dyson have the high-end bagless vacuum market pretty much to themselves these days. We did find some well-regarded competitors in the budget bracket, though, with affordable and lightweight models from Dirt Devil and Eureka that had excellent customer reviews.</p>

[table id=240 /]
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Cleaning path:</strong> A wider cleaning path means fewer passes to clean an area, but it usually also makes a vacuum less maneuverable.</p>
<p><strong>Edge cleaning gap:</strong> This is a measurement of the distance of the pickup track from the edge, which determines how much dirt is missed when you&#8217;re vacuuming along baseboards or furniture.</p>
<p><strong>Steering design:</strong> Dyson really made a name for themselves with the &#8220;big ball&#8221; steering design, but we&#8217;ve come a long way since the days when every vacuum handled like a giant commercial model. Swivelling heads are now a common feature that actually made two other brands easier to turn than the Dyson.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories:</strong> Upright vacuums typically come with hose attachments that help you clean things like stairs, couches and drapes. Great attachments really make some jobs easier, but if you don&#8217;t have any upholstered furniture you might find yourself keeping them in the closet.</p>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> Lower weight is always better for carrying and using a vacuum, so long as you aren&#8217;t giving up features you need. This is also an important factor if you&#8217;re vacuuming on hardwood, since lighter vacuums are less likely to leave scuff marks.</p>
<p><strong>Noise:</strong> All vacuums are loud, but some are louder than others. Sleeping housemates will thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Filter performance and sealed systems:</strong> High efficiency particulate air (&#8220;HEPA&#8221;) filters are common, and the filter itself almost always does a great job filtering out even the smallest dust particles. The big difference between vacuums is whether they&#8217;re fully sealed or just let dust escape out of cracks and gaps.</p>

<p><strong>Height to fit under furniture:</strong> Coffee tables, beds and other low-clearance furniture can be tricky to vacuum under. Low-profile vacuum beater heads can slip into more places without stopping to use a specialty attachment.</p>
<p><strong>Cord Length:</strong> You want to be able to vacuum your entire floor without switching outlets, so cord length is a big priority for larger rooms or even just getting down the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>Length of hose:</strong> If you want to get the most out of your specialty attachments, it&#8217;s nice to be able to roam a bit. This is especially important for high ceilings.</p>

<p><strong>Total reach:</strong> This spec is usually a combination of cord length and hose length, plus the longest extension attachment. We think it makes more sense to think about your needs for cord length and hose length separately, though.</p>
<p><strong>Warranty and service network:</strong> In the past, vacuum repair worked like car repair: You buy an expensive machine from a dealer and take it back in for repairs. Dyson still has a repair network, while Shark works mostly by shipping things in the mail.</p>
<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs an upright vacuum?</h2>
<p>Upright vacuums are great on carpet. If you&#8217;ve got wall-to-wall medium-pile carpet, an upright vacuum is probably going to be your first choice. If you have more than 500 square feet of carpet to clean, an upright also makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>For bare floors, like hardwood or tile, an upright vacuum usually isn&#8217;t the best choice. Picks from our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-steam-mop/">steam mop review</a> will be a much better choice on tile or vinyl, though a good upright vacuum will still pick up dirt.</p>
<p>Being able to turn off the brushroll is an important feature if you&#8217;re going to use an upright on bare floors, since the brush will usually scatter dirt too much and doesn’t really help on a bare floor. Brushroll control is a standard feature for all the vacuums we looked at.</p>
<p>Upright vacuums put the weight of the motor above the brushroll, which helps it work into carpet fibers. That extra weight pushing down helps with getting out tough dirt, and for &#8220;grooming&#8221; longer carpet into that gorgeous freshly vacuumed look.</p>
<p>A good upright vacuum also makes cleaning floors more convenient. An upright keeps all of your vacuum parts rolling on one set of wheels, which means you only have to stop vacuuming when you get to the end of your cord.</p>
<p>The cordless models from our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuum review</a> are even more convenient to carry around. An upright is wider, though, so it can clean more quickly, and it can also go longer before the dust cup fills up. Most importantly, a plug-in upright won&#8217;t run out of battery power before you finish cleaning.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, an upright vacuum puts the suction motor, roller brush and dust receptacle in one piece riding on wheels with a long handle. A canister vacuum separates the motor and dust receptacle from the tools with a long hose, so you typically have most of the weight of the vacuum in a piece that follows you around on the floor while you hold the attachments and pickup tools.</p>
<p>Upright vacuums are similar to the oldest designs, basically adding suction and a bag to 19th-century carpet sweeper designs like the Bissel. Early upright designs were called &#8220;suction sweepers,&#8221; while early canister designs were called &#8220;suction dusters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those names highlight the strengths of each design: Upright vacuums are very efficient for &#8220;sweeping&#8221; over large surfaces, while the maneuverability and flexibility of a canister&#8217;s detached hose make it perfect for vacuuming things that aren&#8217;t your floor.</p>
<p>That said, most upright vacuums sold to consumers deliberately allow you to use a flexible hose and attachments, so you can still clean your drapes and upholstery.</p>
<p>Likewise, canister vacuums typically come with long-handled floor-sweeping attachments, and some even come with very nice electric-powered brushroll systems for plush carpet.</p>
<p>An upright vacuum really shines if you need to clean up and down a carpeted hall. The cord is long enough that you can finish the job without unplugging, and you won&#8217;t have to drag a canister along behind you. It&#8217;s also easier to store in a closet because of the small footprint.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re cleaning smaller rooms with lots of furniture, the lighter weight and low-profile head of a canister vacuum&#8217;s pickup tool make it much easier to work under and around obstacles. The drawbacks start when you have to move the canister body while you&#8217;re vacuuming.</p>
<p>Canister vacuums often come with air-powered tools, which means that only the flow of air is powering the brushroll that&#8217;s picking up hair and dirt from your carpet. Air-powered tools are better than nothing in a pinch, but they&#8217;re not nearly as effective as a motor-driven brush. We found out when testing the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">best pet hair vacuums</a> that just because a canister vacuum is expensive doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s always the right tool for the job.</p>
<p>Shark&#8217;s popular &#8220;lift-away&#8221; vacuum design tries to split the difference between a canister and an upright. If you want to separate the bulky motor housing from the floor tools you can just push a button and detach it. The hose is very short compared to a purpose-built canister system, but it has many of the same strengths when you need to vacuum under a bed or on carpeted stairs.</p>
<p>Note that among Shark models, only the powered lift-away models can run the brushroll motor when the base is detached. The un-powered Navigator, however, can still do bare-floor cleaning just as capably in this mode.</p>
<h2 id="why-bagless">Why a bagless vacuum cleaner?</h2>

<p>It might seem like distant history, but for most of the hundred or so years of vacuum cleaning we&#8217;ve relied on a bag to capture dirt that&#8217;s picked up. Once the bag was full, you had to throw it away and replace it with a new one. Bags could be made from paper for cheaper designs, but more expensive bags used other materials for better reliability and filtration.</p>
<p>Various bagless vacuum designs have been tried, but it was James Dyson who really popularized the bagless concept. Dyson pioneered the use of &#8220;cyclonic&#8221; airflow to separate dirt inside the dust receptacle through centrifugal force. Twenty years later, nearly all consumer-grade vacuums are bagless.</p>
<p>Without cyclonic dust removal, filters are the weak point of any vacuum system. If the filter is too fine, not enough air will get through and they will plug up quickly. If the filter lets a lot of air through, dust particles will also escape. Bag systems slowly lose suction efficiency as the filter pores fill with dust.</p>
<p>Modern bagless vacuums all use cyclonic action to separate dust, which means they can all use HEPA filters and filter-exhaust air down to sub-micron particles without instantly plugging up. Bagless systems generally use filters that are designed to be washed, so you should never have to buy replacement parts.</p>
<p>One more perk of bagless designs is that you can more easily find a piece of jewelry or a micro SD card that you accidentally pick up.</p>
<p>The savings are a relief, and not having to hunt for replacement bags when your vacuum is discontinued is nothing to sneeze at, either. But there is at least one downside to bagless designs.</p>
<p>When your vacuum collects dirt in a bag, you can simply throw it away and move on if you pick up something sticky, smelly or otherwise nasty. With a bagless vacuum, you&#8217;ve got to clean out the plastic receptacle and wash the filter.</p>
<p>In the marketplace, bagless has been a clear winner. You can still find a few of the old standby brands that maintain marketshare among commercial users, but even Panasonic has left the US vacuum cleaner market altogether after making Kenmore&#8217;s vacuums for decades.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We tested each of these vacuums in real-world conditions over the course of two months in three different apartments. We also spent a week testing for specific performance criteria in side-by-side dirt pickup tests on different types of carpet, and we measured noise and dust output.</p>
<p>After all that testing, we sat down and analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of each vacuum to decide which buyers they could be best for.<br />
[table id=241 /]
<h3>Maneuverability and weight</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/maneuverability.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We tested maneuverability around everyday living-room furniture. Weight played a big role in improving the scores of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet</a>, which also swivels well for quick turns. The Shark &#8211; Apex kept up, though, despite weighing about four pounds more than the budget-priced uprights.</p>
<p>The other surprising results for maneuverability were the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NAGRRRU/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson &#8211; Ball Multi Floor 2</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07J4R23VJ/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; PowerSpeed</a> models. The Dyson ball design just seems stiff and clunky compared to the new swivel-head designs from other makers. And remember, this is a lighter, smaller sibling in the Dyson family.</p>
<p>The Eureka was definitely the most frustrating, though. Without any consideration for swiveling, even the low weight made just turning it around at the end of a hallway far more difficult than it was with the other models.</p>
<p>The dust cups in this roundup were surprisingly similar. Dyson has a slight edge with a one-button release and dump system that makes emptying easier, though figuring out how hard to press the button takes some getting used to. Putting the Dyson&#8217;s pieces back in place is sometimes tricky, too. The other systems also have a drop-away bottom that makes emptying dirt easy, but fiddling with their latches isn&#8217;t quite as elegant.</p>
<p>Dyson&#8217;s outer canister separates completely from the cyclonic separator piece, so it&#8217;s easier to do a deep-clean if something gets lodged in there. None of the other dust receptacles were especially bad at trapping debris, but the Dyson system is (as one might expect) very elegant.</p>
<h3>Under-furniture height</h3>
<p>Measuring the height of each vacuum&#8217;s head gives an idea of how low the base of your furniture can be before the vacuum won&#8217;t fit at all. A model like the Dyson may fit under your couch part-way, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it will actually vacuum underneath. Most upright vacuums are too bulky, so you need to use an accessory tool on the hose to get all the dust bunnies.</p>
<p>Shark&#8217;s powered lift-away system on the Apex has a definite edge here. With the motor body removed, the brush head is free and clear to vacuum in tighter quarters.</p>
<h3>Edge cleaning</h3>
<p>We also tested the ability of these vacuums to pick up along the edge of a room or large furniture that goes to the floor. The Apex was a clear winner on this test, with good pickup right to a half-inch from a baseboard. The other finalists all left a track of dirt more than an inch wide.</p>
<h3>Attachments and Hose Length</h3>
<p>Our testers rated the usefulness of attachments for tricky situations like stairs, couches and drapes. Shark is almost cheating on this score, since the lift-away design means you can attach the handle directly to the motorized brush head to easily vacuum stairs, but the Shark vacuums include useful tools in other respects, too.</p>
<p>Of note is the motorized hand-sized upholstery brush included with the Apex. This kind of tool only works with vacuums that send power through the hose, so it&#8217;s pretty unique on a vacuum that doesn&#8217;t cost $600.</p>
<p>Hose length was a tricky feature to analyze: If you need to vacuum over and under a big sectional couch, for example, it might make all the difference. But the stand-out winner in this category, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NAGRRRU/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson &#8211; Ball Multi Floor 2</a>, had the hose storage system that was most annoying to work with. Dyson stores a rigid extension tube inside the hose, and it all nestles into the handle shaft, but getting the parts to click into place after use was difficult.</p>
<p>The Shark’s short hose length lost the most points with our testers. The hose on the Apex is only half the length of Dyson&#8217;s incredible ten-foot reach. It&#8217;s easy to lift the Apex&#8217;s body with one hand if you&#8217;re standing on a stepladder to reach a ceiling, but if you&#8217;re going to use the hose frequently you might start looking at the after-market hose extensions offered by other companies.</p>
<h3>Pick-up performance</h3>

[table id=243 /]
<p>We ran ten different tests to determine performance on various kinds of carpet and with different types of dirt. We weighed samples of icing sugar, sand and circle-shaped cereal and tested how much each vacuum left behind in a single pass on short-, medium- and long-pile carpet.</p>
<p>The stand-out performance in the pickup tests came from Dyson. If you&#8217;ve got medium- or low-pile carpet and want a deep clean, Dyson does a great job. In those cases it left behind mere grams of material. That said, in long carpet fibers, Dyson offers no height or power adjustment to keep it from simply getting stuck. If you&#8217;ve got luxurious carpet or area rugs, count Dyson out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark&#8217;s Navigator</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet</a> were nearly tied for how much they picked up on shorter carpet. We were especially impressed with the performance of the Dirt Devil, given how inexpensive and light it is.</p>

<p>The real winner for overall usefulness was the Shark &#8211; Apex. While the Navigator and Dirt Devil performed acceptably well on long carpet in their bare-floor modes, the Apex is the only vacuum in this lineup to offer real suction or brush speed control.</p>

This is the only upright that didn't struggle on area rugs and high-pile carpet.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Dyson and Eureka designs (despite the &#8220;height control&#8221; setting on the Eureka) were impossible to use effectively on long carpet. These vacuums try to gobble up the long fibers with the brushrolls on, and all the suction power pulls the vacuum down into the carpet so you can&#8217;t move.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s even worse if your plush carpet is a small area rug: With a vacuum like the Dyson, you&#8217;ll just get totally stuck or even damage your rug when it gets pulled part-way inside the vacuum.</p>
<h3>Filtration and sealing against dust escape</h3>
[table id=245 /]
<p>For a real test of the filter performance, we used a Dylos air-quality meter to measure particle counts in particles per million by volume, measuring half-micron particles and ten micron particles separately but averaged together here. Readings were taken before and after a vacuuming session, as well as after an additional five minutes running the vacuum to allow its filter to capture particles that had been thrown around.</p>
<p>Sealed-system vacuums performed better than the budget-priced models, though we were impressed at how well the Shark &#8211; Navigator kept up with the more expensive competition, even spreading less dust than its bigger sibling.</p>
<p>The Eureka turned in an impressive result if you only look at the improvement from running the vacuum for five minutes after you finish using it; the amount of dust it spat into the air while it was vacuuming, though, was by far the highest.</p>
<p>These results show that even a well-sealed vacuum that has a good filter will still kick up a lot of dust. <strong>Dust will settle naturally, but it takes a while. You should always vacuum the day before you have asthmatic friends over, not immediately before they arrive.</strong></p>
<p>In our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">pet vacuum review</a> we saw comparable performance capturing smells. The sealed vacuums also performed well keeping pet dander and even odors inside the receptacle. The Eureka performed surprisingly well here capturing dust, much better than it did capturing smells, but there&#8217;s definitely enough variability in our testing environment and the way dust circulates in a room to account for that.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to keep your air as clean as possible, Shark and Dyson do a good job of keeping dust contained. Check out our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-air-purifier/">review of the best room air purifiers</a> if you want to get dust levels even lower than this after you&#8217;re done vacuuming.</p>
<h3>Noise</h3>
[table id=244 /]
<p>After we collected all of the test data on effective cleaning, we booted up our audio-analysis rig to get some noise readings. We used a calibrated mic and the Room Eq Wizard software, set to measure decibels with A-scale weighting.</p>
<p>We took noise measurements from six feet away in a single-car garage bay with a concrete floor. That&#8217;s about double the distance you&#8217;d be at when using the vacuum. We also included two other test vacuums: The tester&#8217;s old Dyson &#8211; DC25 (purchased in 2013) along with the Shark &#8211; Rocket stick vacuum, which won top place in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuum review</a>.</p>
<p>The average noise level is quite loud, 85 dBA for just a vacuum motor or 89 with the brushroll engaged and picking up dirt on a hard surface. These vacuums move a lot of air very quickly, so noise is inevitable. For the louder machines, these levels are actually close to what we got in tests from our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-leaf-blower/">review of electric leaf blowers</a>.</p>
<p>The difference between the quietest and loudest vacuum was a full 10 dBA. Because of how sound works, people will perceive that as only double the loudness, but it&#8217;s the same power increase as running nine more of the quietest vacuums in a room together.</p>
<p>The quietest vacuum was the Shark &#8211; Apex, also the most expensive vacuum we tested. <strong>The cheaper Shark &#8211; Navigator was only 1dBA louder, with both vacuums peaking under 87 dBA with the brushroll turned on.</strong> That&#8217;s still loud enough that <a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2016/02/08/noise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to guidelines set by the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety</a>, you shouldn&#8217;t be up-close with these vacuum cleaners for more than an hour every day without hearing protection.</p>
<p>All of the other vacuums we tested (including the stick vacuum) were louder than 85 dBA from six feet away. From close-up, as you&#8217;d be using them, the loudest vacuums measured at 97 dBA. You shouldn&#8217;t use a loud vacuum cleaner for longer than half an hour every day without some ear plugs.</p>
<p>This is still much quieter than the noise exposure from power tools at a jobsite, but it&#8217;s something to keep in mind. If you clean for a living and need some hearing protection, check out our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-ear-plugs/">review of the best ear plugs.</a> Obviously, any of these vacuums are loud enough to wake most roommates (not to mention a baby).</p>
<p>One notable quirk is that while the Dyson is loud overall, its brushroll motor hardly adds any extra noise. Shark&#8217;s powerful brushrolls are quiet, but you can definitely tell when they&#8217;re turned on and off.</p>

<p>At just over $300 from most retailers, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex AZ1002</a> is a premium product that really works to justify the extra cost. This is Shark&#8217;s largest vacuum, and it includes all of the best toys: powered accessory tools, a wood-floor-friendly brushroll, a hair-proof brush cleaning system, an extra-long cord and some working carpet-height settings.</p>
<p>This is the biggest vacuum we tested, though it actually has a fairly narrow cleaning track at 11.5 inches. Compare that to 12 inches on the budget-friendly Dirt Devil or 13.4 inches on the smaller-sized Dyson we tested. Shark tends to focus on maneuverability and flexibility instead of a wide pickup path, and we&#8217;re pretty happy with that tradeoff.</p>
<p>At 16 pounds and drawing 1350 watts of power, the Apex definitely feels like a full-size vacuum when you first assemble it. Most impressive are the power and floor-surface control switches that are mounted on the handle for easy access. No more bending down just to pause to answer the door or move from carpet to hard flooring.</p>
<p>We also noticed the DuoClean brush rollers pulling the Apex across floors more briskly than other uprights. Thankfully, the quick-swiveling head is easy to steer, so we never felt like this was a runaway vacuum. It&#8217;s power you can feel, but you&#8217;re in control.</p>
<h3>Best for thick carpet</h3>
<p>Thick carpet is where this vacuum really shone. Some of the other machines could get you by if you turn off the brushroll to keep it from jamming up, but the Apex gives you just the right amount of suction and brush speed to move swiftly across the floor and effectively clean your carpet.</p>
<p>In our test picking up icing sugar, the Apex was only 20 percent better than the Dyson on long carpet. With sand, though, that difference jumped to an astounding 43 percent. The Apex was also the only upright to earn a perfect score picking up large objects, though the Dirt Devil was not far behind.</p>
<h3>Powered lift-away design</h3>

<p>Shark&#8217;s trademark design innovation is that they don&#8217;t let upright vacuums just be uprights: most of their line also converts to something more like a canister system, with the motor and dust cup in a &#8220;Lift-Away&#8221; pod that detaches from the handle tube.</p>
<p>The Lift-Away design makes the vacuum more flexible than a simple hand tool plugged into a hose could ever be. As mentioned above, since this is a powered Lift-Away model you can use the full-size brush head under furniture, and if you&#8217;re vacuuming a small area with lots of obstacles you can shed all the motor weight for more agility.</p>
<p>The downside of Shark&#8217;s Lift-Away designs has always been short hoses. You run out of hose very quickly if you try to use the Apex like a canister vacuum with the motor unit on the floor, so if you&#8217;re vacuuming a whole room with lots of furniture to clean under you&#8217;ll probably wind up carrying it in one hand while you vacuum with the other.</p>
<p>You can buy a wheeled cart for the canister, and there are non-powered hose extensions you can try, but most of the time it just makes far more sense to use the Apex in its upright mode.</p>
<p>Having too much extra hose can be annoying, and even Dyson&#8217;s remarkable collapsing hose is a bit unwieldy. Maybe there&#8217;s no perfect two-in-one canister and upright vacuum, but we really would like to see at least another three feet on the Apex to say it&#8217;s worth considering as a canister-mode design. For stairs and upholstery, though, it&#8217;s fantastic.</p>
<h3>Also the best upright vacuum for hardwood floors</h3>

<p>The Apex isn&#8217;t a one-trick fish, though. As well as tackling plush carpet, this is the best upright vacuum for bare floors. The Apex brings a few features to bear that you should consider if you&#8217;re vacuuming a hardwood floor rather than wall-to-wall carpet.</p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s Shark&#8217;s DuoClean brushroll. Many hardwood experts don&#8217;t like using a brushroll anywhere near hardwood, and you could use a vacuum that just has a simple easy-gliding suction head. (You could also use a dust mop.) <strong>But the DuoClean system is an exceptionally soft brush, and it works well to dust and even slightly polish your hardwood or manufactured flooring.</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got sand on your floor, it&#8217;s better to pick it up without grinding it in at all, but most of the time you encounter grains of sand on your floor you won&#8217;t know until you see a scratch. The Apex is, at least, designed to minimize the damage.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Top of the Food Chain: Shark - Apex</h3><p>Shark's vacuums are incredibly popular, and this model includes basically every feature they've come up with. Great control means this is actually a good vacuum on all surfaces, and the powered lift-away system makes it very flexible. To top it all off, this is quiet and captures dust effectively.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Another reason this is the best upright vacuum for hardwood floors is that it won&#8217;t choke on your area rugs. None of the other vacuums we looked at in this price range have controls for switching surfaces, so this is the vacuum that does the whole room at once.</p>
<p>We need to stop for a moment here and emphasize that if you&#8217;ve got a new engineered hardwood floor, you should double-check with the manufacturer that use of a soft brushroll won&#8217;t void your warranty. Flooring finishes should all be fine, but care instructions sometimes specifically say not to use a buffing machine or a &#8220;beater bar&#8221; head.</p>
<p>Again, we haven&#8217;t seen any evidence that this vacuum could damage a floor unless you&#8217;re running it through piles of sand and deliberately grinding it into your hardwood.</p>

<p>Shark sells the Apex in a few different versions, but we tested the version that had the best set of accessories, the AZ1002. This model ships with three compact attachments you can plug into the end of the hose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compact, motorized brush head</li>
<li>12-inch crevice tool</li>
<li>Combination upholstery brush &amp; mattress tool</li>
</ul>
<p>Also remember that the extension tube and the full-size head will plug into the handle, so you can get about 30 inches of extra reach with any of these tools for dusting high-up corners and drapes.</p>
<p>Shark sometimes runs promotions that will include extra accessories, like a flat-surface or under-furniture dusting tool, if you purchase directly from their site.</p>
<p>The motorized pet tool is a good pick if you&#8217;ve got corduroy upholstery or other surfaces that collect hair and need more than just suction to clean. It probably wouldn&#8217;t be worth picking this tool up all by itself if you buy the Apex without it, but it&#8217;s a nice perk and stores neatly on the base of the vacuum.</p>
<p>For stairs and other tricky carpeted surfaces, we think that plugging the handle directly into the regular carpet head and using the Apex like a super-powered handheld vacuum is a fantastic trick. If you&#8217;ve ever skipped cleaning carpeted stairs because you hate how clunky your vacuum is, you&#8217;ll love the Apex.</p>
<h3>Sealed system and HEPA Filter</h3>
<p>The Apex performed very well in our dust collection test. Any powered-brush vacuum will kick dust into the air, so don&#8217;t count on the Apex to make your air dust-free immediately after vacuuming, but the sealed system and HEPA filter will make sure that it&#8217;s not just blowing all the dust you pick up back out into your room.</p>
<h3>A bigger, better vacuum</h3>
<p>To sum up all our time with the Apex: this is a big vacuum that&#8217;s not clunky. Shark has some great tricks that make this a more versatile system than any other vacuum we found. If you have long carpet, area rugs, or any other tasks that utilize Shark&#8217;s special features it&#8217;s an easy vacuum to recommend.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re only vacuuming medium-length carpet, though, both the Shark &#8211; Navigator and the Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet will also do a good job. Those vacuums are lighter, so they&#8217;re easier to use, and they&#8217;re much less expensive, too.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex</a> is a big vacuum, but it’s still easy to handle.</li>
<li>On long carpet, the Apex easily beat all competitors.</li>
<li>This doesn’t quite have as much cleaning power as a Dyson on medium carpets.</li>
<li>Shark&#8217;s powered lift-away design gives flexibility.</li>
<li>Good sealing and filtration keeps dust to a minimum.</li>
<li>The DuoClean brushroll design is also good for hardwood floors.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-value">Best Value: Shark &#8211; Navigator</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Navigator NV352</a> earned a second-place ranking based on performance in our tests, but when you consider that it&#8217;s only half the price of the more expensive vacuums we bought, there&#8217;s plenty of reason to consider it best value overall.</p>
<p>The Navigator is a consistent winner in vacuum tests all over the internet. This is a step up from the cheapest vacuums that Shark makes, and a clear step down from their full-featured models. The NV352 doesn&#8217;t have the new hardwood-polishing soft brush, and the version with Shark&#8217;s new maintenance-free &#8220;ZeroM&#8221; brushroll is about $50 more. The lift-away mode won&#8217;t run the brushroll, and there&#8217;s no suction or speed control to make long carpets bearable.</p>
<p>That said, on mid- or short-length carpet this vacuum almost keeps up with a $300 Dyson in our pickup tests for sand and powder.</p>
<p>This is our pick for those whose biggest concern is pet hair pickup, so long as you don&#8217;t have longer carpet. If you do have high-pile carpet, this isn&#8217;t the worst-performing vacuum if you turn the brushroll off, but it&#8217;s not nearly as good as a machine with real multi-surface controls.</p>
<p>Just like the Apex, the Navigator beat the Dyson in both air quality and noise-output tests. It&#8217;s nice to know that for a value-priced vacuum, you don&#8217;t have to make compromises when it comes to your health.</p>

This isn't the very best in any one category, but it's got a strong motor and it's still easy to handle.

<p>If you&#8217;re vacuuming on low-pile carpet or bare floors, the Navigator did spray more sand than the Apex or Dyson. If you spot a pile of sand, you should always turn off the brushroll anyhow, but the Navigator seems to have an extra-aggressive brush.</p>
<h3>Shortcomings</h3>

    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cerealpickup.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>As you can see in the clip above, the Navigator had trouble in the cereal pickup test, especially on medium carpet. Even on short carpet, where it performed much better, there was a straggler.</p>
<p>In our maneuverability tests the Navigator easily beat the Dyson, but it&#8217;s not as easy to steer as the Dirt Devil. When we asked our tester which vacuum she would most like to keep for her apartment, she passed up the Navigator&#8217;s air filtration and power for the most maneuverable choice.</p>
<p>All in all, there are a few ways the Apex is clearly a better vacuum. The Navigator keeps pace, though, and actually outperformed the Apex in some tests. For most people, this will be a great vacuum.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Navigator</a> is a tried and true value pick.</li>
<li>If your biggest concern is pet hair on mid-length carpet, get this.</li>
<li>Even the less-expensive Shark filters exhaust air even better than Dyson.</li>
<li>The Navigator is almost as quiet as the Apex.</li>
<li>A non-powered lift-away design makes this less flexible than the Apex.</li>

<p>Dirt Devil&#8217;s lineup of vacuums is very much focused on the budget segment of the market, with few models crossing the $100 threshold. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Razor Pet Steerable Upright</a> is the upgraded model with swivel-action steering, and we think it&#8217;s a great vacuum if your budget is tight.</p>
<p>The Dirt Devil kept pace with the Navigator through the low- and mid-pile carpet tests, so it&#8217;s a vacuum that&#8217;s capable of thoroughly cleaning your carpet. But where it really stood out was in handling. The Dirt Devil is actually slightly heavier than the Navigator, but it&#8217;s easier to maneuver and wheel around.</p>
<p>This vacuum also fits under furniture with a clearance height just slightly lower than the Apex&#8217;s. Without the lift-away feature this isn&#8217;t as versatile in some tight spots, but there&#8217;s something great about a vacuum that&#8217;s just good at what it was built for.</p>

The Razor keeps up admirably on most carpet, and it's pretty good at dust control.

<p>For dust control, this vacuum doesn&#8217;t have a HEPA filter or a fully sealed system. It will spread more fine dust around than the Shark or Dyson vacuums. That said, it was surprisingly good at containing the smell and dust from pet hair in one tester&#8217;s apartment. It&#8217;s also slightly quieter than a Dyson.</p>

<p>Dirt Devil includes an air-turbine-powered hand tool with this package, and it&#8217;s the kind of tool that might help in a very few situations, but for the most part you&#8217;ll probably skip it. The Shark&#8217;s motorized brush is wider, and actually has enough torque to get dirt out of carpet or upholstery fibers.</p>
<p>Dirt devil also includes a two-in-one crevice and brush tool for capturing loose objects that fall out of your pockets into your couch. The tools are friction-fit, instead of snapping in place, but they work about as well as most cheap vacuum accessories and store neatly on the side of the vacuum.</p>
<p>One of our testers advocated for a second-place ranking for this vacuum. If you&#8217;ve got a small apartment or a limited area of carpet to clean, this is a vacuum that will get the job done without any pretentious extra features.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet</a> is an easy-to-steer upright vacuum.</li>
<li>If you need competitive cleaning power on a tight budget, here it is.</li>
<li>A low-profile head makes this easier to get under furniture.</li>
<li>The Razor&#8217;s filter and noise reduction won&#8217;t beat Shark, but it keeps up with Dyson.</li>

<p>The Dyson &#8211; Ball Multi Floor 2 is a powerful vacuum with some great design details, but after spending time with all of the vacuums in this lineup, none of our testers really liked using it.</p>
<p>Dyson products are often tricky to review. When Dyson does something well, they usually do it very well. James Dyson revolutionized vacuum cleaners and has been a dominant force since the DC07 was released in 2001. That said, Dyson has never been very competitive with price, and there are some things about this vacuum that are nearly unforgivable.</p>
<p>At about $300, the Ball Multi Floor 2 is a solid performer. We don&#8217;t want to misrepresent the performance numbers: this is clearly the best vacuum for low-pile carpet if all you care about is deep-cleaning. The track is wide, and the suction and agitation get more dirt out —  on average, the Dyson picked up 95 percent of our test samples on carpets where it will actually move effectively.</p>
<p>Dyson also makes an even more expensive vacuum, but it doesn&#8217;t solve the Multi Floor 2&#8217;s biggest problem. The Ball Animal 2 is supposed to have even more power, but if you have high-pile carpet or area rugs that&#8217;s just like throwing gasoline on a fire. Dyson does not design these vacuums for people with multiple floor surfaces.</p>
<p>The Dyson is a few pounds lighter than the Shark &#8211; Apex, but despite all the ingenuity of the rolling-ball design, this is a difficult vacuum to push around and maneuver. Compared to clunky old commercial vacuums from forty years ago the ball is a great idea, but the new swivel-head competitors are much easier to use. Again, the upgrade model from Dyson would just make the problem worse with a bigger and heavier body.</p>
<p>This might be the best upright vacuum for tile floors, since the hard brushroll doesn&#8217;t matter the way it does on hardwood, and the most important feature is suction power in that case. But it&#8217;s clear that any of the choices from our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-steam-mop/">steam mop review</a> would be a better tool for cleaning tile floors.</p>

<p>One strange quirk of the new Ball 2 design that you won&#8217;t see in promotional pictures or even most video reviews is the pressure relief vent at the top of the handle.</p>
<p>When you finish vacuuming and push the Dyson up into its standing mode, the suction switches from the brush head to the handle-mounted extension hose automatically. Air starts rushing in through the cap at the top of the handle.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s a bit scary if your hand is on top of the handle when you push it into the standing mode, and it&#8217;s not something we&#8217;d seen on the other Dyson vacuums we&#8217;ve used.</strong> You&#8217;re not going to lose a finger or anything, but it was a turn-off for our testers.</p>
<p>In 2018, Dyson <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/06/dyson-announces-cordless-future-with-end-of-plug-in-vacuums" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced that they&#8217;re no longer developing</a> new plug-in vacuum designs. We chose their V8 cordless stick vacuum as a top pick in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuum review</a>, so we know they&#8217;re on to something, but there are good reasons for many of us to own a conventional upright.</p>
<p>It seems like Dyson never got further than designing around great suction and long hoses. If that&#8217;s your primary concern, then this model or the even more powerful Animal 2 will beat most other vacuums. If you want a vacuum that&#8217;s easy to push and works on other surfaces than low-pile carpet, we suggest looking elsewhere.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07J4R23VJ/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; PowerSpeed NEU180B Upright</a> isn&#8217;t a terrible vacuum. It has good reviews on the retail websites we looked at, with a 4.4 average on Amazon and a good Fakespot grade, as well, so we don&#8217;t suspect those are disingenuous reviews. Many of them seem to be cat owners, so it&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re just easy to please.</p>
<p>But about the best thing we can say about the Eureka, in comparison to the other models we tested, is that it&#8217;s very light. Compared to the Dirt Devil at the same price, or the Shark &#8211; Navigator for about $60 more, it&#8217;s just not at all competitive. Not in pickup, not in maneuverability, not in ease of use, not in noise. It doesn&#8217;t even fit under furniture well.</p>
<p>The Eureka is worthless on long carpet. No, a Dyson isn&#8217;t much better, but that&#8217;s not a good excuse when you advertise &#8220;five height-adjustment settings.&#8221; It turns out that the setting just opens or closes the suction opening at the floor very slightly and directs it away from the brushroll. This vacuum did not work on area rugs or carpet with any kind of long pile.</p>

<p>Upright vacuums are tricky beasts. Just about any upright will do a decent job of getting everyday dirt out of low-pile carpet, and so picking the very best means testing for the most extreme cases. It also means we had to be a little bit more picky about likes and dislikes.</p>
<p>After testing vacuums in a variety of real-world settings and comparing them side-by-side in controlled tests, it&#8217;s clear that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex</a> is the vacuum to beat. Good performance on every surface was definitely a winning trait, and creature comforts like handle-mounted switches didn&#8217;t hurt. The powered lift-away design isn&#8217;t everything that a canister vacuum would be, but it&#8217;s pretty darn close for a two-in-one design.</p>
<p>Even with a runner-up pick, it&#8217;s hard not to feel like we&#8217;re short-changing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Navigator</a>. It&#8217;s small and light, but it packs a lot of power into that compact frame. This value-friendly model is still dust-sealed and quiet, but it doesn&#8217;t have multi-surface power settings or run the brush head in lift-away mode.</p>

<h2 id="about-tester">About our expert tester</h2>
<p>My name is Tyler. I’m a guitar instructor, recording artist and guitar nerd in San Diego, California. Throughout my 13 years playing the guitar and five years as an instructor for <a href="https://www.mobilemusicteacher.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mobile Music Teacher</a>, I’ve gained a lot of firsthand experience with beginner acoustic guitars as both a student and a teacher.</p>
<p>I’ve always said that there’s no greater joy in my life than setting someone up with a guitar that they love. I believe that a guitar can grow to be a valuable companion in life, and I cannot stress enough the importance of picking a good one. So let’s begin!</p>
<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Throughout my time as a guitarist and guitar instructor, I’ve had the pleasure of playing hundreds of different guitars. Whether shopping for myself, a student or for random people in need of advice at a music store, I’ve gained an understanding of acoustic guitar options for players of all levels. I have bought and sold numerous guitars of my own, so even before my extensive research for this review, I was familiar with most of the final candidates for the best beginner’s instrument.</p>
<p>In addition, I attend The NAMM Show (National Association of Music Merchants) in Anaheim, California, every year. Thousands of companies set up shop there to make connections in the industry and promote their products. In this mile-wide musical candy store, most instruments are available for us players to demo.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-acoustic">What is an acoustic guitar?</h2>
<p>Acoustic guitars are guitars that do not require electrical amplification. These instruments produce sound with a hollow body that amplifies the string vibrations. Practically speaking, acoustic guitars are guitars that don’t need to be plugged in.</p>
<p>Electric guitars are different from acoustic guitars in that they require amplification through a separate unit fittingly called an amplifier. There’s no right or wrong answer when choosing between an electric and acoustic guitar; it’s just personal preference of sound and musical taste. A large benefit of acoustic guitars is that they don’t need an amplifier, an electrical outlet or any cables/wires to play and produce sound.</p>
<p>There are, however, acoustic guitars with “pickups” installed within the body cavity. The pickups allow the guitar to be plugged in and amplified, but these guitars are typically still referred to as acoustic. Acoustic guitars with pickups are not necessary (or appropriate) for beginners, and they are almost exclusively used in live performances.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-choose">How to choose an acoustic guitar for beginners</h2>
<p>When purchasing an acoustic guitar for new players and students, a very important trade-off arises. Acoustic guitars, primarily the more affordable ones, can be risky purchases due to their tendency to become less playable over time. It’s a gamble of money versus longevity. Spending your money on a guitar with a lower price tag may seem sufficient for a new player, but in reality you’re likely committing to a higher-priced upgrade in the not-so-distant future.</p>
<p>In addition longevity issues, cheaper guitars are harder to play. Very small differences and inconsistencies in a cheaper guitar’s construction can make a world of difference when it is played. When the strings are too hard to press into the fretboard, students (particularly children) can get very discouraged and quickly storm away with sore fingertips. This can be due to various factors that must remain in balance in order for a guitar to play, feel and sound the way we want it to.</p>
<p>Guitars that cost around $300 or less tend to fall victim to these issues of quality. Usually, the necks of these cheaper guitars will warp over time due to poor manufacturing and/or subpar wood quality. This slight change in the overall balance of the guitar can have a significant effect on its playability. However, our runner-up pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HWIRQ6O/?tag=ybdag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ibanez &#8211; AW54OPN</a>, was an exception to this.</p>
<p>Now you would think there’s a formula that guitar companies use to manufacture consistent guitars. But wood has dynamic properties, which means a guitar expands and contracts with changes in weather, humidity and temperature (just like it would in a tree). It’s important to invest in a guitar that was built with these factors in mind. Even though a guitar may play well upon first purchase, it’s not a guarantee that things won’t change over time.</p>
<p>So, you should invest in an instrument that is unlikely to change significantly over the years. Although it&#8217;s difficult to predict the volatility of wood movement over long periods of time, we can infer many things by taking initial measurements and assessing any inconsistencies in areas like neck alignment and tuning issues.</p>
<p>Every piece of wood is different, and quality wood with solid manufacturing comes at a higher price. It’s no coincidence that the best-sounding guitars will also maintain their structure and balance better than all others. So what does this all mean? Ultimately, it’s worth it to spend a decent bit of cash on quality wood and solid construction in even a beginner’s guitar. However, if this isn’t realistic for you, we’ve included great fallback options with lower price tags that will still hold their own and perform the way you’ll need them to.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>When shopping for an acoustic guitar, there are many things to consider that affect the instrument’s resulting sound and playability.</p>
<h3>Action</h3>
<p>When people talk about “playability” of guitars, it’s generally safe to assume that they’re referring to the <i>action</i> of the guitar. This is the very fine balance of string proximity to fretboard.</p>
<p>Guitars with lower action, or those with strings that are closer to the fretboard, are generally much easier to play than guitars with higher action. However, if the action is too <i>low</i>, the strings can make unintended contact with multiple frets, leading to a “buzzing” sound that may render the guitar unplayable. Fittingly, this is commonly referred to as “string buzz.”</p>
<p>Guitars with too <i>high</i> of action are also difficult to play for beginners and can lead to a variety of issues. When just getting started on the guitar, your fingers are very sensitive to the strings, and calluses have likely not formed on your fingertips yet. With a greater distance between the strings and the fretboard, the strings need to be pressed harder, a strain that you can feel in your fingers. This is almost always inhibiting and discouraging to children, and can lead them to put down the instrument during practice or even give it up completely. Choosing an acoustic guitar with a reliable build quality should lead to lower (but not too low) action, relieved fingers and a happy guitar player.</p>
<h3>Neck relief</h3>
<p>The neck relief of a guitar is the curvature of the neck. In general, acoustic guitar necks should be somewhere from straight to very slightly bowed<i>. </i>In other words, a typical guitar neck will form a very shallow “U” shape when the guitar is lying face up on a flat surface.</p>
<p>Neck relief can be adjusted by using a small tool (typically either an Allen wrench or a tool provided by the manufacturer) to tighten or loosen the guitar’s truss rod. The truss rod is a metal rod that extends from the point of contact with the body all the way to the headstock, or the top of the guitar.</p>
<p>Adjustment of the truss rod affects the curvature of the neck itself. However, when the neck on an acoustic guitar has significant relief issues, it can be extremely difficult or even impossible to fix completely.</p>
<h3>Intonation</h3>
<p>The intonation of a guitar is the instrument’s relative tuning to itself. For example, if you were to pluck the open sixth (lowest) string, you would be playing an E note. If the guitar is properly intonated, then the instrument should maintain the same accuracy for each and every note as you move up the fretboard.</p>
<p>Good intonation is <i>crucial</i> to a guitar. With inconsistencies in the instrument’s intonation, certain chords and notes will not ring harmoniously as you progress up the fretboard. This leads to extreme restriction, and sometimes even a totally scrapped guitar.</p>
<p>Intonation problems are far more common with cheaper acoustic guitars. These issues are difficult to fix, and buyers of cheap low-end guitars should be aware of this. These guitars could very well shift and twist their way to poor intonation, rendering them restrictive and potentially unplayable.</p>
<h3>Size and shape</h3>
<p>Guitars come in many different shapes and sizes. Ultimately, there is no right size or shape; it all boils down to personal preference.</p>

<p>Smaller-bodied guitars such as the Taylor &#8211; GS Mini are fitting for children due to their reduced size. Children frequently have difficulty playing larger, full-size guitars due to an inability to see their fretting hands or reach the strings comfortably with their strumming hand. They may also have an overall feeling of discomfort and awkwardness with such a large instrument.</p>
<p>Adults tend to prefer full-sized guitars. However, smaller-bodied guitars can be very useful for traveling, and many adults and teenagers choose smaller guitars for this reason. I personally use a Baby Taylor acoustic guitar for my lessons because it is so easy to transport.</p>
<p>Generally, the bigger the guitar is, the bigger the sound will be. Smaller bodies lead to less resonance and thereby a lesser sound output, particularly in bass response. This does vary, however, and construction of the guitar also plays a large role in the instrument’s resonance.</p>
<p>Some guitars also feature what’s known as a “cutaway.” Cutaways are inlets cut into the body of the guitar itself, allowing ease of access to the higher frets. These frets aren’t as frequently played on acoustic compared to electric guitars, especially for beginners, but a cutaway can be nice to have for some sweet acoustic guitar solos down the road.</p>
<h3>Wood/Material</h3>
<p>The wood type and construction have a huge impact on a guitar’s tone. There are a variety of tonal characteristics amongst different wood types, and some companies even gear different models toward different kinds of playstyles. Taylor Guitars has many great resources on the topic, and they commonly refer to these sonically characterized woods as tonewoods.</p>
<p>Some lower-end guitars are also made of what’s called a wood laminate. Laminates are multiple layers of thinly processed wood that have been pressed and bonded together with an adhesive for strength and stability.</p>
<p>Now, tonewoods and pretty woods are great and all, but they won’t get you very far if you’re not able to play them. And with beginner guitarists, playability is of paramount importance. With this in mind, it’s important to consider a guitar to be at its most playable at the time of purchase. In reality, slight alterations and adjustments can be made to your guitar down the road, but most of these alterations are highly recommended against unless they are absolutely necessary. They can also cause significant damage to your guitar if not done properly.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>When testing these guitars in person, we followed very standard measuring/recording techniques that can be easily understood and recreated <a href="http://www.fretnotguitarrepair.com/repair/acoustic-guitar/action.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>The obvious variable in these tests is that we couldn’t sit and measure the exact guitar that you would be purchasing. Your guitar’s measurements will not match ours, but consistencies do still ring true throughout models in testing. Companies that have a reputation of guitars with great playability have those reputations for a reason. Within these companies, essential components like wood quality and ultra-precise construction are made a priority in their manufacturing and quality control.</p>
<h3>Action/String height test</h3>
<p>As you now know, picking an acoustic guitar with low (but not <i>too</i> low!) action is important and makes the instrument much easier to play for beginners. To measure action, we used a precision ruler (1/64”) to measure the distance from the bottom of the low E and high e strings to the top of the 12th fret. This is a standard method of measurement for guitar action.</p>
<p>Sometimes when the action of an acoustic guitar is too high, players will swap out the strings for a lighter gauge set. While this can decrease action by putting less stress on the neck and allowing it to straighten, it is not a reliable method of adjustment. Changes in action through this method are unpredictable and can be inconsistent, thereby potentially leading to other problems such as string buzz and intonation issues.<br />

<h3>Neck relief test</h3>
<p>We tested for neck relief using feeler gauges. These thin blades of steel allow us to measure the curvature of a guitar neck with a high level of precision. The blade thicknesses span from 0.0250 inches (0.635 mm) down to 0.0015 inches (0.038 mm).</p>
<p>This test was conducted by fretting the strings at the first fret (using a capo), along with the fret that marks where the neck merges with the body of the guitar. We then measured the distance between the bottom of the low E and high e strings to the top of the 7th fret. This method is commonly used to measure the curvature of the neck that has extended past the body of the guitar.<br />
[table id=158 /]
<h3>Intonation test</h3>
<p>Our test for a guitar’s relative tuning to itself, or <i>intonation</i>, was conducted easily using the very popular instrument-tuning mobile phone app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/guitartuna-guitar-bass-tuner/id527588389?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Guitar Tuna</a>. In the paid version of this app, you have access to “pro accuracy,” which measures each note down to the cent. Pretty nifty to have such a great tool on your phone!</p>
<p>For this test, we tuned all open strings to their exact designated frequency (calibrated to 440 Hz), and then compared them to the resulting frequency of each string while fretted at the 12th fret. This distance is known as an “octave,” and if the guitar is properly intonated, each fretted note should exactly match its open-stringed counterpart.</p>
<p>Differences in tuning were recorded for any note that exceeded<i> +/- </i>three cents of its relative open string tuning. Positive values represent the fretted note being sharper than the open note, and negative values represent the fretted note being flatter than the open note. We decided to leave out any differences of three cents or less, because at that level of accuracy, even just strumming the string harder would push the note outside that range.</p>
<p>It is important to note guitars that have inconsistencies in sharp versus flat fretted notes. When poorly intonated guitars aren’t even “consistently poorly” intonated, attempting to fix them is almost always a losing battle.<br />
[table id=160 /]
<h3>Sound quality and tone test</h3>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.guitarcenter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guitar Center</a> in La Mesa and San Marcos, California, we were able to conduct and record our sound quality and tone testing in soundproofed, private lesson rooms in complete silence. This was incredibly useful and allowed us to record each guitar individually using an Apogee MiC 96k. Tonally, what you prefer becomes more subjective, so it can be helpful to hear the guitars in this way before purchasing.</p>
<p>Three different styles were performed and recorded on each guitar:</p>
<ol>
<li>Chord progression strumming <i>with</i> a guitar pick.</li>
<li>Fingerpicking and percussive play <i>without</i> a guitar pick.</li>
<li>Open G chord strummed slowly, one string at a time.</li>
</ol>
<p>While these sound clips may not hugely influence your decision, they were helpful for us to listen back to and reference the general character of each guitar. It’s useful to acknowledge that different guitars have varying strengths and weaknesses in regard to things like sound clarity, resonance, frequency distribution and overall tone. Oftentimes, cheaper guitars will exert dissonance in the form of harsh overtones, or frequencies greater than the intended note, which can be off-putting to the listener’s ear. You may hear this in some of the recordings as a “warbled” sound while the notes or chords are sustained.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N4RIAO4/?tag=ybdag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Taylor &#8211; Academy 12</a> is our top choice for a beginner acoustic guitar. This instrument played and sounded like a guitar of twice its cost and had a noticeably better build quality than its competitors. Due to its moderately low action and balanced neck relief, this guitar felt very easy to play.</p>
<p>While it didn’t have the lowest action or the straightest neck that we came across, the Taylor’s slightly increased space between the strings and the fretboard allowed us to really jam out without any concern of string buzz. This also allowed the guitar to have tons of sustain, as the strings did not come in contact with any unintended frets.</p>
<p>The intonation of this guitar was flawless. Contrary to nearly every other guitar we tested, the notes along the entirety of this guitar’s neck remained consistently in-tune and sounded as intended.</p>

<p>Tonally, the Academy 12 sounded full and bright. This primarily Sitka spruce guitar was very responsive and greatly accommodated all playstyles. From chord strumming with a guitar pick, to percussive fingerpicking, this instrument remained comfortable and maintained its fullness without falling short on any particular style.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that the Taylor &#8211; Academy 12 steals the show for a beginner guitar. Taylor’s website states:</p>
<p>“One of the biggest reasons why new guitar players give up is the lack of a quality instrument. High action, bad intonation or cruddy sound will quickly derail the playing experience. The goal [with the academy series] was to remove all the barriers that get in the way, from feel to sound to cost. The result is a guitar that’s easy on the hands and helps you sound great from your first strum.”</p>
<p>We couldn’t put it any better ourselves. The Academy series was released just over a year ago and has been spreading like wildfire ever since. When I first sat down in the Taylor Guitars room at NAMM 2017, the Academy series caught my eye. Upon playing, it was clear that this model would revolutionize beginner acoustic guitars for years to come. It just felt and sounded like a far more expensive guitar. In addition to its low action and beautifully bright and resonant tone, the guitar rested comfortably between my lap and strumming arm with the aid of Taylor’s ergonomic armrest cut into the edge of the guitar body.</p>

<p>This series is available with steel strings as a dreadnought or grand concert body shape, or nylon strings with a grand concert shape for classical fingerpicking style. You can’t go wrong with any of these, but we recommend avoiding the nylon string model unless you or your child plan to stick to classical fingerpicking.</p>
<p>Additionally, this guitar comes with a deluxe gig bag included upon purchase. These cases are lightweight, sturdy and will help keep your guitar protected without the need to spend extra money on a guitar case.</p>
<p>If this guitar is within your budget, or even slightly outside of it, we definitely recommend going with the Academy 12. Choosing the right starting guitar can be the difference between a student developing a lifelong passion or another item collecting dust in the closet.</p>

<p>We were enamored by the sound of the beautiful, all-mahogany <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HWIRQ6O/?tag=ybdag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ibanez &#8211; AW54OPN</a>. This instrument exerts a rich and full tone that allows players to really jam out without resulting in cacophonous overtones. It’s common for more affordable guitars (like this one) to lack depth in midrange response, but this guitar represents the sound of mahogany: warm, full and balanced. When compared to the Taylor &#8211; Academy 12, this guitar sounded less bright and focused. This was not surprising, as mahogany is a much darker sounding tonewood than Sitka spruce.</p>

<p>Throughout our playability testing and measurements, the Ibanez excelled on all fronts. It’s very rare to play an acoustic guitar with such low action and neck relief. In fact, while testing for neck relief, we had to resort to our thinnest gauge blade (0.0015 inch) for both sides of the fretboard and there was still room to go thinner. Typically when this is the case, there is string buzz present somewhere along the fretboard. This wasn’t the case, as the guitar played and sustained beautifully in all areas. The Ibanez was the only guitar we tested that had this low of action throughout the entirety of the fretboard.</p>

This guitar is an excellent pick for players on a budget and for those looking for ease of playability with well-built construction from a reliable company.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HWIRQ6O/?tag=ybdag-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The other Artwood series model that we tested, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0051UIRR2/?tag=ybdag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AC240</a>, felt and sounded very similar to the AW54. In our ears, the AW54 had a slightly bigger sound than the AC240. This is likely due to the larger resonance area in the body. Some players would prefer the more compact size of the AC240, but you can’t go wrong with either. It may sound like a significant trade-off of size versus sound, but both guitars play very comfortably while sounding full and balanced.</p>
<p>Both of these models are excellent instruments and either one would make a great guitar for beginners. However, the dreadnought body shaped AW54 is priced significantly lower than the grand concert shaped AC240, and its sound and playability lead us to wonder why it’s priced differently at all. If you think you or your child would prefer a slightly smaller body shape, and you don’t mind paying the difference at around $100, then the AC240 is also an excellent choice.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>The solid mahogany wood composition of the Ibanez &#8211; AW54OPN produces a beautiful warm and full sound.</li>
<li>The Ibanez Artwood series had less brightness and clarity than the Taylor &#8211; Academy 12.</li>
<li>This guitar tested to have extremely low action and played very easily.</li>
<li>The grand concert shaped AC240OPN felt and sounded very similar to the dreadnought shaped AW54, but has a significantly higher price tag.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007IVUOXM/?tag=ybdag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Taylor &#8211; GS Mini</a> may be small, but it packs a huge punch. This guitar produced tons of sound with the brightness and clarity you’d expect from a Taylor, but at a reduced size compared to the other full-sized guitars. The neck was straight and the action was very low.</p>
<p>Tonally, you can expect the GS Mini to be bright and focused. However, due to its smaller body, you can also expect this guitar to produce less bass response than full-sized guitars.</p>
<p>Aside from the guitar’s excellent playability and tone, we did find some intonation issues. The intonation of the D string was flat (-), while the low E string was sharp (+). It’s common for the low E string to be poorly intonated in acoustic guitars due to it putting the most force and tension on that side of the neck, but the intonation of the D string was surprising.</p>

<p>Buying a smaller guitar poses the question, Will I eventually need a size upgrade? Fortunately, the Taylor GS Mini is quick to answer. Due to this guitar’s precise construction and wood quality, this instrument will hold its own and prevent the need for an upgrade. I know adults who prefer the size and convenience of a smaller-sized guitar, and I’ve had young students that prefer the size of a full guitar. Ultimately, size preference varies per player, but you can count on this guitar to sound at or above the level of a full-sized instrument.</p>

This guitar renders the size versus sound tradeoff obsolete by producing a sound with greater fullness and clarity than guitars far larger, while also maintaining incredible build quality and playability.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007IVUOXM/?tag=ybdag-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The reduced body size of the GS Mini allows it to sit lightly on your lap and play very smoothly. As a guitar instructor that travels from house to house every day, I choose to carry around a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007CSXUNM/?tag=ybdag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baby Taylor</a>. But if I moved around any less than I do, my go-to would be a GS Mini.</p>
<p>Aside from being a great fit for kids, the GS Mini also makes for a great travel guitar, as it is easy to carry on your back in its case (included with purchase) or to stow away when cargo space is limited.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Taylor &#8211; GS Mini is excellent for kids due to its reduced size and top-tier build quality and sound.</li>
<li>This guitar makes for a great travel companion, as it is easy to carry on your back in its accompanying case and takes up minimal cargo space.</li>
<li>Kids will find this guitar very comfortable and easy to play due to its size, low action and lightweight construction.</li>
<li>Although this guitar has the bright and full sound of a Taylor, it does have less low-end bass response due to its smaller size.</li>
</ul>

<p>Aside from our winners, we tested six other guitars that, in one way or another, fell short to the competition. We don’t recommend these guitars, as they’re priced the same or higher than our top picks but don’t perform as well.</p>
<h3>Seagull &#8211; S6 Original Acoustic Guitar</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000RW0GT6/?tag=ybdag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Seagull &#8211; S6</a> is a classic. Seagull makes great instruments at an affordable price, and I’ve had the pleasure of playing many of them. However, due to the release of the Taylor Academy Series, the S6 has met its match. At similar price points, the overall sound, playability and structural reliability of the Taylor &#8211; Academy 12 trumps the Seagull S6 without question.</p>
<p>The S6 plays well and is a well-built instrument. It has decent neck relief with low action, and has only mild intonation issues. However, the guitar tone lacks brightness and clarity compared to the Academy 12.</p>
<p>Having said this, Seagull guitars do have a very different sound than Taylors. Seagull has been around since 1982, and has persisted due to their unique sound, solid playability and affordable price. If you’re a player who just prefers the fundamental tone of Seagull over Taylor, then this instrument will make a fine selection.</p>
<h3>Yamaha &#8211; F335 and FS800</h3>
<p>Yamaha acoustic guitars are decent for the money, but are a good example of guitars that will <i>not</i> hold up in time and will eventually result in the need to upgrade. I’ve had many students over the years who started out with Yamaha guitars that needed adjustments right out of the box, and then would continue to warp over time. Our test results support this, as these guitars had extreme intonation issues and high action.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003OFQBKQ/?tag=ybdag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">F335</a> felt and played significantly better than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C931H4S/?tag=ybdag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FS800</a>. Its neck was straighter and its action was lower. While only two of the strings had poor intonation, it was concerning because they were inconsistent. The open D string compared to its octave on the 12th fret was off by +6 cents, but the G string was off by -5 cents. This inconsistency between adjacent strings would cause major playing issues as you move higher up the neck of the guitar.</p>
<p>The FS800 had significant intonation issues, as four out of six strings were off by at least +5 cents. It&#8217;s surprising that Yamaha would let this guitar leave the factory with this intonation issue, but it&#8217;s also possible the instrument warped on its own due to climate changes or during transit.</p>
<p>These guitars may have had more of a chance if they weren’t in competition to the Ibanez &#8211; AW54. But these Yamaha models are very similar in price yet fail to deliver the same quality. The better playability and sound quality of the Artwood series blows away both the F335 and FS800 from contention.</p>
<p>The Yamaha models we tested proved to harbor an excess of intonation inconsistencies, higher action and harsh overtones that can be heard in our recordings.</p>
<h3>Fender &#8211; CD-60S</h3>
<p>Fender&#8217;s legacy in the world of guitars exists for a reason. This reason is not that they make exceptional acoustic guitars. If we were here to discuss electric guitars, you can bet Fender would populate the list. As for their acoustic models, they tend to fall a bit short.</p>
<p>Having said this, I was surprised by the playability of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BMJ3M44/?tag=ybdag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CD-60S</a>. The neck profile was very comfortable, and the action was quite low too. Unfortunately, the action was a little too low, because there was some string buzz with the low E string.</p>
<p>Other than the buzzing string, the guitar played very nicely. The neck profile felt more similar to an electric guitar than an acoustic one, and was very natural and easy to play. Tonally, the guitar was bright and focused, but a little bit thin sounding. The guitar lacked the midrange depth that we heard from the Ibanez Artwood series, along with the overall balance and fullness of the Taylor guitars.</p>
<p>The particular guitar we measured also had major intonation issues with one string. The A string measured to be different by 10 cents over its octave. This is pretty significant, and odd to only be present in one string while the rest are fine.</p>
<p>I have had students that own this guitar and have enjoyed it. Per my experience, this is a starter guitar that will warrant an upgrade in the future. I’m sure it doesn’t come as a surprise to you to hear that we’ve picked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HWIRQ6O/?tag=ybdag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ibanez &#8211; AW54OPN</a> over this Fender acoustic.</p>
<h3>Epiphone &#8211; PR-150</h3>
<p>Epiphone is also a huge name in the electric guitar industry. It is frequently known to be a solid choice for a “more affordable Gibson” guitar, and it definitely holds its own when it comes to electric guitars.</p>
<p>Similar to Fender, Epiphone acoustic guitars tend to fall short and veer away from solid playability as time passes. We gave this guitar a 6/10 in playability, as we were not impressed by the overall feel and sound of the instrument. It also had very prominent issues with intonation.</p>
<p>The perk of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001S02HEI/?tag=ybdag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PR-150</a> is that it’s extremely affordable. If your budget only allows for a $120 guitar, then this might be a good pick for you. But remember… it’s expensive to buy cheap!</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The importance of picking a quality acoustic guitar, even for a beginner, is unparalleled to other instruments. There are no replacement parts, fine-tuning mechanisms or electrical amplification and effects to fall back on. With acoustic guitars, it all boils down to the instrument’s wood quality and construction, and there’s little you can do to make modifications to the instrument years down the line.</p>
<p>Our tests only supported this claim, and it was a great experience to both feel and hear the differences among the many guitars we played.</p>
<p>Bob Taylor, founder of Taylor Guitars, is a pioneer in the industry and has redefined the expectations for guitars of all levels. We are not in any way endorsed by Taylor Guitars, but rather choose to stand by their instruments due to their reliability, superior playability, quality of sound and sustainable wood farming.</p>
<p>Choosing a Taylor is choosing a guitar that will last a lifetime. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N4RIAO4/?tag=ybdag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Taylor &#8211; Academy 12</a> is our top pick for beginner guitarists because we stand by the importance of learning with a quality instrument. The Academy 12 produces a bright and balanced sound, and the ergonomic armrest further adds to an enjoyable experience for beginners.</p>
<p>If a Taylor guitar is out of your price range, you’ll still be more than satisfied with our runner-up pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HWIRQ6O/?tag=ybdag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ibanez &#8211; AW54OPN</a>. While it does fall a bit short in its brightness and clarity when compared to a Taylor, it makes up for it with it&#8217;s warm mahogany wood sound and excellent playability.</p>
<p>Don’t join countless others in the mistake of choosing a cheap instrument. In this regard, “cheap” will always apply to both the price and the quality/reliability. For the difference of a couple hundred dollars, you can get yourself a guitar for life.</p>
<p><strong>Rock on!</strong></p>

				<description><![CDATA[We spent weeks testing ten of the top fans on the market, and found that the Vornado - Vfan blew away the competition. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter weeks of testing, we&#8217;ve determined that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TX79C1O/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage</a> is our current top choice for best fan. Inspired by the company’s original model from 1945, the VFAN Vintage has an authentic vintage look. It operates both powerfully and quietly, which is the combo you want in a bedroom or living room fan. You pay more for the vintage aesthetic and more durable coated metal construction, but if style as well as efficacy is important to you, the Vornado is worth the price. At less than a third the price of our top pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012BL7Z5S/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesis &#8211; Avalon</a> was the second-most powerful fan we tested, yet remains lightweight, relatively quiet and keeps a low profile.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-found">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>There is a wide variety of fans on the market, so we started by researching which fans were best for the home and bedroom. Once we had a list of the top rated fans, we vetted them through reviews on Reddit, Amazon and real testing sites such as The Wirecutter.</p>
<p>With a list of nine finalists, we read through articles on how to measure airflow and designed our testing process with a senior manufacturing engineer with over 15 years of combined experience in the automotive, medical and defense industries.</p>
<p>Once we developed two methods to test wind velocity and circulation and came up with our numbers, we used these fans as any consumer would: to cool down on a hot summer day. In the end, the real world testing influenced our top picks as much as our calculations.</p>
<p>The cooling effect that you feel is not something that can be directly measured since a fan will not cool a room, but it will help lower your body temperature due to evaporative cooling on your skin. If you are looking for a unit that will lower the temperature in the room, you should consider installing an air conditioner.

<h2 id="features-to-consider">Features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> You want the style and design of a fan to fit in line with your room and personal needs without spoiling the interior design.</p>
<p><strong>Noise:</strong> Since a fan is often placed in a living room or bedroom, you want it to be quiet enough that you can hold a conversation without shouting. Our 10 fans averaged a reading of 63.86 decibels. (This is about the noise level of the inside of an average restaurant.) Bonus points if the fan has a quiet setting so you can use it to fall asleep at night.</p>
<p><strong>Oscillation:</strong> The ability to push out large volumes of air makes a fan better able to circulate a room. However, even a fan with low CFM (cubic feet per minute) measurements can provide a wide area of coverage if it oscillates.</p>
<p><strong>Removable grill:</strong> A fan can gather dust quickly and push it out into the room. A fan that’s easy to clean, such as one with a removable grill, makes it more likely that you will clean it on a regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>Remote control:</strong> For the sake of convenience, a remote control is handy to have, especially if the fan has remote control housing for storage when not in use. You may never have to leave your couch again.</p>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> The lighter the fan, the easier it is to move around the room or even switch rooms.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-fans">Types of fans we tested</h2>
<p>We reviewed the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-tower-fan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best tower fan</a> in another article, so for this article we focused on the following three types of household fans.</p>
<p><strong>Floor:</strong> A floor fan sits on the floor and tends to be larger than other fans. Since heat rises and the coolest air is at floor level, this will push the cooler air upwards. This makes a floor fan a good choice for home, even though many floor fans are used in industrial applications.</p>
<p><strong>Pedestal:</strong> An oscillating pedestal fan generally has large blades that are capable of cooling larger rooms. All the pedestal fans we tested have an adjustable stand. You can use the adjustable stand to change the height of a pedestal fan, and it usually includes both a remote control and digital display so you can adjust the settings from your couch or bed.</p>
<p><strong>Personal:</strong> Also referred to as a table fan, a personal fan has a small, compact size. This makes it ideal for placing on desks, tables or countertops so you can stay cool in your personal space. It is typically used if you are working at home or situated at an office desk.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/pureflow-vid-sm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<h3>Circulation</h3>
<p>Fans can improve air circulation, which means they can move a large volume of air throughout a room. We conducted the circulation test two different ways. First, we used an anemometer and a makeshift wind funnel to measure the rate of air flow. Second, we gauged circulation in a real world setting using testers on hot, humid days with temperatures in the high 80’s.<br />
We used the anemometer to measure the volume of air each fan could move.</p>
<p>Then we averaged the velocities and calculated the air flow rate in cubic feet per minute (CFM), a standard of measurement used in the HVAC industry. To give you an example of airflow measured in CFM, 300 to 400 CFM per ton of cooling is needed for an air conditioning unit to run properly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Capture all the air coming off the fan</strong><br />
We used a trash bag to &#8220;funnel&#8221; all of the air coming off the fan down to an opening of 6&#215;6 inches, then measured the air speed that comes out through the opening of the trash bag in linear feet per minute.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Measure the air speed</strong><br />
To measure the air speed, we turned on the fan to its highest setting, and let it speed up. Then we checked to make sure there wasn’t air blowing out somewhere other than the measured opening. We used our anemometer to measure an average speed for the air coming through the opening in linear feet per minute.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Calculate CFM</strong><br />
To determine the number of cubic feet per minute the fan moves, we multiplied the rate in linear feet by .25 square feet (since a 6&#215;6 inche square is a .5x.5’ square). For example, the GreenTech had a speed of 748.1 feet per minute. Multiplying this number by .25 square feet gave us a CFM of 187. We compared our results to data published by the fan manufacturers, when available.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Conduct real world testing</strong><br />
The above calculations may have little bearing on a decision to purchase a fan. With that fact in mind, we also set up a real world test that is perhaps more useful for the average person.</p>
<p>Our testers sat across the room from a fan to consider its capacity to cool them down and to circulate air. We asked our testers whether they felt cooler, and if it felt like the air was moving around the room in a way that made them feel more comfortable. Then, we recorded their responses.</p>
<p>Once we were armed with data, we compared our numbers to tester responses and looked for correlations. We found that the bigger fans were able to push a higher volume of air, even if the blades are moving more slowly.</p>
<p>The Air King, at 20 inches, outperformed the other finalists both in numbers and real life circulation. The Genesis &#8211; Avalon, at more than half the price of the Air King, pushed out a comparable volume of air. Our other floor fan, the Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage was another top performer. Of the pedestal fans, the Klarstein rated nearly as well as the floor fans.</p>
<p>We were unable to get accurate numbers for the Vornado &#8211; Zippi, which has exposed fabric blades that touched the plastic bag and impeded the air flow.</p>
<h3>Wind velocity</h3>
<p>We tested the peak air speed with an anemometer at a typical distance we&#8217;d use a fan. To capture the speed of an air stream coming off the fan, we used a cardboard “sampling” tube. Our tube measured 3 feet long and 6 inches in diameter. This gave us a straight path for the air that was the same for each test.</p>
<p>We placed each fan so its louvre blades weren&#8217;t blowing air up or down but were parallel to the ground. Then we held the tube parallel to the ground and directly touching the face of the fan to help isolate it from any vortexes. We turn the fan on to its highest setting and measured the wind speed at the end of the tube. We moved both the tube and meter around different parts of the fan and logged the fastest speeds we could capture.</p>
<p>Since this test only measured the speed of a tiny air stream, a high number here from a small fan isn&#8217;t unexpected. However, we found that the wind velocity was higher in our largest fan and our floor fans had the highest speeds.</p>
<p>The Air King reached top speeds of 13.4 miles per hour (MPH), once again outperforming our other finalists. The Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage was a close second at 11.4 MPH, and the Genesis reached top speeds of 10.5 MPH. Among the pedestal fans, the Klarstein performed the best (and was nearly comparable to the floor fans) at 10.3 MPH.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, the personal fans had the lowest speeds. The best performer here was the Holmes at 7.8 MPH.</p>
<h3>Sound test</h3>
<p>The noise of fans are usually calculated as sones, a subjective measurement of how sound is sensed. <strong>The lower the sone rating, the quieter the fan will be.</strong> You may see this number advertised by manufacturers, although more typically this is used with exhaust fans or fans that serve as a backup when an HVAC system doesn’t work properly.</p>
<p>Typically, the sone level is measured at the maximum cubic feet per minute (speed), which we previously tested. You can also convert sone ratings to decibels to give you an example of how loud a fan sounds. For example, a sone rating of 2.0 would have the approximate noise level of a residential area at night.</p>
<p>For a practical sound level measurement, we used a sound decibel meter to measure decibels at an arm’s length away from the grill and set the fan to its highest setting. Unsurprisingly, our personal fans such as the Vornado &#8211; Zippi and Honeywell were the quietest at 48 and 59.8 decibels, respectively. The Holmes was in the mid-range at 64.5 decibels, despite being a personal fan.</p>
<p>The quietest floor fan was the Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage, which was even quieter than the Holmes at 62.4 decibels. The quietest pedestal fan was the Best Choice at 64.6 decibels.</p>
<p>The Air King was exceptionally loud, rating at 79.2 decibels (or approximately the sound of a vacuum from 3 feet away). It also had the most unpleasing acoustics, as it starts out with a rattling sound, and on full speed it buzzes like a swarm of bees.</p>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<p>No matter how quiet or powerful a fan can be, usability is a key factor when choosing a fan that works best for you. For this portion of the testing, we considered how easy it was to interface with the fan, how safe it seemed and how easy it was to keep clean.</p>
<p><strong>Assembly</strong><br />
As we unpacked the boxes, we considered ease of assembly. The floor and personal fans arrived in one piece, while the pedestal fans needed to be assembled. The Klarstein was the easiest of the pedestal fans to assemble, with a two piece grill that snapped together. Both the Rowenta and Best Choice required some complicated maneuvering to fit together. This also became an issue when we cleaned the fans later.</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetics</strong><br />
Once assembled, we considered design and aesthetics. We took note of the unique, modern look of the bladeless GreenTech and the sleek design of the Klarstein (especially compared to the other pedestal fans). In terms of sheer style, the Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage would hold its own with any interior decorating scheme. It is simply a fan meant to be displayed. The Vornado &#8211; Zippi is another fan from the same maker that stands out on a desk.</p>
<p>The Air King, with its rough metal edges and exposed screws, has an unrefined, industrial look that may not vibe in a home setting. The Genesis is comparable to the Air King in terms of size and style, but tends to blend into the background much better.</p>
<p><strong>Stability</strong><br />
The first thing we looked for when we turned the fans on was whether or not each fan kept steady. We placed the pedestal fans on carpet and hard flooring, the personal fans on a desktop and the floor fans on carpet, hard flooring and a kitchen chair (since floor fans should by nature be more versatile in their placement). Nearly all of the fans were stable on their highest setting, the one exception being the Air King, which wobbles on “take off” and then seems to get its bearings.</p>
<p><strong>Cleanability</strong><br />
You don’t have to worry about dust collecting on the blades with the bladeless GreenTech: All you need to do is wipe down the face and base with a soft cloth. If there is any dust accumulation on the back grill, you can clean it with a vacuum. It was the only fan we tested that didn’t require the removal of any parts to clean, making it the most simple.</p>
<p>Two of our personal fans, the Holmes and Honeywell advertise a removable grill that you can easily pop off to dust the blades. However, both models require you to remove the Phillips head screws at the back or base of the grill, so it isn’t as easy as we would have liked.</p>
<p>The grill wire of the Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage can be released from the support tabs using a flat screwdriver, and snapped back into place, making it easier to reach the blades than our other floor models. It is difficult to reach the blades of the Genesis and Air King, since you unscrew the grill to clean and then reassemble it.</p>
<p>For the models that require you to take it apart to clean the blades, we came across several tips from users that may help you reduce the number of times you have to perform a deep clean. Among the tools recommended were canned air, Swiffer dusters and cotton swabs. We also used microfiber cleaning cloths to dust the grill, preemptively removing dust before we needed to clean the blades.</p>
<p><strong>Safety</strong><br />
We initially conceived that we would use a pencil to test safety, by seeing if it would fit through the grate and whether or not it left a mark on the the side of the pencil when stopped by blades. However, after concern that this would damage the fans, we went with a much simpler test: seeing if our pinky finger (roughly the size of a child’s index finger) would fit through the grate with the fan turned off.</p>
<p>Styled after its 1945 predecessor (the fans of those days had more exposed blades), the Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage was the only fan that caused us to raise our eyebrows. Our pinky finger fit a little deeper than we felt safe, were the fan to be on and a child involved. Needless to say, you would want to keep children and pets away from any fan with a moving blade. If you are concerned about safety, the bladeless GreenTech would be your best bet. The Vornado &#8211; Zippi is another safe alternative, with fabric blades that won’t harm little fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Usability</strong><br />
The floor fans and personal fans are fairly straightforward in terms of operation: you use a knob to turn them on. Therefore we didn’t concern ourselves with usability as much as the pedestal fans.</p>
<p>For all the fans, we measured cord length with a ruler, since nobody wants a fan that doesn’t reach their outlets. The cords typically ran to 5 or 6 feet, with several fans on the shorter side of the spectrum at 5 feet. We favored the 6 feet, although the 8-foot cord of the GreenTech was handy. The Air King had 20 feet of cord, which was more than necessary for our home needs.</p>
<p>For the pedestal fans, we interacted with them without reading the user manuals first, to determine whether or not the display symbols were intuitive. Since the pedestal fans came with a remote, we checked the product manuals for specifications and tested whether the remotes worked at the ranges claimed.</p>
<p>The Klarstein was intuitive to interface with, both on the LCD digital display and remote control, despite having multiple settings, speeds and a timer. We especially liked the fact that the remote control had the same dial system to adjust speed as on the fan. Another feature we liked is the auto-dimming display, which turns off automatically after a few moments so you don’t have a distracting glow in your bedroom at night.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, some users have reported that their television remote changes the fan settings. We didn’t experience this with any of the remotes we used around it: television, DVD and Wii.</p>
<p>In comparison, the Best Choice  has an easy to read digital display, but the bright blue light never shuts off, which can make it hard to sleep when placed in a bedroom. The remote control is clearly labeled with words (rather than icons like the Klarstein) and easy to use.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-fan">The best overall: Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage</h2>

<p>If you are looking for a fan with a lot of bells and whistles, you may want to look elsewhere. However, if you want a sturdy and powerful fan that has a neat vintage aesthetic, doesn’t wobble and is quiet and powerful, we highly recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TX79C1O/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage</a>. We tested the VFAN Sr, although the line comes in several sizes and even has a pedestal option.</p>

Most importantly though, it has high power but operates quietly.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TX79C1O/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>For a fan that looks old-fashioned, the VFAN has one of the widest vertical tilt ranges of the fans we tested. It can tilt 180 degrees in either direction; the only thing that stops it from tilting 360 degrees is the cord. It doesn’t oscillate, but it doesn’t need to. The twin air cones, deep-pitched propeller blades and vortex action mean that air moves outward in a spiral, so it travels further. Even before we verified this with our circulation test, we could feel the breeze rippling in all corners of the room.</p>
<p>It is the most expensive fan we tested, but it’s also made with a quality built to last. It has a durable construction and is made with high-quality materials.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Vornado brand has been around since 1945, giving them plenty of time to hone their craft. One thing that hasn’t changed? The retro style of the Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage that recreates the classic look.</li>
<li>You don’t need a degree in aerodynamics to appreciate the effects of the company’s signature vortex action, which pushes out a large volume of air and allows it to travel further.</li>
<li>While it doesn’t oscillate, it has a vertical tilt that beats out nearly all of the other finalists.</li>
<li>Despite a high wind velocity, it is one of the most quiet floor fans we tested.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-runner-up">The runner-up: Klarstein &#8211; Silent Storm</h2>

<p>We found that overall, floor fans are more powerful than pedestal fans. But that doesn’t mean you’re out of luck with a pedestal fan. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZYTD184/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klarstein &#8211; Silent Storm</a> delivers consistent high wind speed and circulates air better than the other pedestal fans we tested; in fact, its performance rivaled that of a floor fan. You end up getting the power of a floor fan with the versatility of a pedestal fan. In our opinion, this makes it worth the high price tag (when compared with similar models).</p>
<p>If you like fancy features, you may be especially enticed to buy the Klarstein. One of its coolest features is the comfort mode, which automatically adjusts the speed based on the current room temperature. We also liked the night mode, which turns down the decibels and automatically switches off.</p>

<p>In the same vein, the auto-dimming display means there is nothing blinking at you when you try to go to sleep at night, and it makes the design look more sleek during the day. The natural mode, which simulates the wind, was less jarring than in other models with a similar feature.</p>
<p>On the silent mode, it measures only 40.4 decibels, perfect if you want a gentle breeze at night without the noise. It is one of the louder models on full speed, slightly above our average decibel rating, but it didn’t impact our opinion about the Klarstein. We can honestly say that we didn’t find any drawbacks with this fan, although you may want to keep in mind that the price tag is on the high side compared to other fans we tested.</p>
<p>The Klarstein comes with 26 different speed settings, and w<span style="font-weight: 400;">hile 26 settings may be more than any user actually needs, we loved being able to give the dial a quick spin to easily land within the range we wanted (high, medium, low). The multiple settings are thanks to the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">brushless DC motor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (BLDC), which gives you a wide speed range due to a linear torque curve. BLDC motors have higher efficiency, run quietly and have a long service life &#8212; all features you look for in a quality fan. </span></p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A powerful 16-inch fan on a tilt-resistant base, the Klarstein &#8211; Silent Storm is a strong performer with a sleek look.</li>
<li>The height can be adjusted by up to 6 inches, and the vertical tilt adjusted by 30 degrees. It also has 90-degree oscillation. With all these options, you can direct the wind stream where ever you need it to go.</li>
<li>Change speed settings (up to 26) with an easy to use control wheel on either the unit or the remote control.</li>
<li>It has a brushless DC motor and operates on 35W, so it is economical even at its highest speeds.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-budget-pick">The budget pick: Genesis &#8211; Avalon</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012BL7Z5S/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesis &#8211; Avalon</a> is a fitting choice for households that move their fan from room to room. It has a lightweight construction, weighing only 8 pounds, and features an easy-carry handle. For something so lightweight, we were pleasantly surprised at how stable it is on the floor or a table (especially given its high wind speeds). When bumped into, it doesn’t knock over easily, either.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012BL7Z5S/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/genesis-avalon-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/genesis-avalon-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/genesis-avalon-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/genesis-avalon-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/genesis-avalon-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/genesis-avalon-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/genesis-avalon-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/genesis-avalon-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/genesis-avalon.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Budget Pick: Genesis</h3><p>Lightweight, portable and powerful are the key features of this high velocity floor fan.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012BL7Z5S/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>It has a 360-degree vertical tilt, so you can push a large amount of air (it tested as our second highest rated fan in terms of volume) into the room at whatever angle you wish. It has a durable copper motor, so not only does it reach high wind speeds, it has a reputation for lasting a long time. This makes the low price even more exceptional.</p>
<p>The design is fairly minimalist, encased in a hard black plastic, but it certainly won’t clash with your decor. It blends in to any area it is placed. We also appreciated the tightly spaced grill, which keeps small prying hands away from the blades.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will say that this fan&#8217;s low price is somewhat evident in its design. It’s harder to clean the blades of the Genesis, and the all-plastic construction makes it feel and look more flimsy than our other top picks.</span></p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In terms of volume and wind speed, the Genesis &#8211; Avalon was the second most powerful fan we tested.</li>
<li>At just 8 pounds, it is exceptionally lightweight for such a powerful fan.</li>
<li>Able to pivot a full 360 degrees, you can direct the air stream anywhere you choose, even directly up or down.</li>
<li>With well covered blades and a <a href="https://www.ul.com/aboutul/what-we-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UL approved</a> safety fused plug, you can feel comfortable with its safety features.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Holmes &#8211; Lil Blizzard</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000J07RMU/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Holmes &#8211; Lil Blizzard</a> is perfectly sized to fit on your desk, helping you circulate air so you can feel comfortable and work more efficiently. After all, you can’t type with two hands if you’re fanning yourself with one. It isn’t the quietest personal fan, but it isn’t so loud that your office mates would complain. It oscillates smoothly, can be tilted up or down (30 degrees in either direction) and can be locked in place.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000J07RMU/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/holmes-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/holmes-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/holmes-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/holmes-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/holmes-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/holmes-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/holmes-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/holmes-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/holmes.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Personal: Holmes</h3><p>While the Holmes can circulate air in a small area, it’s an ideal breeze-maker for your desk.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000J07RMU/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>It can also be easily used on a bedside table to cool yourself at night or on a kitchen counter to offset the heat from cooking. It’s priced low enough you could buy more than one, and it’s lightweight enough to easily move around if you want to save space.</p>
<h3>Air King &#8211; 9212</h3>
<p>You could say the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007Q3RHK/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Air King &#8211; 9212</a> blows away the competition in terms of wind speed and air flow you could say it will blow you across the room. The Air King has tremendous power, but it feels like overkill as a fan for home. It also has a three-pronged outlet, unlike our other fans. If you have an open space office or a garage that would benefit from powerful air circulation, this is a good option.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007Q3RHK/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/air-king-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/air-king-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/air-king-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/air-king-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/air-king-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/air-king-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/air-king-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/air-king-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/air-king.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best for Office: Air King</h3><p>The Air King pushed out the highest volume of air of the finalists. However, you'll have to be tolerate its high noise levels.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007Q3RHK/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>When you first start up the Air King, it makes a rattling sound and wobbles, but then it settles into a normal albeit loud whirring sound. For this reason, we did not choose the Air King for our top pick, despite its winning performance.</p>
<h3>GreenTech &#8211; PureFlow</h3>
<p>The aesthetic of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072PS3FR1/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GreenTech</a> is ultra modern — in fact, with its sphere shape and shiny white casing, it looks more like a futuristic cartoon character (specifically, EVE from Disney’s WALL-E) than a traditional fan.</p>
<p>We can’t say enough about our comfort level with the bladeless design, and we felt it was safe enough to be in an area where young children are playing, without worrying they would attempt to stick their fingers through a grate and touch the blade.</p>
<p>The digital controls are easy to use, so you can figure them out without the use of the manual. The remote control is simple to use as well, and has a long range so it can be used from the other side of a large room.</p>
<p>The speeds range from 1 to 12. It’s not that powerful on its highest speed (at 10” across, it has a smaller face than the average 16 inches), but it circulates well, and you can feel the breeze from across the room. Despite the safety and usability of this fan, we didn’t feel it had enough wind speed to recommend it as our top pick.</p>
<p>What we loved about the digital controls on this fan is that it remembers the last setting you used, so if it was on speed 10 when you turned it off, it will be on speed 10 when you turn it on again.</p>
<h3>Rowenta &#8211; VU5551</h3>
<p>In its turbo-boost mode, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C4QP8N2/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rowenta<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></a>had strong wind speeds and was able to push a decent amount of air (just above average when compared with our other finalists). Unfortunately, with only mid-range power, it was the second loudest of the fans we tested. It advertises a top decibel rating of 57, although we recorded it at 68.1. The remote control and unit are easy to interface with, and the fan is easy to adjust.</p>
<p>The downsides to the Rowenta are that there is no on-board storage for the remote control and the front grill is extremely difficult to remove and reposition (making cleaning a chore). It also has a blue light that stays on all night. For these reasons, and the fact that it is slightly less powerful than our top picks, we didn’t name this our best pick.</p>
<h3>Vornado &#8211; Zippi</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000E19MQ8/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vornado &#8211; Zippi</a> is definitely a conversation starter. Available in black, white or a variety of bright colors, the Zippi has a unique look. It is reminiscent of an airplane propeller, with three blades made of soft nylon fabric. The blades are safe to touch even when the fan is in motion. It weighs only 1.7 pounds (our lightest fan) and folds compact, making it an ideal travel companion.</p>
<p>It’s the quietest fan we tested, but it also had the lowest wind speed. We weren’t able to test the CFM due to the way the fan is constructed, although we did notice it is light on power. This took it out of the running for first place. Still, we think it’s pretty cute.</p>
<p>Some users have reported if you tilt it all the way back on the highest setting, it will flip over. We didn’t experience this issue, however.</p>
<h3>Honeywell &#8211; HT900 Turbo</h3>
<p>We can see why the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001R1RXUG/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Honeywell</a> is a best seller on Amazon. It’s very basic, but it can pivot to a 90-degree angle and pushes out a large volume of air for its small stature. The Honeywell uses its proprietary Turbo Force Air Circular technology to achieve this effect. It’s one of the quietest fans we tested, so it’s great for a small bedroom.</p>
<p>It’s slightly big for a desktop fan but not enough air flow to place more than a few feet away from where you need it. This makes it a good fan, especially for the price, but prevented it from being labelled our number one.</p>
<p>Despite measuring at a loudness of only 64.6 decibels (close to our average decibel rating), the Best Choice makes clicking, popping and occasional grinding noises when in use. We also found the so-called “wind mode” to be a little disconcerting; it felt as if power were fading in and out, as if it were coming loose from the plug. Finally, the construction left something to be desired, and the LCD digital display never shuts off. For these reasons, we didn’t name the Best Choice as a top pick.</p>
<p>However, given its low price in comparison with the other pedestal fans, it may still be worth considering. If you just need a fan to get you through a brief period, the Best Choice is a decent fan in terms of circulation, breeze and ease of use.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>With any of our top choices, you can feel confident you’ll be purchasing a high-caliber product. They all have high wind speeds, push out a large volume of air and are constructed from durable, quality materials. The best choice for you when it comes to a fan depends on your personal preferences and budget.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TX79C1O/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage</a> is a great choice for those who have a strong sense of style and want a fan that circulates air in a tornado air stream that reaches all corners of the room.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a pedestal fan that can be adjusted to direct a strong air stream to where you need, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZYTD184/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klarstein &#8211; Silent Storm</a> is an excellent choice. It’s the most versatile fan we tested, with multiple modes and speeds. It can be set to a night-time mode that is ultra quiet and shuts off after a set amount of time, making it an ideal fan for the bedroom.</p>
<p>If budget is highest on your list of considerations, you’ll appreciate the relative low price of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012BL7Z5S/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesis &#8211; Avalon</a>. The Genesis is a steal, and you won’t have to sacrifice power.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We tested the top kid and adult bean bag chairs for durability, comfort and style and found that the Lumaland was the coziest and sturdiest. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent four weeks rigorously chilling, cuddling and sleeping on eight of the top-selling bean bag chairs on the market. We tested durability, washed the covers and researched safety of filling materials and in the end, found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073VQSJ45/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lumaland &#8211; Luxury Bean Bag Chair</a> to be the best bean bag chair. Lumaland stood out because of its shredded foam filling and quality microsuede cover. All our testers loved this bag’s back support and how easy it was to change the cover making machine washing a breeze. For a kid-sized bean bag, we found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008AE0WV0/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Big Joe &#8211; Dorm Bean Bag Chair</a> stood out from the competition because of its comfort, easy-to-clean cover and lightweight design.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We began our research by consulting online reviews from respected retailers like Amazon, Target and Walmart. User reviews from these sites were used to find out which features are important to consumers, and to determine the leading bean bag chair brands. We also read subreddits such as /r/furniture/, where consumers discussed which bean bag chairs had proved to be good purchases.</p>
<p>After determining which bean bags received a high number of positive user reviews, we narrowed down our list by excluding luxury bean bags that were over $200. We excluded luxury bean bags because our research found similar enthusiasm from reviewers for luxury and midrange ($50-$150) versions, so we chose bean bags that would deliver the most value.</p>
<p>Next we researched technical components of bean bag filling materials. We found the two most popular filling materials were polystyrene beads or shredded foam. It was important that our list of finalists contain bean bags filled with both types of material, so that we could put the two most popular materials to the test.</p>

[table id=125 /]
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Filling material</b>: All of our bean bag finalists were filled with either a type of expandable polystyrene (EPS) bead or shredded foam. EPS is the same material used in disposable coffee cups and packaging peanuts. It is a good material for bean bag chairs because it is lightweight and can hold its form for several years.</p>
<p>EPS is not biodegradable, but EPS beads may be recycled. Bean bags that use recycled EPS beads have a shorter lifespan than those that use non-recycled EPS beads. Unfortunately, this means that consumers who want to “go green” and use recycled EPS beads may end up having to refill their bean bags sooner than those who opt for non-recycled EPS beads.</p>
<p>Only one of the bean bag chairs we tested specified whether its EPS beads were made from recycled or non-recycled material. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008AE0WV0/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Big Joe &#8211; Dorm</a> uses <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0055DXQS0/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Megahh Beads</a>, which is Big Joe’s proprietary formula. The company claims this material has no recycled components. Our other bean bag chairs did not specify whether their EPS beads were made with recycled or new material.</p>
<p>Shredded foam is also popular as bean bag chair filling because of its high density and comfort. This is a heavier material that often requires the consumer to break apart large foam pieces by massaging the foam within a cover. If the foam is not broken up enough, irregular-shaped foam chunks can be uncomfortable when sitting. However, when broken in correctly, this material provides a high degree of comfort.</p>
<p><b>Cover material:</b> Durability, comfort and style are all important considerations when choosing a bean bag cover. We tested bean bags with microsuede, cotton, vinyl and polyester coverings — all durable materials that minimize tearing and bleaching.</p>
<p>Half of the bean bags we tested had removable covers which could be washed or switched with ease. This removability is especially important for microsuede or cotton covers, which are best cleaned in the washing machine. Spot cleaning is often adequate for bean bag chairs with vinyl or polyester covers.</p>

<p>Removable bean bag covers use zippers, therefore zipper quality is very important to the overall removability of the cover. More secure bean bags use double zipper systems that ensure the bean bag cover does not gradually slide open.</p>
<p><b>Size: </b>How much floor space are you willing to devote to your bean bag chair? Bean bags are available in a wide variety of sizes. Typically, child-sized bean bag chairs are under three feet wide, while adult bean bags usually range from four to six feet.</p>
<p><b>Structure</b>: The traditional bean bag is a structureless bag of beads, but there are now more options for those who want a more structured seat. Structured components such as armrests and cup holders may be especially desirable for those planning to use their bean bag chair for long periods of time, such as gamers.</p>
<p><b>Weight</b>: Our testers lugged bean bags up and down stairs, so trust us, lightweight bean bags are a plus. While lightweight bean bags filled with EPS beads make life easier when rearranging furniture, heavier foam can provide more comfort to some users.</p>
<p><b>Aesthetics</b>: The wide range of bean bag covers available means that a bean bag can be a stylish component to a room. Brainstorm which colors and textures would work in your space before beginning your bean bag chair quest.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bean-bag-testing.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Our bean bag finalists were cuddled, squished, bounced and kicked during four weeks of rigorous comfort testing by six different testers. Our testers incorporated all eight bean bags into their daily life. A comfort questionnaire was completed after the first and fourth week of use, so that any changes in the bean bag’s comfort would be noticed. In addition to comfort testing, we also took careful notes on the ease of each bean bag’s assembly and how easy it was to wash the cover.</p>
<h3>Assembly and sizing</h3>
<p>All of the shredded foam bean bags required an inner bag full of foam material to be broken apart and then put inside a cover. This assembly was simple, taking only about five to ten minutes. Foam bean bags take three to seven days for the foam to completely expand. During this period we sat, fluffed and flipped over bean bags multiple times to ensure foam was completely expanded before comfort testing.</p>
<p>The bean bag chairs filled with EPS beads did not require assembly. However, the majority of our testers noted that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F8FM7ZC/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ECR4Kids &#8211; Classic</a> felt like it needed more beads than it came with. If you find your bean bag chair a bit “deflated,” additional <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bean-Bag-Refill-Beans/dp/B00AZWPAJE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1526947541&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bean+bag+beads" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EPS beads</a> can be purchased online and added to your bean bags at home.</p>
<p>At the end of week one and week four, each bean bag’s widest and tallest dimensions were taken. We gathered this information to see if the bean bags would lose their structure or flatten out after intense use. Encouragingly, none of our bean bag finalists’ dimensions changed significantly. However, EPS beads usually lose their structure over the course of the first five years, so if you buy this type of bean bag you may need to purchase bead refills at a later point.</p>
<h3>Comfort</h3>
<p>During week one and week four of comfort testing, testers answered questions regarding neck and back comfort, how easy getting in and out of the chair was, presence of any off-gassing odor and overall quality of the bean bag. The testing revealed no significant changes to any of the bean bags’ comfort over the course of four weeks. The most significant difference noted by our testers was the dissipation of initial chemical odors from packaging.</p>
<p>During the course of our testing, we found that our testers were split on whether they preferred EPS beads or foam filling. If you are not able to test which filling material you prefer, we recommend considering whether you want a lightweight or stationary bean bag chair. Bean bags filled with EPS beads are much easier to move, while foam bean bags stay put like other classic furniture pieces.</p>
<p>Both musty and chemical odors were noted by our testers for multiple bean bags in our week one comfort testing. However, these off-gassing odors disappeared for most of our finalists by week four. The noted exception to this was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B015QJJJHY/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fugu &#8211; 4XL</a>, which maintained a very musty, “cardboardy” smell over the course of the four weeks. This odor was most likely due to the fact that the bean bag’s foam exploded from its package while it was being shipped. Further, we were unable to wash this bean bag’s cover because of a foam leak. The Fugu, like the other foam bean bags, came with its foam filling in a polyester inner lining that is then placed within an outer cover. This inner lining is not meant to be broken, however the Fugu’s sprung a leak.</p>

<p>Half of the bean bags we tested had removable covers that we washed in a washing machine. We found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073VQSJ45/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lumaland &#8211; Luxury</a>’s cover was exceptionally easy to remove and put back on because of the quality zipper design. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P21WAXM/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chill Sack &#8211; 2-Foot Round</a> and Cozy Sack were not far behind; both bean bag covers were easy to remove and put back on. As previously noted, we were unable to remove the Fugu’s cover because of a breakage in its inner lining.</p>
<p>The EPS bean bags did not have removable covers. Instead these brands recommended that the bags be spot cleaned as needed.

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073VQSJ45/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lumaland &#8211; Luxury Bean Bag Chair</a> ranked highest for comfort with all but one of our testers, plus it has an easy-to-remove cover and no odor. Our testers loved Lumaland’s shredded foam filling and microsuede cover. This bean bag’s price tag is under $200, meaning you can get a quality bean bag without breaking the bank.</p>
<p>The Lumaland is four feet wide, a size our testers found to be comfortable for one adult. It is also available in three foot and five foot diameters. Our testers ranked the Lumaland as one of the easiest bean bags to get out of due to its taller height at around 28 inches.</p>

Its comfortable foam filling and easy to clean microsuede cover push it a cut above the competition. Available in eight different colors, the Lumaland's large 4-foot diameter makes a perfect adult lounger.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073VQSJ45/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Straight out of the box, the Lumaland had no musty foam or packaging odor. Like other foam bean bag chairs, the Lumaland’s assembly requires foam contained in an inner polyester lining to be broken up and placed in its outer cover. While the foam had already puffed up slightly during shipping, breaking up the rest of the foam was quick and easy.</p>
<p>The Lumaland’s zipper quality made the cover easy to remove and replace, even when the inner foam was completely broken apart. This means cleaning the Lumaland is no problem for anyone with a washing machine.</p>
<p>The Lumaland’s foam filling makes it heavier than other EPS filled bean bags. This bean bag’s heaviness and quality means it is meant to be a more-or-less stationary furniture item.</p>
<p>Lumaland offers eight different color options for this bag’s microsuede covers. Half of these colors could be described as mature neutrals, meaning the Lumaland looks at home in an adult bedroom or living room.</p>
<p>This bean bag showed no signs of wearing or flattening after four weeks of intense use. This bean bag’s quality is apparent in its comfortable foam filling and outer microsuede cover. For under $200, the Lumaland is a great option for adults looking for a comfortable classic bean bag.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Lumaland &#8211; Luxury is filled with shredded foam that was rated most comfortable by our testers.</li>
<li>The microsuede cover is easy to remove and replace, making cleaning simple.</li>
<li>This bean bag had no musty foam odor and was easy to assemble.</li>
<li>Its tall height (28”x48”) makes it easier to get out of than other lower-hieght bean bags.</li>

<p>While the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008AE0WV0/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Big Joe &#8211; Dorm Bean Bag Chair</a> may be marketed for college students, it is also a top choice for children. It can comfortably fit a wide age range of children, yet is under three feet wide. The Big Joe’s versatility comes from its structure, which includes arm- and backrests.</p>
<p>The Big Joe had the firmest structure of all of our bean bags. Our testers appreciated this firmness and rated this bean bag chair as the most comfortable for kids. While the Big Joe is less cuddly than other unstructured bean bags, it offers more support.</p>
<p>The Big Joe’s structure is ideal for children and teens who play video games because of the increased back support. Also, the Big Joe comes equipped with a drink holder and side pocket that could be useful for gamers.</p>
<p>Big Joe is filled with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0055DXQS0/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Megahh Beads</a>, the company’s own proprietary polystyrene bead, which our testers found comfortable. Unlike with other kids’ bean bags, our testers did not want more or less beads inside. However, as noted earlier, polystyrene beads lose their structure over the course of years and need to be replaced. Additional Megahh Beads, which are fully recyclable, can be purchased for under $20.</p>

While the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P21XE32/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sofa Sack</a>’s quality microsuede cover ranked well with our testers, our testers cited disappointment in the chair’s foam filling. Our testers complained that the Sofa Sack’s foam was too hard to snuggle into. Multiple testers noted that the bean bag chair was comfortable for laying down flat, but did not offer any back support when sitting in an upright or slightly reclined position.</p>
<p>The Sofa Sack came with a slight off-gassing odor, which dissipated after the first week. Its cover was very easy to remove and replace, which made cleaning simple. Overall the Sofa Sack’s cover quality was good, with tough zippers and microsuede material.</p>
<p>Because of its five foot diameter and foam filling, this bean bag is very difficult to move. While its cover has the quality of a good piece of furniture, its inner foam is lacking in comfort. The price difference between the Sofa Sack and Lumaland &#8211; Luxury is under $50, so if possible we recommend springing for the more comfortable Lumaland.</p>

<p>Our testers complained that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F8FM7ZC/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ECR4Kids &#8211; Classic Bean Bag Chair</a> needed more of its EPS bead filling material. This bean bag chair also had a tendency to fill up with air, and then decompress when sat on. At 35” wide, this bean bag is best suited for kids 12 years old and under.</p>
<p>This bean bag chair’s best aspect was its tough vinyl cover, which was very easy to spot clean. This vinyl cover did not rank high for aesthetics with our testers, but definitely did the job for durability and stain resistance. This small bean bag is also very lightweight, meaning this bean bag could easily be moved for indoor and outdoor use.</p>
<p>Overall, we recommend this bean bag as a solid choice for those with kids 12 and under because of the bags light weight, tough cover and easy cleaning. However, you may want to buy extra EPS bead filling to give your kids extra comfort.</p>

<p>Our testers appreciated the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P21WAXM/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chill Sack &#8211; 2-Foot Round</a>’s quality foam filling material, but some were frustrated with the bags small size. The Chill Sack is only two feet wide, and is suitable only for children under five years old.</p>
<p>This bean bag is safe for small children because it does not use chokable EPS beads and has a secure inner bag of foam. The removable microsuede cover is easy to remove and replace to machine wash. Two of our testers noted a slight musty odor initially. However, this disappeared over a week. Overall, this bean bag chair is a good choice for those with very small children.</p>

<p>The Fugu &#8211; 4XL Bean Bag Chair was the largest bean bag chair we tested. We found that after 3-7 days of use this bean bag measured about 6” wider than the advertised four feet. This is because of a breakage of the inner polyester lining that held the foam.</p>
<p>This massive bean bag chair was rated as above average for comfort overall by our testers. However, this bean bag did not rate as comfortable as the Lumaland because of irregular chunks of unbroken foam inside. Though this was technically our fault, the foam inside this bean bag was very hard to break apart during assembly. Our testers detected foam chunks even after four weeks of intense use.</p>
<p>The Fugu also had the strongest odor of all of the finalists. The bean bag chair reeked of “cardboardy,” musty packaging material. To make matters worse, we were not able to wash the Fugu’s cover in the washing machine because of a leak of foam in the bag’s inner lining.</p>
<p>Because the Fugu’s foam had broken through its inner lining, we contacted the seller for a refund. We did not get a response, but a few days later we received a new bean bag. Fugu’s confusing return process and quality issues were a pain. Therefore, we recommend either opting for the similarly priced Sofa Sack &#8211; 5-Foot Round, or paying around $50 more for the superior Lumaland &#8211; Luxury Bean Bag Chair.</p>
<h3>Flash Furniture &#8211; Oversized</h3>

<p>Multiple testers cited wishing there were more beads inside the Flash Furniture &#8211; Oversized Bean Bag Chair. The lack of filling contributed to its just below average ranking for comfort overall. This bean bag chair was our only adult bean bag that was filled with EPS beads.</p>
<p>At 40 inches wide, this bean bag comfortably fits one adult. It arrived already at its full size, and no assembly was required. It also had no off-gassing odor straight out of the box.</p>
<p>This bean bag had a good quality cotton cover with tough zippers that locked to ensure EPS beads stayed inside. Because this cover is non-removable, Flash Furniture recommends spot cleaning the chair as needed. This is a pain because of cotton’s tendency to stain and absorb smells. We do not recommend this bean bag because it is a pain to clean and needed more filling.</p>
<h3>American Furniture Alliance &#8211; Child’s Large</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-12796 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance.jpg" alt="American Furniture Alliance pink bean bag" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/American-Furniture-Alliance-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The American Furniture Alliance &#8211; Child&#8217;s Large Bean Bag ranked lowest for comfort with our testers because of the cheap polyester outer material and the course EPS beads inside. While there was a good amount of beads inside the bag, our testers did not find these beads as comfortable as in other kid’s bean bags.</p>
<p>This bean bag had a slight chemically smell that dissipated over time. The outer cover is not removable and is hard to spot clean because the polyester material absorbs liquids and odors. At 32” wide this bean bag is a good size for kids 12 years old and younger, but does not deliver on quality and comfort.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The primary job of a bean bag is to be comfortable. Durability, style and low odor are big pluses as well. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073VQSJ45/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lumaland &#8211; Luxury Bean Bag Chair</a> delivered on all of these components. Its shredded foam filling was easy to break apart and ranked as the most comfortable by our testers. Testers also loved the softness of the bean bag’s outer microsuede cover. This cover is a breeze to machine wash because removing and replacing it on the bean bag is simple.</p>
<p>The Lumaland comes with no odor straight out of the package, and is large enough to comfortably fit one adult. The bean bag chair proves that a quality adult bean bag can be purchased for under $200.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008AE0WV0/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Big Joe &#8211; Dorm Bean Bag Chair</a> took our top spot for kids because it fits a wide variety of age ranges from small child to teen. This highly structured bean bag delivers on back support and is extremely lightweight. It is stain resistant and priced under $50, meaning parents can save more money for the college fund.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P21WAXM/?tag=ybdbean-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chill Sack &#8211; 2-Foot Round</a> is a quality option only for those with children under five years old. Its foam filling and microsuede cover ranked high for comfort, but the bean bag’s small size is limiting.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter four weeks testing four top-ranked dehumidifiers in the most muggy conditions we could create with a room full of <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-humidifier/">humidifiers</a>, we’ve determined that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UWP07LK/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Frigidaire &#8211; FFAD7033R1</a> is the most-efficient, fastest-working and best dehumidifier overall.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>One of the challenges when picking a home appliance is the short cycle between updates: every year or two your favorite model will have a new name, and all the reviews on shopping or manufacturer sites will be for a model that’s out-of-date. Worse, there’s often plenty of stock on hand for old models, and pricing goes up and down in a way that’s hard to predict.</p>
<p>We figured out the manufacturer numbering schemes where we could, or faced the hold-music and called a sales rep to find out what was going on with tricky model names.</p>
<p>Discussion board posts comparing different models and options are pretty scarce, but review sites like <a href="http://www.dehumidifierbuyersguide.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dehumidifierbuyersguide.com</a> and <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-dehumidifier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wirecutter</a> agreed about the best model, and Consumer Reports listed an older model from the same manufacturer.</p>
<p>In the end, we bought up-to-date models from the three top-ranked brands on the trustworthy review sites that have comparable specs. We also picked one lesser-known dehumidifier from homeLabs: this dehumidifier is well-ranked on Amazon and has a pretty amazing average rating of 4.7.</p>
<p>We only tested one model with a built-in pump (the Danby) since most manufacturers sell both versions. The pump version can sometimes be hard to track down; fortunately, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000SM342Q/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">an add-on pump</a> is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJwFgi3D-6g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very easy upgrade</a> to any of these machines and will work just as well.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs a dehumidifier?</h2>
<p>There are two obvious applications for dehumidification, but we want to make sure that we’re laying all the cards on the table here: don’t just buy a dehumidifier if you’ve actually got an air conditioning problem.</p>
<h3>First case: the swampy south</h3>
<p>Put simply, if you’ve got a choice between air conditioning and a dehumidifier for a sweltering summer day, choose the air conditioner. Each type of machine is doing the same work — passing your room’s air over a cooling system — but the AC will remove heat from your room, while a dehumidifier only sucks out the water and dumps the heat back in your face.</p>
<p>What if your air conditioner isn’t doing the job? We talked to heating, ventilation and air conditioning professionals, including a project manager at <a href="https://www.siemens.com/global/en/home/products/buildings.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Siemens</a> and the owner of an HVAC company, to find out why some people report better performance running a dehumidifier and an air conditioner at the same time.</p>
<p>“It’s a larger problem than most people realize,” says Richard Ciresi, owner of <a href="https://www.aireserv.com/louisville/?L=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aire Serv Heating &amp; Air Conditioning</a> in Louisville. “First, heating and air conditioning units are sized for the hottest and coldest days of the year.<b> Therefore, on a moderate day they often don’t run long enough to remove the excess moisture from the air. </b>Second, some homeowners and even some contractors still believe in the &#8216;bigger is better&#8217; concept, which further exacerbates the problem.”</p>
<p>If your air conditioner is plus-sized and running at full fan speed, the moisture won’t have a chance to condense on the chiller before the thermostat tells the AC to shut down. Since dry hot air is far more comfortable than humid warm air, you can technically make a room more comfortable in the summer heat by running a dehumidifier if you have this problem.</p>
<p>If there’s an air conditioner anywhere in your equation, though, a dehumidifier is one step forward, two steps back. If your central AC is inefficient or broken, you can buy an efficient window air conditioner for the same price as a dehumidifier, and you’ll use far less energy that way. If you’re renting and can’t stand the heat, talk to your landlord about AC fixes before you spend $200 on a dehumidifier.</p>
<p>Modern air conditioners should also have a “dry” mode that will run at a lower fan speed to maximize the amount of moisture they take out of the air.</p>
<p>A good dehumidifier is less expensive to purchase than most <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-portable-air-conditioner/">portable air conditioners</a>, so if that’s all that fits in your budget and you can’t install a $200 window air conditioner, it’s better than nothing.</p>
<h3>Second case: for your basement</h3>

<p>Anytime you’ve got a lot of moisture in cold air, a dehumidifier shines. Because all the heat that’s made while running is dumped back into the room, these machines turn cold, damp air into warm, dry air. They’re perfect for basements or anyplace else that doesn’t get heat or ventilation.</p>
<p>If you’re in a colder region, you might have a heated basement that stays very dry during the winter, but even a well-drained house can get a damp basement in the late spring after you shut the heat off. If you’ve got an older basement without heat, then you probably know all too well the problems that come from stale, moist air.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a dehumidifier to stop mold and mildew in your basement, the biggest question you need to answer is where you can pump the water to. If you’ve got a floor drain, just about any model will be ideal; if you need to run a hose to a sink, toilet or out a window, then you’ll need a “vertical pump” feature.</p>
<h3>What size should I get?</h3>
<p>Dehumidifiers are rated based on how much water they can theoretically collect from the air in a 24-hour period. Generally, you’ll find 30, 50 and 70-pint models.</p>
<p>After looking at the available models and prices, we decided to test only 70-pint models. <a href="https://www.sylvane.com/choosing-the-right-size-dehumidifier.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There are guides available</a> that try to help you calculate how much capacity you need, but they tend to leave you guessing about how to define your conditions and will often return a recommended capacity that’s not available anyway.</p>
<p>Models capable of removing only 50 pints per day might be slightly smaller, but they don’t typically cost much less and the fans are sometimes actually louder to keep up. Unlike an oversized air conditioner, there’s really no drawback to having a bigger dehumidifier, it just gets you to a target humidity level more quickly.</p>
<p>If saving $50 on an appliance this big is going to be a dealbreaker, then the equivalent 50-pint or 30-pint models should run almost as well as the models we tested.</p>

<p>We put these machines through as much torture as we could in  late-spring southern California. The climate here is fairly dry despite our proximity to the Pacific, but we had a few days of fortuitous rain where we could gauge the usefulness of a dehumidifier in a real-life home environment.</p>
<p>For the hard numbers, though, we had to create some artificial environments in our test location. (We had a house full of <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-humidifier/">humidifiers</a> on hand to get the job done.)</p>
<p>All the models we bought and tested included a defrost feature, and we’re a bit sorry (okay, not really) to say that even running late at night in mid-March, southern California isn’t cold or damp enough to freeze up any of these dehumidifiers.</p>
<h3>Controlled performance test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12037" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance.png" alt="controlled performance results" width="2000" height="1218" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance.png 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance-610x371.png 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance-768x468.png 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance-885x539.png 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance-1500x914.png 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance-295x180.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance-1000x609.png 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance-360x219.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance-375x228.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance-414x252.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance-320x195.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dehumidifier-performance-885x539@2x.png 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>In a 35-square-foot bathroom, we used a high-output humidifier to pump the relative humidity up to 60 percent at 78 degrees. (Not as extreme as a summer day in the Everglades, but enough to gauge the relative performance of each machine without being extravagantly wasteful.)</p>
<p>We set each dehumidifier to bring the relative humidity down to 45 percent, and used an Elitech &#8211; GSP-6 humidity and temperature logger to track how quickly each machine could change humidity in the room.</p>
<p>We also plugged each machine into a Kill-a-Watt electricity meter to measure the number of kilowatt hours consumed over a twenty-minute runtime. Factored with the change-per-minute in room humidity, we can see that the last-place performer needs about 50 percent more power to dry out a room than our top pick.</p>
<h3>Noise test</h3>

<p>We set up in our living room late at night and measured the sound pressure level produced by each machine. Our test equipment included a Dayton Audio iMM-6 microphone (spot-checked by our resident audio nerd) patched through Room EQ Wizard.</p>
<p>We mounted the microphone on a stand (about one meter from each dehumidifier) and logged A-weighted decibels over all the different fan settings.</p>
<p>The Frigidaire’s noise results are deceptive, because while the fan is definitely louder than the others at full speed, it almost masked the compressor noise.</p>
<p>Danby’s case was the opposite. The nominal level on the meter was fairly low, but the compressor would buzz and rumble its way from 53.4 up to 55 dBA at times, and the change in noise is more noticeable than those numbers might lead you to believe. Overall, it was the least-pleasant dehumidifier to have running in the house, though not by a huge margin.</p>
<h1>Humidistat accuracy</h1>

<p>For our next set of tests, we set up the machines in our living room and ran them against a big humidifier. We weren’t tracking overall performance in this test so much as how high each model allows the humidity to go before it turns on.</p>
<p>Humidistat settings are in 5 percent increments on each machine, so there’s not much to say about precision. The machines that allowed a wider swing on each side wound up with a closer average accuracy, but if you’re buying a dehumidifier for your priceless antique guitars then that’s not much comfort.</p>
<p>Calibrating how you set the machines against a more-reliable <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AEQ9X9I/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">hygrometer</a> is going to be your best bet if you want stability. We’d say the homeLabs is your best bet for stability, though calibration may vary depending on what day of the week yours rolls off the line.</p>

<p>If you want to run a dehumidifier in close quarters, like an RV or a bedroom, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UWP07LK/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Frigidaire</a> 70 pint with &#8220;Effortless Humidity Control&#8221; is the model least likely to remind you of commercial cooling equipment. This is a well-designed package: a little bit smaller, a lot easier to pick up with its pop-up handle. It’s the best-looking dehumidifier, in our opinion, and all the details come together to make it our favorite.</p>
<p>Efficiency and speedy performance are best-in-class, removing more humidity while drawing less power than the competitors. The Keystone only uses 14 percent more power to do the same job, but it also sounds worse and creates a wider swing in room humidity.</p>
<p>The Frigidaire’s noise isn’t exactly the quietest (the fan moves a lot of air), but the buzzing sound from the compressor is the least pronounced out of all the models we tested.</p>

It's pricier, but the lower noise is great and it's easier to move around. The base model works well if you don’t mind emptying it or have a floor drain, but it’s available with a pump too.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UWP07LK/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Frigidaire is the only manufacturer to include a middle-speed option between low and turbo, which might be the best compromise between noise and performance. It’s another touch that just makes the machine more friendly to use than the others.</p>
<p>If you’re manually emptying your dehumidifier tank (hopefully saving the water, it’s not drinkable but it is distilled) then you’ll find another reason this design shines. While some water buckets are shaped in ways that channel water out of three or four different places while you empty it, Frigidaire uses a splash guard which makes it easier to pour carefully.</p>
<p>While this model has a gravity-fed hose outlet that will work great with a floor drain, the version of this model <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y1M6XPT/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">that has a built-in pump</a> would be our pick for catching the water in a toilet tank. An external pump like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000SM342Q/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Little Giant</a> should work just fine with the base model, too.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Frigidaire’s FFAD7033R1 includes the most powerful “turbo” fan, making this the quickest at removing moisture.</li>
<li>Even with great performance, this is still the most efficient model.</li>
<li>This isn’t the very quietest we tested, but it sounds more like a fan, not a rickety old freezer.</li>
<li>Only basic humidistat modes, but there’s still auto-defrost if you need it.</li>
<li>A compact build and well-designed carrying handle won the day.</li>

<p>This is a fairly unknown brand with a strangely-styled name that you won’t find in brick-and-mortar retailers. We picked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073VBWKJZ/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">homeLabs &#8211; 70-pint dehumidifier</a> to test because it has an astounding 4.7/5 review score, even after 1200 reviews. This listing still has a <a href="https://www.fakespot.com/product/home-70-pint-dehumidifier-energy-star-electric-dehumidifier-machine-for-basement-or-large-room-with-hose-drain-to-remove-mildew-mold-or-odor-safe-large-size-portable-wheels-auto-humidity-control" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fakespot rating of &#8220;A</a>&#8220;, so it seems like people are genuinely happy with this model &#8212; given the class-beating price, we had to check it out.</p>
<p>Let’s not mince words: there’s very little difference between most of the dehumidifiers you can choose from. Internal components probably only come from a few factories, and the similarities between the finished machines reflect that. If you take off the control panels and plastic covers, only the Frigidaire would stand out as a nominally-unique design (and not really much different at that).</p>

<p>That said, homeLabs doesn’t include sophisticated automatic modes like some of the competition, but it’s good at all the important tasks. The humidistat works as it should, cycling on and off as needed to keep room humidity stable.</p>
<p>The swings in room humidity during our tests were actually smallest with this model, only inching up to 1 percent below target humidity before it turned on again and ran down to 10 percent below the target.</p>
<p>The biggest concern we had with the homeLabs is that it comes in only third place for performance and last place for efficiency. It’d take years running every day for most people to see any savings from the efficiency difference of a different model, though, and the performance is still better than the not-much-cheaper 50-pint models you might also be comparing this to.</p>
<p>When we purchased our lineup the price difference between this the homeLabs and our top pick came to $30, but if you compare the average price in the past year homeLabs was $52 less than Frigidaire, mostly because this model sometimes appears in flash sales for a rock-bottom $109.</p>
<p>The Frigidaire is unquestionably nicer to have in the room with you, but if you’re leaving your dehumidifier in an unoccupied basement or crawl space you might not care about the noise difference or slightly-better performance and efficiency at all. A $30 savings will also cover most of the cost of an external pump, if you don’t have a floor drain and want this to run unattended.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Even when it’s not on sale the homeLabs &#8211; HME020031N is the cheapest 70-pint dehumidifier we found.</li>
<li>Solid performance, but not a class leader. Our top pick will be 33 percent more efficient on average.</li>
<li>Steady and stable, with less-dramatic swings in noise and humidity than the others.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CDFESPC/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Keystone</a> ranked second-place for performance and efficiency, so this is a OK choice for about $17 less than our top pick. On the whole, though, there’s not much reason to choose the Keystone over our budget pick.</p>
<p>Keystone covers all the basic dehumidifier functions, and adds a “comfort” mode that turns up the fan when the days are hotter. These sorts of auto-speed features might make a difference if you’re running this in a living space, but the basic humidistat is the only automatic function most people will need.</p>
<p>If you are planning to run a dehumidifier in a space where you’re working or sleeping, you should know that this isn’t as quiet as our top pick. When you crank up both fans, the Frigidaire puts out a few more dB in “whoosh,” but the Keystone’s compressor-noise is definitely a louder buzzing.</p>
<p>This is the only model that has any significant difference between the loudest compressor sounds and the noise it makes when it settles down, but that doesn’t help its rank.</p>
<p>Keystone’s humidistat also allows for the widest swings in humidity, sometimes 7 percent above the target. Coupled with the fairly efficient operation, this might mean it cycles on and off less frequently and saves a little bit more power than other designs, but we don’t consider a wide swing a benefit.</p>
<h3>Danby &#8211; Premiere DDR070BDPWDB</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XQ4PKPN/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Danby &#8211; Premiere</a> dehumidifier comes from a lesser-known Canadian company that specializes in refrigeration and specialty appliances. Note the spelling of “Premiere,” and the no-words-allowed control buttons that are equally confusing in all official Canadian languages.</p>
<p>The similarities between Danby and Keystone’s machines are uncanny: the filter screen from the back of the Keystone will fit in the Danby, and Danby’s bucket slides fairly easily into the Keystone.</p>
<p>The differences in test performance are real, though slight. Danby has made their Premiere model quieter on the low-speed setting than most brands, though the buzz of the compressor is still sharper than Frigidaire’s. When running, this dehumidifier sounds like a slightly-muffled version of the old freezer that sits in your Grandma’s garage.</p>
<p>The biggest difference is a notable lag in performance that was consistent across three tests. Compared to our top pick, this model would need 53 percent more power to remove the same amount of humidity.</p>
<p>There’s always some variability in appliance performance, and we’d expect that the average machine from Danby might be slightly better than the one we got, but that’s not enough to lift it from the bottom of the pile.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XQ425L2/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The pump-included version of this model sometimes goes for $199</a>, so if you need a basement dehumidifier that can dump automatically into a sink this might be your best buy, but most will be better off buying the Frigidaire or our budget pick with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000SM342Q/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">an external pump</a>.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you need a dehumidifier to get rid of your moisture problem and make your home more comfortable, the combination of best efficiency, best performance and least-annoying-sound from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UWP07LK/?tag=ybddehu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Frigidaire</a> is hard to beat. Frigidaire isn’t the price leader in this category, but they’re not far off.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter three weeks using the top six models, 15 hours of lab testing and in-depth consultation with a team of air quality experts, we chose the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8DAYBA/?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Winix &#8211; 5300-2</a> as the best air purifier to keep our lungs clean. Winix runs quietly, plus it features an air quality sensor — the kind of feature that usually only shows up on much more expensive air purifiers. Filters for the Winix are easy to find and affordable. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BTKAPUU?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coway &#8211; 1512</a> is another strong performer, but its filters are available from fewer sources.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We scoured the web for opinions and feedback about the features and qualities that make a good air purifier. From the in-depth discussion on the usual subreddits to the advisory information published by agencies like the California air resources board, there is a lot of good information on the web that discusses the principles of air purification.</p>
<p>Sadly there’s also a lot of hype. Devices like the notorious Ionic Breeze have been making bold claims without hard evidence for a very long time, and it seems like there are always new products appearing with similar claims. Ionizer-type devices can help take particles out of the air if they&#8217;re well-designed, but mostly they dump ozone into your air, and that causes more problems than it solves. It’s bad enough that the CARB has <a href="https://www.arb.ca.gov/research/indoor/ozone.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an entire website of advisories</a> about this kind of device and a registry to help you avoid buying one.</p>
<p>We found that nearly all of the non-ionizer products on the market are high efficiency particulate-arresting-class air filters. HEPA is a classification for filter performance that’s well-established and understood, and the filters used in all of these devices are very similar in construction. (Though not necessarily in size, which determines how much air they can filter at once.)</p>
<p>There is a chance that a cheap air purifier will use “HEPA-like” filters that don’t actually meet that standard, but the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (&#8220;AHAM&#8221;)with their Verifide program are trying hard to make sure that you don’t get stuck with a fake. They test with three categories of pollution: large particles, pollen-size particles and smoke-sized particles.</p>
<p>Since the legit filters are all so similar, the differences between air purifier models, generally speaking, can be reduced to three questions: how much of your room’s air can it push through the filter, how loud is it and how much will it cost you to run?</p>
<p>The first question is also answered by the AHAM&#8217;s <a href="https://ahamverifide.org/ahams-air-filtration-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Verifide program</a>. Most air purifier manufacturers participate in the program, where an independent lab gives each device a “clean air delivery rate” certification. Generally this certificate also advertises a room size that will be effectively cleaned at that rate, based on the tested performance for cleaning smoke particles. You can also <a href="https://www.ahamdir.com/462-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search all certificate listings by recommended room size or other performance parameters</a>.</p>
<p>We picked products in two size categories: CADR 200, which should be effective in rooms up to 320 square feet, and CADR 100, which should be effective for a room smaller than 150 square feet.</p>
<p>We looked closely at retail sites and other reputable reviews from major publications to see what people love and hate about their purifiers, then we looked for devices in our size categories that should be easy to maintain with economical filter refills.</p>

<h2>Types of air contamination</h2>
<p>We spoke to experts who work with the California Air Resources Board to get an idea of what an air purifier can help with. The good news is that air purifiers can definitely help anybody who’s worried about air quality, but they aren’t a cure-all.</p>
<p>There are generally three classes of air pollution, with different effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small particles are the most prevalent form of air pollution. This includes everything from pollen to the soot in smoke, and fortunately this is the easiest class of pollution to clean. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16055881" target="_blank" rel="noopener">At 10 microns, particles are small enough to be easily inhaled</a>, and air quality indexes usually track particles automobile emissions at the 2.5 micron particle size, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8179653/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where it seems to have the most effect on our bodies</a>.</li>
<li>Ultra-fine particles are the very smallest particles, smaller than 0.3 microns. The sources of ultra-fine particles are everywhere, but the effects they have on our health are less well-understood.</li>
<li>Volatile Organic Compounds are basically gas vapors, most of which you can smell. These come from many sources: plastic, food, your dog and the paint on your walls. There are activated carbon filters that can remove VOCs, but if they’re big enough to be effective they will be expensive and need to be replaced frequently. Generally speaking, if you’ve got a source of VOCs that’s a problem, you should get it out of your house or vent the air rather than trying to filter it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some sources of air pollution are more difficult to manage than other. If you live in an area where smog and dust from a nearby freeway is an issue, then closing doors and windows and using an air purifier can make a big difference. If you’re dealing with smells from a nearby sewage treatment plant… there’s not as much you can do except close your windows and hope for the wind to blow the smell somewhere else.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-they-do">What can an air purifier actually do?</h2>
<p>An air purifier is, for the most part, a high-efficiency filter and a fan. Some models add features like static generators to clump particles, and a few include sensor circuits to turn the fan speed up only when it’s needed, but the basic task of cleaning your air is accomplished by moving as much of you room’s air as possible through a filter.</p>
<p>We asked our experts what a HEPA filter will or won’t remove. Does an air purifier capture viruses, for example?</p>
<p>Jeffery Williams, from the <a href="https://www.arb.ca.gov/research/indoor/indoor.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indoor Exposure Assessment Section at the California Air Resources Board</a>, notes that “There’s really no clean-cut answer to that question. The tests for these devices are using a very contrived scenario when they’re quantifying efficiencies. Specific dust sizes are generated and then the amount of dust before and after the filter is measured and you get an efficiency. In the natural world, you’ve got a very broad range of particles; some bacteria and viruses are large enough to get captured, some aren’t. A mechanical filter, like a HEPA filter, will do a good job with particles but not necessarily pull out the odors and VOCs.<b>”</b></p>
<p>While an air purifier can be very effective at removing dust, spores and other bothersome particles that are floating through your room, it can’t do anything about the particles trapped in your upholstery (let alone your pet’s hair).</p>
<p>If you have a home or apartment with airtight windows and doors, an air purifier can pretty easily clean out the dust and air pollution that wafts in when you open your doors, but if you’re moving around and kicking up dust inside the room, things get tricky. The more dust you kick up, the more air you’ll need to move through the filter to keep the air clean.</p>
<p>If you’ve got leaky windows and door, things get even more tricky, with some homes in warmer parts of the world changing the inside air for outside air one or two times per hour.</p>
<p>Most CADR room-size calculations aim for three air changes per hour, so they should be able to keep up with indoor sources of pollution like cooking and infiltration of dirty outside air, but it’s difficult to clean the air in just one “zone” of a house unless you can actually seal it off.</p>
<p>So what’s the hard evidence about health benefits? Jeffery Williams with the Air Resources Board says that there is some evidence that children with asthma in families who use an air purifier have improved sleep quality and fewer clinic visits<b>,</b> but “we don’t see a big difference in terms of symptoms between those that use air cleaners and those that don’t. You can’t say ‘use an air cleaner and your allergies will go away,’ it’s not like that.”</p>
<h2>What to try before you buy an air purifier</h2>
<p><b>Cleaning carpets and furniture: </b>Dust mites, skin cells and other particles accumulate quickly in carpet and upholstery, so vacuuming and cleaning regularly can take care of a lot of the dust that’s in your living space. A vacuum with a HEPA filter or a central <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">vacuum</a> that keeps the dust outside can make an even bigger difference. If you find that your vacuum is cumbersome for regular use, <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum/" rel="noopener">hand-held vacuums</a> can make a big difference in keeping the sofa dust under control.</p>
<p><b>Use your range hood: </b>If you do have an exhaust fan in the range hood above your cooktop, you can avoid filling your home with smoke and exhaust gasses from a natural gas range by turning on the fan when you’re cooking. (If the range hood recirculates air through a basic filter instead of venting it outside, you’ll probably already know that it doesn’t help air quality much.)</p>
<p><b>Pets and allergy solutions: </b>If you’re allergic to your best friend, what can you do? The <a href="http://www.aafa.org/page/pet-dog-cat-allergies.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asthma and Allergy Foundation</a> suggests you can get a little bit of relief by making sure not to give your pet access to your bedroom, but you’re still going to have to keep the rest of your house very clean. An air purifier will help with the dander and other pet-dust that’s floating through the air, but there are still particles in your carpet, upholstery and hiding in your pet’s hair.</p>
<p><b>Don’t smoke inside:</b> An air cleaner will be better than nothing if you’re dealing with second-hand smoke, but there’s really no way to remove the odor of tobacco smoke or all the danger of exposure if it’s in your house.</p>
<p>Barbara Weller, a manager in the Health &amp; Exposure Assessment Branch of the California Air Resources Board, tells us “Second hand smoke is very complex, and there are both larger and smaller particles. An air purifier would remove some but not all of those particles. You can’t take a room where people have been smoking and just run the filter and clean out the room, those second-hand smoke particles adhere to <i>everything</i>. [An air purifier] won’t eliminate the danger of second-hand smoke.”</p>
<p><b>Put out the candles, too:</b> Sadly, the romantic glow of candlelight <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/08/21/candles.air.pollution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also spreads soot and other particles into the air</a>. Soy or Beeswax are better than paraffin, and an air purifier will help manage the smoke that’s in the air, but it’ll be much cleaner if you don’t light them at all.</p>
<p><b>Seal windows and doors:</b> If you’re more concerned about the air quality outside than inside, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjmTlWE-6h8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weather-proofing your doors and windows</a> can keep the infiltration of polluted air to a minimum. Even if you do decide to go with an air purifier to deal with the pollution that comes into your house when you open the door, a well-sealed house will cut down on AC or heating costs.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-pick">How to pick the right air purifier</h2>
<p><b>CADR and room size:</b> Picking the right air purifier for the job is the most important choice. The “Clean Air Delivery Rate” is a lab-tested measurement of the number of cubic feet of air that the purifier can filter per minute: multiply that by 1.5 to get the number of square feet it can easily handle with an 8’ ceiling.</p>
<p>CADR is often listed for dust, allergens and smoke, but the smoke rating is the one to watch when picking a general-purpose air purifier. They tend to be very similar numbers.</p>
<p><b>Types of air cleaning:</b> There are a few different technologies on offer that can help make your air more breathable, but the technology we focused on for this review is HEPA filtration. Filters are effective and fairly economical; other technologies might add some benefits, but they’re either very expensive or they aren’t very effective with large volumes of air.</p>
<p><b>Timers and sensors:</b> If you’re looking for a filter to leave on 24/7, then you’ll want the lowest noise and most energy-efficient model you can get. If you can keep your room sealed from indoor or outdoor pollution except at certain times during the day, though, a timer or an air quality sensor means you won’t be running your air purifier more than necessary.</p>
<p><b>Fan noise:</b> A quiet machine may make a big difference for quality of life, you don’t want to trade air pollution for noise pollution.</p>

<p>We ran each of these air purifiers in a two-bedroom townhouse located near the 55 Freeway in Orange County, California. Air quality isn’t as bad as some parts of the state, but the outside air isn’t great. Our tester also just moved in, and the windows are sadly lacking in weather sealing.</p>
<p>We logged air quality with a Dylos particle counter, which uses lasers to track how many tiny particles are floating through the air: results definitely show an improvement when running an air purifier, even when cooking or with a toddler running around in the same room.</p>
<p>In a 238-square-foot living room, the CADR-100 machines struggled to keep up with heavy activity, though performance wasn’t all that bad during nap time. This casual, real-world testing definitely reinforced to us the importance of picking an appropriately-sized air purifier if you want to keep up with dust and leaky windows.</p>
<p>This testing also showed us the value of having some way of knowing when you need to turn up the fan on your air purifier. If you’re buying for a busy household you might just keep it running on full blast, but it quickly became obvious that that wasn’t necessary if our test-toddler was asleep and nobody was cooking. The Winix and Coway air purifiers, with their built-in air quality sensors, definitely make a lot of sense for someone who doesn’t have a way to test their own air.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>We set up two air-tight testing chambers to run filtration rate tests. We have no reason to be skeptical about the testing done by AHAM and Intertek, but the published clean air delivery rate tests only show performance at the fastest fan speed. We ran controlled tests at both high and low speed settings to see how much performance you’re giving up in order to turn down the noise.</p>

<p>For testing, we introduce controlled pollutants into our sealed test chamber: 10g of titanium dioxide, a very fine white powder that mostly has particles in the 0.3 to 1.0 micron range. (This is the same compound that makes paint white.) We also burned 1.5 grams of Dunhill pipe tobacco (about half a bowl in a small pipe) to generate some ultra-fine smoke particles and see if these devices could be at all effective in cleaning up second-hand smoke.</p>
<p>The Dylos counts both small (.5 micron) and large (10 micron) particles, but we’re publishing the small-particle rates since performance for each was very similar.</p>
<p>We ran two tests for each purifier, at high and low fan speeds, for an hour each. We normalized the start times used values from the logs to give a similar baseline.<br />

<p>Along with the performance tests, we also checked noise output of each model. We measured the sound pressure level at a 3 foot and 10 foot distance with the lowest and highest fan settings. Testing was done by our resident sound engineer using the REW suite and a calibrated mic, with levels verified against a calibrated SPL meter.</p>
<p>As expected, the noise level was quite high at full blast, but we were pleasantly surprised at how quiet most of these air purifiers are on the lowest fan speed. The Coway really deserves a special mention here: on low settings, both Coway and Winix are so quiet they’re difficult to measure, but the Coway won by a decibel.</p>
<p>At full blast it was Honeywell who had the edge, but this is where it’s important to realize that low noise is typically directly related to a low performance. Honeywell performs better than the others on low, where it’s louder than the competition; on high, it’s quieter and lags behind on air cleaning.</p>
<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>We checked on filter replacement costs to see who is charging the most reasonable price to keep your air purifier running for the long term.</p>
<p>Because filter life will vary depending on how much each filter picks up, we also measured the filter area that the cost of a refill gets you. This is still going to be, largely, a matter of personal preference: like the cabin air filter in your car, most people can use these filters for much longer than the manufacturer rates them for without seeing a change in performance.</p>
<p>The activated carbon component of these filters is, in every machine except the Levoit, a replaceable pre-filter. The pre-filter does double-duty catching hair or big particles (something that could also be done with nylon mesh) and doing a very little bit of work capturing volatile organic compounds. You can read other reviews if you want to see details on how poor these skinny filters are at capturing smells or fumes.</p>
<p>If you have the option of buying a replacement HEPA filter and not replacing the carbon filter, you could cut down your filter cost significantly. On the other hand, if you’re willing to trade a little bit of airflow for slightly-better-but-still-negligible performance with VOCs, one Amazon purchaser has claimed success stacking the carbon prefilters to get more active surface area.</p>

<p>In any case, the life of a HEPA-type mechanical filter is as long as you’re willing to put up with the performance it offers. When it catches a lot of particles it will start to literally clog up; new particles are still captured, but it will take more time and electricity for your purifier to filter the air in your room. Unless you’re using it in a dog kennel or a woodworking shop, though, you can probably run the same filter for much longer than one year.</p>
<p>We also verified the kilowatt-hours of electricity each machine uses on highest and lowest speed to see what the long-term cost of ownership will be. We calculated the cost based on 20 hours/day of low-speed and 4 hours/day of high-speed use. That’s close to a worst-case cost scenario, since hopefully you’ll be able to turn each machine completely off after running it for a few hours a couple of times per day. We used the U.S. national average of 12 cents per kilowatt-hour, your local rates will of course vary.</p>

<p>Winix has a competition-blasting air purifier in their <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8DAYBA/?tag=ybdpur-20">5300-2</a>. Leveraging a big HEPA filter with an efficient and quiet fan, this machine is cheap to run and quiet enough that you might not even know it’s there. Even if you have a smaller room, this is our pick.</p>
<p>Simply put, this is a good price for a HEPA-type air purifier that’s certified to clean a room of up to 360 square feet. That’s 2,880 cubic feet of air, and the Winix will circulate that much through the filter more than four times in an hour at top speed. That in and of itself is not remarkable: HEPA filters are all basically the same, and this size class is a popular one since it will clean most living rooms easily and a bedroom even more quickly.</p>
<p>The big price-hike for air purifiers of this size tends to occur when a manufacturer includes an air quality sensor and Wi-Fi. Honeywell and Whirlpool are offering their no-sensor big-room filters for about $150, while Dyson, Blueair and Philips add sensors and a Wi-Fi connection for about $200 more. For the same price as the “dumb” purifiers Winix offers an air quality sensor to automatically turn up the fan, but it will never ask you to reset your router.</p>

<p>Coway is the other value-leader, but their 1512HH still typically costs $100 more than the Winix with the same features. Performance is basically the same; Winix uses a few watts more electricity when it’s sitting on the lowest speed, but it makes up the difference quickly by using 15 fewer watts at full blast without sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>The filters cost nearly the same on Amazon, and there are far more places we found selling Winix-compatible refills. The Coway filter does offer slightly more surface area when you measure the depth of the pleats, but if you’re replacing filters at the recommended rate of once per year you’d probably never get even close to clogging either brand.</p>

<p>The biggest difference we saw between Winix and Coway in day-to-day testing is that Coway has tweaked their auto-speed system to run at high speed for slightly longer at bigger intervals. While the Winix purifier sped up for a few minutes, slowed down, then sped up again five minutes later if there was still dust moving around the room, Coway’s speed controller will turn up the fan for five minutes at a time with longer breaks.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to control the individual particles that flow past the tiny sensors on these machines so we couldn&#8217;t really test their accuracy, but in our day-to-day use both purifiers turned on when we expected and didn’t seem wasteful.</p>
<p>Winix and Coway are both using an electrostatic ion generator of some kind to boost efficiency. (Winix calls it “PlasmaWave.”) Based on the performance differences with the filter-only Honeywell machine it does seem like the effect could be significant, and if Winix’s ion generator is slightly more efficient it would explain the slight edge they have shown in our test and the tests run by The Wirecutter.</p>
<p>PlasmaWave only drew 10 watts more when we turned it on, and the CARB approval certification means it isn’t creating ozone at nuisance or harmful levels the way some machines do with this type of system.</p>
<p>If you want a few perks, Winix also makes the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8DAYII/?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">5500-2</a>, which has a remote and will auto-dim the control panel when you turn off your lights. The price for the two models is often identical, so if you have a very long walk to the other side of your bedroom and you think you’ll want to turn the machine on or off when going to bed maybe that will be worth seeking out. The 5500-2 has a listed filter refill that’s slightly different, but based on the certified performance rating we can’t imagine how the real-world performance would be any different.</p>
<p>The 5300-2 has a “night” feature that turns off the control panel lights, but it only works in the auto-speed mode. You’ll have to ignore or cover up the lights if you want to leave the fan running on a constant speed to make background noise while you fall asleep.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Winix &#8211; 5300-2 took top spot for air-cleaning performance, though only by a hair.</li>
<li>The noise output is second quietest, but that was also a close race. It also plays a friendly song when you turn it on or off.</li>
<li>Winix’s power efficiency is the best we’ve seen.</li>
<li>Replacement filters for the 5300-2 are competitively priced and easy to find.</li>
<li>An auto-speed system turns up the fan only when it’s needed, which means it saves power and doesn’t make unnecessary noise.</li>
<li>If you have a 24”-by-15” spot for it, there’s not much reason to buy a smaller machine. If you need more capacity, buy two.</li>
</ul>

<p>Coway has garnered a lot of positive press and good will with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BTKAPUU?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AP-1512HH</a>. This is, by all accounts, a great air purifier. At the end of the day, though, any advantages it has over the Winix 5300 are slim at best, and the purchase cost is higher.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for the very quietest machine you can possibly find that still has room-clearing performance when you need it, Coway manages to have an ever-so-slightly slower fan at its lowest speed. It’s just a hair quieter, draws 2 watts less electricity, and will take a few minutes more to clear out particles. On highest speed, Coway and Winix are indistinguishable for noise levels, though Winix is cleaning very slightly faster and with 15 fewer watts used.</p>

<p>We should note that the air delivery rating from AHAM’s certified test is a whole cubic-foot-per-minute higher for Coway than it is for Winix, so there’s undoubtedly enough margin of error in our testing that you can call it a wash. The time to clear 50% of the particles in a sealed room is close enough between the two that you’d need to count by the second, and our testing tool only logs by the minute.</p>
<p>The Wirecutter has recommended Coway’s air purifier for years, and it seems they mostly picked Coway over Winix because those filters are slightly more expensive than Coway’s if you’re buying from the manufacturer directly. Shopping around, the price difference all but disappears. If you’re worried about getting genuine refills, Home Depot also has the <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Winix-True-HEPA-4-Filter-Activated-Carbon-Replacement-Filter-A-115115/202034412" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Winix filters for less</a>, and Coway filters are hard to find outside of one probably-authentic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C7WMQTW/?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon listing</a>.</p>
<p>If you find Coway’s model on sale and you like the shorter-but-deeper shape, it’s a great air purifier, but it’s so similar to the Winix in performance and features that looks are probably the only reason you’d prefer it.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Coway &#8211; AP-1512HH runs neck-and-neck with the Winix in every category but cost.</li>
<li>This fan is so quiet on low speed we were a bit shocked to see how well it’s still filtering.</li>
<li>Power efficiency is slightly worse on the highest speed, but it would only add a few dollars to your power bill over a year compared to the Winix.</li>
<li>Compared to Winix, Coway replacement filters are not as readily available in the U.S.</li>
</ul>

<p>Honeywell has one of the biggest and best-known lineups in this product category, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BWYO3EM/?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HPA200</a> is the machine in that line that matches the 310-square-foot capacity bracket of the other bestsellers and top picks we tested.</p>
<p>This is a capable air purifier. The filter quality is as good as any other we’ve seen, though Honeywell uses two small filters to allow compatibility of refills across the entire HPA line. Literally, each step up from HPA100 to HPA200 to HPA300 adds 155 square feet of capacity by adding another 6”-by-10” filter and 100 CFM worth of fan output. This is a neat inventory management trick, but it almost certainly hurts the efficiency of the air purifiers themselves. The economy-of-scale effect isn’t reflected in the price of filter refills, either.</p>
<p>On high speed, the HPA200 is a little bit quieter than our top pick, but it’s also moving a bit less air. It uses more power to do so, probably because of the shape of the baffle used to create a good seal around two rectangular filters.</p>
<p>On low speed, Honeywell has made the opposite compromise: the fan runs faster, makes more noise, and still uses more power than our top pick. That means it’s doing more work when it’s on the lowest setting, but the Winix will save significant watts using the auto-speed air quality sensor to turn up the fan and use power when it’s really needed.</p>
<p>If the Honeywell were a significantly cheaper machine to buy than the Winix, it might be worth picking it up to use only occasionally for solid and reliable performance. Tracking the price, though, Honeywell is almost never cheaper than the Winix. Our top pick goes on sale a few times a year for even less than its already-great average price.</p>
<h3>GermGuardian &#8211; AC4825</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-11725 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/germguardian-ac4825.jpg" alt="the GermGuardian AC4825" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/germguardian-ac4825.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/germguardian-ac4825-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/germguardian-ac4825-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/germguardian-ac4825-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/germguardian-ac4825-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/germguardian-ac4825-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/germguardian-ac4825-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/germguardian-ac4825-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/germguardian-ac4825-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/germguardian-ac4825-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/germguardian-ac4825-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/germguardian-ac4825-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>If you really don’t have space for a 24” x 15” tower fan, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VGIGVY/?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GermGuardian &#8211; AC4825</a> is slimmer, though not much shorter. On high speed it’s the quietest machine with adequate performance for a small room.</p>
<p>The GermGuardian is a relatively good air purifier for $80 (it’s far more effective than Levoit’s under-powered model). Compared to our top pick, though, the $70 price difference disappears within two years if you use the GermGuardian all day every day and replace the filter after six to eight months as the manufacturer recommends. If you can fit the extra width in your room and budget an additional $70 up front, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8DAYBA/?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Winix</a> will be a far more efficient and easy-to-use machine.</p>
<p>Compared to the Winix, GermGuardian lacks the auto-speed feature, and the filters are more expensive despite being only one-third as big. On low speed it’s actually louder than the Winix and draws six times more electricity. The small filter and fan also gives more of a “whistle” than “whoosh” sound, and that might annoy some.</p>

<p>If your budget is tight and you just need something while contractors make plaster dust renovating the next-door apartment for a week, this will clean the air in a 100-square-foot bedroom relatively well. The long-term cost of filters and electricity, though, give us pause.</p>
<p>The fact that this machine isn’t certified and listed by independent tests from the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers is concerning, though Guardian Technologies claims to use the same testing methodology for the “100+” CADR rating they list in the manual. Its performance matches the AHAM-listed Honeywell in our testing, so we don’t have too many doubts about the claim.</p>
<p>Banking on a UV-light “germ killing” feature to attract buyers is also a turn-off, as much as we’d love to live in a world where a simple appliance can keep you from getting sick. We asked our experts at the Air Resources board about UV sterilizers, and here’s what Jeffery had to say:</p>
<p>“As far as efficacy, it depends on [how long the organism is sitting] under the light. The UV light damages the DNA, so if the light is pretty bright and the airflow is slow enough in that part of the device then it can reduce the number of viable bacteria or viruses; it gets rid of some, but not all. Some spores, for example, are very resistant to UV. In general, it can help.”</p>
<p>Barbara Weller was quick to add, though: “you really are better off cleaning surfaces, washing hands, getting rest and a good diet so you’re as healthy as possible. Healthy habits will be a lot more effective than [a UV lamp in an air cleaner] at reducing flu in your home.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BWYO2FW/?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Honeywell’s HPA100</a> is literally a sized-down version of the bigger 200 and 300 models; it even takes the same filters refills as the bigger models, but only uses one at a time. (The carbon pre-filter is smaller, but you can fold the big sheet to fit if you buy the wrong refill.)</p>
<p>If you can grab this when it goes on sale for $80 or so, this might be a worthwhile purchase for a small room where space is limited. At the $105 average price, though, it’s not a good value. It costs almost as much to run as its big brother, and quite a bit more than our top pick (since it uses four times more electricity just to idle.)</p>
<p>In use, this is only a tiny bit louder than the GermGuardian, and its performance was almost identical. It’s not necessarily as easy to fit in a room, though, and we prefer the simple “I, II, III” rotary switch on the GermGuardian to the cryptic “germ, allergy, general, turbo” scale Honeywell uses their touch panel.</p>
<h3>Levoit &#8211; LV-H132</h3>

<p>Levoit is a fairly new player in the home appliance field, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B071D58ZY5/?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LV-H132</a> has gained a lot of positive buzz since it launched last year. It’s a quiet and attractive device, with thoughtful features: there’s a blue night-light, but also a no-light mode for those of us who hate the tiny LEDs that plague our bedrooms. The filter also seems well-built and it should last as long as Honeywell’s for half the replacement cost.</p>
<p>The low noise output and power draw from this air purifier, though, seems to be an indication that it simply isn’t trying to move as much air as other devices we tested. Levoit lists “100 CFM” in the manual and some advertising copy, and if that were true it would probably match the performance of the Honeywell and GermGuardian, but given the performance we saw in testing and the low noise and power draw it’s moving far less air than that.</p>
<p>It’s not entirely surprising that a new, small company that’s flying under the appliance-manufacturing radar wouldn’t work as hard to get certification from AHAM’s Verifide program. The Guardian company certainly doesn’t seem in a hurry to get on the list, and their device is widely heralded as a great pick. Levoit’s performance, though, seems like a pretty clear case of over-rating a device and hoping nobody checks. We’re thankful we didn’t spend a lot of time testing their bigger, more expensive “CADR 135+” PUR131 model.</p>
<p>We reached out to Levoit for comment, and their engineers didn’t think we got a unit with defective electronics or anything else that would cause a sub-standard test result; they didn’t directly comment on the result, either.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>There are a lot of lessons we learned about what air purifiers can and can’t do, but we’re impressed by the abilities these machines have when doing their main job, cleaning most of the particles out of your air. If you live in a place with bad outdoor air quality, or if you’ve got a lot of things inside that are making your indoor air quality worse, then any of these machines will make a difference.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8DAYBA/?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Winix has a great air purifier in the 5300-2</a>, but it’s the auto-speed sensor that really makes it our top pick. Without lab equipment it might be hard to guess when you should have an air purifier turned all the way up and when it can sit at low speed; Winix takes care of that for you, and you can trust that it’ll clean your air as fast as anything else.</p>
<p>You can get faster performance for really big rooms if you buy a giant machine with four times more fan power and filter area, but most of us would probably be better off (and definitely save money) buying three or four of this model to take care of hotspots.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BTKAPUU?tag=ybdpur-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The runner-up from Coway</a> is in most respects an equivalent machine. We’re a little bit happy that it’s more expensive and that it isn’t as easy to find Coway filters, since that makes picking the Winix as our winner even easier.</p>
