				<description><![CDATA[We’ve selected some of the best men’s dress socks that will upgrade your wardrobe. Easton Marlowe appeals to both conservative and wild tastes, and the best dress socks for the value are Alpine Swiss.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>f you don a suit for work everyday, it’s likely you have a dresser drawer stuffed with black, navy and gray dress socks. These conservative hues were once the norm for office and formal dress, but men’s dress socks don’t have to be just in 50 shades of the same. Bold colors and patterns can express your personality while also being sartorially smart. We’ve selected some of the best men’s dress socks that will upgrade your wardrobe. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B9FD9H5/?tag=ybdsocks-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Easton Marlowe</a> appeals to both conservative and wild tastes, and the best dress socks for the value are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0194E63NU/?tag=ybdsocks-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alpine Swiss</a>.</p>
<h2>Features to Consider</h2>
<p>Men’s dress socks are typically made of blends of varying percentages of cotton, polyester, nylon, wool and spandex. A cotton-polyester or cotton-nylon blend is usually advertised as “moisture wicking,” which refers to the fiber’s ability to move perspiration to the surface so it can evaporate.</p>
<p>Cotton is comfortable and absorbent but keeps moisture trapped in the fibers. Polyester, nylon and other synthetic materials repel moisture and excel at moisture wicking. Many dress socks are made of cotton woven with some sort of synthetic to help with moisture wicking and an elastic to keep the sock from slipping down to your ankles.</p>
<p>Sizing can be tricky, especially if you want socks that are predominantly made of cotton (80% and higher), which shrink when washed. Most socks are available in men’s shoe sizes 8–12, so if you have a larger foot and want the socks to fit after washing them, look for dress socks that are also available in sizes 13–15.</p>
<p>Polyester and cotton blends don’t shrink much after repeated washings, so you can buy them in your regular shoe size. Socks that are predominantly cotton will often shrink after the first wash, so it’s best to buy them (if available) the next size up.</p>

We selected Johnny B - Mode as the best men's hair gel for versatility in styling and Gentlemen Republic - Refined as the best value for men's hair gel.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e tested some of the best men’s hair gel on thick, straight hair and thin, fine hair to find out which ones have the most flexibility and holding power but also don&#8217;t make your head look like it’s been shellacked. The best men’s hair gel for all hair types is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009G7Z3XM/?tag=ybdhrgel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Johnny B &#8211; Mode</a>, and the men’s hair gel that gets you more gel for your buck is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PTB4CM2/?tag=ybdhrgel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gentlemen Republic &#8211; Refined Molding Gel</a>.</p>
<p>A primary ingredient in all hair gel is water, and combined with thickeners and emulsifiers, it creates a substance that’s easy to apply and makes your hair look well-groomed. Many gels also have alcohol in the top three ingredients, and with daily use, they’ll dry out your hair. A few gels, like our top picks Johnny B &#8211; Mode and Gentlemen Republic &#8211; Refined, are alcohol free, and these can be used frequently without damaging your hair.</p>
<p>Hair gel might not give you the textured, natural look for your expensive haircut, so we’ve also reviewed other <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-mens-hair-product/">men’s hair products</a> you might want to try instead.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>here’s a dizzying array of men’s hair products on the market, but finding the one that works best for you can be a frustrating and expensive trial-and-error experience. We experimented with a wide range of men’s hair products and determined that <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/American-Crew-Defining-Medium-Hold-Paste-3-oz/14662890" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">American Crew &#8211; Defining Paste</a> is the best product overall for grooming all hair types. If you have thick hair, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007CXWC4/?tag=ybdhairp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">American Crew &#8211; Fiber</a> will give your hair body and control with a salon finish.</p>
<h2>Important Features to Consider</h2>
<p>Our tester has thick, straight hair that’s been cut to lengths varying from one-half inch at its shortest to eight inches at its longest. This cut allows him to style his hair for an upswept formal look or a finger-combed casual look, which both need different hair products to achieve. The tested products can be grouped into the following categories:</p>
<p><strong>Pomade:</strong> Traditionally an oil-based product, most pomades are now water-based and have a gel-like consistency. Pomade can be applied to wet or towel-dried hair and usually has a high shine and strong hold. Generally, pomade is used on hair styles that are combed. Think Mad Men.</p>
<p><strong>Fiber:</strong> There’s actually no fiber in hair-styling fiber. It’s a blend of beeswax, lanolin, oils and other ingredients in the form of a hard paste. Fiber needs to be warmed between your hands before applying and is most effective on dry, short or medium-length hair. Fiber has a matte (no shine) finish and adds texture to hair so it can be molded into shape.</p>
<p><strong>Paste:</strong> Hair paste is the most versatile of men’s hair products. True to its name, it has a thick, paste-like consistency that can be applied to all types of hair and lengths. Once the paste is worked through, hair can be styled in any manner repeatedly after one application. Hair paste has a firm hold with a matte finish and no shine.</p>
<p><strong>Cream:</strong> This is one of the easiest hair products to apply and is often combined with pomade and fiber. Hair cream is lightweight and doesn’t have a strong hold, so dry or barely damp hair can be styled loosely for a more casual look with a matte finish. Creams work on almost any hair length, but because they don’t have a strong hold, they’re not ideal for a spiked-up hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>Spray:</strong> We’re not referring to hairspray, but to products that are marketed equally to men and women: sea-salt sprays. The salt in these light sprays absorbs oils and adds texture and body, giving medium-length or long hair a tousled, surfer look.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for hair gel, we&#8217;ve reviewed the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-mens-hair-gel/">best hair gel</a> in a separate article.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter months of research and wearing 16 different trays and strips at work for three weeks, we&#8217;ve chosen the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System</a> as the best teeth whitening kit.

</ul>
<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>Teeth whitening products are, for the most part, re-packaged supplies made for dentists to use in-office or give to patients for home treatment under professional supervision.</p>
<p>The one whitening product that&#8217;s &#8220;accepted&#8221; for at-home use by the American Dental Association is Crest&#8217;s Whitestrips line, which is now in its second generation of products and branded &#8220;Crest 3D White.&#8221; This was an obvious place to start.</p>
<p>When we researched the most-purchased products, though, it&#8217;s pretty obvious that most people who want white smiles don&#8217;t mind buying at-home whitening products that aren&#8217;t formally approved.</p>
<p>Over-the-counter teeth whitening kits use low concentrations of peroxide and are not considered dangerous. The FDA does not regulate teeth whitening kits sold in the U.S. Of course, dentists are quick to point out the uncertainty that comes with this lack of regulation. Dentists have access to stronger whitening products and the training to use them safely.</p>
<p>Written reviews of whitening kits are typically vague about product recommendations, and we didn&#8217;t find any comparative reviews that assess kits against one another.</p>
<p>We did find lots of conversation about teeth whitening on the web. The conversation is mostly about how well whitening works, how quickly it works, and whether it&#8217;s safe to do at home. Subreddits like r/dentistry frequently discuss the pros and cons of at-home whitening.</p>
<p>We looked at the top-selling products available at local discount stores and on major online retailers, and after closely scrutinizing 35 different products and whitening systems, we bought 16 different products to test, including five kits, five types of whitening strips, three stand-alone tray kits and three whitening gel products not sold as kits.</p>
<p>Two of the highest-rated gels we bought, from Philips and Opalescence, are labelled for sale through a dentist but still designed for use at home.</p>
<p>After looking at the range available and talking to a dentist, we decided to test the most popular 35-percent strength in most kits to see if our tester had any sensitivity or other reactions. We also tried a few slightly stronger or slightly weaker solutions.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-whiten">How to whiten teeth at home</h2>
<p>Teeth whitening is very complex. Each person has different teeth and different stains, so it&#8217;s nearly impossible to say what success you&#8217;ll have with a particular whitening method. But the treatment itself is very simple, and the differences between products are minimal.</p>
<p>The ways that dentists will whiten your teeth are well-established. Dentists have been testing whitening treatments in their offices and with take-home kits for decades, and the methods haven&#8217;t changed much. The teeth whitening kits you can buy for yourself are, for the most part, the same thing you&#8217;d get from a dentist.</p>
<p>Whitening teeth involves bleaching built-up organic compounds like tannins from your teeth. This is more than just scrubbing a film off the surface: Whitening products actually remove stains from within the enamel.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>There are two compounds commonly used to achieve this bleaching: hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide. Unstable oxygen-rich molecules in these compounds quickly break down many (but not all) stains.</p>
<p><b>The two molecules are so similar because about 35 percent of carbamide peroxide </b><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/hydrogen-peroxide-urea" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>breaks down directly into hydrogen peroxide</b></a><b>, so the bleaching action is basically identical. </b>Carbamide is more stable in storage, which also makes it take longer to reach its maximum potential effect.</p>
<p>The big debate in teeth whitening is over the best way to evenly apply those peroxides to your teeth — and only to your teeth. Whitening strips stick a peroxide-laced gel onto the front of your teeth, while gel-filled trays can hold a stronger solution in place with a (low) risk of your swallowing it or burning your gums.</p>
<p>Toothpaste with peroxide can also help whiten teeth, though it&#8217;s in such a low concentration that you might never notice any gradual change.</p>
<h3>Charcoal teeth whitener</h3>
<p>Whatever you do, don&#8217;t try to scrub your stains off with an abrasive charcoal powder or use household cleaners in hopes of getting quick results. According to <a href="https://jada.ada.org/article/S0002-8177(17)30412-9/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies of popular products</a>, charcoal teeth whitener toothpaste is usually abrasive enough to do more harm than good. Gentle natural-alternative tooth polishes can be fine as a detergent-free way to keep your teeth clean, but don&#8217;t sacrifice your enamel to get a whiter smile.</p>

<p><b>Whitening strips:</b> The most basic and easiest type of whitening product, these strips of gel usually contain hydrogen peroxide and stick firmly to the surface of your teeth.</p>
<p><b>Trays:</b> If you want to keep a stronger solution of peroxide in better contact with all your front teeth, a tray keeps it on your teeth.</p>
<p>There are four types of trays available:</p>
<p><b>Universal-fit trays:</b> If you don&#8217;t want to go through the trouble of molding a tray to the shape of your teeth, this style will do the job and keep whitening solution or other dental products on your teeth, but they&#8217;re usually not comfortable to wear for more than a few minutes.</p>
<p><b>Heat-moldable trays: </b>These trays are made from a heat-moldable EVA plastic (related to what&#8217;s in a hot glue stick.) When you heat the tray in almost-boiling water, it becomes soft enough to take an impression of your teeth, and you can usually get a perfect fit. Once it’s cooled, you could trim the tray if you want, but the plastic is quite thick. These trays will warp if you rinse them in hot water or leave them in the sun, and then they&#8217;d need to be re-molded to fit.</p>
<p><b>Custom-made trays: </b>These trays are made by a dental service laboratory to fit exactly over plaster copies of your teeth, and excess tray material is trimmed back to the gumline. Your dentist&#8217;s office can make impressions of your teeth and handle the order, but we found many mail-order labs that will sell you a kit to make impressions at home.</p>
<p><b>Disposable Trays: </b>This is a new type of product from Opalescence. Their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IU5EDKK/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GO system</a> uses waxy, moldable trays that come pre-filled for full-coverage whitening without having to squirt any peroxide gel out of a tube.</p>

<p>Whitening strips are some of the most popular whitening products on the market, and for good reason: Starting with the introduction of Crest &#8211; Whitestrips in 2001, at-home whitening went from scary to dentist-approved.</p>
<p>The Crest line of whitening strips from Procter and Gamble is still the only at-home bleaching brand with the <a href="https://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/ada-seal-products/category-display?category=Bleaching+Products" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Dental Association&#8217;s Seal of Acceptance</a>. That means they&#8217;ve paid a lot of money to run patient trials to show that the product works as described and is safe.</p>
<p>One downside to whitening strips is that the peroxide-carrying gel isn&#8217;t able to fill in all the nooks and crannies of your smile: If you have overlapping or crooked teeth, the strips are likely to whiten the forward-facing parts and leave other parts untouched.</p>
<p>The other downside to whitening strips is that manufacturers use vague terms to describe the strength of what you&#8217;re buying. Percentages of active carbamide or hydrogen peroxide are always listed for gel-and-tray systems, but the concentration of active ingredients are rarely listed on whitening strips.</p>
<h2 id="side-effects">Who should avoid teeth whitening?</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.ada.org/en/member-center/oral-health-topics/whitening" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADA&#8217;s summary of clinical trials</a>, sensitivity and gum irritation are the primary known side effects of whitening. These side-effects will subside, but for a weeks-long course of treatment you&#8217;ll want to know what you&#8217;re in for.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got cavities, whitening could put hydrogen peroxide directly in contact with the nerves and blood vessels in your roots, so if you have any suspicion of decay, you should definitely get a check-up before whitening.</p>
<p>If your gums are irritated already — even just from eating something like popcorn — you&#8217;ll be more likely to feel a sting from the whitening gel if you get it on your gums. Some of the kits we tested recommend rinsing with salt water before a whitening treatment to determine if your gums will be hyper-sensitive to the peroxide.</p>
<p>Another warning we saw in whitening directions is about uneven whitening: Mineral deposits will not bleach at the same rate as the rest of your enamel. Likewise, if you&#8217;ve got veneers, partial prosthetic teeth or anything other than tooth enamel in your smile, whitening products will only bleach your real tooth surfaces.</p>

<p>The sad reality is that quick-acting whitening products are also more likely to make your teeth hurt. Studies have shown a <a href="https://www.cda-adc.ca/jcda/vol-65/issue-4/201.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">64-percent rate of complaint</a> among patients with a fairly low concentration of 10-percent carbamide peroxide (or 3.6-percent hydrogen peroxide) which still takes 2 to 3 days of hours-long treatment to show any results.</p>
<p>When we asked officemates about their experiences with teeth whitening (whether at a dentist&#8217;s office or at home), we got similar feedback: Not everyone will have problems with tooth pain after whitening, but many people do.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vanhaywood.com/uploads/articlespage/NGVB%20Limit%20Indic%20JapUKTB06.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Dr. Van Haywood</a>, increasing the strength of the peroxide solution doesn&#8217;t give a linear increase in whitening performance, which means that doubling the strength won&#8217;t necessarily whiten twice as fast. But the effect on sensitivity does increase more directly, so if you&#8217;re trying out at-home whitening you&#8217;ll probably want to stick with a lower-strength product and plan to use it for longer.</p>
<p>The good news, is that you don&#8217;t sacrifice overall results with weaker solutions: Teeth will only whiten a certain amount with these treatments, so using extra-strong products just gets you there more quickly.</p>
<p>Many dentists will suggest a sensitivity-fighting toothpaste like Sensodyne, which contains fluoride and potassium nitrate, both of which <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11820045" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been shown in studies to help reduce sensitivity</a> without reducing the effectiveness of whitening gels. We found suggestions on Reddit that you should start brushing with a sensitivity-fighting toothpaste (or massaging it into your teeth) even weeks before you start bleaching.</p>
<p>Some whitening gels we tested already have potassium nitrate and fluoride in the gel, including the two big-name products we tested: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0141J993Y/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Zoom DayWhite</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00147X6DQ/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Opalescence &#8211; PF</a>. The less-expensive all-in-one at-home kits did not have these ingredients.</p>
<p>Philips also adds a re-mineralizing &#8220;amorphous calcium phosphate&#8221; solution in their whitening gel that’s designed to help restore the surface of your teeth. This is the main reason we found to buy the more expensive whitening gel; in most other ways they&#8217;re identical to other carbamide or hydrogen peroxide solutions on the market.</p>
<p>If you want to stick to the more commonly available whitening products, you can still help reduce sensitivity with a specialized toothpaste containing stannous fluoride, potassium nitrate, Amorphous Calcium Phosphate (ACP) or Colgate&#8217;s proprietary &#8220;pro-argin&#8221; treatment. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078HQ48JX/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sensodyne&#8217;s fluoride-and-potassium</a> product is the best-known over-the-counter brand in the U.S., but ask your dentist about specialized products that might suit your particular sensitivity.</p>
<p>Nova-min is another compound that has worked very well in clinical trials, but after GlaxoSmithKline bought the rights in 2012, they&#8217;ve basically removed it from the North American market. You can buy Nova-min toothpaste from overseas, if you&#8217;re willing to pay a premium. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EF39784/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Here&#8217;s an Amazon listing for the import Sensodyne formula</a>.</p>
<h2 id="one-day-results">Can you whiten teeth in one day?</h2>
<p>Ideally, a tooth whitening system would work instantly. Few of us plan what we&#8217;ll look like at important meetings or in photographs much more than a week in advance, much less a month’s worth of hour-a-day treatments.</p>
<p>As we mentioned above, the downside to using stronger concentrations of whitening agents is sensitivity, but there&#8217;s another factor to remember: Whitening results vary, and you might not get any better result with an expensive in-office treatment than you would with a take-home kit.</p>
<p>If your dentist offers in-office &#8220;power bleaching&#8221; treatment, you&#8217;ll probably have access to the latest in light-activation tools and stronger concentrations of whitening product than you&#8217;d be comfortable using at home. If you really only have one day, a dentist will be able to give you reliable and safe results.</p>
<p>If you have the time, however, a long-term treatment should be just as effective (and much more affordable) than in-office options.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s one major hurdle to testing whitening products: Everyone&#8217;s results will be different. No two smiles are alike, and you can&#8217;t know if the stains that you have will be as easy to remove as another person&#8217;s. We tested with a single subject who has mildly sensitive teeth and no cavities or gum problems.</p>
<p>That said, there&#8217;s a reason all of these products use hydrogen peroxide (and carbamide peroxide, which breaks down to become hydrogen peroxide) as their whitening agent. It&#8217;s been proven to work, and it&#8217;s predictable. Every whitening system designed for effective at-home use is based on peroxide bleaching.</p>
<p>We bought 13 different whitening products, and our tester used them over the course of three months, focusing mostly on differentiating ease of use rather than the effect of the active ingredients.</p>
<p>We tested the activity of the peroxide gels in a coffee-stain test to make sure that these kits aren&#8217;t including fake or watered-down supplies, but it&#8217;s impossible for us to say anything more conclusive than that about results.</p>

<p>First, we laid out each kit and compared the instructions given. We found that the guidance from each product was similar, though some kits were definitely more thorough.</p>
<p>Instructions for shaping the mouthguard were almost always more detailed than instructions for applying the whitening product itself. Instructions for using whitening strips, which we admit are a fairly simple type of product to use, were almost non-existent.</p>
<p>We were expecting some clarification or guidance related to how long to use each product, but in most cases the recommended treatment times included wide ranges and seemed almost arbitrary. If you leave the bleach on your teeth longer, you&#8217;ll get more of an effect, but these suppliers are wary of making promises.</p>
<p>Standout instructions came with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System</a>, which is a good thing since a mistake mixing silicone putty and taking an impression could result in a wasted kit. Thankfully, Sparkling White Smiles also offers an extra tray’s worth of impression putty.</p>
<h3>Ease of molding process</h3>
<p>Timing is important with two-part silicone putty, since it hardens within a minute of mixing, but the heat-molded trays in the other kits required watching for signs that the walls were beginning to droop and acting immediately. One tray left in for a few seconds too long stuck to itself (like the instructions warned) and required a complete do-over.</p>
<p>Most kits include spare heat-moldable tray materials, just in case. Instructions for the kits were adequate, with no real stand-out winners. The timing for when to remove the tray from the hot water, when to put it in your mouth, and keeping all the edges from sticking together was surprisingly complex but manageable.</p>
<h3>Fit and comfort</h3>
[table id=288 /]
<p>Our tester used each tray-style kit to make impressions of his teeth. For most of the heat-shaped trays, the fitting process was repeated once or twice to get a comfortable and secure fit that wouldn&#8217;t leak whitening gel out or saliva in.</p>
<p>The trays from the Sparkling White Smiles lab were, of course, the best-fitting. The quality of fit from the shape-it-yourself trays was surprisingly good, despite our tester&#8217;s lack of experience with the process. Thinner material, like the AuraGlow and Cali White trays used, was easiest to shape.</p>
<p>We tested three other generic heat-formable whitening tray products to see if there was any difference between what&#8217;s included with whitening kits and other popular options. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nova White</a> is the only company selling trays that are notably different, with thicker, textured plastic that curls rapidly if you let it get too hot. With some practice, the thicker plastic allows for an excellent fit.</p>
<p>Two kits we tested included universal-fit trays that don&#8217;t require heat-molding. Cali White includes this as an option along with two trays you can heat-mold, but the highly-rated <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079SNKQJX/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MySmile &#8211; Teeth Whitening Kit</a> only has a universal tray.</p>
<p>After trying two days of whitening with the giant trays, we don&#8217;t recommend them at all. This is definitely one-size-fits nobody, and for our tester, having a giant piece of plastic wedged in his mouth only led to uncomfortable half-hour sessions dealing with excessive saliva.</p>
<p>If heating the custom-fit trays scares you off, then whitening strips or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IU5EDKK/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Opalescence &#8211; GO</a> system are better options.</p>
<h3>Bleach strength</h3>
<p>We tested the strength of each solution on a piece of paper dyed with concentrated coffee.</p>
<p>The big surprise with this test is that whitening strips and some of the thicker gels are basically inactive unless they get wet. On dry paper, they had almost no bleaching effect at all. But after we washed the residue off the paper from the first test, we started to see bleaching in those areas.</p>
<p>The relative difference in activity between the different solutions, which range from an equivalent of 6-percent hydrogen peroxide up to 15 percent, was hard to see in this test. The difference in effect was more noticeable between thick and thin gel than it was between strong and weak concentrations.</p>
<p>Based on what we&#8217;ve read about the effects of peroxide bleaching on different people, it seems like a weaker solution over a longer period of time will have the best outcome. This means more time with the trays in your mouth, and also more days before you start expecting results, but usually less pain from sensitized teeth.</p>
<p>That said, the common 35-percent carbamide peroxide gel included in most over-the-counter kits is popular for a reason. You should see some results in a week, even with half-hour daily whitening sessions.</p>
<h2 id="led-whitening-kits">Does LED whitening do anything?</h2>
<p>LED lights is the most polarizing part of over-the-counter whitening systems. It&#8217;s obviously an effective marketing strategy for companies like HiSmile and Express Smile Atlanta capitalizing on celebrity instagram endorsements.</p>
<p>Three of the kits we purchased included lights: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072LF2356/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cali White &#8211; Deluxe Whitening System</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079SNKQJX/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MySmile &#8211; Teeth Whitening Kit</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M63SQTI/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Crest &#8211; 3D White Whitestrips with Light</a>.</p>
<p>Theoretically, these lights could possibly make a small difference by heating up the peroxide and drying out your enamel.</p>
<p>Note that the ADA does list the whole Crest &#8211; 3D White line as &#8220;accepted,&#8221; but <a href="https://www.ada.org/en/member-center/oral-health-topics/whitening" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they also clearly state</a> that from their reviews of published research they don&#8217;t think light-activation makes a difference.</p>
<p>The lights included with over-the-counter kits aren&#8217;t even close to the equivalent of a light-activated treatment at your dentist&#8217;s office. Those machines use a laser or other high-wattage system, not 50 cents worth of cheap LED emitters. Even those expensive in-office light systems might not be making much of a difference, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4178330/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some studies show</a>.</p>

<p>We tried these three LED systems for a few sessions, to be thorough, but then we tried some control tests on paper and an eggshell. Masking off part of the test surface with foil to see if the light was making a difference, our tests showed no change in whitening with the light, even after 10 repeated treatments.</p>
<p>Our tester was happy to put all the LED parts back into the boxes and go back to whitening with just trays and gel. Taking a selfie with a strange device hanging out of your mouth is kind of cute, but it&#8217;s awkward enough wearing just trays or strips every day.</p>
<p>After looking at research and actually trying the LED systems, we can&#8217;t help thinking this phenomenon is an elaborate prank.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System</a> is a professional-grade whitening setup at a price that&#8217;s almost impossible to beat. For about the same price as a few boxes of Crest &#8211; Whitestrips, you get truly custom-crafted whitening trays and a generous supply of carbamide peroxide gel.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever had orthodontic work done, you probably know the teeth impression procedure: A dental assistant has you bite down on a plastic tray filled with silicone putty, then after the putty solidifies they send away the impressions to make castings of your teeth. After that, they can more easily make dental devices that fit the exact shape of your teeth.</p>
<p>Lab-made whitening trays use exactly that same procedure, but in the age of next-day shipping, you can get trays made without an office visit and at a much lower price. Yes, you have to mix the putty yourself, but that&#8217;s one of the few differences between this kit and getting trays made at the dentist.</p>

<p>Mixing and molding the impressions of your teeth with the included putty is a straightforward procedure, and the instructions included are thorough. The two pieces of putty are a little bit firmer than silly putty, and the colors make it easy to see when you&#8217;ve mashed them together long enough to mix. You then have a few minutes to press your teeth into the putty with the provided tray and wait for it to harden.</p>
<p>If you have difficulty making one set of impressions, Sparkling White Smiles includes enough putty to make one extra impression, and they&#8217;ll walk you through the process if you run into major trouble.</p>

After you send in your impressions these trays will get back to you in a few weeks, and then you'll have a complete at-home whitening setup just like your dentist would sell you.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Once you make your impressions, drop the trays and address form in the mail and your completed trays will be mailed back to you in two weeks. If you&#8217;re in more of a hurry than that, Sparkling White Smiles also offers rush shipping for $22. You have to include a check or credit card info for express service or spare trays.</p>
<p>You can also order a custom-fit soft night guard that&#8217;s thicker than the whitening trays for an extra $46. The whitening trays are thin, so if you&#8217;ve got a major teeth-grinding problem, you might want to shell out for the dedicated guard. $46 isn&#8217;t cheap, but this is still much less than paying most dentists to have a guard made.</p>
<h3>The rest of the kit</h3>
<p>Based on the trays alone, the relatively high cost of the Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System might make the popular mold-it-yourself tray kits like AuraGlow a more obvious option. With enough gel for 50 treatments, though, the $80 we paid for this system was well worth it.</p>
<p>The gel included with the Sparkling White Smiles kit is 22-percent carbamide peroxide. That&#8217;s weaker than many popular kits, which isn&#8217;t a bad thing. Many dentists recommend concentrations as low as 10 percent for at-home treatment, with much longer treatment times to ensure maximum effectiveness. The instructions suggest treating for 30 minutes twice daily with this solution, which is more tray time but less risk of tooth pain than other systems.</p>
<p>Other manufacturers selling the same strength of product, like Opalescence, suggest up to two hours of treatment time with this strength of solution, but it&#8217;s best to consult your dentist if you have specific questions about finding the right treatment regimen for your teeth.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B1X3I1W/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bright White strips from Lovely Smile</a> are, as far as we can tell, identical to most other whitening strips on the market. The active ingredient is a small amount of hydrogen peroxide, and the strips themselves are thin and adhere well to teeth.</p>
<p>Lovely Smile suggests applying these thrips for 15 to 30 minutes during your first go, and for one hour per day after that. The kit contains enough strips for two weeks of whitening treatments, the same treatment length as Crest Whitestrips.</p>
<p>As we hope has been made clear, there&#8217;s no way to say exactly how effective any particular treatment will be for your teeth, but these strips are a low-risk way to start.</p>
<p>As with any whitening strips, the biggest problem is applying them carefully and evenly. It seems the peroxide in these strips is weak enough that they&#8217;re not likely to cause any harm, but you wouldn&#8217;t want to stick them to your gums every day. If you do find your gums sensitive after using strips, the irritation is temporary and should go away quickly.</p>
<p>Some dentists recommend trimming whitening strips so that they&#8217;re only a wide as you need to cover your most visible teeth, since nobody can tell how white your molars are. Excess strip material means more chance it&#8217;ll be touching your gums or even the roof of your mouth on the inside. The Lovely Smile strips are as easy to trim as the other brands are, and it&#8217;s reassuring that the pieces you&#8217;re throwing away aren&#8217;t as expensive.</p>

Hydrogen peroxide is a proven ingredient for strip-based whitening, and the menthol helps you know if you've applied them correctly.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B1X3I1W?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The only drawback to Lovely Smile strips in particular is the hour-long recommended treatment time: strips are pretty easy to get used to compared to trays, but by the time an hour is up you&#8217;ll be ready to get them out of your mouth. The Crest &#8211; Glamorous White and Solimo strips have instructions for half-hour treatment times.</p>
<p>A tingle from the menthol additive in these strips is also a good indicator that you’ve started dissolving the gel in your saliva or that it&#8217;s stuck to your gum tissue instead of your teeth.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re done with your daily hour of strip-wearing, you&#8217;ll definitely want a place to rinse and brush your teeth. A paper towel works in a pinch to wipe the gel off, but it&#8217;s very sticky stuff. Most of the strips we tested were the same in this regard.</p>
<h3>The drawbacks of whitening strips</h3>
<p>As with any product like this, the sticky gel on the Lovely White strip has to touch your tooth enamel to whiten it. If you&#8217;ve got irregular teeth that overlap or otherwise prevent even contact, strips could inadvertently whiten only some parts of your teeth. Trays are a much better way to go in that case.</p>
<p>If you want the assurance that comes from the American Dental Association seal of acceptance, you&#8217;re going to have to spend about double the price of these strips to get the guarantees of Crest&#8217;s famous white strips. The results you get from the Lovely White strips should be the same.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re turned off by the lesser-known brands recommended above, you&#8217;re in luck: You can buy the same whitening products online that your dentist will sell you, usually at a much lower cost. Our pick is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0141J993Y/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Zoom Day White</a> system. This product doesn&#8217;t come with trays, but that&#8217;s easy to address with off-the-shelf heat-molded trays like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this affordable set from Nova White</a>.</p>
<p>Zoom is a whitening system that&#8217;s been used by dentists since the 1990s. Philips bought Zoom from Discus Dental in 2010, and it&#8217;s now one of the top systems used in dental offices.</p>
<p>We picked Zoom over other high-concentration formulas for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, Philips uses hydrogen peroxide rather than carbamide peroxide, and it should work better in short treatment sessions for most people than the equivalent concentration of carbamide peroxide.</p>
<p>Second, Philips includes a remineralization and sensitivity-fighting formula in this package. Potassium nitrate is the same active ingredient used in sensitivity-numbing toothpaste, and Amorphous Calcium Phosphate (ACP) should help restore the surface of your tooth enamel.</p>
<p>Yes, you can get these sensitivity treatments in a toothpaste, but if you&#8217;re already spending half an hour every day putting fancy goop on your teeth, why not kill two birds with one stone?</p>
<p>Even buying it on Amazon, Zoom isn&#8217;t exactly a bargain. Compared to the rock-bottom price of 47 cents per treatment when you&#8217;re buying generic carbamide gel and heat-molded trays, or a cost of $1.60 per treatment for the perfect fit you get with the Sparkling White Smiles kit, the $3.87 per-treatment cost of the Philips system (including a $10 for a separate set of trays) is steep. But it&#8217;s comparable to the cost of some popular all-in-one kits, and you&#8217;re getting sensitivity treatment along with the higher-strength whitening solution.</p>

If you're looking for the fastest results you can get without booking an expensive hyper-bleach at your dentist, this is a good alternative.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0141J993Y?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The downside to buying professional-grade whitening gel on the internet is that these items aren&#8217;t actually intended to be sold direct-to-consumer. That is, they&#8217;re intended to be sold to you by a dentist, not by a dental supply warehouse running an Amazon store.</p>
<p>This whitening gel is designed for at-home with the guidance of a dentist, and the instructions are written that way. Also, Philips won’t give you a refund as Crest will if you aren&#8217;t happy with your results.</p>
<p>That said, 14-percent peroxide is still low compared to the products dentists will use for one-day whitening treatments. This stuff will sting if it gets on your gums, but it&#8217;s not dangerous unless you put it in your eye.</p>
<h3>Affordable, high-quality trays: NovaWhite</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;re buying the Philips &#8211; Zoom gel by itself, you&#8217;ll also need trays. This is the trickiest part of at-home whitening: Heat-molded trays included in most kits are good enough, but they&#8217;re not foolproof.</p>
<p>Our pick for a stand-alone tray to go with Zoom refills is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NovaWhite heat moldable trays</a>: They conform very well to your teeth and they&#8217;re a bargain at less than $10 for a set of four.</p>
<p>That said, the NovaWhite trays do curl over just a bit more quickly when you&#8217;re heating them in hot water than some of the other trays. We found these to be excellent trays for a low price, but plan on shaping both pairs of trays to get the best fit, and follow the instructions about heating time carefully.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to use name-brand whitening gel like your dentist will sell you, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0141J993Y/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Zoom Day White</a> is one of the best.</li>
<li>Philips tempers the strength of this 14-percent peroxide solution with sensitivity-fighting potassium nitrate.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s also a calcium-restoring gel in this solution</li>
<li>Zoom also comes in lower concentrations, but this is our pick for a fast-acting whitening solution.</li>

<h3>AuraGlow &#8211; Radiant Effects</h3>
<p>If you want a complete kit that provides good value, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7Y5P9D/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AuraGlow &#8211; Radiant Effects whitening kit</a> is popular for a reason. The trays included in this kit were a little bit easier to heat and mold than most, with good instructions that resulted in a good fit the first time with no tweaking necessary.</p>
<p>After making seven complete sets of kits, we rank this set close to the top. AuraGlow&#8217;s trays give you a little more leeway when you&#8217;re trying to decide if it&#8217;s time to pull them out of the water. The tray material doesn&#8217;t just curl over and stick to itself if it&#8217;s in the hot water two seconds too long.</p>
<p>Your results may vary, of course, with do-it-yourself heat-molded trays. That&#8217;s why we picked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System</a> as our top choice. The thicker, softer plastic of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NovaWhite</a> trays also felt just a little bit tighter overall once we tweaked them with a re-heat and a second attempt at getting a perfect fit.</p>
<p>The gel that comes with the AuraGlow kit isn&#8217;t any worse than what comes with the Sparkling White Smiles kit; it&#8217;s a bit stronger, but you should be careful about keeping it off your gums either way. At $1.50 per application, this set is about half the cost of buying Philips &#8211; Zoom refills and a set of trays, without any of the fancy additives included there.</p>
<p>Compared to the cost of the very least-expensive products available, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004BLXG5U/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SensAllis gel refills</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nova White trays</a>, this kit looks more expensive. Buying the most economical supplies comes out to one third the price-per-application of an AuraGlow kit, though you might never use up all that gel.</p>
<p>On the whole, the AuraGlow kit makes the most sense if you intend to stop whitening after using the one month of included treatments. A month of 35-percent carbamide should theoretically get you all the improvement you&#8217;re likely to see, but results vary.</p>
<h3>Cali White &#8211; Deluxe Whitening System</h3>
<p>If you just have to have a selfie with an LED light for your Instagram story, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072LF2356/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cali White &#8211; Deluxe Whitening System</a> is the LED-bundle kit we&#8217;d pick over the others we checked out.</p>
<p>For about $5 more than AuraGlow&#8217;s kit, Cali White includes a universal-fit tray, which is actually much more awkward than it looks. The included heat-moldable trays are practically identical to the trays included with AuraGlow&#8217;s kit, and you get the same amount of carbamide peroxide gel.</p>
<p>Cali White goes out of their way to promote the benefits of baking soda, cranberry seed extract and aloe in their whitening gel, but it&#8217;s still carbamide peroxide doing the work.</p>
<p>The LED light included is kind of neat, but so far as we can tell it doesn&#8217;t speed up whitening in any way. We tried it, and it&#8217;s more annoying than it could possibly be worth.</p>
<p>Overall, the Cali White kit isn&#8217;t a bad buy for the trays and peroxide gel, but there&#8217;s no reason to pick it over the AuraGlow system.</p>
<h3>Opalescence &#8211; GO</h3>
<p>The take-home universal-fit <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IU5EDKK/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Opalescence &#8211; GO</a> system is unique in that it offers many of the advantages of both tray systems and whitening strips.</p>
<p>This product includes a universal-fit tray that&#8217;s pre-filled with Opalescence hydrogen peroxide gel, but it&#8217;s a moldable wax tray. You put the plastic holder over your teeth, squeeze the tray to fit just right, then remove the plastic.</p>
<p>Sadly, this isn&#8217;t as easy as it sounds. The trays are quite large to fit a wider range of mouth sizes, which means you need to carefully judge how far up and back to move them before you can squeeze them into shape.</p>
<p>These trays have far more gel than we&#8217;ve seen suggested by any filling instructions in other kits — there&#8217;s even gel for the inside of your back molars, just in case your date is shining a flashlight into your mouth.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re squeezing gel around as you mold the tray to fit your teeth, and this is Opalescent&#8217;s thick glue-like gel, not the watery stuff most kits come with. It&#8217;ll stay in place fairly well, but it&#8217;s not as easy to wipe off your gums.</p>
<p>Once you get the hang of how these trays work, they can be made to fit very well. Opalescence is popular with dentists, so if you have questions about strength or timing your regular dentist might be more likely to give you advice. It&#8217;s not as comfortable using this system as strips or custom-made trays, but it&#8217;s better than non-molded trays.</p>
<p>On the whole, we&#8217;re not sold on the value of this product. It&#8217;s not really harder to learn how to fit a heat-molded plastic tray than these waxy trays, and this product is far more expensive than anything else we tested.</p>
<p>At nearly $6 per set of trays, the best reason to go with this system is if you want to share a package with someone for a quick week of touch-up whitening, or you really hate the idea of squeezing hot plastic into your mouth.</p>

<h3>Solimo &#8211; 10-day kit</h3>
<p>Direct from whatever factory makes all of these strips for everyone, Amazon brings you their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CNW4LN5/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Solimo-branded 10-day whitening kit.</a> With the same active ingredients as Crest &#8211; 3D White Whitestrips and the slightly less-expensive Lovely Smile strips, the main reason to pick this set would be if the Lovely White 14-pack is out of stock. The differences between the products are minimal.</p>
<h3>Crest &#8211; 3D White Whitestrips</h3>
<p>We tested both the 3D White <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001OOLLVS/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glamorous White</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M63SQTI/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">&#8220;With Light&#8221;</a> packages, and the differences are, again, minimal. In our control test to check peroxide-bleaching activity, these strips gave very similar results on coffee stains. The main difference is the taller, narrower strip you&#8217;re given for your bottom teeth in the Glamorous White packages, and of course the $34 LED light.</p>
<p>Crest&#8217;s &#8220;With Light&#8221; package also comes with directions that suggest using the strips for a full hour, rather than Glamorous White’s half-hour. It&#8217;s possible that the hydrogen peroxide solution is weaker in the “With Light” package, but Crest might also be using the difference in directions to suggest better results from the more expensive kit.</p>
<p>The LED light from Crest, as in the other kits, showed no effect on the activity of the peroxide in a controlled bleaching test. It&#8217;s possible it could warm your teeth slightly, but it&#8217;s a very small and low-power light source.</p>
<p>The one edge Crest has over the other strip-type whitening kits is that they&#8217;ve spent a lot of money getting the necessary research in place to earn the <a href="https://www.ada.org/en/press-room/news-releases/2017-archives/june/crest-3d-white-glamorous-white-whitestrips-to-receive-ada-seal-of-acceptance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Dental Association&#8217;s Seal of Acceptance</a>. While that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean this system is better than other whitening products, it does mean that it has been proven to work safely in a lot of tests.</p>
<p>Crest (owned by Procter and Gamble) is the only consumer-sale whitening product manufacturer that has successfully applied for the Seal on a whitening product. They&#8217;re in a similar place to P&amp;G&#8217;s Oral-B <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-electric-toothbrush/">electric toothbrushes that we tested</a>: This brand proven, but that doesn&#8217;t mean other brands are selling ineffective products. The ADA won&#8217;t tell us if a company has ever paid up and still failed to earn the Seal on an over-the-counter product.</p>
<h3>Lumist</h3>
<p>The whitening strips from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BFWQEZG/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lumist</a> are the most unique of all the strips we researched. Rather than have just a plastic backing on a sticky peroxide-carrying gel, Lumist makes their backing more formable and stretchy. You can mold these strips around tooth features that the other strips will just bubble and crease on, ironically making Lumist a more three-dimensional solution that Crest&#8217;s so-called 3D Whitestrips.</p>
<p>Lumist uses 20-percent carbamide peroxide in these strips, which makes them faster-acting than other strips and potentially as quick as a tray and gel solution. The price of the Lumist strips is the weak point, though; at $6 per treatment, they’re almost as expensive as the stronger and more comfortable-to-wear Opalescence &#8211; GO trays.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Whitening your teeth at home is a bit like changing your own oil: it&#8217;s not for everyone, but nearly anyone can learn how to do it if they&#8217;re motivated. It&#8217;ll also save you some money.</p>
<p>For the best results, you want a set of plastic trays that will be comfortable to wear for a half-hour to an hour at a time. These trays should also conform exactly to your teeth, keeping the whitening solution on your enamel and off your gums.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System</a> gives you the precision and quality of a tray your dentist could sell you, but without the overhead of paying for an in-office assistant to mix the silicone putty. Along with excellent trays, you get an all-inclusive package with enough whitening gel to last for months.</p>
<p>If $80 is more than you can afford to spend on whiter teeth, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B1X3I1W/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lovely Smile &#8211; Bright White</a> whitening strips will get you two weeks of basic treatment for less than $20. You can expect to see a basic improvement in shade with this system, and whitening strips are recommended by even the most cautious dentists.</p>
<p>If you need speedy results, we like the higher-concentration, fast-acting hydrogen peroxide offered in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0141J993Y/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Zoom Day White</a> system. This solution comes with sensitivity-fighting and mineral-restoring compounds mixed in, so the extra sensitivity from faster-acting peroxide should be minimized. You&#8217;ll need to buy trays like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">these from Nova White</a> separately, though.</p>

<p>Before deciding on which mascaras to test, we read up on the science and design of mascara. We researched mascara formulas, the importance of the brush and wiper (the inside lip of the bottle that determines how much product is left on the applicator) design and whether or not there’s a major difference between designer and drugstore mascaras (spoiler alert: it has nothing to do with the formula).</p>
<p>Once we understood the mechanics of mascara, and which features produce which desired effect, we delved into the consumer side of things. Mascara is one of the most-loved products, used by <a href="https://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/formulating/category/color/Elevating-Mascaras-Formulating-Must-have-Lash-Effects-506459671.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">59 percent of female consumers</a>. What do consumers want most when choosing a mascara?</p>
<p>While washable mascara may be better for daily wear, some women have a personal preference for waterproof mascara. It’s more durable, and it’s better for a hot climate. We curated several waterproof mascaras to test in our roundup of finalists.</p>
<p>We looked at trends reported by <a href="https://www.mintel.com/press-centre/beauty-and-personal-care/global-colour-cosmetics-sales-to-exceed-us-48bn-as-mintel-identifies-4-growth-areas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mintel’s global beauty analysts</a>. We found that the industry is shifting towards natural and organic products, based on demand by consumers for environmentally-friendly products. The downside is that many of the natural mascaras do little to enhance lashes. We made sure to include several natural choices in the finalists we tested.</p>
<p>Our top pick for a natural mascara, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GC62MNF/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TetyanaNaturals &#8211; 4D Silk Fiber Lash</a>, impressed us with its ability to make lashes longer, bolder and more defined.</p>
<p>Then, we narrowed down specific mascaras, gathering information via consumer reviews on Sephora and Ulta. Due to concerns about counterfeit products (more on that later), we put less weight on Amazon reviews. Once we curated a list of the 35 best mascaras, we used eleven staff testers to wear, remove and rate them.</p>

<h3>Are designer brands really better than drugstore brands?</h3>
<p>Nearly all mascaras use the same basic ingredients: wax, carbon-black or colored pigments and film formers to coat lashes and help the pigment stick. Waterproof mascaras contain additional waxes (since waxes repel water), isododecane and cyclopentasiloxane to prevent pigment from running down your cheeks.</p>
<p>One exception to the basic wax-pigment formula would be fiber mascaras, which use tiny fibers made of silk, nylon or rayon to temporarily lengthen lashes. The product (and resulting length) is washed away at the end of the night. If extreme length is a feature you desire, you may want to go beyond looking at brush design and consider a fiber mascara.</p>
<p>Claims of benefits from vitamins or botanical extracts in certain formulas are usually just for marketing purposes. The basic combination of wax and pigment make up the majority of the formula, and these ingredients are at low percentages that make little difference.</p>
<p>The magic happens when the brush, formula and wiper work together to create a certain look (be it more volume or more definition). Some brands even use the same formula, but a unique brush, wiper and bottle design yields dramatically different results.</p>
<p>Let’s break down the anatomy of a mascara:</p>
<p><strong>Brush:</strong> These can be made of nylon or plastic bristles. The number of the bristles and their spacing, even the way the bristles are twisted and trimmed, can make a difference in the outcome. For example, bristles that are finely spaced will give more definition. Bristles that are further apart will give you thicker lashes with more volume.</p>
<p>Each brush is carefully designed by the manufacturer. Brands spend a large amount of money to patent their brushes, which goes to show that the design of the applicator is just as, if not more, important than the formula.</p>
<p><strong>Wiper:</strong> The wiper is the plastic ring inside the mouth of the tube. It impacts the performance of the mascara by wiping off excess formula. A wiper that is too tight will remove most of the formula before you get a chance to apply it. A wiper that is too large will result in clumpy lashes that dry slowly and tend to smudge. Mascaras with adjustable wipers allow you to determine how much mascara you want to leave on the brush, less for definition and more for a dramatic look.</p>
<p>Since the applicator design is the major component of a mascara’s performance, the amount of money a brand pours into the design of a bottle and wiper can make a difference in the end result. So even though the formulas in drugstore and designer mascaras are essentially the same, the designer mascaras we tested ranked higher overall than the drugstore versions.</p>
<p>However, choosing the right mascara doesn’t mean you need to make a large investment. Many of the drugstore mascaras we tested were low-rated by our panel of testers. Yet a drugstore mascara, the Neutrogena &#8211; Healthy Lengths, easily rivals its designer counterparts.</p>
<h3>How to choose the right mascara</h3>

<p>It can be tempting to stroll into a beauty store to try out a mascara before you buy, especially since the high-end designer brands can be expensive. However, testing in stores isn’t recommended. Since the brush and wiper play a major part in the final results, the disposable wand doesn’t give you an accurate assessment of the mascara. Also, other testers may have double-dipped, so there’s no guarantee the wand is free of bacteria.</p>
<p>Your best option is to focus on which brush style fits your needs, which we’ll detail in the next section.</p>
<h4>For sensitive eyes</h4>
<p>Even if a mascara claims to be opthamologist tested, you should always check to see if it causes you sensitivity by testing it on your arm first. If you do have a reaction, you don’t want to find out when it’s already left your eyes inflamed and bloodshot. Mascara gets the closest to the eyeball of any makeup, so it’s the most likely to be a culprit for dermatitis or allergies.</p>
<p>If you have sensitive eyes, you’ll want to steer away from waterproof mascaras. The ingredients that make these formulas waterproof or water resistant can dry out your lashes and cause them to fall out over time. This process is hastened when you sleep with mascara on, which happens more often with waterproof mascara because it can be difficult to remove.</p>
<p>You may also need to avoid mascaras with extension fibers or colored pigments; the fewer ingredients, the less likely the mascara is to cause irritation. That doesn’t mean you have to give up lashes with staying power: <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-magnetic-eyelashes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">magnetic lashes</a> are a great option for a natural day look or a night on the town.</p>
<p>No matter which mascara you choose, you should replace your mascara every three months. The more times you use a tube, the more potential it has to be infected with bacteria that can lead to irritation or eye infection.</p>
<p>If you’re hesitant to discard your mascara so frequently, you may feel better knowing there’s a <a href="https://www.appalachianwild.org/wands-for-wildlife.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wildlife organization</a> that wants your used wands to help save the lives of animals.</p>

<p><strong>Classic:</strong> These are best for volume and separation. If the style of wand has thicker bristles, it will give your lashes even more volume. A plastic bristle brush will give you more definition and less clumping than a nylon bristle brush.</p>
<p><strong>Hourglass:</strong> If you want lashes so dramatic they look like falsies, an hourglass shape can provide tons of volume while also lifting your lashes.</p>
<p><strong>Tapered:</strong> Also known as a cone brush, the thinner end helps you reach the small lashes toward the inner and outer corners of your eye.</p>
<p><strong>Inverted cone:</strong> If you want a wide-eyed look with volume and length, this brush will help you reach your goals. The smaller bristles grab onto the root of your lashes, pulling them upwards and outwards.</p>
<p><strong>Pointed:</strong> This wand has a dual use for full coverage. You can apply it as you normally would on the outer lashes. Then you can turn it and use the pointed end to lengthen.</p>
<p><strong>Curved:</strong> The main purpose of a curved brush is to curl your lashes. It mimics the natural curl of the lashes, hugging your lashes from the waterline to the tip. To add even more curl and prevent drooping, start with an eyelash curler and coat with a waterproof formula.</p>
<p><strong>Comb:</strong> If you have short and thin lashes, this type of wand will help grab and coat individual lashes without clumping.</p>
<p><strong>Skinny:</strong> This is another style for those with shorter lashes. A skinny brush helps coat lashes from the very root, giving your lashes more definition and making them appear longer.</p>
<p><strong>Jumbo:</strong> On the opposite end of the spectrum is the jumbo brush, which is best for thickening. It can give you thicker and fuller lashes in half the time of other brush styles.</p>
<p><strong>Rectangle:</strong> This style is best for volume and length, as the bristles stretch and pull your lashes to greater heights. The downside is it won’t easily reach the smaller lashes at the corners of your eye.</p>
<p><strong>Spiral:</strong> If you want curl, but also volume, this brush gives you the best of both worlds. It lifts the lashes as you roll, without losing out on any volume.</p>
<p><strong>Ball:</strong> Larger brushes don’t always reach the root of the lash, so if your lashes are blond or fair, you may want to consider a mascara with a ball brush. It concentrates on a few lashes at a time, for root to tip coverage and can coat all the lashes that traditional brushes have trouble reaching.</p>
<p><strong>Miniature:</strong> It may seem extra, but if you want a whole mascara just for your bottom lashes, there’s a brush for that. Paired with a long wear formula, you can avoid smudging using one of these super small brushes.</p>

<p>Counterfeit products made big news in 2017 when <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/amazon-recalls-potentially-hazardous-solar-eclipse-glasses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon recalled</a> thousands of eclipse glasses that could not be verified as authentic. Just as it can be hazardous to look directly at the sun without proper eye protection, counterfeit is also a concern with beauty products. It can be dangerous to apply counterfeit products to your hair or skin.</p>
<p>Thirty-four percent of beauty consumers <a href="https://www.allure.com/story/how-to-avoid-buying-counterfeit-beauty-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered they were using a fake</a> after having a bad reaction. Not only could you be applying toxic metals such as arsenic or mercury to your skin, you don’t know what other kinds of illegal operations you are funding.</p>
<p>Even though both brands and online marketplaces take measures to keep counterfeits off the market, it’s still a good idea to be aware when shopping online. That doesn’t mean you should never buy products online, but you should protect yourself by using the following tips to avoid purchasing (and applying) counterfeit beauty products:</p>
<ul>
<li>The only way to be absolutely sure you’re getting the real deal is to buy directly from the company’s website or official retailer.</li>
<li>If you order from an online marketplace such as Amazon or Walmart, avoid third-party vendors (sellers other than the brand or authorized retailer). Check the seller’s name next to the “ships from and sold by” information.</li>
<li>If the price seems too good to be true, you should be cautious. Verify the current retail price on the brand’s website or their authorized dealers (often found on the brand’s site). Even a small discount may be an indication that it’s a fake.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once we had our 35 mascara finalists in hand, we tested each mascara using a panel of 11 women of varying ages, ethnicities and beauty routines. We conducted tests for sensitivity, performance and wearability and how easily the mascaras were removed at the end of the day.</p>
<h3>The skin patch test</h3>
<p>Before our testers put the wands to their eyes, they patch-tested the product on their inner forearm in the morning. We asked them to use a cotton swab to swipe excess product from the base of the wand, then dab it on their skin. They covered it with an adhesive bandage and then checked it for redness at the end of the day.</p>
<p>None of our mascara finalists caused an allergic reaction on any of our eleven testers. However, since the experience is subjective (for example, those who wear contacts or are prone to allergies are more susceptible), there’s no guarantee these mascaras won’t make your eyes itchy or watery. You should always do your own patch-test first.</p>
<h3>The performance test</h3>
<p>In order to gain insight into the effect of each mascara on different peoples&#8217; lashes, we had our testers wear their designated mascaras for a 12-hour period. Our testers applied the mascara at 9 am and wore it until 9 pm. Immediately after applying mascara, they rated it on a scale of one to five (with five as best) on the following metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>How evenly the mascara applies</li>
<li>How well it defines and separates</li>
<li>How much volume it adds</li>
<li>The length of the lashes after application</li>
</ul>
<p>Later in the day, they reported on the following metrics using the same scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the mascara flakes</li>
<li>Whether the mascara smudges or runs</li>
<li>Whether the mascara is heavy or sticky</li>
<li>Whether the lashes are crunchy or remain soft</li>
<li>How well the mascara lasts through the day</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we averaged the ratings to see which mascaras performed best across the board. Mascaras often focus on one attribute, such as extreme volume or extreme length. This process allowed us to find the mascaras that did it all: providing volume, length and definition while remaining clump and smudge free.</p>
<p>While some of us may desire lift and others live for lengthening, the <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/eyes-to-kill-mascara-P393671" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giorgio Armani &#8211; Eyes to Kill</a> ranked high in every category, making it an ideal choice for most consumers. The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GC62MNF/?tag=ybdlash-20">TetyanaNaturals &#8211; 4D Silk Fiber Lash</a> was a close second, making it an excellent option if you desire length along with definition and don’t have a sensitivity to fiber extensions.</p>
<p>Another top contender for a mascara that doesn’t skimp on volume, definition or length is the M.A.C. &#8211; In Extreme Dimension Lash. However, it didn’t rank in the highest averages because it tends to be sticky after application and crunchy when it dries, while our top finalists left our lashes soft and fluttery.</p>
<p>Long lash lovers will appreciate the TetyanaNaturals &#8211; 4D Silk Fiber Lash, INIKI Organic &#8211; Long Lash Vegan, Too Faced &#8211; Better Than Sex and <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/diorshow-waterproof-mascara-P99901" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dior &#8211; Diorshow Waterproof</a>.</p>
<p>If you are looking for more volume, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ADRGV26/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neutrogena &#8211; Healthy Lengths</a> and M.A.C. &#8211; In Extreme Dimension Lash make lashes appear thicker without sacrificing definition. The Giorgio Armani &#8211; Eyes to Kill and Too Faced &#8211; Better Than Sex Waterproof are also extreme volume-boosters.</p>
<p>Those that want every lash to stand out will appreciate the TetyanaNaturals &#8211; 4D Silk Fiber Lash and Neutrogena &#8211; Healthy Lengths.</p>
<h3>The removability test</h3>
<p>The harder it is for a mascara to remove, the more tempting it is to go to bed with it still on our eyes. We all know it’s a terrible habit that stains your pillowcases and your cheeks, but you may become more disciplined once you learn that crashing with your mascara still on can contribute to blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelid that leaves your eyes looking greasy and crusted).</p>
<p>Some mascaras we expect to be harder to remove; the same ingredients that make a waterproof mascara stay all day make it more difficult to take off at night. But no one wants a mascara that fades by five o’clock and still requires some tugging to remove.</p>
<p>We had our testers gently wipe Cetaphil makeup remover wipes over their eyes after wearing their mascara for a 12-hour period. We asked them to count the number of wipes needed to fully remove mascara and then rate the mascara as easy or difficult to remove.</p>
<p>The vast majority of our finalists were easy or moderately easy to remove with the wipes. Notably, the Too Faced &#8211; Better Than Sex Waterproof, Maybelline &#8211; Full N&#8217; Soft Waterproof and Dior &#8211; Diorshow Waterproof were easy to remove, despite their waterproof capability.</p>
<p>The fiber mascaras, TetyanaNaturals &#8211; 4D Silk Fiber Lash, AsaVea &#8211; 4D Silk Fiber Eyelash and Thrive Causemetics &#8211; Liquid Lash Extensions, were easy enough to remove from the lashes but the extending fibers would clump and ball and stick to the cheeks.</p>

<p>The fat asymmetrical brush and blend of hard and soft waxes makes the <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/eyes-to-kill-mascara-P393671" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giorgio Armani &#8211; Eyes to Kill</a> a jack-of-all-trades mascara. This mascara is great for someone who wants big lashes and doesn’t want to have to watch a YouTube tutorial to make it happen.</p>
<p>The Giorgio Armani is a designer mascara, and it’s on the higher end of the price range of the finalists we tested. Even with blind-testing our mascaras to avoid bias, the Giorgio Armani emerged as the highest-rated mascara by our panel of testers.</p>
<p>It’s not too dry or too wet, and it glides through lashes easily. It has a Goldilocks sized wiper, so it leaves the right amount of product on the brush. That means that you can swipe it quickly and have big, bad lashes, but it doesn’t leave you with clumps.</p>
<p>We loved the buildable volume; one coat is perfect for a natural day look. Thanks to the oversized bristle weave brush, this mascara goes on faster than others. Since it gives you full and even coverage with just a swipe, you can apply it while multitasking in the morning (meaning you can get big, fluttery lashes before your toddler tips the cereal bowl all over his clean shirt).</p>
<p>You can ramp it up in the evening with two coats for a false lash effect. It lifts lashes and doesn’t droop or wear off, so even if you are making a quick transition between work and a night out, you can leave the tube at home and feel confident your lashes are still long, thick and lifted.</p>

<p>Contact wearers will rejoice that it doesn’t leave a film on the lens or flake into the eyes, making it comfortable for a 12-hour stretch. It has only minimal smudging, so you don’t end up with mascara on your cheeks, even after a full day of wear.</p>
<p>Another top rated mascara that we recommend as an excellent overall choice is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004UY9HLA/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M.A.C. &#8211; In Extreme Dimension Lash</a>. It leaves lashes crunchier than our top pick and is more difficult to remove, but the volume, length and definition will have you batting your lashes all day.</p>

<p>While waterproof mascaras can be notoriously hard on your lashes, the <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/diorshow-waterproof-mascara-P99901" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dior &#8211; Diorshow Waterproof</a> is our top pick for those days when you need your mascara to be extra. It holds up through splashing, swimming and watching your best friend walk down the aisle.</p>
<p>Women who prize long, fat and spidery lashes will especially love the Diorshow. It lifts, lengthens and separates using an extra wide brush with bristles that are grouped closely together. This means you can swipe it through quickly and finish applying without agonizing over every little lash. It has an inky-black pigment that gives your eyes a dramatic appearance, making it a definite go-to for a special occasion.</p>
<p>Our testers reported that the wiper is slightly too tight, so you may need more than one coat to get the right amount of product on your lashes. However, the fat brush gives you an instantly full effect. What the testers loved most is that it isn&#8217;t heavy at all, leaves the lashes very soft and, most importantly, lasts all day with no smudging or flaking.</p>

<p>It’s also easy to remove when you decide to turn in, so you won’t be tempted to sleep with it on overnight.</p>
<p>Another good choice for a waterproof mascara is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GC62MNF/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TetyanaNaturals &#8211; 4D Silk Fiber Lash</a> (which also happens to be our top pick for a natural mascara). We also like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008JVL7PE/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Buxom &#8211; Lash Waterproof</a>, although it does tend to leave lashes crunchier than our top pick.</p>

<p>If you want long and natural looking lashes without splurging, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ADRGV26/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neutrogena &#8211; Healthy Lengths</a> gives results that rival the more expensive designer options.</p>
<p>If you love the separated lash look, the Neutrogena is your best bet for a drugstore mascara. It has a plastic bristle brush that’s skinny enough to reach the lashes at the corners of the eye. Our testers gave a rating of four out of five to the Neutrogena for length, but a five-out-of-five rating for definition and separation as well as volume. The formula is thin and buildable, so if you want extra length, you can apply more coats of mascara and it won’t cake up on your lashes.</p>
<p>The wiper is just the right size, so the formula applies evenly. It gives you fluttery, soft and separated lashes that last all day without smudging or flaking. If you want to pass yourself off as genetically blessed with good lashes (at a fraction of the price of high-end mascaras), this is the mascara you’ll love best.</p>
<p>One drawback is that the name may be a misnomer, as the <a href="http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/product/684315/Neutrogena_Healthy_Lengths_Mascara/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Environmental Working Group rates this mascara</a> as a six (one is best) in terms of hazardous ingredients. It has the poorest EWG ranking of all our mascara finalists, with fragrance being the main culprit for concern. If you have sensitive eyes or are keen on an environmentally friendly mascara, this may not be the right choice for you. Unless you are sensitive to fragrances, this may be a non issue for you.</p>

<p>If natural products are important to you, you’ll want to check out the Tetyana Naturals &#8211; 4D Silk Fiber Lash, which we cover in the next section. Our other drugstore finalists ranked low on our list, but the Maybelline &#8211; Lash Sensational would be our next choice for a drugstore mascara.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GC62MNF/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TetyanaNaturals &#8211; 4D Silk Fiber Lash</a> is a good choice if you want long, bold lashes and don’t have a sensitivity to extending fiber particles (you may want to stay away from this one if you wear contacts as the particles can get into your eyes). It has a cone-shaped brush with plastic bristles, making it a good choice if you want to reach every last lash.</p>
<p>This mascara is waterproof, which makes it an excellent choice for days at the beach or special occasions. The TetyanaNaturals can be difficult to remove and leave fiber particles on your cheeks, so be sure you’re committed to a longer nighttime routine if you purchase this product.</p>
<p>It gets the right amount on the lashes, and applies evenly. However, there is a small trail of product on the tip of the brush, so we find we need to wipe it off before applying to avoid getting product on our cheeks.</p>
<p>If you apply the mascara with a simple swipe, you get natural-looking and well-defined lashes with extra length. We find that if you use a zig-zag motion to apply the mascara (wiggle it back and forth as you swipe upwards), you’ll have a lot more volume with this mascara. So depending on how you apply it, you have multiple options for how your lashes look.</p>
<p>While TetyanaNaturals isn’t rated by the Environmental Working Group (or the Think Dirty app), we researched individual ingredients, and the majority were rated low for concern. Only the last ingredient (triethanolamine) was listed with a moderate concern.</p>

<p>The mascara is also free from any of the dangerous chemicals that you probably don’t want on your face. In comparison, none of the mascaras that are top rated by EWG were as effective as we would like, so despite an official EWG rating, we feel the TetyanaNaturals is a good choice for a natural mascara.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072QGSDPD/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">INIKI Organic &#8211; Long Lash Vegan</a> is well-rated EWG mascara that we would recommend as another good natural choice.</p>

<h3>INIKI Organic &#8211; Long Lash Vegan</h3>
<p>If you want a natural mascara that’s big on lengthening and don’t mind a little less volume, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072QGSDPD/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">INIKI Organic &#8211; Long Lash Vegan</a> is a good choice. Our testers remarked on its fluid formula; thicker mascaras can add volume but can also give them a tendency to clump. The wetness of the INIKI mascara ensures a smooth application. Because the lashes are so long and the formula is on the wet side, it can smudge on your eyelids if you don’t give it enough time to dry.</p>
<p>Animal testing isn’t the only thing to look out for when buying vegan-friendly cosmetics. Beeswax is commonly the first or second ingredient in mascaras, but INIKI Organic uses carnauba wax (obtained from the leaves of the Brazilian tropical palm tree).</p>
<h3>Thrive Causemetics &#8211; Liquid Lash Extensions</h3>
<p>If you have short lashes, you’ll appreciate the skinny wand and extending fibers of the <a href="https://thrivecausemetics.com/products/liquid-lash-extensions-mascara" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thrive Causemetics &#8211; Liquid Lash Extensions</a>. This type of brush helps you reach the very root, for longer-appearing lashes. It applies evenly and gives you volume and length, but leaves room for improvement in the area of definition. The Thrive Causemetics is long wearing, although the fibers tend to clump into little balls when you’re trying to remove the mascara at night.</p>
<p>Thrive Causemetics is “Beauty with a Purpose”: for every product purchased, they donate to help a woman thrive.</p>
<h3>Benefit Cosmetics &#8211; Roller Lash</h3>
<p>The curved skinny wand of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07167RSXS/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Benefit Cosmetics &#8211; Roller Lash</a> makes it best for lift and separation, especially if you have short lashes. It earns top marks for adding volume and length. It doesn’t flake, smudge or run and gives you soft-feeling lashes. The Roller Lash leaves the right amount on the wand, so there’s no need to wipe off extra or apply multiple coats, but it does tend to clump on lashes.</p>
<h3>BUXOM &#8211; Lash Volumizing</h3>
<p>The company touts the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K6MHGZY/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BUXOM &#8211; Lash Volumizing</a> brush as an hourglass shape, but our testers feel it functions more as an inverted cone (wider at the top and shorter bristles packed closely together at the bottom).</p>
<p>An hourglass shape is best for volume and lift, while an inverted cone gives you volume and length. Either way, our testers report that it doesn’t give enough volume, perhaps because there is too little product on the brush. What it excels at is making your lashes longer, darker and more lifted. It is durable and lasts all day without smudging or running.</p>
<h3>M.A.C. &#8211; In Extreme Dimension Lash</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004UY9HLA/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M.A.C. &#8211; In Extreme Dimension Lash</a> lost points for making lashes feel heavy and sticky, but it excelled in every other category. In fact, one of our testers was so impressed, she says she’s never using anything else again. The brush is extra long and the bristles are spread out so you can reach every lash. It has a ball tip to get root to tip coverage on each individual lash. On the flip side of all this praise, the M.A.C. is extremely difficult to remove.</p>
<h3>C&#8217;est Moi &#8211; Muse Mascara</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CKMCQJV/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">C&#8217;est Moi &#8211; Muse Mascara</a> is a top scoring natural mascara on EWG, meaning that the ingredients don’t pose any concern for you and the environment. The formula tends to be heavy, but it still leaves lashes soft. There’s no flaking or smudging, and it lasts all day.</p>
<p>The wiper leaves just the right amount of product on the applicator, but even though the brush separates lashes, the formula causes them to stick together again, and you have to work at definition.</p>
<h3>Dior &#8211; Diorshow</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/diorshow-mascara-P396240?skuId=1689744&amp;icid2=mascaras_bestsellers_carousel:p396240" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dior &#8211; Diorshow</a> has a pointed tip on a fat brush, so once you coat all your lashes, you can go back and focus on lengthening. It does leave a little too much product on the brush, so it doesn’t apply as evenly as we would like. We wouldn’t recommend this mascara for achieving volume or flexible lashes, but if you’re looking for definition (and don’t mind a floral scent), this could be a good choice.</p>
<h3>Buxom &#8211; Lash Waterproof</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008JVL7PE/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Buxom &#8211; Lash Waterproof</a> is an excellent runner up to our top pick for a waterproof mascara. It leaves lashes a little too much on the sticky and crunchy side to be our first choice, but it receives high marks across the board for even application, definition, volume and length.<br />
Like the other Buxom mascara we tested, it has an hourglass brush, but the waterproof formula delivers better results in terms of volume.</p>
<h3>Urban Decay &#8211; Perversion</h3>
<p>The fat brush and tight wiper of the <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/perversion-mascara-P387956" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Urban Decay &#8211; Perversion</a> gets just the right amount of product on the brush and applies evenly, but the formula leaves something to be desired. There is little definition, separating or lengthening. It does add volume and lasts all day, so if that’s a priority, you might still consider the Urban Decay.</p>
<h3>Benefit &#8211; They&#8217;re Real!</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/they-re-real-lengthening-volumizing-mascara-P289307?skuId=1343938&amp;icid2=mascaras_all_in_one_carousel:p289307" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benefit &#8211; They&#8217;re Real!</a> has a pointed brush for lengthening, and it really does an incredible job at giving you long, natural-looking lashes. If you were lucky enough to be born with lush lashes, it enhances them. If your lashes are on the shorter and sparser side, the Benefit makes them appear longer and thicker. It stays all day, but is difficult to remove at night. The other downside is that it tends to leave lashes slightly crunchy, rather than fluttery.</p>
<h3>Glossier &#8211; Lash Slick</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.glossier.com/products/lash-slick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glossier &#8211; Lash Slick</a> is fine if you want separation and lengthening, but don’t mind less volume and little definition. The tapered brush helps you get into the corners of the eye, and the wiper leaves the right amount of product on the brush for an even application. There is some slight smudging, and the mascara is less noticeable by evening.</p>
<h3>Hourglass &#8211; Caution Extreme Lash</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/caution-extreme-lash-mascara-P433809" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hourglass &#8211; Caution Extreme Lash</a> has a slightly fatter brush that coats your lashes with the right amount of formula. It applies evenly, but it doesn’t provide the definition, volume or length we are looking for. It has a tendency to smudge, and only lasts halfway through the day.</p>
<h3>Mineral Fusion &#8211; Volumizing Mascara</h3>
<p>The wiper of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CFQFG8/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mineral Fusion &#8211; Volumizing Mascara</a> is tight, so there is little product left on the brush, and it requires multiple coats. If you’re looking for volume or length, you’ll want to steer away from this one, as it leaves a lot to be desired in these areas.</p>
<h3>Too Faced &#8211; Better Than Sex Waterproof</h3>
<p>This brand was the first to come out with the hourglass-shaped brush, which gets every last lash and has been copied by other brands since its arrival on the market. However, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J4KYUJI/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Too Faced &#8211; Better Than Sex Waterproof</a> leaves a little too much product on the brush and therefore tends to smudge. If you want volume and length and can take a little more time to carefully apply your mascara, this is a good one.</p>
<h3>Maybelline &#8211; Lash Sensational</h3>
<p>One tester reported that despite passing the sensitivity test on her arm, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PFCT2R0/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Maybelline &#8211; Lash Sensational</a> irritated her eyes. The wiper is overly large and leaves too much product on the wand, which leads to an uneven application and clumping. It defines but doesn’t separate lashes. It adds volume and length and looks the same at the end of the day as when you first apply it.</p>
<h3>Too Faced &#8211; Better Than Sex</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J4KYUJI/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Too Faced &#8211; Better Than Sex</a> ran into a similar issue as the waterproof formula. Despite the volumizing effects of the hourglass brush, the wiper is too big. This leads to too much product, clumping and sticky lashes that feel crunchy when dry. We do love the staying power and big lashes this mascara gives us!</p>
<h3>Essence &#8211; Lash Princess False Lash Effect</h3>
<p>The best thing about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00T0C9XRK/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Essence &#8211; Lash Princess False Lash Effect</a> is that it doesn’t run, even with teary eyes. It didn’t make it as a contender for top pick, because it leaves too much formula on the lashes. One of our testers found she has to use her finger to get the lashes to separate. It clumps, flakes and doesn’t add enough volume or length to make up for the zealous amount of product.</p>
<h3>theBalm &#8211; Mad Lash</h3>
<p>If lifting is what you want, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D90BYKC/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">theBalm &#8211; Mad Lash</a> delivers with its curved brush. The product applies evenly, but you may need to go over your lashes a few times to get the desired look. It separates well, has decent volume and a good length. It leaves your lashes soft and isn’t heavy, but it does leave little flakes and can get on your lid pretty easily when applying.</p>

<h3>No7 &#8211; Lash Impact Ultra</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0743LTCP3/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">No7 &#8211; Lash Impact Ultra</a> left us feeling a little meh. Despite a tapered brush, this mascara does little to define or separate. It adds an okay amount of volume and length, but wears off by the end of the day and left our lashes looking droopy. The best thing we can say about it is that it doesn’t flake or smudge.</p>
<h3>CoverGirl &#8211; LashBlast Volume</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EMAM9BC/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CoverGirl &#8211; LashBlast Volume</a> has a plump brush with defined bristles, and delivers a little bit extra formula than you need. Because of this, it’s easy to get mascara on the top of your lid when applying but it doesn’t smudge once dry. It gives a little more volume than other drugstore mascaras, but doesn’t do much to lengthen or define. Our testers had to use the tip of the brush to separate lashes.</p>
<h3>Vivienne Sabó &#8211; Cabaret Première</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LYSCW6Z/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vivienne Sabó &#8211; Cabaret Première</a> is a good all-around mascara, although it adds more length than it does volume. It does not apply evenly, has a tendency to clump on the lashes and doesn’t stay put, so there’s some slight smudging throughout the day. In our ratings, this mascara earns an average of four out of five, but it doesn’t have the wow factor.</p>
<h3>Peter Thomas Roth &#8211; Lashes to Die For</h3>
<p>The wiper of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002Q52YKG/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Peter Thomas Roth &#8211; Lashes to Die For</a> could use some minimizing, as it leaves too much product on the brush, causing the mascara to smudge onto our lashes and cheeks. It defines lashes but doesn’t separate them, again because there is too much product. It adds a minimal amount of length and volume, but it does last most of the day.</p>
<h3>L&#8217;Oreal Paris &#8211; Voluminous Butterfly</h3>
<p>The purpose of the wing-tip applicator from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ISP83GM/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">L&#8217;Oreal Paris &#8211; Voluminous Butterfly</a> has an asymmetrical lash line shape to extend and lift corner lashes. It’s also supposed to volumize lashes by reaching the roots and stretching lashes outward, but our testers found it didn’t add any volume. They reported that it only adds a little length, as well. The primary benefits they found are definition and separation. It leaves lashes soft, lasts all day and doesn’t smudge.</p>
<h3>Lancôme &#8211; Définicils</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000UB23YK/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lancôme &#8211; Définicils</a> is overly enthusiastic with its delivery of product, so it does not apply evenly and leaves lashes somewhat crunchy. It has good longevity and stays where it should, but doesn’t do much in the first place to add volume, definition or length.</p>
<h3>AsaVea &#8211; 4D Silk Fiber Eyelash</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L6MWWZL/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AsaVea &#8211; 4D Silk Fiber Eyelash</a> has a tapered plastic bristle brush, so it applies evenly and separates fairly well. It takes a couple of coats to get the desired effect, but the end result is lengthy lashes with some volume and no flaking or smudging. It does have a sticky feel upon application and is slightly crunchy when dry. Like our other fiber mascaras, it is somewhat difficult to remove.</p>
<h3>Milk Makeup &#8211; Kush High Volume</h3>
<p>There was way too much product on the <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/kush-mascara-P429903" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Milk Makeup &#8211; Kush High Volume</a>, to the point where we had to wipe it against the tube. Because of this, it was difficult to apply and lashes clump. It smudges throughout the day for the same reason. The most disappointing part was that for all the extra formula, it does little to add volume or length.</p>
<h3>W3LL People &#8211; Expressionist</h3>
<p>If you’re going for a bare-faced makeup-free look, you’ll appreciate the slight enhancement of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O859WWU/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">W3LL People &#8211; Expressionist</a>. It leaves just the right amount of product on the applicator and separates lashes. Since it doesn’t add much volume, it doesn’t define them as much as it separates. Our testers reported that it is comfortable to wear until it starts to smudge (and it does), then it starts to feel sticky under your bottom lashes.</p>
<h3>Tarte &#8211; Lights, Camera, Lashes</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/lights-camera-lashes-P111902" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tarte &#8211; Lights, Camera, Lashes</a> does little more than darken lashes and tends to wear off by the end of the day. It leaves the right amount of product on the wand and applies evenly, but does little to separate or define. It adds minimal length and volume and flakes during the day.</p>
<h3>CoverGirl &#8211; Clump Crusher</h3>
<p>The curved brush of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0094GHKFE/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CoverGirl &#8211; Clump Crusher</a> makes it good for lifting, and it’s great at applying evenly and giving lashes definition. It doesn’t add volume or length, so it’s a better mascara for those who want lift and a natural look. You may be able to get a little more effect with multiple coats, as the wiper is tight and leaves little product on the brush.</p>
<h3>Marc Jacobs Beauty &#8211; O!Mega Lash Volumizing</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/o-mega-lash-volumizing-mascara-P387034" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marc Jacobs Beauty &#8211; O!Mega Lash Volumizing</a> doesn’t really do much for us in any of the metrics we considered. It delivers the right amount of product, but is just moderate across the board: length, volume and definition were not what we anticipated. The formula is heavy and leaves lashes crunchy when dry. The good news is that it’s easy to remove.</p>
<h3>Maybelline &#8211; Full N&#8217; Soft Waterproof</h3>
<p>Our testers report that the brush of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004OT29MA/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Maybelline &#8211; Full N&#8217; Soft Waterproof</a> feels cheap and flimsy. It delivers the right amount, but you have to use multiple coats for any effect. It doesn’t define or separate unless you use the tip of the brush. It doesn’t feel heavy or sticky, but it won’t last you all day, either.</p>
<h3>IT Cosmetics &#8211; Superhero</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/superhero-elastic-stretch-volumizing-mascara-P411396" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IT Cosmetics &#8211; Superhero</a> was the lowest rated of the mascara finalists we tested. It delivers too much product, so the lashes end up stuck together rather than defined or separated. They feel crunchy when dry, as well. It does add a lot of volume, but very little length.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>We all want something specific when it comes to our lashes, be it a higher lift or longer lashes. However, the <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/eyes-to-kill-mascara-P393671" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giorgio Armani &#8211; Eyes to Kill</a> is a real crowd pleaser and caters to a wide demographic with its ability to volumize, define and lengthen lashes. We consider it a one-size-fits-most mascara with mass appeal, especially since it has enough longevity to last from dawn to dusk and is still easy to remove.</p>
<p>For those who need more staying power, the <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/diorshow-waterproof-mascara-P99901" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dior &#8211; Diorshow Waterproof</a> is our recommendation. The hourglass shape gives you volume and length for bold, stunning lashes that stay coated through rain, sweat or tears.</p>
<p>If there’s one beauty item you don’t need to splurge on to look good, it’s mascara. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ADRGV26/?tag=ybdlash-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neutrogena &#8211; Healthy Lengths</a> proves this point by defining lashes and adding volume almost as well as its designer competition. Despite its name, it adds more definition than length, but it is without a doubt the mascara you’ll want to grab the next time you’re in the beauty aisle of your local drugstore.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After three months of testing against beard trimmers and electric shavers, the Philips- OneBlade is our pick for keeping stubble perfectly groomed.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter three months of head-to-head testing with beard trimmers, electric shavers and conventional razors, the OneBlade is our pick for keeping a stubble-beard at a perfect balance between scruffy and groomed. It might be a good choice as a shaver if you don&#8217;t need smooth results, and it does double-duty with body hair attachments.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078BDHV9P/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips – OneBlade Face + Body</a> has a unique blade design, one of the only successful new designs since motorized hair clippers were invented. Rather than just making a row of v-shaped shears sliding against each other, Philips took the one-dimensional trimmer concept and made a new blade that cuts on both edges.</p>
<p>These are also much thinner blades than most clippers have, so you can cut very close to the skin without risking scratches from the tips of the blade. This means that you get real contrast between areas you want to look clean and areas where you want to leave some scruff.</p>
<p>The downside to this blade design is that you can&#8217;t sharpen the blades. Once they stop cutting effectively, you need to buy a replacement blade unit. They cut well for four months with most hair types.</p>
<p>Like most new electric shavers, the OneBlade is completely waterproof. That makes cleaning easy, and you can shave, trim your beard or groom your body hair in the shower. The Lithium-Ion battery in this upgraded model also lasts for a long time.</p>

<p>The Philips &#8211; OneBlade is the first successful attempt at an electric device that can be both a good hair trimmer and a good electric razor. These technologies have been around for nearly a century, and the OneBlade is a blend of the two mechanisms that performs both tasks.</p>
<p>The OneBlade is most similar to a hair clipper, but the OneBlade uses razor-thin plates instead of heavy, thick clipper blade plates. This means the edges can still cut close without scratching you with pointed cutting tips.</p>
<p>In many ways the thinness of the blades makes the cutting action of the OneBlade more like an electric shaver, where the distance between the moving blade inside and your skin is determined by a protective foil. The OneBlade doesn&#8217;t cut on the flat face of its head, though, just along the two edges.</p>
<h2>What about the other OneBlade?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JZ88HJ5/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OneBlade Core</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HBBR9FC/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hybrid</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GINTAP8/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesis</a> are a family of innovative single-edge safety razors from a high-profile Austin startup. That OneBlade brand is not directly related to the Philips-Norelco hybrid electric trimmer this review is about. But it&#8217;s still a product you should know about if you&#8217;re interested in shaving.</p>
<p>This other OneBlade is a company that set out in 2002 to design the perfect razor, and when the Genesis model launched in 2015 it was universally lauded as an excellent shave. Much like a modern multi-blade cartridge razor, OneBlade designed the head to pivot while you&#8217;re shaving to maintain the perfect angle with minimal practice required. OneBlade uses a single-edge disposable razor blade that you slide in through a carefully-engineered refill slot.</p>
<p>At $400, the OneBlade &#8211; Genesis isn&#8217;t for everyone, but the newer Core and Hybrid models swap in Tritan polyester for some of the steel parts, so they&#8217;re slightly easier to afford. The specially-made Japanese blades are far less expensive than Mach 3 or Fusion refills, but they&#8217;re still 75 cents.</p>
<p>We haven&#8217;t reviewed that OneBlade, because it&#8217;s the definition of a niche product. If you love heirloom-quality products that push the envelope of design and engineering, it&#8217;s worth looking at. But we&#8217;ve <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-safety-razor/">reviewed double-edge safety razors</a> that also give an excellent shave. They also use common double-edge blades, which are one-third the price even if you buy the fancy brands.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a close shave that doesn&#8217;t require buying $4-a-week cartridges, these razors are all good options; some require more practice, some cost more. The electric OneBlade from Philips takes for granted a different set of needs, which is why we&#8217;re writing this review.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested the OneBlade</h2>
<p>Our resident shaving enthusiast gave his straight and safety razors a break for almost six months while he tested beard oil, beard trimmers and electric razors. The OneBlade was part of our lineup of beard trimmers, but it&#8217;s unique enough that we felt it deserved a separate review.</p>
<h3>Closeness</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/closeness.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>In the course of his time with all the different shaving products, our tester would compare different devices back to back, even taking extra passes after a shave to see if leftover stubble could be picked up by a superior device. That gives a relative ranking of better or worse when comparing minute differences between similar shavers, but we needed a real scale to show differences between trimmers, shavers and razors.</p>
<p>Putting our tester&#8217;s face under a microscope or trying to measure hairs with a micrometer is impractical. We came up with an easier and more relatable way to compare the OneBlade with other shavers: <b>We can compare the feel of the leftover stubble after shaving with these devices based on the time it takes to get similar stubble feel from hair that grows out after a smooth blade shave.</b> Hair growth rates aren&#8217;t universal, of course, so this isn&#8217;t a measurement that will translate to another person, but it&#8217;s one way to evaluate differences between shaving methods.</p>
<p>The OneBlade leaves about the same amount of stubble as our tester can feel after 18 hours of growth. A good beard trimmer like the Wahl will only trim down to something like 48-hour stubble, while a top-class electric razor like the Panasonic can get almost as close as a blade shave, usually about the same difference as five-hour growth.</p>
<p>The variability in this kind of measurement is high. If you take your time and learn the growth patterns in your hair you&#8217;ll get a better shave with any method than when you&#8217;re rushing.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re using a waterproof shaver like the OneBlade, making a wet shave part of your morning routine can also take closeness to another level by ensuring that the hairs are standing up as straight as possible. We covered the essentials of wet shave gear in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-shaving-brush/">shaving brush review</a> and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-shaving-cream/">shaving cream review</a>.</p>
<h3>Ingrown hairs and razor bumps</h3>
<p>A problem with ingrown hairs after shaving, often called razor bumps, has the clinical name pseudofolliculitis barbae. This condition primarily affects curly hair. If it&#8217;s shaved below the skin, the sharpened point on a curled or bent hair can start growing out under the skin and cause inflammation, infection or even scarring.</p>
<p>Razor bumps are a much, much bigger problem than just discomfort. It&#8217;s not an isolated problem, either: The <a href="https://www.aocd.org/page/pseudofolliculitisb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Osteopathic College of Dermatology says</a> this condition affects about 60% of African-American men, but it can be a problem for anyone with curly hair.</p>
<p>Alternatives to shaving like depilatory &#8220;shaving powder&#8221; or other forms of hair removal seem drastic, but when the alternative is scarred-over bumps it&#8217;s no wonder people will try extreme measures.</p>
<p>Keeping pores clean is one way to prevent infections, so a clean razor, good preparation routines and post-shave can help, but keeping the hair from curling under the skin is the only way to fully prevent bumps.</p>
[table id=249 /]
<p>Our tester is fortunate not to suffer from ingrown hairs — if anything, his problem is the opposite, with hair growth patterns that are tricky to cut close. But we checked hundreds of reviews from a half-dozen retailers and other sources to see if there were any reports of ingrown hair problems the way there are with razors.</p>
<p>We couldn&#8217;t find any account of razor bumps from using the OneBlade. Irritation, yes, but not bumps. This seems to be as close as you can shave without risking razor bumps. In comparison, many rotary-type and foil shavers can be almost as bad for ingrown hairs as a blade-shave is.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got curly hair, it&#8217;s probably on the thicker side, too, so you may need to replace the OneBlade heads more frequently than other folks. Philips recommends a replacement every four months.</p>
<h3>Irritation</h3>
<p>Unlike razor bumps, irritation is a fairly easy problem to solve. The OneBlade gives a fairly irritation-free shave, relative to other methods, but you&#8217;ll still need to get used to it. Shaving close with the OneBlade requires going against the grain and laying the blade head flat against your skin, so if you&#8217;re pushing too hard you can still get redness.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got skin that&#8217;s especially prone to razor burn, the OneBlade can be used wet. We tried with the winning products from our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-shaving-cream/">shaving cream review</a>, and the slickness of a dense lather definitely helped the OneBlade glide more smoothly. You could also use a light oil for similar results, though clean-up isn&#8217;t as easy that way.</p>
<p>Compared to a good electric shaver, the OneBlade is about equivalent in terms of irritation. It&#8217;s much less irritating than a zero-gapped clipper blade, which can actually scratch your skin if you&#8217;re not careful.</p>
<h3>One trimmer for face and body hair</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/face-and-body.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>If you need a close trim on body hair (whether for swimming, cycling or personal comfort) you may have considered an electric shaver for a smoother result. If you use a foil shaver for body hair, though, you&#8217;re probably not going to want to use it anywhere else. Even if you can clean it with antiseptic.</p>
<p>The Face + Body version of the Philips &#8211; OneBlade comes with two spare blades, and along with a set of stubble and short beard combs it also has two comb attachments specifically to help you with trimming body hair. <strong>This means that you can keep your body-grooming attachments totally separate from your face-grooming attachments, but you get the same close trim everywhere.</strong></p>
<p>Most guys who try &#8220;man-scaping&#8221; are just looking for clean results without risking nicks in sensitive areas, and that&#8217;s where OneBlade excels. In our testing, we didn&#8217;t find a way to get nicks in sensitive areas — you still need to pay attention, but it&#8217;s a safe grooming tool. It also pulls less on thin body hair than foil shavers do.</p>
<p>If you need totally-smooth results like you would get from a razor, or if your hair is especially tough, the OneBlade might not be good enough. Our favorite body hair grooming tool overall is still the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H41JQVR/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bodygroom trimmer and shaver</a>, also from Philips. Check out our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-body-hair-trimmer/">review of body hair trimmers</a> for all the details.</p>
<p>The Bodygroom will shave closer than the OneBlade, and tickles a little bit less. The trimmer side of the Bodygroom will also handle thick, dense hair better. It&#8217;s a bigger, more expensive and more complicated tool, though.</p>
<h3>Charging and battery life</h3>
<p>The OneBlade charger and battery system are very good. We tested the upgraded Face + Body version, which has a Lithium-Ion battery rated by the manufacturer for 60 minutes of use. In our tests it ran for three hours with no load.</p>
<p>Compared with other older Philips nickel-metal hydride batteries, and all but the very biggest beard trimmer batteries, that&#8217;s a great result. It also charges more quickly than budget-priced cordless trimmers, and the charger is dual-voltage for international use with a converter.</p>
<p>Your biggest problem might be losing track of the charger, since you can probably go for two weeks of daily use without needing it.</p>
<h3>Maintenance costs</h3>
[table id=250 /]
<p>If you think about every purchase as an investment, you&#8217;re probably wondering about the replacement blade costs for the OneBlade. As you might expect, the blades can only be purchased from Philips/Norelco, and they&#8217;re not exactly cheap.</p>
<p>Given a three-year expected battery life and four months of blade life, using the OneBlade every day for six years (which includes buying a replacement unit after three and a half years) will cost you almost $250 total. That&#8217;s about $100 less than a premium electric shaver, and less than a quarter the cost of buying new Gillette five-blade razor cartridges every week.</p>
<p>The long-term cost of the OneBlade shouldn&#8217;t scare you off if it does what you need, since this is a unique combination of trimmer and shaver. But blades for a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-safety-razor/">double-edge safety razor</a> are still by far the most economical way to shave at less than 25 cents for a premium blade.</p>

<p>The Philips Norelco OneBlade is a design that&#8217;s going to be best in a very specific set of uses.</p>
<p><b>The first ideal use-case is for people who can&#8217;t use a razor.</b> Mostly that&#8217;s if you&#8217;re worried about razor bumps. If you want a closer shave than hair clippers can provide, but not the closeness of a good foil shaver, the OneBlade is nearly perfect. Its blades don&#8217;t last as long as clipper blades, but they&#8217;re not as expensive as shaver foils.</p>
<p><b>The other case it&#8217;s perfect for is maintaining stubble.</b> With the short 1mm comb in the Face + Body kit, you can keep some slightly-scruffy face fuzz at a consistent length, but still clean up around the edges easily with the bare blade. All this with one tool.</p>
<p>Some argue that the perfect stubble-beard still involved shaving close below the jawline just in case someone wants to caress or nuzzle you there, but the OneBlade does a great job at keeping up appearances.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got thick beard growth and like the look of close-cropped 3/16&#8243; of growth, but not more, the OneBlade has a set of length attachments that will help you keep it there and clean up the edges.</p>
<p>If any of these situations describe your needs for facial hair grooming and you also trim your body hair, the OneBlade is a great do-it-all purchase. The fact that you can keep your armpit blade separate from your face blade is a great benefit of the replaceable blade design.</p>
<h2 id="did-not-like">What we didn&#8217;t like about the OneBlade</h2>
<p>The consequence is that the OneBlade is also missing some qualities of both systems.</p>
<p>If you have thick hair, the blade may not have enough mass or motor power to cut well. This is more of a problem when trimming or cutting off longer hairs than when shaving. The blades are also disposable, unlike clipper blades which can be sharpened.</p>
<p><strong>If you&#8217;re looking for a smooth shave, you&#8217;re also going to be disappointed by the OneBlade.</strong> Compared to a foil-type shaver, it&#8217;s just not possible to get that close. Electric shavers often use a lift-and-cut mechanism to pull hairs into the cutting edge.</p>
<p>At the very least, shavers allow you to press the protective foil into your skin, so stubby hairs pop through holes to be trimmed off right at the base. To get this close with the OneBlade, you&#8217;d have to press the row of cutting teeth into your skin — something Philips prevents with plastic guard teeth.</p>
<p>Electric shavers are already a compromise compared to the bare blades on a manual <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-straight-razor/">straight razor</a> or <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-safety-razor/">safety razor</a>, which cut with no protective gap or guard between the blade and your skin.</p>
<h2 id="other-versions">Other versions of the OneBlade</h2>
<p>We tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078BDHV9P/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">mid-tier “Face + Body” kit</a>; it has a much better battery and more attachments than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D328DH8/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">base model</a>. For $15 more, we think that’s a great deal, but spending around $40 more on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072DTDVMC/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OneBlade – Pro</a> isn’t quite as compelling.</p>
<p>The Pro features an adjustable guide attachment with a 10mm length, which brings it up to par with the rest of the trimmers we tested for mid-length beards, but the attachment isn’t as wide or sturdy as the guides bigger trimmers like the Panasonic have.</p>
<p>The Pro doesn’t come with the spare guides or blades that you can dedicate to body-hair use, which dampens our enthusiasm for it. You can buy those separately for about $30; you can’t buy a longer guide comb for the base OneBlade.</p>
<h2 id="other-shavers">Alternatives to the OneBlade</h2>
[table id=251 /]
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a trimmer that will help you with a beard longer than 3/16&#8243;, the Panasonic or Wahl trimmers from our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-beard-trimmer/">beard trimmer review</a> will give you the length guides you need.</p>
<p>The OneBlade is also not a good pick if you need a smooth-feeling shave. Our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-safety-razor/">safety razor review</a> has great picks for close shaves: The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YJ70NY/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Feather &#8211; Popular DE safety razor</a> is a good choice if you need a closer shave than the OneBlade offers but you want to minimize irritation. An even closer shave can be had with a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-straight-razor/">straight razor</a>, though they aren&#8217;t for the faint of heart.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s the time-saving of a dry shave you want, the Panasonic and Braun shavers that won our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-electric-shaver/">electric razor review</a> are also a good way to get a smoother shave than the OneBlade can achieve.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you just need to be technically clean-shaven but you’re not worried about the prickly feeling of stubble, the OneBlade is cheaper than an electric shaver and just as easy to use. If your hair is light enough, you&#8217;ll actually look clean-shaven; it’s a much closer shave than other trimmers.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in cultivating the look of stubble, this trimmer is ideal. The included length guides will help you grow out a tiny bit more fuzz in specific areas, and the bare blade will keep your neck and cheeks looking clean.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a body hair trimmer, the OneBlade isn&#8217;t strong enough for everyone&#8217;s hair, but for most it will do a great job.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We began our research by reading consumer reviews of the best deodorants available from major retailers like Amazon, Target and Walmart. We examined types of products available, online ratings, user comments and bestselling options. We also read a wide range of related health and beauty articles and blogs on the topic.</p>
<p>We identified four major deodorant categories:  antiperspirant, clinical strength, natural and spray.  However, it is possible for a single deodorant to be classified into more than one of these categories. For example, a spray can also be either a natural product or an antiperspirant, and clinical strength products are all antiperspirants, as well. We then narrowed our search down to four or five well-loved products in each major category — 17 finalists in total — and put them through side-by-side product testing.</p>
<h2 id="lineup">Compare the best deodorant for women</h2>
[table id=239 /]
<h2 id="types">Types of deodorant</h2>
<p>If you’ve ever wondered why the human body stinks and sweats, <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150330213947.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Science Daily</a> explains that “the smell is caused by bacteria on the skin breaking down naturally secreted molecules contained within sweat.” You could try to cover up the smell, stop the sweat or do a combination of both, but you need an effective deodorant and/or antiperspirant.</p>
<p>Deodorants fight body odor-related bacteria and cover up the smell. Antiperspirants limit or completely stop underarm sweating.</p>
<p>The difference between men’s and women’s deodorants is mostly in how they are marketed. The actual active ingredients are almost identical. Certain fragrances appeal more to men, but if you prefer the scent, packaging or price point of a men’s deodorant, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t give it a try.</p>
<p>No matter what type of deodorant you choose, keep in mind that deodorant is body-specific. People may react differently to the same product, and what works well for one person might not work at all for someone else.</p>
<h2 id="health">Antiperspirant health concerns</h2>
<p>Antiperspirants have been criticized in recent years for their active ingredients — specifically aluminum compounds — that  temporarily restrict the release of moisture from the sweat glands in the underarms.  These aluminum compounds are purported to be linked to breast cancer. Even though there is <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/breast-defense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no scientific evidence to support these claims</a>, many people switched from using antiperspirant deodorants to natural, aluminum-free products or stopped using deodorant altogether.</p>
<p>Some studies also suggest a possible link between <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/does-aluminum-in-pans-and-antiperspirants-lead-to-alzheimers-disease/2013/05/03/e2726998-ae75-11e2-98ef-d1072ed3cc27_story.html?utm_term=.ef94385a6154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aluminum and Alzheimer’s disease</a>. Overall, however, research is inconclusive.</p>
<p>A growing movement to go without deodorant has <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/What-Happens-When-You-Stop-Wearing-Deodorant-44660720" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pros and cons</a>. The cons are pretty obvious, but people who stop wearing deodorant claim that your body gradually adjusts and stops secreting excessive odor and sweat.</p>
<p>You’d certainly save money by not using deodorant, and by reducing your use of plastics, you would help the environment as well. Of course, you could also smell nice and be eco-friendly by looking into <a href="https://www.lushusa.com/body/deodorants-and-dusting-powders/teo/00433.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7_WL-NCv4QIVlRh9Ch30mA9DEAAYASAAEgIElfD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plastic-free deodorant options</a>.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>As reported by <i>The Washington Post</i>, deodorant is an $18 billion-a-year industry<i>. </i>There is an overwhelming range of products on the market, and you should consider several important features before purchasing the one that’s right for you.</p>
<h3>Odor control</h3>
<p>For most people, controlling body odor is key. While aluminum compounds reduce sweat, other deodorant ingredients specifically fight odor-causing bacteria. Antibacterial ingredients — like alcohol or triclosan — are both effective options. Artificial and natural fragrances are also used to mask unpleasant smells.</p>
<h3>Wetness control</h3>
<p>If you’re concerned about controlling underarm moisture from sweat, we’d recommend a product containing an aluminum-based antiperspirant. These ingredients are listed under “Active Ingredient” on product labels and include aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY, aluminum chlorohydrate and aluminum zirconium octachlorohydrex.</p>
<p>You’ll also find a percentage of how much of the ingredient is used in the product. This amount varies. Clinical-strength deodorants offer the highest amount of active antiperspirant ingredients and, therefore, the highest level of wetness protection.</p>
<p>A couple of the clinical strength products we tested, for example, contain 20 percent of the active ingredient aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY, which is the maximum amount allowed by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for over-the-counter sale. All active ingredients found in antiperspirants are regulated by the FDA for safety. For comparison purposes, other antiperspirant deodorant solids that we tested range from 15.2 percent to 19.3 percent.</p>
<p>If you perspire heavily, a higher percentage of active ingredients will be more effective for controlling underarm moisture. The level of concentration is the key differentiator in antiperspirant effectiveness. Prescription-strength products, which are even stronger than clinical-strength ones, may also be of interest; consult your doctor to explore this option.</p>
<h3>Natural ingredients</h3>
<p>Many natural deodorants promote the use of mineral salts to provide odor and wetness control. These ingredients have not been scientifically proven to be effective; however, some individuals find them helpful. When it comes to effective control of body odor and wetness, we found that natural products simply aren’t as effective as antiperspirant deodorants.</p>
<h3>Initial scent</h3>
<p>The fragrance of the deodorant upon application should be considered. Do you like the way it smells and the way it interacts with your natural fragrance? Because this is a personal preference, it might be helpful if a particular product line has a variety of different scents from which to choose. You can then experiment with various scent options without risking any lapse in protection.</p>
<h3>Application</h3>
<p>The delivery method varies and includes solids, gels, roll-ons, sprays or creams. The style and shape of the applicator, along with texture of the product, can have an impact on personal comfort.</p>

<p><strong>Solids:</strong> A solid or stick deodorant is one common option. These deodorants are swiped onto the skin and go on the driest of any deodorant product but can leave small amounts of white residue on clothing. They generally come in small, plastic containers that can be tucked into a purse, glove compartment or office desk drawer for use away from home.</p>

<p><strong>Gels:</strong> These come in a similar style bottle to solids but are softer and wetter in consistency. To apply, you twist the bottom of the bottle to push gel through slits in the plastic top. Gels feel wet and often cold upon application, but because most gels are clear in color, they leave little to no residue on clothing.</p>

<p><strong>Roll-ons:</strong> Liquid deodorants are rolled on to the skin through a roller-ball top. They go on very wet, so users can easily feel exactly which areas have been covered. Most are clear in color and tend to leave little, if any, residue on clothing.</p>

<p><strong>Sprays:</strong> Most deodorant sprays come in aerosol containers. This type of deodorant goes on quickly and easily but tends to waste product by spraying beyond the targeted armpit and into the surrounding air. Aerosol deodorants can cause frostbite-like burns if held closer than six inches to the skin upon application. Although <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-aerosols-still-bad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aerosols no longer contain ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)</a>, they do contribute to asthma-inducing smog and global warming. On the other hand, they leave little to no residue on clothing.</p>
<p><strong>Creams:</strong> These are less common and tend to be natural, aluminum-free products. Creams don’t need extra ingredients to solidify them so the whipped consistency is more concentrated in fragrance than stick deodorants. Creams are  applied with your fingers and are more messy and less convenient than other forms.</p>
<p>When applying the various forms of deodorants, the most noticeable differences are whether it feels wet when you first put it on, how long it takes to dry and your own tolerance for this sensation. If you don’t like the wetness of roll-on liquids, gels or sprays, you’ll probably be better off with a solid.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid residue, you may prefer a roll-on, gel or spray. Individuals seeking the purest, most natural ingredients may want to explore creams.</p>
<p>Finally, note that clinical-strength products instruct application only at bedtime, and not immediately after showering, which might take some adjustment if you’re f used to applying deodorant at your convenience. The bedtime application is recommended, because as body temperatures cool at night, people sweat less. This allows the product to properly soak in overnight. The antiperspirant benefits of these products don’t wash off as quickly as the deodorant components do when you’re showering.</p>
<p><b>Longevity: </b>The length of time that a deodorant provides effective odor and wetness control might be an another important factor to consider. The longevity of each product will vary significantly based on the individual, activity level, timing of bathing, the weather and more.</p>
<p><b>Residue: </b>We all know how annoying it is to find white deodorant streaks on our dark clothing. Some deodorants also leave residue on lighter colored fabrics, and antiperspirants are often blamed for leaving yellowish marks on clothing over time. Certain common antiperspirants, such as aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY, react with sweat and cause such yellowing.</p>
<p><b>Cost: </b>Deodorant prices range significantly, from under $5 to over $25. Because it is a product that you’ll purchase regularly, cost may be a factor when making your decision. Be sure to look at the net weight of product contained when price shopping; some of the containers are significantly larger than others. Also, consider product waste when using aerosol sprays. Although they contain more product than other deodorants by net weight, you lose some to the surrounding air when applying.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Our 17 finalists were put to the test under a variety of conditions over a period of several weeks. During the testing period, the weather was pleasantly mild — typically in the low- to mid-60s during the day, and lower 50s at night.</p>
<h3>Odor</h3>
<p>Underarm odor was evaluated on a rating system of one (smells bad) to 10 (smells good). Scores were assigned at 3 different stages: initial scent upon application, over time (8 hours later) and after sweating under standardized conditions (always the same workout). These 3 scores were then averaged to create an overall odor control rating.</p>
<p>Our top performers that kept us smelling nice were antiperspirant deodorants <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006V7Y8Y/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Donna Karan &#8211; Cashmere Mist</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KG4JG2P/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; MotionSense</a>.</p>
<h3>Wetness</h3>
<p>Underarm moisture was evaluated on a similar rating system of one (wet) to 10 (dry). Scores were assigned at the same 3 stages as above: initial wetness upon application, over time (8 hours later) and after sweating under standardized conditions (always the same workout). Similarly, these 3 scores were then averaged to create an overall wetness control rating.</p>
<p>Our top performers for keeping sweaty underarms dry were antiperspirant deodorants <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KG4JG2P/?tag=ybddeo-20">Degree &#8211; MotionSense</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/BT00KRV6RU/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secret &#8211; Outlast Invisible Solid</a>.</p>
<h3>Application</h3>
<p>We evaluated deodorant application on a scale of one (poor) to 10 (excellent). This included comfort of the applicator shape, product smoothness, wetness of product upon application and any application-related restrictions. Of note, clinical strength deodorants had several restrictions: use before bedtime, apply only two clicks and don’t use immediately after showering.</p>
<p>This process resulted in our top choices for comfortable application being <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KG4JG2P/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; MotionSense</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GY2B6NS/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dove &#8211; Advanced Care</a>.</p>
<h3>Residue</h3>
<p>We tested all products for noticeable clothing residue by placing a couple of swipes or sprays on both white and black t-shirt fabric. We then examined these to see if any obvious residue remained, such as yellow on white or white on dark. In general, all roll-ons, gels and sprays left the least amount of noticeable residue.</p>
<p>Antiperspirant deodorants all left some residue and were about the same for each one. The softer, clinical-strength solids left the most residue when placed directly on fabric, but our tester noted that this consistency could easily be rubbed in upon actual skin application. A couple of the natural deodorants left significant, chunky residue, which our tester also noticed sticking to her underarms and clothing throughout the day.</p>
<h2 id="antiperspirant">Best overall: Degree &#8211; MotionSense</h2>

<p>Our top choice of antiperspirant deodorant, as well as our selection for best deodorant for women overall, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KG4JG2P/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; MotionSense</a>. This product combines a strong, sweat-stopping antiperspirant with a pleasantly scented deodorant, providing both excellent moisture and odor control throughout the day. We love the silky texture, well-designed applicator and relatively low cost. While Degree is a good option for all women, it is a particularly great choice for women with active lifestyles.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KG4JG2P/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree</a> swipes on very smoothly with a nicely shaped solid stick applicator and perfect consistency of product texture — soft enough to go on without any trouble or discomfort, but firm enough to not disintegrate into excessive residue that leaves a mess on your clothing. With a net weight of 2.6 ounces (74 grams), Degree has a pleasant bottle shape and a comfortable grip.</p>
<p>We tried the Sexy Intrigue scent, which blends jasmine, rose, amber and vanilla, achieving a light, feminine, seductive result. The Degree MotionSense product line also comes in a variety of other appealing fragrances that includes Fresh Energy, Shower Clean and Daisy Fresh.</p>

<p>Degree offers excellent odor- and wetness- control and performs well even under heavy sweating conditions. This is likely due to the active ingredient aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY, which is notable at 19.2 percent. This is only 0.8 percent less than the clinical-strength deodorants we tested that had this same ingredient. In other words, you are receiving nearly the same antiperspirant protection that clinical-strength deodorants offer for less than half the price.</p>
<p>Also, unlike clinical strength deodorants, there are no restrictions to when and how much to apply, or how often you can use it. Degree can be applied liberally or reapplied any time you need extra protection, such as before hitting the gym or after showering.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KG4JG2P/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree</a> may be particularly helpful for active individuals. The company explains that their MotionSense technology involves unique microcapsules that sit on the surface of your skin. When friction from movement breaks these up, additional fragrance is released. In other words, the more you move, the more it protects you from unpleasant body odor.</p>
<p>In terms of cost, Degree is one of the most reasonably priced products of all 17 finalists.</p>
<p>While a couple of our other antiperspirant deodorant finalists, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006V7Y8Y/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Donna Karan &#8211; Cashmere Mist</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/BT00KRV6RU/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secret &#8211; Outlast Invisible Solid</a>, were also strong competitors, Degree &#8211; MotionSense was outstanding overall in its odor- and wetness-control, smooth texture, comfortable applicator and nice fragrance.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Degree &#8211; MotionSense provides excellent odor and wetness protection.</li>
<li>This product performs well for both daily living situations and for strenuous exercise.</li>
<li>Degree contains the highest level of active antiperspirant ingredient, aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY (19.2 percent), of the non-clinical-strength deodorants we tested.</li>
<li>We love the Sexy Intrigue fragrance, but there are several other options to try!</li>

<p>We’re not convinced that clinical-strength deodorants are worth the extra cost and application hassle for their slight advantage in antiperspirant protection. However, if you struggle with excessive perspiration, you may appreciate that advantage. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BEUPVXQ/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secret &#8211; Clinical Strength Soft Solid</a> performed well in both the odor and wetness control categories. It also has a nice floral scent and the smoothest applicator of all clinical-strength products we tested.</p>
<p>Although clinical-strength products are fairly comfortable to apply, application directions are too restrictive for little, if any, performance benefit. Instructions require bedtime application, not applying directly after a shower and using a mere two clicks of product. Also, the softer style solid generally felt wetter initially than a traditional solid, which we didn’t care for.</p>
<p>The product directions for Secret &#8211; Clinical Strength Soft Solid state to apply two clicks of product to underarms at bedtime, which is funneled out through slits across the top of the deodorant stick. This was also the case with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CHJUJTO/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; Women Clinical Protection</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008VT05JS/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dove &#8211; Clinical Protection</a>, though the shape of the openings on Secret helped the product go on a little more evenly.</p>

<p>Secret&#8217;s fragrance, Clean Lavender, is light and pleasant. However, upon showering the next morning, the deodorant portion of the product washed off. That said, no particularly bad odor was noted that day, and wetness was well controlled even during a workout.</p>
<p>The active ingredient in Secret is aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrex GLY (20.0 percent), which is similar to the active ingredient aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GYL (20.0 percent ) in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CHJUJTO/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; Clinical Strength</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008VT05JS/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dove &#8211; Clinical Strength</a>.</p>
<p>Both of these active ingredients, along with all aluminum compounds found in antiperspirants, are regulated by the FDA. Twenty percent of both aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrex GYL and aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GYL is the maximum allowable amount for over-the-counter sale. Without a prescription, you will not find a stronger antiperspirant.</p>
<p>Not only are these ingredients effective for underarm moisture control, they have also been shown to cause less skin irritation than other aluminum-based antiperspirants like aluminum chloride and aluminum chlorohydrate.</p>
<p>Although it is the most expensive of the four clinical strength options tested, it is also the largest container, with a net weight of 2.6 ounces (73 grams).</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The product provides effective odor and wetness control, though the deodorant scent may be washed off sooner than you’d like, depending on when you shower.</li>
<li>As with all clinical-strength deodorants, a very small amount of Secret should be applied at bedtime only.</li>
<li>Secret &#8211; Clinical Strength is more expensive than other options, but you get more deodorant.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our foray into natural deodorant product testing had us feeling a little dubious, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RSVP6PS/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Native</a> quickly caught our attention as being vastly superior to other natural deodorant products. Its sweet, tropical scent and smooth consistency stood out among deodorants, particularly within this category. Native is an excellent choice for anyone who wants to avoid aluminum-based antiperspirants and still maintain effective deodorant protection.</p>
<p>First of all, we noted that it has a significant following online, with over 3,000 highly favorable reviews for each scent offered at Target. Native is free of aluminum, dyes, parabens, sulfates, and the company never experiments on animals.</p>
<p>Native excelled at smoothness of application. The texture felt surprisingly similar to our favorite deodorant overall, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KG4JG2P/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; MotionSense</a>. Other natural deodorants were either too chunky, too hard or too wet. Native, on the other hand, was just right.</p>

<p>We really liked the sweet, tropical Coconut &amp; Vanilla scent, but a few other fragrances are also appealing, such as Lavender &amp; Rose, Eucalyptus &amp; Mint and Jasmine &amp; Cedar. Relative to other natural deodorants tested, Native did a decent job of protecting against body odors throughout the day. Unfortunately, it didn’t hold up too well to a vigorous workout and was in large part just sweated off.</p>
<p>Of course, one of the best natural ways to stay smelling nice is to shower regularly. Check out our reviews for the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-shower-head/">best shower head</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019QYK8WK/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; MotionSense Dry Spray</a> is packaged in a well-designed bottle, offers a fun, sporty scent and provides good wetness and odor protection. If you’re a fan of aerosols, you might want to give it a try.</p>
<p>While we wouldn’t say it goes on instantly dry as indicated, it didn’t seem any wetter than most typical solid sticks and dried quickly. Although Degree &#8211; Dry Spray certainly protected against odor and moisture, it generally wasn&#8217;t as effective under sweat-inducing conditions as solid antiperspirant deodorants. This was true of the other spray products we tested. Degree claims a 48-hour antiperspirant, but we needed to re-apply it after working out.</p>
<p>Degree &#8211; Dry Spray&#8217;s bottle is easy to grip, but unlike most deodorants, it doesn’t have a pop-off top. Instead, the sprayer has a built-in lock feature that can be used, for example, when traveling. Generally, we found the quicker access of the capless style to be convenient and, one less thing to lose!</p>

You’ll enjoy its sporty Active Shield fragrance as you hit your daily workout!</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019QYK8WK/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Degree sprays on smoothly and evenly. However, when our tester followed its labeling instructions and sprayed it six inches from her skin, a fair amount of product sprayed the surrounding air space, just as the other sprays did.</p>
<p>One major benefit of a spray deodorant is that they leave less noticeable residue on either dark or white clothing. This was the case with all four spray products tested, and they were all comparable on the small amount of residue left behind.</p>
<p>The active ingredient in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019QYK8WK/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; MotionSense Dry Spray</a> is aluminum chlorohydrate (23.3 percent), a common ingredient in antiperspirants that has been used for decades. Aluminum in this form can be irritating to the skin, cause acne and aggravate <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-safety-razor/">razor</a> burn in some individuals. Fortunately, we didn’t notice any issues and were comforted that the FDA considers aluminum chlorohydrate to be safe in concentrations up to 25 percent.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Degree &#8211; MotionSense Dry Spray offers good odor and wetness control under most conditions.</li>
<li>It sprays evenly and leaves little noticeable residue on clothing.</li>
<li>The bottle style is easy to grip, and its built-in lock feature is convenient when you&#8217;re traveling.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Antiperspirant deodorants</h3>

<p><b>Donna Karan &#8211; Cashmere Mist</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006V7Y8Y/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Donna Karan &#8211; Cashmere Mist</a> smells heavenly and scored top marks for initial scent. It offers the perfect combination of cleanliness and sexy femininity, with just a hint of baby-powder undertones. It is effective as both an antiperspirant and deodorant, standing up well to both daily use and rigorous workouts.</p>
<p>However, it loses points in applicator comfort. The small, round shape isn’t terrible, but our tester definitely preferred the wider, more traditional shape of the other solids. Also, the cap is a twist-off style, as opposed to pop-off, which we found somewhat less convenient.</p>
<p>The biggest drawback is its price tag; it&#8217;s more than six times the cost of our favorite antiperspirant deodorant, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KG4JG2P/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; MotionSense</a>. While we find it a stretch to justify the expense, if you&#8217;re willing to shell out some big bucks, you will no doubt smell fantastic. Think of it as an antiperspirant deodorant combined with your favorite perfume.</p>
<p><b>Secret &#8211; Outlast Invisible Solid</b></p>
<p>We found that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/BT00KRV6RU/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secret &#8211; Outlast Invisible Solid</a> also did an excellent job for both odor and wetness control and held up well to the workout. It is comfortable and smooth to put on, and the scent —  Completely Clean — smells fresh and, well, clean. Secret’s active ingredient is aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY (19 percent), which offers nearly the same antiperspirant protection for wetness control as our overall winner, Degree &#8211; MotionSense.</p>
<p>Although we slightly preferred the fragrance, texture and bottle style of Degree, Secret is a strong competitor for best antiperspirant deodorant and a smart choice for your daily antiperspirant-deodorant needs.</p>
<p><b>Dove &#8211; Advanced Care</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GY2B6NS/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dove &#8211; Advanced Care</a> did the job decently enough, but nothing particularly stood out during testing other than its lovely, smooth texture. The fragrance we tried, Revive, was subtly fruity and perfectly pleasant. The product line also offers additional scents, such as Beauty Finish and Cool Essentials. Its NutriumMoisture technology is advertised to moisturize your underarms for softer skin in just three days, but we didn’t notice any difference,</p>
<p><b>Secret &#8211; Fresh Clear Gel</b></p>
<p>A reasonably effective option for anyone who dislikes any type of white deodorant residue on their clothing is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V5DH4ZA/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secret &#8211; Fresh Clear Gel</a>, which performed very well and left no visible residue on fabric. The applicator has a nice shape, and the product went on smoothly, although the gel initially felt cold and wet on the skin. The scent we tried, Boho Berry, was appropriately fruity.</p>
<p>This product didn’t hold up quite as well as the other antiperspirant deodorants in terms of odor and wetness protection. This may be because it uses a slightly different active ingredient, aluminum zirconium octachlorohydrex GLY (16 percent).</p>
<h3>Clinical-Strength Deodorants</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22288" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/non-winning-clinical-strength.jpg" alt="non-winning clinical strength deodorant" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/non-winning-clinical-strength-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/non-winning-clinical-strength-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/non-winning-clinical-strength-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/non-winning-clinical-strength-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/non-winning-clinical-strength-810x540.jpg 810w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/non-winning-clinical-strength-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/non-winning-clinical-strength-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/non-winning-clinical-strength-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/non-winning-clinical-strength-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/non-winning-clinical-strength-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/non-winning-clinical-strength-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/non-winning-clinical-strength-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/non-winning-clinical-strength-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/non-winning-clinical-strength-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/non-winning-clinical-strength-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/non-winning-clinical-strength-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/non-winning-clinical-strength-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/non-winning-clinical-strength-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><b>Degree &#8211; Women Clinical Protection</b></p>
<p>This deodorant has a nice, light scent — Shower Clean — and performed well overall on odor and wetness testing. It did leave quite a bit of residue on the materials test, but because of the soft consistency of the product, this didn’t seem like a major problem. When it came to actual wear on the skin, we didn’t notice any particularly alarming level of residue on our clothing.</p>
<p>Like our top deodorant contender, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KG4JG2P/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; MotionSense</a>, this product uses MotionSense technology: aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY, but with 20.0 percent instead of 19.2 percent. That doesn’t seem like much of a difference to justify paying nearly twice as much for a smaller amount (1.7 ounces vs. 2.6 ounces).</p>
<p><b>Dove &#8211; Clinical Protection</b></p>
<p>We almost couldn’t tell any difference between <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008VT05JS/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dove &#8211; Clinical Protection</a> and Degree &#8211; Women Clinical Protection. The applicator, consistency, packaging, ingredients and effectiveness of the product are virtually identical. Even the scent of Dove — Soothing Chamomile — smells similarly light and floral. One quarter of this product is composed of moisturizers to improve the feel of your underarm skin.</p>
<p>As with Degree &#8211; Women Clinical Protection, we felt that the slight antiperspirant protection benefit that one may receive from using Dove &#8211; Clinical Protection over a standard antiperspirant deodorant did not justify the significantly higher cost.</p>
<p><b>Certain DRI &#8211; Prescription Strength Clinical</b></p>
<p>The only roll-on of the clinical-strength deodorants tested, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JB1MUNI/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Certain DRI &#8211; Prescription Strength Clinical</a>, goes on wet and once dry, provides moderately effective wetness control. Unlike the other 16 products we evaluated, Certain DRI is unscented. If you have skin sensitivities to fragrances or want to wear perfumes alongside an antiperspirant, this might be a good option for you.</p>
<p>We did prefer, however, the deodorant component of the other clinical-strength products we tested, because upon bedtime application and until the next morning’s shower, they gave off a pleasant, floral scent. On the plus side, Certain DRI&#8217;s clear liquid left no residue on fabric.</p>

<h4><b>Green Tidings &#8211; All Natural</b><b>  </b></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EOB0042/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Green Tidings &#8211; All Natural</a> has a pasty, almost chunky consistency. It performed better than the other natural products in terms of odor control, but it didn’t last throughout the day. The Green Tidings applicator is small and round and generally not as comfortable as a traditionally oval-shaped solid. This deodorant felt gooey and left reside on both black and white material.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the fragrance is different than other deodorants: it has  a strong lavender scent like you might find in a scented candle. Its main ingredients are recognizable &#8212; tapioca starch, coconut oil and baking soda &#8212; and it&#8217;s non-toxic, vegan and free of gluten, aluminum, paraben and artificial fragrance. The company also offers a 100-percent satisfaction guarantee or a full refund.</p>
<h4><b>Schmidt’s &#8211; Natural</b></h4>
<p>The beautiful packaging and lovely scent options of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018K3ATKE/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Schmidt’s &#8211; Natural</a> made us really want to like it, but the stick was so hard and rough that it actually hurt to apply. It left the most residue — yellowish in color —  of all 17 deodorants we tested. Schmidt&#8217;s also wasn&#8217;t effective at controlling wetness and odor.</p>
<p>It does have a nice scent, however; we particularly liked the Bergamot &amp; Lime fragrance. Schmidt&#8217;s is quite similar to Native &#8211; Women, but is less effective and far more painful to apply.</p>
<p><b>Bali Secrets &#8211; Natural</b></p>
<p>Despite favorable online reviews, we’re having trouble seeing the point of wearing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012E9DMNQ/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bali Secrets &#8211; Natural</a> at all. First off, it was our least favorite scent of all 17 finalists — in fact, we disliked the smell of Original Essence so viscerally that we’d rather go deodorant-free. The harsh scent reminded us more of a cleaning product.</p>
<p>Next, the roll-on style goes on very wet and not as smoothly as you might expect. Its gritty consistency jammed up the small applicator and made easy application challenging. Any benefits it may have had for controlling odor and wetness soon wore off, and we felt sticky the entire time wearing it.</p>
<p>Bali Secrets is probably good for the planet — it&#8217;s made from seaweed extract and mineral salt — but that seems to be the only thing it’s good for.</p>

While we didn’t love the spray mechanism of this particular aerosol product, Secret was fairly effective in controlling odor and wetness throughout the day — probably as a result of the highest active ingredient level of all our sprays, aluminum chlorohydrate (24 percent). Like the other sprays, it goes on really wet, leaves very little in the way of residue and scents the air surrounding your armpit.</p>
<p><b>Dove &#8211; Dry Spray</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OIUBDLI/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dove &#8211; Dry Spray</a> also sprays on wet but dries quickly. We liked its light scent and sleek bottle design, but overall it just didn&#8217;t hold up as well, particularly after a heavy workout. The active ingredient is aluminum chlorohydrate (20.2 percent), which is a fair amount less than the more effective spray deodorants and was probably the reason we felt more sweaty.</p>
<p><b>Suave &#8211; 24 Hour Protection</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J5K4CJQ/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Suave &#8211; 24 Hour Protection</a> is another product that smells like baby powder. It didn’t spray on evenly, wasted a lot to the surrounding air and was only somewhat effective at odor and wetness control. Suave’s active ingredient is also aluminum chlorohydrate (19.1 percent), likely leading to less-effective antiperspirant control.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After weeks of immersing ourselves in the world of women’s deodorant, we&#8217;re confident that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KG4JG2P/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; MotionSense</a> antiperspirant deodorant will provide excellent odor and wetness control during both daily life and sweaty exercise routines. Its light and sexy scent, smooth texture, comfortable shape and relatively high concentrate of active ingredient make this product our selection for both best antiperspirant deodorant and best deodorant overall for women.</p>
<p>If you perspire especially heavily and  are more concerned with the antiperspirant component of a deodorant product, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BEUPVXQ/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secret &#8211; Clinical Strength Soft Solid</a> might be the way to go. Keep in mind that there are some application restrictions that may require changing up some long-time habits.</p>
<p>If you’d like to stick with all-natural ingredients and avoid aluminum-containing antiperspirants, try <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PGD49QV/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Native</a> natural deodorant. It’s fun, tropical scent will go a long way towards masking unpleasant body odors, and the smooth texture is one of our favorites to apply.</p>
<p>For those who prefer a spray deodorant, we found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019QYK8WK/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; MotionSense Dry Spray</a> a good option. It provides good odor and wetness control under most circumstances and is packaged in a nicely designed dispenser.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After weeks spent trying on the best magnetic eyelashes on the market, we found that the Lash’d Up - Natural "i woke up this way" are the only ones worth buying.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent weeks consulting a professional lash expert and testing seven top products to determine <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DXB4CMQ/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Lash’d Up &#8211; Natural &#8211; i woke up this way</b></a> is the best magnetic eyelashes product on the market.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We began our magnetic eyelash review by consulting online reviews from respected retailers like Amazon, Ulta, Target and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. From the get-go, frustration from consumers with the way these lashes were applied and looked was palpable. This was compounded when we began checking out beauty bloggers to get their thoughts on specific magnetic eyelash brands.</p>
<p>However, for every naysayer we came across, we also found bloggers happy about finding a product that freed them from traditional falsies. Often, bloggers would disagree about specific magnetic eyelash brands. Therefore, we picked eyelash brands that garnered the most positive support and conversation.</p>
<p>We also read up on other magnetic eyelash reviews from respected sources such as Elle and Today, and of course, scoured subreddits such as r/MakeupAddiction. We chose our top finalists based on which brands were leaders in the field and which had the most positive feedback from consumers.</p>
<h3>Discontinued Products</h3>
<p>We found that there was a lot of volatility on Amazon regarding magnetic lashes. Four magnetic lash brands we tested were discontinued on Amazon during the course of our testing. The quick appearance and disappearance of magnetic lash products could be a consequence of brands attempting to cash in on a trending product.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, we disregarded any magnetic lashes that had a low number of reviews or were removed from Amazon during the course of our testing.</p>

<p>We won’t lie to you. Applying magnetic eyelashes is no cakewalk. However, if you give yourself about half an hour and follow these tips, you can get the technique down.</p>
<p>There are plenty of magnetic eyelash applicators on the market. We tested the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0778P44J5/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rapid Vitality &#8211; False Eyelash Applicator</a> to apply our lashes. Also, many of our magnetic eyelashes came with a cheaper plastic version of this type of applicator. Neither of our testers found these applicators particularly helpful. Instead, we recommend using <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-tweezers/">tweezers</a> or using the technique described by the lash expert we interviewed, Janelle Friedman. Janelle is the CEO and founder of <a href="http://www.goodjanes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoodJanes Beauty</a>. “This tactic will help to prevent the lashes and magnets from moving too far from the lash line, ensuring they look more natural,” Janelle explains.</p>
<p><b>Step 1: </b>Apply black eyeliner prior to lash application for a smoother blend.</p>
<p><b>Step 2: </b>Line up the bottom lash under your lash line.</p>
<p><b>Step 3: </b>Position the top lash to connect the magnets. Align the top and bottom lashes with your index finger and thumb takes some getting used to, but our testers were eventually able to get the hang of it.</p>
<p><b>Step 4: </b>Apply mascara to blend lashes.</p>
<p><b>Step 5: </b>To take off magnetic eyelashes, place your lashes between your index finger and thumb, then rub your fingers together to gently separate the magnets.</p>
<p>Janelle also recommends investing in a triangulated mirror. These mirrors allow you to see your lash line from multiple angles, which can help take some of the frustration out of applying magnetic eyelashes.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Length of lash</b>: The majority of the lashes we tested were about three-eighths of an inch in length. This is longer than what most people need, but you can always trim your magnetic lashes to be a more manageable length. One of our testers preferred their falsies to be about a quarter of an inch long, while the other preferred a full-length lash. It is a matter of personal preference, largely influenced by your natural lash length and thickness.</p>
<p><b>Material: </b>Magnetic Lashes can be made from synthetic fiber, silk, human hair or mink. Our top pick was made of silk, which we thought looked pretty natural. While we liked the look of some of the synthetic lashes we tested, watch out for those with a plastic, unnatural shine.</p>
<p><b>Full strip or accent: </b>Before buying magnetic eyelashes, you should decide if you want a full strip of falsies or just an accent for your outer eye. We tested both types of lashes and found that accents can be a bit tricky to blend. So, our advice is to go for a full strip and then cut it to the width that works best for you.</p>
<p><b>Amount of lashes</b>: The more lashes, the more dramatic the look. In our testing, we looked for falsies that added some drama to our eyes but didn’t have people asking us if our eyelashes were real.</p>
<p><b>Storage case</b>: All of the lashes we tested were advertised as being reusable. Therefore, a good storage case is important to keep track of teeny-tiny lashes. We wanted a storage case that closes securely, and that has designated spots for lashes.</p>
<p><b>Durability: </b>The last thing anyone wants is for their lashes to pop a magnet the third time they wear them. We tested our lashes multiple times to make sure they were durable enough for multiple uses.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/lashd-up-clip.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We had two testers. One works professionally in the lash industry. She tried on each of our false lashes and answered questions about each lash’s application, material, look and fit. The other tester wore each of our top ranking lashes three separate times to find any possible durability issues.</p>
<h3>Application</h3>
<p>As we said before, applying magnetic lashes is not easy. It took both our testers, even the professional, a while to get the hang of it. <b>There was not much range in difficulty of application, as all of our finalists proved equally difficult to get the hang of.</b> However, one of our testers noted that the One Two Lash &#8211; Founder’s Lash and 3 Second Lash &#8211; Magnetic Eyelashes were a bit easier to apply because they only had one magnet per strip.</p>
<h3>Material</h3>
<p>Most of the lashes we tested were made of synthetic fibers. Our testers had problems with the unnatural, plastic shininess of  3 Second Lash &#8211; Magnetic Eyelashes, AsaVea &#8211; Magnetic Eyelashes and VASSOUL &#8211; 3D Magnetic Eyelashes. In particular, one of our testers said that 3 Second Lash’s product looked “like lashes for a Halloween costume.”</p>
<p>However, our testers were fine with the way the lashes of the Eylure &#8211; Opulent Corner and One Two Lash &#8211; Founder’s Lash sets looked, even though these were also made of synthetic fibers.</p>
<p>We were amazed to find out that the Ardell &#8211; Magnetic Lash Accent #001 was made of human hair, as our testers rated its material as just average looking. Our testers were particularly pleased with the silk lashes of Lash’d Up &#8211; Natural &#8211; i woke up this way, which they described as, “thin and natural looking.”</p>
<h3>Natural vs. dramatic looks</h3>
<p>While trying on our finalists, we asked our testers whether they would use each set for a day look or a dramatic night look. Lash sets that had a large number of long lashes were categorized as dramatic looks, appropriate for a night out or special event. Sets that had fewer lashes were labeled as natural day looks.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that lashes that work for a natural day look still require some mascara and curling to fully blend into your lashes. Day-look lashes also had to be comfortable enough to wear for eight hours straight.</p>
<h3>Fit</h3>
<p>Fit refers to how well the magnetic eyelashes hugged the natural lash line and how comfortable they felt on. This was the “make it or break it” test for our finalists. We had many problems with magnetic eyelashes not curving to the lash line’s natural curve.</p>
<p>Lashes that had two to three magnets per strip generally did a better job at curving along the lash line than those that had one magnet per strip because they had multiple points of contact to bend around. We found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DXB4CMQ/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lash’d Up</a> lashes, which used a two magnet system, had the best fit.</p>
<p>While our testers loved the material and lightweight design of the One Two Lash &#8211; Founder’s Lash, they were unimpressed by the one magnet per strip design, which stuck out too far from the natural curved lash line. The three-second lash also used only one magnet per strip and scored low with our testers.</p>
<p>We were surprised to find that a secure fit was not a big issue for any of our lashes. None of our finalists fell off during the course of testing, even when testers shook their heads or jumped up and down. However, lashes with more magnets felt more secure in general.</p>
<p>Some lashes were a little too wide for our tester’s eyes. This can be easily fixed by trimming off excess lash at the inner corner. Therefore, we did not dock any of our finalists for being too wide.</p>
<h3>Reusability</h3>
<p>All of the lashes we tested were advertised as reusable. However, the reality of being able to reuse teeny-tiny lashes depends largely on having a handy, secure container for them.</p>
<p><b>The best holders by far were the sturdy plastic boxes of the </b><b>One Two Lash: Founder’s Lash</b><b> and the </b><b>3 Second Lash &#8211; Magnetic Eyelashes</b><b>, which were truly handy and easy to keep track of. </b></p>
<p>The Ardell &#8211; Magnetic Lash Accent #001 did not come with a holder, only the cheap plastic tray and cardboard box it came in. We thought that this made these lashes very easy to lose.</p>

<p>Our testers thought that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DXB4CMQ/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Lash’d Up &#8211; Natural &#8211; i woke up this way</b></a> magnetic lashes stood out from the pack because of their ability to curve to your natural lash line. These were the best magnetic lashes we found for all-day looks because of their lightweight design and natural appearance.</p>
<p>These lashes use one full-eye-length top strip with two magnets and two shorter bottom pieces that have one magnet apiece. These strips are pliable enough to be curved along your natural lash line using the two magnets at the inner and outer eye as anchors. Both our testers agreed that the Lash’d Up lashes were easier to get closer to the natural lash line and felt more comfortable than any of our finalists.</p>
<p>The Lash’d Up’s fit makes blending these lashes into your natural lashes much easier because the magnets don’t stick out too far from your eye. However, we still recommend using black eyeliner before application (and mascara after putting on your magnetic lashes) to fully blend them with your natural lashes.</p>

These lashes have two magnets per strip and are extremely flexible, which helps them curve close to your natural lash line.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DXB4CMQ/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Lash’d Up’s lashes are one of the shortest we tested, measuring only about a quarter of an inch in length. The majority of our finalists measured about three-eighths of an inch. The shortness of Lash’d Up’s lashes help give them a more natural curl and overall look.</p>
<p>These silk lashes also have a more natural look because there are fewer lashes in this set than most of our other finalists. This also makes these lashes very lightweight and comfortable to wear. One tester even thought you might forget you had these lashes on after a while.</p>
<p>One downside: The holder for your Lash’d Up lashes is very minimal — just a cardboard box with a plastic tray that slides out. This cardboard box already started breaking during our testing. We fear that it would completely fall apart if you were traveling. We wish Lash’d Up would invest in a more secure carrying case to ensure these lashes don’t get lost.</p>
<p>These lashes were a midrange price of about $15. A few of our finalists offered two pairs of lashes for a similar price, but because of the superior fit and look of Lash’d Up magnetic eyelashes, we are not complaining. This a fair price for magnetic eyelashes that deliver where it counts.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Lash’d Up &#8211; Natural &#8211; i woke up this way</b> magnetic eyelashes are your best pick for a natural day look because of their comfortable fit and lightweight.</li>
<li>Our testers found that Lash’d Up’s dual magnets and flexible strips were better for getting in close to your natural lash line.</li>
<li>These lashes are easy to blend with your natural lashes because of their shorter length, natural curl and silk material.</li>
<li>The holder for these lashes is subpar, but for about $15 you can afford to get a backup set or a better case.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-finalists">Other finalists we do not recommend</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, we were disappointed in the quality and fit of the rest of our finalists. Magnetic lashes are a relatively new beauty trend. Therefore, we are still waiting for a solid competitor to Lash’d Up’s superior quality. We are not able to recommend any of our other finalists, as we discovered during testing that we cannot justify using them over traditional false lashes.</p>
<h3>One Two Lash &#8211; Founder’s Lash</h3>

<p>The most outrageous thing about the <a href="https://www.onetwocosmetics.com/shop/founders-lash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One Two Lash &#8211; Founder’s Lash</a> is the $70 price tag attached to it. While our testers appreciated the natural look of the lash material and their sturdy carrying case (easily the best of our finalists), they were overall unimpressed with the fit of these lashes.</p>
<p>These lashes come with four lash strips per eye. One for your top outer corner, lower outer corner, top inner corner and lower inner corner. Each of these half-length strips comes with one magnet. Our testers liked that these magnets had a handy marking system to keep track of which magnets connected. However, they found that this system did not work well for keeping lashes close to your natural lash line.</p>
<p>Our top pick used dual top magnets as anchors to bend the false lash to match the curve of the natural lash line. However because the One Two Lash’s top magnets are separated, this bending cannot occur. This causes a weird separation to happen between natural and false lash, betraying your use of falsies.</p>
<p>Therefore, despite the obvious quality of the carry case and lash material, we don’t recommend shelling out $70 for these poor-fitting lashes.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/3-second-lash-trade-magnetic-eyelashes-in-black/5011937" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">3 Second Lash &#8211; Magnetic Eyelashes</a> set came with three separate pairs of lashes, two natural looks and one dramatic look. All of these lashes used one magnet per strip system that was not able to hold the lash close enough to the natural lash line. Like the One Two Lashes, these lashes had obvious separation from the natural lash line that was a major problem with our testers.</p>
<p>Our testers also described the material of these lashes as extremely shiny and cheap looking. The dramatic pair included in this set was described by one of our testers as looking like a cheap Halloween costume.</p>
<p>The only upside to this lash set is that it comes with a sturdy carrying case that makes it easier not to lose lashes. However, with the terrible fit and quality of these lashes, you might not care if they get lost.</p>

<p>Our testers found it nearly impossible to blend the dramatic <a href="https://www.ulta.com/magnetic-lash-accent-001?productId=xlsImpprod17631467" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ardell &#8211; Magnetic Lash Accent #001</a> with their natural lashes. These lashes simply have too many lashes to blend at all naturally as an accent lash. Even if you trim these lashes to a more reasonable length, the sheer density of lashes and magnets makes this accent stand out like a sore thumb from your natural lashes.</p>
<p>The Ardell lashes use a three-magnet system, which keeps lashes secure but adds to the visual weight, all located at the outer corner of your eye. Their material was also a bit shiny for our testers’ liking.</p>
<p>To top off this mess, Ardell’s lashes do not come with any decent storage. Putting them back in the cardboard and plastic box they came in is a pain and a mess.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07663DK66/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">VASSOUL &#8211; 3D Magnetic Eyelashes</a> are another hard-to-blend accent lash that frustrated our testers. These lashes were too shiny and thick to properly blend with natural lashes. Our testers also had issues getting the outer corner of these lashes close enough to the lash line.</p>
<p>This could be partly remedied by trimming the outer corner of these falsies closer to their outer magnet, but this still did not solve the glaring distinction between natural lash and false accent.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.target.com/p/eylure-magnetic-lashes-opulent-corner/-/A-53588324" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eylure &#8211; Opulent Corner</a> is also too opulent to blend with the rest of your lashes. In addition, these lashes are too stiff. So even though these lashes have a dual-magnet system, they do not bend enough to sit on your natural lash line. They sit too far down and in a completely straight chunk of dramatic eyelash on the outer corner of your eye — not the look anyone wants.</p>
<p>On the positive side, our testers liked the material of these lashes and the plastic carry case they came with. However, the terrible fit of these lashes makes them impossible to use for an attractive look.</p>
<h3>AsaVea &#8211; Magnetic Eyelashes</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KHBVIH6/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AsaVea &#8211; Magnetic Eyelashes</a> were a very similar story to the Eylure accent lashes. They had too many lashes, all localized in your outer corner, to blend with the rest of your lashes. Also, they too were very stiff, so they didn’t have any of the natural curve that keeps the falsies close to the lash line.</p>
<p>Because these lashes don’t curve along your natural lash line, separation occurs between the natural and false lash, especially near the outer corner of your eye. Our testers also commented that these lash’s material was too thick and shiny to look natural.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After spending over three weeks on our magnetic eyelashes review, we found that your best bet for a natural all-day-look magnetic lash was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DXB4CMQ/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Lash’d Up &#8211; Natural &#8211; i woke up this way</b></a>. What really separates Lash’d Up from the pack is their ability to curve close to your natural lash line, using a magnet at both your inner and outer corners. Our testers also like the more natural amount, thinness and curl of these lashes, which give an attractive look you could wear all day.</p>
<p>Our other finalists, despite having many good reviews, let us down. They did not sit close enough to the lash line and did not look natural enough to justify using them over traditional false lashes.</p>
<p>Our testers found that accent magnetic lashes, on the whole, did not look as natural as full-length lashes because they had more trouble curving with the natural lash line and many had simply too many lashes to blend.</p>
<p>If you want to try magnetic eyelashes, definitely go with the Lash’d Up &#8211; Natural &#8211; i woke up this way. Hopefully, in the coming year, there will be more competitors that offer the same quality as Lash’d Up. However, for now, there are a lot of lackluster magnetic eyelashes that do not sit close enough to the natural lash line to justify buying.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e asked a family to test and rank the performance of twelve highly-rated electric toothbrushes. After four months of daily brushing, plus controlled lab tests for power and battery life, we picked the sonic-action <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WWCX7GN/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greater Goods &#8211; Balance</a> as the best electric toothbrush. This value-priced model features soft bristles, top-tier performance and the best timer functions.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been going to regular dental checkups in the last decade or so, you&#8217;ve probably been told to buy an electric toothbrush. When our researcher asked his dentist which brand was recommended after a checkup a few years ago, he said very simply that they&#8217;re all pretty good.</p>
<p>/r/Dentistry provides some great discussion about the need for good technique even with a superior toothbrush. It&#8217;s clear that people tend to favor one of the two most popular brands — Oral-B and Philips — but that preference isn&#8217;t based on one obvious preference or another.</p>
<p>After reading reviews from sites like Wirecutter, Techgearlab, and Dentaldorks, it became apparent to us that the differences between brushes would be tricky to test. Consumer Reports, one of the most trusted institutions in unbiased product comparisons, has completely given up testing and recommending specific brushes.</p>
<p>The leading brands are easy to spot; they have TV commercials and YouTube celebrities promoting them. We were curious about up-and-coming contenders, though. There are dozens of other companies making brushes, but are any of them good? Our final list includes three best-selling underdog models that offer features that compete with the big brands.</p>
<p>After noting that heads on kid-specific models were mostly identical to the &#8220;sensitive&#8221; replacement heads made for the &#8220;big&#8221; adult handles, we decided to test brush systems that would work for a whole family rather than testing an entire “for-kids” category separately.</p>
<p>After eliminating obsolete models and closely scrutinizing reviews of the 23 most popular models, we narrowed that list to a set of 12 contenders that we hoped would provide a diverse range of test results.</p>
<p>We included an under-$10 AA-battery-powered brush mostly to calibrate our expectations for midrange brushes, and decided to spring for a pair of ultra-premium brushes just to see what that kind of money can get you.</p>
<p>We decided not to test subscription services this time around, mostly because the new kids on the block seem very similar to the big brands without actually competing on price. (Goby, for example, is more expensive than Oral-B, with fewer features.)</p>

<h2 id="sonic-vs-oscillating">Sonic vs. oscillating toothbrushes</h2>
<p>There are plenty of ways you <i>could</i> make a toothbrush work, from direct-drive gears to ionic plaque removal, but there are two popular types that are easy to find and proven to work:</p>
<p><b>Sonic toothbrushes</b> use a motor to move bristles very quickly with pulses of vibration, somewhere from 250 to 350 pulses per second. (The Sonicare Essence is a middle C at 261 Hz if you check it with a tuner.) A pulse is usually counted as both a back-and-forth stroke, so around 516 strokes per second (&#8220;31,000 brush strokes per minute&#8221;) is a common advertising claim. The vibrations definitely move the bristles, but less than a sixty-<br />
fourth of an inch to either side.</p>
<p><b>Oscillating toothbrushes</b> are almost exclusively made by Oral-B. Rather than vibrating like the sonic types, or spinning the brush head in one direction like a polishing tool, these heads spin in a back-and-forth motion that mimics very quick manual brushing. The brush head rotates back and forth about 125 times per second, with about a quarter-inch of brush movement each cycle.</p>

    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/action-comparison.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>So, which is better? <a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD004971/ORAL_different-types-of-powered-toothbrushes-for-plaque-control-and-healthy-gums" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cochrane Oral Health reported in 2010</a> that out of 17 trials with 1369 participants, they found no evidence that one type of brush was better than the other.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dentalcare.com/-/media/dentalcareus/research/pdf/triumph/biesbrockjclindenttriumphse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One 2007 study found</a> that the smaller Oral-B heads had an advantage over the larger heads used by Philips, while according to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25597787" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this review in the journal of periodontology</a> and <a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD002281/ORAL_poweredelectric-toothbrushes-compared-to-manual-toothbrushes-for-maintaining-oral-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another review by Cochrane</a>, some of the slight edge that Oral-B has in broad reviews of studies is probably because oscillating heads are tested more often.</p>
<p>Philips claims that their Sonicare system can dislodge and clear gunk (and even plaque) in places that a moving toothbrush bristle can&#8217;t. By all indications, it&#8217;s a system that works: The studies they&#8217;ve chosen to publish on their own site try to show that when you tally all the oscillating-vs-manual and sonicare-vs-manual results, Sonicare is slightly better at removing plaque and keeping gingivitis at bay.</p>
<p>The biggest differences, then, are going to be very personal. Some find the loud, rattling head on the Oral-B brushes to be annoying, while people with ticklish mouths may find the vibration of the sonic brushes unbearable.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Two-minute timer:</b> This is the most important feature of an electric toothbrush, arguably even more important than the motorized bristles. A two-minute timer will encourage most people to brush for the right amount of time, and if it&#8217;s built into the toothbrush you won’t forget it the way you might with an app or countertop timer.</p>
<p><b>Quad pacer:</b> This is an additional feature of better toothbrush timers: Rather than simply notifying you of when two minutes is up, a pacer tells you when you&#8217;ve spent 30 seconds on one quadrant of your mouth. When you&#8217;re using the coaching apps on your phone, Oral-B and Philips actually further divide this with separate timers for your front teeth and each side.</p>
<p><b>Pressure sensor:</b> This feature is designed to warn you when you&#8217;re pressing the toothbrush into your teeth and gums too much, a mistake that can cause gum problems like receding gumlines.</p>
<p><b>&#8220;Smart&#8221; coaching tools: </b>The most expensive brushes include features like a position sensor that tracks exactly how long you brush a particular part of your mouth. They&#8217;ll also track bad habits like excessive pressure.</p>
<p><b>Brush heads for braces: </b>Oral-B and Fairywill sell specialized tips for working around braces, bridges, crowns and other tricky spots. Note that most sonic-type brush makers claim you won&#8217;t special tips if you&#8217;re using a brush with sonic cleaning action, since it can dislodge some material even without direct contact. Which is the best electric toothbrush for braces? After testing a wide variety of types, we&#8217;re confident all of the sonic types work a little bit better than oscillating types, but beyond that there&#8217;s not much difference.</p>

<p><b>Heads for sensitive gums:</b> Softer bristles are better for nearly everyone. In order to get approval from the American Dental Association, brush heads have to use fairly soft bristles that will help avoid gum problems. We found that most of the heads shipped with electric toothbrushes are fairly soft, but the &#8220;sensitive&#8221; heads are also typically a little bit smaller, which we found makes them easier to get around back molars and other tricky spots.</p>
<p><b>Storage for brush heads: </b>In a few cases, the charging stand includes a place to keep spare brush heads. If you&#8217;re sharing a brush handle with a partner, or if your dentist advises that you use a specific accessory head in addition to a regular head, this definitely comes in handy.</p>
<h2 id="ada-seal">Is the ADA seal of acceptance an important feature?</h2>
<p>We looked at brushes listed as &#8220;approved&#8221; by the American Dental Association. They don&#8217;t list many brands, but that&#8217;s partly because it&#8217;s an entirely voluntary standard; a manufacturer has to submit their brush, then prove their marketing claims through expensive clinical trials. Electric toothbrushes only started showing up on the list in late 2017.</p>
<p>To get a direct comment on the real meaning of their list, we reached out to the ADA to learn more about the approval process and the difference between an approved and non-approved brush. They directed us to <a href="https://www.ada.org/en/science-research/ada-seal-of-acceptance/how-to-earn-the-ada-seal/general-criteria-for-acceptance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this page that lists the requirements</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;To qualify for the Seal of Acceptance, the manufacturer of a manual toothbrush must provide evidence that:</p>
<ul>
<li>All toothbrush components are safe for use in the mouth.</li>
<li>Bristles are free of sharp or jagged edges and endpoints.</li>
<li>Handle material demonstrates durability under normal use.</li>
<li>Bristles won’t fall out due to normal use.</li>
<li>The toothbrush can be used without supervision by the average adult to provide a significant decrease in mild gum disease and plaque.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike standards that have easily measured numbers attached to them, like efficiency rating for <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-window-air-conditioner/">air conditioners</a> or clean air delivery rate for <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-air-purifier/">air purifiers</a>, this is a fairly simple pass or fail.</p>
<p>When we asked the ADA if any toothbrush has ever been submitted that&#8217;s bad enough to fail, ADA content specialist Mike Bittern said, &#8220;The list of manufacturers that apply for their products to receive the Seal of Acceptance is confidential information the ADA does not share.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even that requirement to use clinical trials to show a decrease in gum disease is fairly loosely enforced: Oral-B, for example, submitted all of their brushes in one batch with a confusing array of studies to support them, while Philips only submitted one model (and not even their most expensive model).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s safe to assume that the &#8220;average adult&#8221; can get a significant benefit from using just about any toothbrush, seal or not.</p>
<p>If the ADA were making recommendations for a specific kind of electric brush mechanism, or approving a specific brush attachment, we might be inclined to weigh the ADA seal as a more important benefit. As it is, we didn&#8217;t let the lack of a seal stop us from testing or recommending non-ADA alternative brands.</p>

<p>One important question we set out to answer was &#8220;what&#8217;s the difference between a $20 toothbrush and a $200 toothbrush?&#8221;</p>
<p>We were expecting to see more in the way of specific claims and obvious quality differences, but that&#8217;s not what we found at all. The distinctions that set top-of-the-line brushes apart from lowly entry-level models are special touches, but most of them don&#8217;t translate to any difference in your oral hygiene.</p>
<p><b>Bluetooth connectivity</b> is one feature that stood out as carrying the biggest premium and also the least pay-off. Maybe the most significant difference you get with Bluetooth is toothbrush updates: There was every month for the Philips &#8211; DiamondClean; we can&#8217;t decide if that&#8217;s good or just annoying. Practically speaking, Bluetooth serves as a way for manufacturers to make sure you only get the high-end features of their system when you spend more money on a Bluetooth-enabled brush.</p>
<p><b>Position sensors</b> tell you what parts of your mouth you spend the most or least amount of time on. Sensors record in 12 specific zones only (right/front/left in top/bottom inside/outside) but that&#8217;s probably as many zones as we want to track anyhow. The position sensor also tells the app if you&#8217;re scrubbing back and forth too much instead of letting the motor do the brushing.</p>
<p><b>Brush head tracking </b>on the Philips brushes uses a tiny RFID chip on each brush head to help the toothbrush know when you&#8217;ve replaced worn-out bristles, and even to switch modes automatically if you buy a specific head for something like whitening or gum care. It&#8217;s nifty to automatically see all your brush heads in the app, but mode switching is pretty easy with the button and the colored indicator bristles already help you see when the brush is ready to retire.</p>
<p><b>Fancy storage cases and chargers </b>are probably the most obvious perk of buying a high-end brush. Oral-B gives you a place to put four brush heads on the 3000 and the 8000, and the 8000 also comes with a travel case with a USB charge port and smartphone stand built-in for using your app on the road. Philips gives you a decent travel case with the 5100 and all DiamondClean models, and the trademark drinking glass charging stand is standard for the DiamondClean line, but the travel charger and brush holders are reserved for the super-premium DiamondClean 9750 kit.</p>
<p><b>Countertop timers and coaching devices</b> used to be included in Oral-B&#8217;s high-end brush models, but they&#8217;ve been replaced entirely by smartphone apps. If you want a quad-timer display to visualize your brushing progress and pressure feedback without connecting a smartphone or tablet, you can still buy the old Oral-B SmartSeries 7000 for a small discount compared to the new app-only model.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>To find out how well they perform in real-world conditions, a family of three tested these twelve brushes for four months. They compared plaque removal, battery life, clever (and silly) design features, noise and vibration concerns, storage and charger options, and cost of ownership. They also compared Bluetooth-connected apps for the high-end brushes from Philips and Oral-B.</p>
<h3>Evaluating modes and features</h3>
[table id=178 /]
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, for most of us adding more modes to a toothbrush increases the confusion more than the value. The sad truth is that while extra control is nice, none of these features are really worth spending a lot of money on.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s our take on the common features that the big brush makers use to distinguish between their different price levels:</p>
<p><b>Pressure sensor:</b> This is the main feature you pay for in a $40 brush compared to a $25 brush. The pressure sensor will change the brush speed and flash a light to let you know when you&#8217;re pressing too hard.</p>
<p>In theory, this is a built-in coaching tool that helps stop you from wasting time or damaging your gums. In practice, we found it pretty easy to figure out how much pressure to use, and the pressure sensors that were calibrated to a lighter touch would always go off when brushing around the back molars.</p>
<p>We were a bit surprised to find out that if you bear down a little bit too much with the Greater Goods &#8211; Balance it will basically stop brushing. The manufacturer says that this isn&#8217;t intentional, but it works about as well as the pressure sensor on the less expensive Oral-B or Philips models.</p>
<p><b>Adjustable power levels and specialized modes:</b> More expensive brush handles in the $70 price range can change the speed or strength of their brushing action to deliver more aggressive (or more gentle) scrubbing.</p>
<p>Among brushes from Philips and Oral-B, you get more control when you pay for a more expensive brush. The $200 Philips &#8211; DiamondClean Smart has specific customization for the strength of vibration within every mode, and we&#8217;ll admit that level of control was appreciated while our mouths were getting used to the sonic tickle.</p>
<p>The biggest distinction among multimode brushes is how you switch settings: A dedicated mode button is simple and sensible, while brushes without the button (like the Oral-B &#8211; Pro 3000) force you to cycle through every mode even when you&#8217;re just turning the brush on or off.</p>
<p>Among lesser-known manufacturers, four or five modes is standard fare, even for a budget-priced brush. Since the major difference we found is comfort, we tried not to give excessive weight to the presence of these modes. The fact that Greater Goods included a mode switch, though, made it stand out.</p>
<p><b>Bluetooth and position sensors: </b>This is the feature that you really have to shell out for. On the most expensive brushes, a Bluetooth connection to the app allows the companion app to track where in your mouth you scrub too quickly or with too much pressure.</p>
<p>We were fascinated by the sophistication of this kind of record and a bit baffled about who would really benefit from all that information.</p>
<p>If a detailed record of how much time you spend brushing your inside-upper-left molars compared to your lower incisors is exactly what&#8217;s been missing from your life, Philips and Oral-B can both deliver. We liked the Philips app a bit more than Oral-B&#8217;s system, but they&#8217;re both capable.</p>
<h3>Cleaning Performance</h3>
[table id=177 /]
<p>We looked for ways to rank daily brushing effectiveness, but after our lead tester tried a few different methods to measure results, we started to realize that these kinds of raw performance tests aren&#8217;t really representative of what&#8217;s important about a toothbrush.</p>
<p>The most effective method for evaluating brush performance is to use dental disclosing tablets; this is basically bright colored dye that stains plaque and tartar on your teeth so you can see it. You&#8217;ve probably been through this routine with your dentist: Brush as normal, chew the tablet, and see what you missed.</p>
<p>The problem with using disclosing tablets to rank brushes is that the tablets demonstrate flaws in the brusher more than the brush. We found that the biggest difference between our test samples wasn&#8217;t that some brushes are better, but that our tester&#8217;s results got better over time with <i>every</i> brush as he started paying close attention to what he was missing.</p>
<p>We even went so far as to use acrylic model teeth and a piece of textured nylon to test the brushes in more controlled conditions. But the real lesson was a simple one: The best way to get cleaner teeth is to find out what&#8217;s missing with your current technique.</p>
<p>We need to be crystal clear on this point: You&#8217;re still going to need to practice with an electric toothbrush to get really great results. No brand or type of brush is a magic bullet, and if you&#8217;re expecting a brush to restore a receding gumline or whiten your teeth all by itself, you&#8217;re going to be disappointed.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, dentists have been repeating the same line to us for years: buy any electric toothbrush (seriously, it doesn&#8217;t matter which one) and use it for two minutes twice per day. If you want to maximize plaque removal, gum health or any other specific benefit, the most productive thing you can do is show your dentist how you&#8217;re brushing and get feedback on how to improve.</p>
<h3>Testing softness</h3>
<p>One of the two qualifications for a toothbrush to earn approval from the American Dental Association is that it needs to have soft bristles. The days of wire-stiff toothbrush bristles are over: Brushmakers are using the same nylon filament as before, but with thinner shafts for more flexibility.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a small trade-off here: More flex means less scrubbing and a shorter life before the bristles are worn out, but the reduced risk of receding gums is definitely an outcome we&#8217;re happy with.</p>
<p>We tested softness on ripe tomato skins and hard-boiled eggs. None of the toothbrushes damaged the tomato, but the sonic-type toothbrushes quickly started breaking apart the hard-boiled egg. Oral-B&#8217;s oscillating scrubbing motion should be more gentle on extra-sensitive gum tissue than the competing sonic-type brushes, but only barely. This also means they&#8217;re slightly less efficient at breaking up food between your teeth, but again, only barely.</p>
<p>The bigger concern for sensitive mouths will be ticklishness. If the idea of your teeth resonating in musical tones makes your jaw quiver, Oral-B is definitely the safer bet.</p>
<h3>Battery test</h3>
<p>After running each brush for a week of testing and battery charging, we topped them all off at a full charge and then ran them until they would no longer brush.</p>
<p>One note on these tests: Oral-B&#8217;s brushes use old-fashioned nickel-metal-hydride batteries, while every other brand uses lithium ion. This accounts for a big difference in expected battery capacity, and the results aren&#8217;t surprising once you learn that.</p>
<p>The Fairywill and Brio brushes both showed amazing improvements in capacity over the other designs. That said, even the worst performer (the Oral-B &#8211; Pro 3000 at 44 minutes) will give you three weeks of brushing, and the no-fuss wireless charging stands all work very well to keep your brush at the ready.</p>
<h3>Cost of ownership</h3>
[table id=176 /]
<p>Without a clear performance metric to hang a ranking on, and with so many options to choose from, the cost of buying a toothbrush and replacing the heads became a more and more important factor to consider. We calculated the total cost of ownership for each brush over three years to account for the inevitable death of rechargeable batteries.</p>
<p>When you add a second person buying replacement heads, that cost becomes even more important.</p>
<p>The Philips Sonicare heads are very nicely made, but all of the cheaper competitors we tested claim to be using the same Dupont Tynex nylon (which has been the gold standard for toothbrush bristles since it was invented in the 1930s.)</p>
<p>When Oral-B sells their replacements for one quarter the price of a Philips brush package, you start to question the sanity of adding microchips to disposable toothbrush heads. Sonicare is a premium brand for Philips, and they seem intent on milking that for all it&#8217;s worth.</p>
<p>We factored the brush head replacement cycle on these brushes at four times per year, but bumped the Greater Goods system up to six times per year, since the bristles they ship with are softer than average and will wear more quickly. If you switch to medium bristles, they should last about as long as any of the other bristles; they&#8217;re a better-than-average value either way.</p>
<h2 id="best-for-kids">Finding the best electric toothbrush for kids</h2>
<p>We intended to test and recommend a specific model for kids three years and up, but it ended up being more tricky than that.</p>
<p>Our tiny tester definitely felt that the sonic brushes were &#8220;more tickly&#8221; than the oscillating heads from Oral-B, but the noise of those brushes was just as intimidating. Our parent/toddler team wound up using most of the brushes manually, without turning them on.</p>

<p>The Philips &#8211; Sonicare for kids brush heads are easier to maneuver in a small child&#8217;s mouth than the equivalent Oral-B &#8211; Sensitive brush head. The Philips head is smaller and narrower than other brushes, and that&#8217;s a good thing; Oral-B sticks with their standard size, and it&#8217;s still a bit tricky to get behind molars in tiny mouths.</p>
<p>Oral-B does make a few other sizes and shapes for their &#8220;Stages&#8221; series, but finding and buying them is a mess. (And many are actually bigger than the standard sensitive head.) The electric brush head replacements get mixed in with the manual brushes in store listings, and finding the brush head with the color and character design that matches your kid&#8217;s handle is infuriating. Local retailers we checked had a good selection of character choices when purchasing the Oral-B brush handles, but no replacement heads.</p>
<h3>Brushing apps for kids</h3>
<p>All of the kids toothbrush apps we tested were really just timer apps. They add value in two ways. First, apps make the brushing experience more exciting. Second, they track your routine and reward you for keeping good habits.</p>
<p>Oral-B has the &#8220;<a href="https://oralb.com/en-us/products/compare/disney-magic-timer-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disney Magic Timer</a>&#8221; app. When brushing, you &#8220;scrub away&#8221; bubbles from a static image of the characters on your branded toothbrush, which was fairly entertaining for our tester.</p>
<p>Philips, on the other hand, built their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCMSV0tHW8I" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sonicare for Kids</a> app around a virtual pet: &#8220;Sparkly&#8221; needs its teeth brushed to stay happy, and you get treats and accessories to feed and customize your &#8220;pet&#8221; after you brush. This is the feature that our test toddler really went for: surprise rewards for brushing.</p>
<p>Sadly, your Sparkly doesn&#8217;t get the good stuff (clothes and accessories) without the overpriced <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YAR7ZL6/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bluetooth-connected kid-specific brush handle</a>. Otherwise, the Sonicare for kids app works quite well with any old toothbrush.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re just looking for a toothbrush with smaller, softer bristles and control over the vibration speed, the Greater Goods &#8211; Balance is our pick.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re ready to spend $40 on a Sonicare for Kids brush handle, it does unlock special accessories for your kid&#8217;s &#8220;Sparkly&#8221; pet in the app, but there&#8217;s nothing else about that brush to justify the price tag.</p>
<h2 id="best-value">Top pick: Greater Goods &#8211; Balance</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mode-switching2-sm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WWCX7GN/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greater Goods &#8211; Balance</a> would be a competitive entry at $50 or $90, but the fact that it&#8217;s a great sonic-type brush selling for less than $30 makes it an easy pick for best value.</p>
<p>After three months of testing, we started to realize that we were never going to find an overall winner that would be perfect for everyone. Some people won&#8217;t like the vibration of sonic brushes, though others will definitely appreciate how much quieter they are. Some people will be better off with smaller brush heads, while others will benefit from more efficient brushing with a bigger head. Some people will want to use a variety of modes for things like gum massage and deep cleaning, while others will just be annoyed by the complexity.</p>
<p>Greater Goods has found a good middle ground in just about every category we considered, and the bonus perks aren&#8217;t cumbersome or gimmicky.</p>
<p>The standout feature for Greater Goods at a sub-$30 price point is the quad pacer. The brush makes a cheerful little buzzing pulse as a reminder to move to the next part of your mouth every thirty seconds. No app required! <b>The Balance is the only budget-priced brush with a quad pacer, and this feature is one of the most effective ways to improve your brushing routine. </b></p>
<p>The charger is a compact wireless-charging stand, just like most brushes we tested. Unique at this price point is a battery status light that turns red when you&#8217;ve got about six brushing sessions left. It also indicates when it&#8217;s charging and when it&#8217;s full; the competitively-priced Oral-B &#8211; Vitality doesn&#8217;t have <i>any</i> battery lights.</p>
<p>The battery is big enough for almost a month of brushing between charges, but the toothbrush is still cheap enough that you won&#8217;t be as frustrated when you need to replace it in two or three years when the battery stops working. (And it will; They all will.)</p>
<p>The Greater Goods brushes are on the smaller side, which is better in our experience than having a head that&#8217;s too big. The bristles are soft, maybe even softer than the bristles Philips is using. Greater Goods also sells <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XDFSWZP/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">medium</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077GF68XC/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">firm bristles</a> if that&#8217;s your preference. Our dentists have always encouraged us to go for softer bristles when we have a choice, but the optional firm-bristle replacements will last longer.</p>
<p>Confirm with your dentist about what&#8217;s best for you, but softer bristles make this the best electric toothbrush for receding gums.</p>

At this price, it's a bargain.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WWCX7GN/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>There&#8217;s a textured-silicone tongue scraper on the back of the brush head; it&#8217;s not an especially aggressive scraper, but not bad for a back-of-the-toothbrush design.</p>
<p>The four different modes Greater Goods offers are distinct enough to be meaningful, but as with the other brushes we&#8217;re skeptical that the faster vibrations are really any better at whitening. If the vibration is too much at first, it&#8217;s nice to have the option to use the &#8220;sensitive&#8221; mode. The feature that really stands out is mode switching with a dedicated button; usually that only shows up on much more expensive brushes.</p>
<p>The plaque-cleaning performance of this brush in our daily brushing and simulation tests is exactly what we&#8217;d expect from a sonic toothbrush: slightly better than the Oral-B oscillating system at clearing away sticky material.</p>
<h3>So, why not some other cheap brush?</h3>
<p>Greater Goods has a few unique features: a mode button makes turning the brush on and off much less annoying, and the brush heads are a little bit nicer and have a tongue-cleaner built in. This makes it the best cheap electric toothbrush we found.</p>
<p>Greater Goods isn&#8217;t the only company selling this particular brush design. Just looking at Amazon, you&#8217;ll see that brushes from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072P165L8/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mornwell</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072YVWBXH/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aquasonic</a> appear to be coming off the same production line with a different colorway and packaged with different accessories.</p>
<p>We spoke with Patrick Kohm, operations manager at Greater Goods, and he didn&#8217;t divulge anything about their manufacturing partners on the record, but a timeline is pretty revealing. Greater Goods launched their new Balance toothbrush design in early 2017. Shortly thereafter, Risun Tech founded the Mornwell brand to sell oral care products direct from their manufacturing plant.</p>
<p>We like the design either way, but Greater Goods has a real telephone support team that&#8217;s located stateside.</p>
<p>This brush won&#8217;t automatically make you better at cleaning hard-to-reach spots than any other brush, but we like that it doesn&#8217;t trip you up with a clunky interface or confusing options. This is a great brush at a great price, and in our interactions with Greater Goods customer service, they seem like a company on track to do even more great things in the future.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sonic-type Greater Goods &#8211; Balance has the timer and pace reminder features you need to reinforce good brushing habits.</li>
<li>Adjustable power levels and soft bristles are a win for gum health and sensitive teeth.</li>
<li>A dedicated mode button makes the optional modes less annoying to use than other affordable models.</li>
<li>All this top-tier functionality is squeezed into a sleek and minimalist design.</li>
<li>Greater Goods is a US company providing real support, but they&#8217;re competing for the lowest price point.</li>

<p>If you don&#8217;t want a sonic-type toothbrush, or if you need a specialized brush head for a unique problem you&#8217;re facing, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003UKM9CO/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oral-B &#8211; Pro 1000</a> is a great choice. Oral-B offers the largest selection of brush head types, and the Pro 1000 is the best value in their lineup.</p>
<p>Compared to the smooth, quiet bumblebee hum of other electric toothbrushes, the Oral-B design sounds like a cross between a power drill and a clattering dishtray. The oscillating brush snaps back-and-forth in much larger semi-circular movements than the sonic-power brushes do, and that&#8217;s the trade-off. Since the bristles move more slowly over a larger distance, they&#8217;re still effective at removing plaque without buzzing your entire jaw from the inside-out.</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/oral-b-closeup.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Oral-B&#8217;s other big win is the sheer variety of tools they offer: Iif you need an interdental tip to clean a tricky gap, plus a polishing cup to make the most of your whitening toothpaste, plus a soft brush that you can give your kids, Oral-B has you covered.</p>
<p>Oral-B&#8217;s replacement brushes are also available at a much lower cost than most of the competition <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L5M26DQ/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">when you buy in a 10-pack</a>. By comparison, Greater Goods is competitive even in a three-pack, which is one reason they won our best value pick, but we didn&#8217;t find the Philips Sonicare replacement heads any cheaper than $8.33 each (and you need to buy them at Costco to get that price.)</p>

There's also a full set of brush heads to choose from, with something for every need that they can think up.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003UKM9CO/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>While you&#8217;ll probably regret skipping the features and buying a cheaper Oral-B model, we also consider the Pro 1000 the most expensive toothbrush most people should buy. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DT0K6J2/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pro 3000</a> just adds two extra brush modes, and you&#8217;ll need to cycle through all the modes every time you use the brush (whether you use them or not). The Genius only really adds a position sensor for tracking your brushing habits.</p>
<h3>Compared to other Oral-B brushes</h3>

The battery life on the Pro 1000 is a bit disappointing: Like all the Oral-B brushes, it uses a nickel-metal-hydride battery. Run time is 44 minutes, though. That&#8217;s plenty if you always put the brush back on the charging stand between uses, but when the competition gives you more than double the battery life at half the purchase price, you start to wonder what you&#8217;re paying for.</p>
<p>Oral-B has stuck to their gun with the oscillating toothbrush heads that made them famous. If the idea of a buzzing sonic-type toothbrush in your mouth is a turn-off, we think this is easily the best buy in the oscillating brush category. The heads are about half the price of <a href="https://www.goby.co/products/electric-toothbrush/midnight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the competing Goby subscription system</a>, and you can buy them nearly anywhere.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Oral-B &#8211; Pro 1000 doesn&#8217;t tickle your mouth like a sonic-type brush.</li>
<li>Oral-B makes brush heads with every feature you can imagine, from interdental tips to polishing cups.</li>
<li>This model has all the essential features at a reasonable price.</li>
<li>Oral-B&#8217;s oscillating design works, but doesn&#8217;t seem to clean quite as well as the sonic-type brushes.</li>
<li>The 44 minutes of battery life is adequate, but not competitive.</li>
</ul>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XT1KDSD/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; DiamondClean Smart Series</a> is the flagship of the Sonicare fleet, and the model 9300 (also called HX9903 depending where you look) gets you the premium features that set this sonic toothbrush system apart.</p>
<p>Bluetooth is the backbone feature for every premium toothbrush currently on the market. Philips tracks every sensor on this brush and records when and how you&#8217;re using it with the smart-device app.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to use an app every time you brush, there&#8217;s really not much reason to buy a brush that costs more than $40. If you do want to use an app, we think the Sonicare app is the best, and this very nice toothbrush will make the most of it.</p>
<p>Another unique feature of the Sonicare system is the replacement heads: The 3-series heads all have unique ID tags that let the brush and the app know which mode they&#8217;re designed for. They also track how long you&#8217;ve been using a specific head, so you can get automatic reminders to replace them even if you&#8217;re using multiple head types or sharing the brush handle with your family.</p>
<p>Automatic mode switching is a great feature, because there are a lot of modes available: Clean, White+, Deep Clean+ and Gum Health all correspond to a specific Philips brush head, but you can manually set any mode you like. You can also choose from three power levels within each mode.</p>
<p>Adjustable power levels are the most compelling feature of this brush, because it offsets the biggest liability of the Philips Sonicare technology: the tickling sensation you get when the brush is vibrating against your teeth, gums or cheek 260 times per second.</p>
<p>We interviewed friends who are long-time users of the Sonicare system, and they all claimed they didn&#8217;t notice the vibration anymore. If you&#8217;re worried about how your teeth will respond in the beginning, adjustable power levels will help you ease into it.</p>
<h3>It is really better for brushing?</h3>
<p>We mostly tested this brush with the standard clean mode, and it tied for first place in our peanut-butter-cleaning test. We&#8217;re not going to say that it will remove more plaque from your teeth than another brush would; that depends on your technique. But this is the most power and versatility you can get.</p>
<p>The battery life for the Philips &#8211; DiamondClean was actually 30 percent lower than the other Philips models. This could be because the brush never turns off its Bluetooth transmitter. Still, it&#8217;ll brush your teeth 57 times without recharging — that&#8217;s almost double the battery life of the Oral-B &#8211; Genius 8000.</p>
<p>Philips&#8217; Sonicare system is quieter in every case than the Oral-B system, but the premium DiamondClean is just a little bit quieter on the standard clean mode than the other Philips brushes. It&#8217;s not a dramatic difference, but the brushes seem to have fewer and fewer parts buzzing around inside as you climb the price ladder.</p>

<h3>Premium design and accessories</h3>
<p>The premium feel of this brush is for all intents and purposes a design feature. The body is a little bit slimmer and sleeker than the lower-priced brushes, and the available color schemes cater to people who appreciate fine designer goods.</p>

The price tag and cost of replacement heads definitely took this brush out of the running for overall winner, though.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XT1KDSD/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XT1KDSD/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DiamondClean model 9300</a> we tested comes with a pebble-grain-wrapped travel case that holds the handle and two brush heads. If you pay another $60 for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSH2RNQ/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">model 9500</a>, you also get USB-port charging in your travel case so you don&#8217;t have to take your stand on the road. These cases aren&#8217;t explicitly designed to prop up a smartphone the way Oral-B&#8217;s case is, but the slot for the handle works fairly well.</p>
<p>The wireless charging stand (a standard feature in all electric brushes nowadays) also comes with a nice, heavy water glass that fits securely on top. This has basically become a signature feature of the DiamondClean brushes, and it&#8217;s definitely a unique touch. There&#8217;s also a clear plastic adapter for the charging stand if you don&#8217;t want to use the glass.</p>
<p>If you jump to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C799HF6/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">even more expensive model 9750</a>, you also get an exclusive glass countertop stand for four brush heads. The price is within spitting distance of $300, so it only really makes sense if you&#8217;re really, really proud of those $12 brush heads.</p>
<h3>Should you really buy this?</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;re mostly looking for a sleek brush with top-tier cleaning performance, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WWCX7GN/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greater Goods brush</a> gets you the same sonic cleaning performance the DiamondClean does. We like the Greater Goods brush heads, but here&#8217;s a twist: The various Philips Sonicare brush heads mount securely and work just as well on the Greater Goods handle. The arbor they mount on isn&#8217;t identical, but it&#8217;s got all the same key dimensions for the retaining clip to work.</p>
<p>If you love glass and copper-tone accents, Philips is the way to go. (We&#8217;re just a bit saddened that there aren&#8217;t brush heads to match the lunar blue handle. Blue and black? Seriously?) As with <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-electric-shaver/#the-other-finalists">Philips&#8217; high-end shaver</a>, it&#8217;s beautiful product that doesn&#8217;t make sense for most people to buy.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Philips &#8211; DiamondClean model 9300 is the Bluetooth-connected sonic brush that looks, feels and performs like a luxury product.</li>
<li>Philips&#8217; smart app works with a position sensor, brush sensor and head sensor to do something special with that connected advantage.</li>
<li>This brand tied for best cleaning performance in the lab, but that might not matter at all. (And it tickles.)</li>
<li>You could even drink your expensive scotch out of the swanky charging stand glass. That&#8217;s worth the price, right?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Oral-B &#8211; Genius 8000</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KTII3DS/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oral-B &#8211; Genius 8000</a> is a good toothbrush. All the features you could ask for are here, and more. The travel case even has a built-in USB charge port for your phone!</p>
<p>The great ideas often weren&#8217;t followed through, though. For example, the charger doesn&#8217;t put out enough amperage to charge a modern phone or tablet: iPads and phones sometimes started charging, and sometimes didn&#8217;t. &#8220;Near-miss&#8221; pretty effectively sums up many features on this high-end brush.</p>
<p>We were sorely tempted to give the Genius 8000 top spot in the premium category. The features are competitive: easy and programmable mode switching, a great selection of brush heads, and position and pressure tracking to make sure you&#8217;re not over- or under-brushing certain areas.</p>
<p>The Oral-B&#8217;s price is a bit better than the Philips system, too, both for the brush handle and for the replacement heads. The Oral-B is loud and clunky, though, compared to the soft hum of the Philips Sonicare technology. The app is good enough, but not quite as easy to navigate or set up as the Philips app.</p>
<p>The built-in charger in the case is a cool feature that almost makes this the best electric toothbrush for travel, but you&#8217;ll also be more likely to need that charger. Oral-B&#8217;s 64 minutes of battery life are pathetic compared to the 114 minutes we got from the Philips &#8211; DiamondClean. Thankfully, this brush has a three-segment display so you can actually see the battery level.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re really compelled by the value of the specialty brush heads Oral-B offers, the Pro &#8211; 1000 gets you into that system at a much more reasonable price point and has all the essential features.</p>
<h3>Philips &#8211; Sonicare Essence</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QZ67ODE/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Sonicare Essence</a> is the cheapest way into the Sonicare lineup, and that makes it a brush worth checking out, but at the end of the day there&#8217;s not much that makes this a good value.</p>
<p>The Essence gets the same good cleaning results that the other Sonicare brushes do. The DiamondClean was a little bit better in a lab test, but we think you&#8217;d be hard pressed to tell the difference between the Essence and the other brushes if they&#8217;re all on the basic cleaning mode.</p>
<p>What separates this brush from the rest of the lineup is the heads it uses. This is an old system that uses a massive threaded collar to hold the tip and its magnetically coupled drive shaft in place. It&#8217;s much more bulky and complex than the main Philips system, and still expensive at $35 for a year&#8217;s replacements, but that&#8217;s compared to $60 for the premium heads.</p>
<p>For that savings, you sacrifice every feature. There&#8217;s no quadrant-pacing timer, much less a pressure sensor or variable power levels.</p>
<p>Philips has already released a replacement for this model, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019K7DPG4/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Essence+</a>. The Plus model takes the same brush head as the rest of the Sonicare brushes rather than the bulky old screw-on heads, but just like the Essence it&#8217;s missing all the other features.</p>
<p>Sadly, the Essence+ is often selling for almost the same price as the much better 4100 model. If you&#8217;re really in love with the Philips brand but you want a bare-bones brush, this older Essence model is typically a much better value.</p>
<h3>Philips &#8211; Sonicare 4100 and 5100</h3>
<p>The Philips &#8211; Sonicare series is comprised of dozens of models and combo packs. We tested both the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078GVDB19/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Four Series model 4100</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078GVH2VH/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Five Series model 5100</a> because they represent the two clear feature changes: The 4100 adds a quad pacer and pressure sensor to the more basic models, and the 5100 adds a &#8220;gum care&#8221; mode and manual mode switching.</p>
<p>In both cases, we were underwhelmed by these features, especially when compared to the Greater Good &#8211; Balance. If the pressure sensor and mode switch were only adding a $20 premium to the price then these brushes might be worth seeking out; after our tests, though, we&#8217;re not convinced the pressure sensor really helps, and even after paying three times the price of the entry-level brush you&#8217;re going to keep on shelling out more for the $8-$12 brush heads every two or three months.</p>
<p>The &#8220;smart&#8221; features (like the ID-chipped brush heads) make some sense when you&#8217;ve got a Bluetooth-connected app tracking every datum of your brushing life, but those perks are missing on these brush handles.</p>
<p>The batteries are better than average, at 154 minutes for the 5100 and 180 minutes for the 4100, but that in no way justifies the sticker price.</p>
<h3>Oral-B Pro 3000</h3>
<p>The Oral-B Pro 3000 is in an awkward place in Oral-B&#8217;s lineup.</p>
<p>Like the midrange Philips, the features here are hard to justify: A gum care and sensitive mode are both great ideas, but it&#8217;s hard to say exactly who will need them, and for how long.</p>
<p>The Bluetooth on this brush is not a well-developed feature, either. It lets you start and pause the smartphone app&#8217;s timer in perfect sync with the built-in timer on the brush, but without a position sensor you don&#8217;t really get anything else from the app that you wouldn&#8217;t also get with a manual brush.</p>
<p>The main reason to buy this brush is if you love the Oral-B oscillating brush heads and want to program a gum massage into your weekly brushing routine. Bluetooth will let the app control that on the schedule that you or a dentist creates; it really is only automating a simple button press, though.</p>
<p>The other feature that comes with this brush, but not the 1000, is a countertop case that holds spare brush heads for your family or special-purpose brush heads. You can buy <a href="https://www.fix.com/parts/toothbrush/braun/fix10275996/brush-head-storage-67040225/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the same official stand</a> for about $15, or a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071DJ8WWL/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">very similar imitation</a> for about $10.</p>
<p>Forty-two minutes of battery is sufficient, but shameful in a $75 toothbrush. On the whole, the lower cleaning power compared to sonic toothbrushes and the louder motor of the oscillating design makes this a really tough model to recommend.</p>
<p>If the lack of a dedicated mode switch is the only thing you think is missing, you can get that (and some extra modes) for about $15 more in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O8ODHOA/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oral-B &#8211; Pro 5000</a>. After spending a few months with a range of Oral-B models, we&#8217;re pretty sure most people will be fully satisfied with the features of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003UKM9CO/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pro 1000</a> at half the price.</p>
<h3>Brio &#8211; SmartClean</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OJHCCP6/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Brio &#8211; SmartClean</a> seems like a brush that was built to order around a feature set, rather than being carefully designed and improved after testing.</p>
<p>The SmartClean checks most of the essential feature boxes, except a pressure sensor and a mode switch. It has three modes: normal, soft and massage. These are sensible to include, but without a mode button you&#8217;re cycling through all of them every time you start and stop the brush. The white plastic body is hard and shiny where every other brush has a grippy texture.</p>
<p>If this brush were $30 rather than the consistent $68 it sold for when we tested, it would be a competitor for the top pick. At this price, it&#8217;s up against the Sonicare 5100. Brio gives you double the battery life and cheaper brush replacements, plus a brush holder on the charger rather than the travel case that comes with the 5100. It&#8217;s also a little bit quieter than the midrange Philips models. It doesn&#8217;t seem to clean as well, though, and there&#8217;s no pressure sensor.</p>

<h3>Fairywill &#8211; FW-507</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06VWD8NY3/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fairywill &#8211; FW-507</a> feels and looks lower-grade than the other brushes we tried. It&#8217;s a popular model on Amazon that seems to share a production line with a number of other brands.</p>
<p>The USB-compatible charge cable is an interesting feature that may come in handy once in a while, but wireless toothbrush stands make far more sense unless you&#8217;re constantly travelling.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a bad toothbrush, really, but the lack of a mode switch makes the five modes more annoying than they&#8217;re worth. Fairywill squeezed the longest run time out of this big rechargeable battery, but a convenient charging stand is a far more important feature for most people.</p>
<p>The Fairywill replacements were the only brush heads we didn&#8217;t like. They&#8217;re not bad, per se; the bristles appear to be the same soft Nylon used by the rest of the industry, and the shape and size are about right. The way they attach to the handle is a big, hollow mounting shaft with a twist-lock retention mechanism. Again, not awful, just not as simple or easy to clean as other systems.</p>
<h3>Oral-B &#8211; Vitality</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078Y357PS/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oral-B&#8217;s Vitality model</a> is an entry-level electric toothbrush that should be attractive for offering access to Oral-B&#8217;s great brush heads for a low up-front cost. But, when compared to other budget brushes, it&#8217;s a bit disappointing.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s missing? Nearly everything. There&#8217;s not even a charge light to let you know if your charger is plugged in. The lack of a pacing timer is not uncommon for the entry-level model in a big brush maker&#8217;s line, but when <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WWCX7GN/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greater Goods</a> is offering that feature at the $25 price point, this brush is hard to recommend.</p>
<p>The Vitality has a larger-than-usual battery for Oral-B&#8217;s line. It actually runs for 17 days worth of brushing, about a day longer than Oral-B&#8217;s flagship brush. This is still 12 days short of the average we found among other brands. It&#8217;s also a quieter brush than some other Oral-B models, but on the whole we think the Pro 1000 is a worthwhile upgrade if you want the Oral-B heads.</p>
<h3>Oral-B &#8211; 3D White</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008I2IKI6/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oral-B &#8211; 3D White</a> is a strange duck. Oral-B clearly recognizes that their brand is strong enough to sell cheap AA-battery-powered toothbrushes.</p>
<p>The 3D White&#8217;s cleaning performance in our peanut butter test was pretty good, partly because the head is so much bigger than the other Oral-B heads. That said, it&#8217;s actually a bit less efficient at brushing in most actual mouths, since it can be tricky to maneuver that big head.</p>
<p>Battery life is kind of amazing: 305 minutes of constant run time on the included AA alkaline.</p>
<p>That said, this brush fails to meet the basic qualifications that advance most electric toothbrushes ahead of stone-age manual-power brushes. There&#8217;s no timer at all, let alone a quad pacer. If we were picking a tool to clean grout lines, this would be a contender for best value of the bunch. As a toothbrush, it&#8217;s just a gimmicky waste of time.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The best brush is one you&#8217;ll actually enjoy using for two minutes, twice every day. Anything more or less than that is probably not going to make a big difference for your teeth and gums, but it&#8217;s a very good idea to schedule a checkup with your dentist so you can talk about technique.</p>
<p>Our favorite brush, then, has all the essential features to make that happen. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WWCX7GN/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greater Goods &#8211; Balance</a> has a two-minute timer with 30-second pacing reminders that help you get every tooth, while the soft bristles and adjustable power modes mean it&#8217;ll let you ease into a new routine. (You can change to harder bristles, too, if you want stronger scrubbing and longer bristle life.) It does all this for less than half the cost of the competition.</p>
<p>The Balance doesn&#8217;t have Bluetooth. But if you really want to record your brushing habits, the data-collecting features of apps we tested work manually with any toothbrush.</p>
<p>If you really prefer moving bristles to buzzing sonic toothbrushes, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003UKM9CO/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oral-B &#8211; Pro 1000</a> still has a quad pacer and pressure sensor, plus it gives you access to affordable specialty brushes. It&#8217;s double the cost of our top pick and it&#8217;s pretty loud, but for sensitive mouths this is a less intimidating option.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re really sold on the idea of a Bluetooth-connected app that will track how long you brush each part of your mouth and let you schedule a customized routine of automatic gum massage, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XT1KDSD/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; DiamondClean</a> is a premium brush that does look and feel like a luxury item.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>To select our eight curling iron finalists, we first looked at online reviews from respected retailers like Amazon, Sephora, Target and Bed Bath and Beyond. We used these reviews to determine what consumers look for in a curling iron and which brands are leaders in the field.</p>
<p>Next, we consulted subreddits such as /r/fancyfollicles, /r/beauty and /r/femalehairadvice. We also checked out reviews from authoritative 3rd parties such as Reviews.com. This info helped us further our understanding of important curling iron features.</p>
<p>We continued researching curling iron technical components, such as barrel material, barrel size and temperature controls. We also consulted a professional hairstylist with twenty years experience, Priscilla Bagby.</p>
<p>Priscilla gave us practical information about proper curling iron/wand usage and what features she looks for in each. She also helped us in our decision to narrow down our finalists to only 1-inch barrels. We chose 1-inch barrels because this size can serve a variety of hair types and can be used to achieve the natural-wave look that is currently popular.</p>
<p>With Priscilla’s help, we also decided to represent all three of the most popular barrel materials in our list of finalists: ceramic, titanium and tourmaline. This let us compare the efficacy of the most popular materials on the market. We also included a range of price points, from bargain to luxury, so that we could find the best curling options for any budget.</p>

<h2 id="how-irons-work">How curling irons work</h2>
<p>Curling irons and wands use electrical resistors inside the barrel to heat up and remove water from hair strands. This process of removing water from hair is commonly called the water-set process. This process can be easily understood if you think of your hair like spaghetti. When curling irons remove the water from your hair, the hair dries in a manner similar to uncooked spaghetti. However, when the hair reabsorbs enough moisture, it loses this rigid structure, like when you add your spaghetti to a pot of water.</p>
<p>This process of direct heat and water evaporation inevitably leads to hair damage, because it breaks down the amino acids naturally present in your hair. Easy steps can be taken to prevent hair breakage and excess damage when curling, such as using a heat protectant and not using an unnecessarily high temperature while curling. During our hands-on testing, our testers used heat protectant to avoid hair damage.</p>
<h3 id="irons-vs-wands">Curling irons vs. curling wands</h3>
<p>The primary difference between a curling iron and a curling wand is that a wand does not have a clamp to hold hair around its barrel. With a wand, you use your hands to secure your hair around the barrel. Some people prefer this because it can lead to a more natural looking curl. Curling wands also may have tapered barrels, meaning the barrel becomes narrower at its tip.</p>
<p>Our professional, Priscilla, prefers to use a wand while curling hair because it can be used to “give hair a more natural look.” However, she concedes that most amateurs are more comfortable using curling irons. Without the safety of a clip, users may accidentally burn their hands while securing hair around the wand’s barrel.</p>
<p>Priscilla explains, “One good [skin] burn deters most people [from wands] for good.” However, “mastery can be achieved with repetitive practice.” Also, most curling wands come with a heat-resistant glove to protect your hands from these types of accidents.</p>

<p>Proper technique is very important when curling hair, not only to get the best look, but also to ensure that you do not unintentionally damage your hair. Immediately before using a curling iron or wand, precondition your hair with a heat protectant.</p>
<p>It is also important to avoid unnecessarily high temperatures when curling hair.There is no “one-size-fits-all” temperature that works for everyone; the right temperature for you is based on your hair’s texture and thickness.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about which temperature to use, start at a low temperature (around 300 °F) and slowly increase it until you are able to set a curl with one 15-second hold around the barrel. Once you have your curling iron or wand set to the correct temperature for your hair, Priscilla recommends focusing on three main factors while curling: sectioning, angles and direction.</p>
<h3>Sectioning</h3>
<p>“Sectioning” refers to how you section off parts of your hair for curling. After using a heat protectant, make sure your hair is dry and detangled before sectioning hair with clips.</p>
<p>Priscilla explains that “natural looks will usually just require two sections.” She recommends creating one section above your ears and another below. More sections can be added for more glamorous looks, but don’t go overboard. “No one needs to do five horizontal sections,” Priscilla says. “It’s way too much curl and looks amateur.”</p>
<h3>Angles</h3>
<p>The angle at which you hold your curling iron or wand while your hair is wrapped around its barrel will affect your curl. Priscilla explains ,“Holding the barrel of your iron or wand on a diagonal will result in a more natural beachy wave pattern, horizontal will result in a more natural brushed curl, and vertical will result in a ringlet curl.”</p>
<h3>Direction</h3>
<p>The direction of a curl can either be toward or away from your face. The curl’s direction, coupled with the angle at which you curl it, can have a huge influence on the overall look of your hair.</p>
<p>For those wanting a natural, two-sectioned look, Priscilla recommends directing the top layer of curls away from your face and the bottom layer towards your face to “maximize volume.” However, if you want to create an even more “lived-in” natural look, alternate the direction of the curls throughout your hair to create “a more natural pattern.”</p>
<p>If you are looking for an old-school Hollywood glam look, Priscilla explains that you should begin on your bottom section by directing curls away from your face, holding your iron or wand at a vertical angle. Continue that all the way around until you end up on the other side of your face with curls that are now directed towards your face. “Pull a boars-head groom brush through and voila, you’re Rita Hayworth.”</p>
<p>“The biggest mistakes that I see with clients and stylists alike is the strong desire to run your fingers through the curl while it’s still hot,” says Priscilla. For curls that last, let your hair cool completely before brushing or applying product. “If you want to relax the curl, simply grab the end of the curl, stretch the curl and hold while it’s cooling.”</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>

<p><b>Barrel size:</b> Curling iron and wand barrels range from 0.5 to 1.5 inches in diameter. We chose to test all 1-inch barrels because they create a curl that is structured, but not too tight for most hair lengths. If you have very cropped hair, you may want to opt for a smaller barrel size; or if you have very long hair, a larger one.</p>
<p>Barrel <i>length</i> is also a consideration because it determines the amount of hair you can wrap around your iron. Standard barrels are usually around 5-7 inches long. Extra-long models can extend up to 9.5 inches, which can be helpful for people with very long hair. Shorter models, under 5.5 inches, are handy for those with shorter hair and/or those who want an easier to carry curling iron.</p>
<p><b>Temperature range:</b> Most curling irons can reach incredibly high temperatures upwards of 400 °F. However, these temperatures are not necessary for most hair types. You should check a curling iron’s minimum and maximum temperatures to make sure it can sustain your ideal heat.</p>
<p><b>Ionic: </b>Ionic curling irons produce negative ions to attract the positive water ions naturally present in hair. These ions promote frizz-free, shiny hair. All of the curling irons and wands we tested promote ionization, although they all have different barrel types.</p>
<p><b>Barrel material: </b>Most curling iron barrels are metal with a coating of one of the materials listed below. However, higher-quality irons are available that are completely comprised of ceramic or titanium. Gold and tourmaline are used as coatings for either metal, ceramic or titanium irons. Coated irons that have a metal substrate may pose durability issues over the course of years, as the barrel’s coating may wear off and cause hot spots of exposed metal.</p>
<p>Some curling iron manufacturers make proprietary blends of the following materials (for example, “tourmaline infused ceramic”):</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ceramic: </b>Ceramic is a material that heats up quickly and evenly, making it a great pick for curling irons.</li>
<li><b>Titanium: </b>The preferred material of our professional hairstylist, Priscilla, titanium curling irons heat up faster than ceramic irons and are lightweight. However, titanium curling irons tend to be on the pricey side.</li>
<li><b>Tourmaline:</b> Tourmaline is a semiprecious gemstone, which is crushed to coat the curling iron’s barrel. This material boosts the negative ions produced by the curling iron, which helps make hair smooth and shiny.</li>
<li><b>Gold</b>: Curling irons with gold-plated barrels heat evenly and prevent overheating, making them a good choice for frequent use.</li>
</ul>
[table id=164 /]
<p><b>Safety features:</b> Ever leave your house and think, “Did I forget to unplug my curling iron?” If so, you understand why an automatic shutoff feature helps your peace of mind. An important safety consideration, automatic shutoff ensures your iron is never left on for more than thirty minutes to an hour.</p>
<p>Other important standard safety features include heat-protectant gloves to protect hands and a stand to prevent the iron from burning your counter. All of our curling wand finalists came with heat-protectant gloves, and all of our finalists had some sort of stand.</p>
<p><b>Usability:</b> A curling iron that is too heavy or unwieldy may lead to hair damage/breakage. Overall usability refers to the the iron’s weight, handle ergonomics, cord length and intuitiveness of the controls.</p>
<p><b>Aesthetics:</b> A good quality, attractive curling iron means it won’t be an eyesore sitting on your counter.</p>

<h3>Hands-on curling</h3>
<p>To see if our finalists really delivered perfect curls, we had regular consumers put them to the test. After using each curling iron, our testers answered questions about the appearance, usability, results and overall impression of our finalists. Our three testers each had a different hair type ranging from short and fine to long and thick. Each tester’s unique hair type meant that they had a different ideal temperature for curling hair.</p>
[table id=166 /]
<p>All of our testers also had some experience with curling irons. Our tester with the least experience had used a curling iron a handful of times and had no experience with curling wands. Our tester with the most experience was familiar with both irons and wands and had used a wand on a biweekly basis.</p>
<p>Our testers largely preferred the curling irons with digital controls as they were clear, simple and accurate. In particular, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FVHH2H6/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neuro</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXS1OXQ/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xtava</a> were found to have the best controls, as their digital temperature controls are simple to use and have bright LED numbers that are easy to read.</p>
<p>Two of our finalists, Hot Tools and Mr Big, have dial temperature controls. Our testers appreciated the dial controls for their simplicity, but were disappointed with the smaller number of heat settings.</p>
<p>The Bed Head and NuMe both have only one heat setting. This limitation was universally disliked by our testers. The single temperature setting for both of these curlers was too hot for all of our testers’ hair. In fact, our tester with average thickness hair experienced smoke due to burnt hair follicles; to prevent further damage, we avoided testing on fine-hair.</p>
<p>The most intimidating curling iron for our testers was the Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curl Secret. This curler is unique in that it is an automated curling machine, meaning it sucks in a section of hair and curls it around an inner barrel. Although it required some learning, this curling iron turned out to be easy-to-use, but ultimately delivered lackluster results.</p>
<p>While not a fully automated machine, the Beachwaver also has a mechanism to twist hair along its barrel. Our testers with medium and long hair were able to get the hang of its barrel-twisting controls easily. However, the mechanism was useless for our tester with short hair.</p>
<h3>Barrel length</h3>
<p>We found that the advertised barrel lengths of our curling irons were often longer than their practical lengths. These advertized lengths often include the unheated tip (at the end of the barrel) as well as the small portion of the barrel located below the curling iron clamp. To determine the length of the curling iron barrel that can effectively be used to curl, we did our own measuring.</p>
<p>Take, for example the Anjou, which was advertised as a 6.3-inch barrel. While this measurement is technically correct, it is misleading. If you subtract the unheated end of the Anjou’s barrel and the bit below its clip, the part of the Anjou’s barrel that actually heats hair is 5.3 inches.</p>
<p>This size made the Anjou ideal for our short-haired tester, but was too small for our long-haired tester. On the other hand, the Mr Big Curling Iron is advertised at 9.5 inches but, practically, only 8 inches of its barrel can be used for curling. Our tester with long hair appreciated this extra length, but our tester with short hair found it too cumbersome.</p>
<p>From our tester’s experiences, we recommend looking for barrels that are 5.5 inches and longer if you have long hair. If your hair is shorter, you should look for 5.5 inches or less. While you shop, keep in mind that advertised barrel lengths probably include the iron’s unheated tip.</p>
<h3>Temperature range</h3>
<p>We used a thermometer attached to a thermocouple to test the highest and lowest temperature settings of our curling irons. Keep in mind that the accuracy of these thermometer readings may vary slightly, as they were not performed in a lab.</p>
<p>The Neuro proved to be the most accurate curling iron of our finalists. Its tested temperatures were within 1 °F of its advertised minimum and maximum specs.</p>
<p>Generally, the rest of our finalists tested a bit lower than their advertised temperatures but were within 10 &#8211; 15 °F. While 11 of our 12 finalists claimed to reach temperatures over 400 °F, we measured that only the Neuro, Hot Tools and Mr Big Curling Iron measured above 400 °F. So if you need very high temperatures to curl your hair, we recommend the Neuro as your best-choice curling wand and the Hot Tools as a solid runner-up.</p>
[table id=165 /]
<p>This heat setting test was particularly useful for the Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curl Secret. This curling iron has four clearly labeled heat settings, and one ambiguous setting simply labeled “POWER.” We found the Conair’s “POWER” setting to be around 270 °F.</p>
<p>The NuMe measured significantly below 410 °F, its advertised temperature, reaching only 343 °F. This underperformance was noticed by our testers, who were displeased with the NuMe’s curling results.</p>
<h3>Heating speed</h3>
<p>To test how long each of our curling irons took to reach its maximum temperature, we again employed the thermometer and thermocouple, along with a stopwatch. We found that the Neuro was our fastest curling wand to heat up, taking only two minutes and 42 seconds to reach 449 °F. The titanium barrel of the Neuro helped it to easily beat the competition in heat time.</p>
<p>The curling irons that heated up fastest were the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E68O4JU/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curl Secret</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B074QWJWTB/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mr Big Curling Iron</a>. The Conair took two minutes to reach 397 °F, and the Mr Big took two minutes and 41 seconds to reach 412 °F.</p>
<p>The majority of our finalists took somewhere between five to 10 minutes to reach their maximum temperature. The slowest to reach its maximum temperature was the NuMe which took over 10 minutes to reach 343 °F. This slow heat time is most likely due to the NuMe’s 100-percent ceramic barrel, a material that takes longer to heat up.</p>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<p>To score high on our overall usability, a curling iron should have simple controls, feel comfortable and lightweight, plus have a long cord. Our testers gushed over the grips of the Neuro and Anjou, which they found particularly easy to hold.</p>
<p>Our testers did not like the grips on the NuMe and Bed Head. They complained that these finalists lack grip texture and ergonomic shaping, and that they have a weight-balance issue which makes them unwieldy.</p>
<p>We measured each curling iron’s power cord and found that the Neuro had the longest cord at 9-feet long. The Xtava, Anjou, Mr Big Curling Iron and Beachwaver also had very long cords, all around 8 to 8.5 feet. The curling wand with the smallest cord was the Remington at 5 feet, 10 inches. However, cord length did no prove to be an issue for any of our testers, as they found even the Remington to be a comfortable length.</p>
<p>The lightest of our curling irons was the Vivid &amp; Vogue, which only weighs about 0.8 pounds (12.2 ounces). This makes the Vivid &amp; Vogue ideal to travel with, especially since it features dual voltage. Our testers thought this extra-light weight made the iron easy to use. The majority of our curling irons and wands range from 1 to 1.5 pounds, which our testers described as a comfortable weight.</p>
<p>The heaviest curling iron we tested was the Hot Tools at 2 pounds. This curling iron’s extra weight gives the impression of a quality tool, but two of our testers complained that this extra weight made it feel more unwieldy.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXS1OXQ/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xtava &#8211; Twist Conical Curling Wand</a> impressed our testers with its styling results. All of our testers gushed about the curls created with this iron, especially our testers with long and medium length hair. The Xtava’s graduated barrel helped our testers get natural-looking, tousled, loose curls.</p>
<p>This curling wand is a great choice for those who want the “natural curl” look. If you are looking for a bit more of a structured curl, you might consider opting for a straight-barrel version of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXS1OXQ/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xtava</a> or the Neuro discussed below.</p>
<p>Out of the box, our testers thought the Xtava looked sleek and smart with its all-black design. They were also highly impressed with its easy-to-use digital controls. The Xtava’s simple buttons and easy-to-read digital screen allow you to control the temperature from 200 °F to 410 °F in ten degree increments.</p>
<p>Our testers also liked that this wand displays its temperature while it heats up, so you know exactly when it’s ready to use. The Xtava took four minutes and 20 seconds to reach its maximum temperature, which we measured as 383 °F. This was an average heat time for our finalists.</p>

<p>While this 383 °F temperature is lower than the Xtava’s advertised maximum (410 °F), we believe it is within the margin of error for our testing. However, if you have thicker hair that should be ironed at temperatures above 400 °F, we greatly recommend splurging for the hotter Neuro. That said, the Xtava is a great choice for the majority of hair types that should be curled below 400 °F, including fine, normal and wavy hair.</p>
<p>The Xtava’s smart controls, plus its comfortable handle, made the Xtava very easy to use for our testers. In addition to the standard heat-protectant glove that comes with most curling wands, the Xtava also came with a good quality case that proved convenient to use.</p>

<p>The Xtava’s tourmaline-infused ceramic barrel measured 5.5 inches in length and tapered from 1.5- to 1-inch wide. This makes it great for medium- to long-length hair. Those with very short hair might opt for the smaller-barreled Xtava, which tapers from 1 inch to 0.5 inch wide.</p>
<p>The weight of the Xtava curling wand is pretty standard among its peers at 1.4 pounds. While this may not be a super-lightweight model, none of our testers complained of arm fatigue.</p>
<p>The only feature our testers thought could be improved in the Xtava is its heat stand, which is pretty small and can easily tip over. However, the Xtava comes equipped with other safety features, such as an automatic shutoff plus a good quality heat-protectant glove and case.</p>
<p>The Xtava’s appearance is sleek, black and serious. However its controls are friendly, and its curling results are flirty and fun. Despite the high quality of the Xtava, it comes at a bargain at around $20. To put the cherry on top, the Xtava is dual voltage, which means you can use it outside of the United States.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Our top pick, the Xtava &#8211; Twist Conical Curling Wand has easy-to-use digital controls and a comfortable handle.</li>
<li>Our testers were highly impressed with the Xtava’s styling results, delivered by its graduated, tourmaline-infused ceramic barrel.</li>
<li>At a 5.5-inch length, the Xtava’s graduated barrel performed well on a variety of hair types.</li>
<li>The Xtava offers top-tier performance without a top-tier price.</li>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FVHH2H6/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neuro &#8211; Unclipped Styling Rod</a> is a straight-barreled curling wand. Our testers thought the Neuro’s expensive price tag is worth it for those with very thick hair, or for those who want a more structured curl. However, if you have thin, normal or moderately thick hair and are looking for a loose tousled curl, the Xtava is a better choice.</p>
<p>The Neuro’s high price tag is partly due its high-quality titanium barrel and smart digital controls. This titanium barrel heats up quickly and can reach an incredible 450 °F, the highest temperature of all our finalists. Therefore, if you have very thick or textured hair, this curling iron is probably worth the splurge.</p>
<p>All of our testers ranked the Neuro’s digital controls far above its competitors. This curling wand’s temperature range was 160 °F &#8211; 450 °F, which you can set in 10-degree increments. Its digital temperature was exceptionally easy to read, and its buttons were intuitive.</p>

This professional-grade curling wand can create a variety of looks, and its titanium-plated barrel can reach a remarkable 450 °F.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FVHH2H6/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Our heat testing also revealed that this curling wand is exceptionally accurate, measuring within 1 °F of its advertised temperature. The Neuro was also the fastest curling wand to heat up, taking only two minutes and 42 seconds to reach 449 °F. Our heat testing data proved that the Neuro’s titanium barrel is worth the price.</p>
<p>The Neuro also comes equipped with other professional-grade features, such as a customizable automatic shutoff feature. This feature allows you to program the curling wand to shut off after whatever amount of time you choose.</p>
<p>The Neuro’s straight barrel is 5.5-inches long, which works well for a variety of hair lengths. Because its barrel is straight, our testers found that it can be used to get a slightly more defined curl than the Xtava. This curling iron works well for creating different types of curls based upon the angle of the iron and the direction of the curl.</p>
<p>The Neuro’s styling results and its professional features make it ideal for consumers looking to spend more to get serious curling power. Like the Xtava, the Neuro is dual voltage, making it a good choice for trips abroad.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>

<p>Our testers with medium-length and long hair loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S28DKO0/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Beachwaver</a>’s automatically rotating barrel, which was unique among our finalists. The Beachwaver’s rotation is controlled by two direction buttons on its barrel, but you don’t have to use this feature if you don’t want to. However, our testers with hair past their shoulders found this feature very handy in getting strands to wrap uniformly around the barrel.</p>
<p>Our short-haired tester found the Beachwaver to be too bulky overall to use successfully. However, our other testers appreciated the Beachwaver’s large handle, which they said felt more ergonomic than our other finalists. The Beachwaver’s large buttons are intuitive, which make using its fancy rotation feature easy.</p>
<p>The Beachwaver’s lowest temperature setting was 290 °F, meaning that it’s unsuitable for those with very fine, color-treated or damaged hair. Our testers liked this curling iron’s digital temperature controls, which allow you to easily select the temperatures in 10-degree increments up to 410 °F.</p>

With its large handle, this curling iron is comfortable to hold and features intuitive controls.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S28DKO0/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Though the Beachwaver was advertised to reach 410 °F, we measured its highest temperature to be 398 °F. This measurement may be within the margin of error for our testing, but if you’re looking for a curling iron that easily exceeds 400°F, we recommend going with the Hot Tools instead. However, the Beachwaver is a great pick for the majority of average- to long-hair types that should be curled at settings below 400 °F.</p>
<p>This curling iron took six minutes and 30 seconds to reach its maximum temperature, an average time for our finalists.</p>
<p>The Beachweaver’s clamp is the smallest of our finalists, yet our testers found it very effective. This small clamp minimizes the crinkle sometimes left by a curling iron’s clamp. Its 5.5-inch long barrel creates attractive curls that our testers rated “above average.”</p>
<p>The main drawback of the Beachwaver is its high price point at over $100. However, its comfortable handle and smart, automatic-spin feature make it a great curling iron for longer hair. The Beachwaver also comes equipped with an automatic shutoff feature that turns off the iron if left unused for 30 minutes.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Beachwaver &#8211; S1 is a good choice for those with medium length or long hair.</li>
<li>This curling iron has an automatic rotating barrel that is easy to control and helps to create nicely styled curls.</li>
<li>Though hefty in size, the Beachwaver’s handle is comfortable to hold, and large buttons make using its fancy features easy.</li>
<li>This curling iron is our luxury pick, with a price point upwards of $100.</li>

<p>We found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073GG2WN4/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anjou &#8211; 1-Inch Curling Iron</a> is the best choice for shorter hair. Our testers thought the Anjou’s more manageable size (14.4 inches overall) and ceramic barrel made it a great overall curling iron. Our testers were pleased with the curls the Anjou made, and they proved the iron to be both effective and easy to use.</p>
<p>The Anjou’s ceramic barrel is advertised as 6.3 inches; however, our testers found that they were only able to practically use 5.3 inches of the barrel. This is because the 6.3-inch measurement includes the unheated end of the barrel, as well as the portion of the barrel below the iron’s clamp.</p>
<p>This posed a problem for our tester with the longest hair, which falls around her mid to lower back. This tester wanted a little more length from the Anjou’s barrel in order to fit more hair around it. However, our other two testers had no issue with the Anjou’s barrel length.</p>

Our testers loved the Anjou’s 5.3-inch ceramic barrel and lightweight design.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073GG2WN4/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Anjou also comes equipped with digital heat controls, which allow you to select the temperature in 10-degree increments from 200 °F &#8211; 410 °F. The Anjou’s buttons are very small, which our testers thought was a bit of a pain. However, the controls are very simple and allow for specific temperature setting. We found that the Anjou took about six minutes and 33 seconds to reach its maximum temperature, which was a pretty average heating time among our finalists.</p>
<p>This curling iron works well for most hair thicknesses, except for those with very thick or textured hair that needs to be curled above 400 °F. We measured its maximum and minimum temperatures to be 198 °F to 398 °F, just a bit lower than its technical specs. This slight temperature discrepancy was not noticed in our hands-on testing.</p>
<p>Weighing 1.2 pounds, this curling iron is relatively lightweight, which our testers thought made it easy to manipulate. This curling iron is also dual voltage, so you can travel with it overseas.</p>
<p>The Anjou is easy to use, features smart controls and offers great results, making it a great pick for those with short- to medium-length hair. To top things off, the Anjou is a bargain, costing only about $25.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Anjou &#8211; 1-Inch Curling Iron is a good choice for those with short to medium-length hair because of its more manageable size at 14.4-inch length and 1.2-pound weight.</li>
<li>This curling iron’s digital controls allow you to select the temperature between 200 °F to 410 °F, and our testers were pleased with the curls created by the Anjou’s 5.3-inch ceramic barrel</li>
<li>The Anjou works well for a variety of hair thicknesses, but it’s not the best pick for those with very thick or textured hair that needs to be curled above 400 °F.</li>
<li>The Anjou comes at a very reasonable price point, costing only around $25.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/conair-reg-titanium-ceramic-1-inch-barrel-curling-iron/1041281284?Keyword=curling%20iron" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curling Iron</a> came in just behind the Anjou in its overall testing score, ranking above average with most of our testers. Our tester with the shortest hair especially liked the Conair’s smaller size and lighter weight.</p>
<p>The Conair’s barrel is made of ceramic-infused tourmaline and measures 5 inches long. This length worked well for our short- and medium-length hair testers, but it was too small for our long-haired tester. Overall, our testers ranked the curls created by the Conair as average.</p>
<p>The Conair lost points in its low-quality appearance. Its light weight (1.08 pounds) and — as one tester described it, “Aquaman-blue” handle — contributed to this overall impression of cheaper quality. However, when you consider that the Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro was able to yield average styling results for an incredibly cheap price at just around $20, it’s easy to forgive the Conair’s appearance.</p>
<p>The Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro’s controls are simple but do not offer the specificity of a digital curling iron. The Conair allows you to select the temperature at five different presets. If you select only “POWER,” the curling iron reaches about 275 °F. Beyond that base setting, your other options are 310 °F, 330 °F, 360 °F and 400 °F.</p>
<p>The Conair took an average length of time to reach its maximum temperature, six-and-a-half minutes. Our measured temperatures for the Conair were a bit lower than the specified minimum and maximum temperatures. This curling iron works best for those with normal or thick hair. Because of its limited temperature range, it’s not a good pick for those with very thin or very thick hair.</p>
<p>Overall, this curling iron is a solid budget pick as it offers average styling results with easy-to-use controls and at a friendly $20 price. This curling iron is better suited for those with short to medium-length hair because of its shorter barrel.</p>
<h3>Hot Tools: 1-Inch 24k Gold Curling Iron</h3>

<p>Our testers thought that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00176B8BG/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hot Tools &#8211; 1-Inch 24k Gold Curling Iron</a> was an overall average curling iron. Like the Conair curling iron, the Hot Tools delivers average styling results. However, during our temperature testing, this curling iron reached one of the highest temperatures of our finalists, heating up to 405 °F. Therefore, if you have thick hair and are looking for a bargain, the Hot Tools is a solid-choice curling iron.</p>
<p>The Hot Tools relies on a dial temperature control system, which is simple, but lacks the accuracy of digitally controlled irons. This curling iron also heated up in a reasonable amount of time, taking about six minutes to reach its maximum temperature.</p>
<p>In addition, the Hot Tools price is very affordable, falling just under $30. It has an easy-to-grip handle and a gold barrel, which measures 4.25 inches. This was our heaviest curling iron, coming in around 2 pounds. When curling a lot of hair, this extra weight can turn hair curling into an arm workout. Overall, the Hot Tools is a solid curling iron, but it lacks the professional features and exceptional results to make it one of our top picks.</p>
<h3>Remington &#8211; Pro Curling Wand</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-17437 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro.jpg" alt="Remington Pro curling wand" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>While our testers were happy with the loose curl that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010AIHKF4/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Remington &#8211; Pro Curling Wand</a> creates, they were less than impressed with this wand’s temperature display and plastic handle. Our testers wished the Remington’s digital temperature display was brighter and more readable and that its handle had a better stand for holding the wand while hot.</p>
<p>The Remington reached its maximum temperature quickly, taking only four-and-a-half minutes. However, we measured the maximum temperature a bit below the advertised 410 °F. If you have extremely thick or textured hair, this is not the wand for you. However, it does work well for all other hair thicknesses that can be curled at a setting under 400 °F.</p>
<p>This curling iron comes at a good price, around $25. However, the Xtava &#8211; Twist Conical Curling Wand comes at a similar price point and offers more professional features and better performance. Therefore, the Remington would only be a good choice if the Xtava was out of stock.</p>
<h3>Mr Big Curling Iron &#8211; 1-Inch</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-17434 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big.jpg" alt="Mr Big curling iron" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, our tester with long hair appreciated the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B074QWJWTB/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mr Big Curling Iron</a> the most, mainly because of its very long barrel that measures 8 inches. However, all of our testers thought that Mr. Big’s curling results were lacking and that its long clamp was unnecessary.</p>
<p>The Mr. Big Curling Iron was our fastest heating curling iron, reaching an incredible 412 °F in only two minutes and 41 seconds. However, because of this curling iron’s unwieldiness, we recommend opting for the Hot Tools if you have very thick hair and are looking for a curling iron that offers temperatures above 400 °F.</p>
<p>For its large size, Mr. Big is relatively lightweight, weighing 1.2 pounds. However, this iron is unnecessarily cumbersome to manipulate around your head, particularly for those with average-length hair. Even if you have long hair, there are curling irons which offer better results, such as the Beachwaver.</p>
<h3>Vivid &amp; Vogue &#8211; Travel Curling Iron</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-17438 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue.jpg" alt="Vivid and Vogue travel curling Iron" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Do you have short hair and travel a lot? If the answer is yes, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B074KG5FXK/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vivid &amp; Vogue &#8211; Travel Curling Iron</a> is a good option for you. If the answer is no, you should probably invest in a larger curling iron. This curling iron has a tiny 3.75-inch barrel and weighs less than a pound.</p>
<p>The Vivid &amp; Vogue has a very simple temperature switch that offers only high or low temperature settings. Its high-temperature setting measured about 350 °F, and its low setting measured 223 °F. This small curling iron took a longer time to reach its maximum temperature, clocking in at around eight minutes.</p>
<p>This extremely lightweight flat iron is simple and cheap, costing around $15. It is a solid flat iron for those with thin, short hair who travel a lot. However, its small barrel and overall lower quality make it a poor choice for everyday use or for those with hair that falls below their shoulders.</p>
<h2 id="others-not-recommended">Other finalists we do not recommend</h2>
<h3>Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curl Secret</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E68O4JU/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curl Secret</a> was the only fully automatic curling machine we tested. Initially, it visually and conceptually intimidated our testers. This machine requires hair to be placed inside two plates that are pressed together and then automatically curl hair inside a curling chamber. However, in practice the Conair was very easy to use and would not curl any piece of hair that was tangled.</p>
<p>This curling machine was extremely quick to reach its maximum temperature. We found that it reached 397 °F in two minutes. Because the Conair &#8211; Curl Secret only has two temperature settings, which we measured to be 372 °F and 397 °F, this curler is only suited for those with normal to thick hair.</p>
<p>Despite its ease of use, our testers were all dissatisfied with the curls produced by the Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curl Secret. Our tester with the shortest hair was unable to use the machine because her hair was not long enough for the machine to properly funnel into its barrel. Our testers with longer hair thought that their curls came out too crinkled. Therefore, we recommend spending time practicing your technique with a manual curling iron, rather than settling for the subpar results of the Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curl Secret.</p>
<h3>Bed Head &#8211; Curlipops Curling Wand</h3>
<p>To put it simply, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007ISRNJS/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bed Head &#8211; Curlipops Curling Wand</a> is too hot. When tested on hair of normal thickness, this curling iron burnt follicles to the point of producing smoke. With only one heat setting at 400 °F, our tester with fine hair was unable to try this curling iron due to risk of serious hair damage.</p>
<p>Our heat test showed that this curling iron’s advertised 400 °F temperature is accurate. At seven minutes and 20 seconds, it took a bit longer than average to reach its maximum temperature. This curling iron is suited for those with very thick hair that requires high heat.</p>
<p>The Bed Head iron also lacks an automatic shutoff function. Paired with its high heat, this deficiency poses serious safety concerns if you forget to unplug your curling iron. Even if you have hair that needs to be curled at this high temperature, our testers ranked this curling iron’s curls as slightly below average.</p>
<h3>NuMe &#8211; Classic Curling Wand</h3>
<p>Like the Bedhead, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B011LSFDE2/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NuMe &#8211; Classic Curling Wand</a> only has one heat setting, which frustrated our testers who all wanted more accurate controls. While its temperature is advertised to be a super-hot 410 °F, we measured it to be around 350 °F. That means this curling iron is only suited for those with hair of normal thickness.</p>
<p>Because the NuMe has a 100-percent ceramic barrel, it takes over 10 minutes to heat up to high temperature. This measured to be the longest heating time of any of our finalists.</p>
<p>Our testers also found the NuMe’s handle to be uncomfortable and thought it was unwieldy to use. This curling iron lacks an automatic shutoff, but still commands a higher price tag at around $70. We recommend you skip this curling wand and instead opt for either the affordable Xtava or the luxury Neuro.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Overall, we were pleased to find that you can get a great curling iron or wand without breaking the bank. With proven performance, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXS1OXQ/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xtava &#8211; Twist Conical Curling Wand</a> earns our pick for the best curling wand.</p>
<p>Our testers were impressed with the Xtava’s smart, easy-to-use, digital temperature system as well as its overall sleek appearance. This curling wand’s graduated barrel delivers a tousled curl that our testers universally appreciated. The Xtava comes with professional features, such as an automatic shutoff and dual voltage, yet only costs around $20.</p>
<p>On the more expensive side of curling wands was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FVHH2H6/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neuro &#8211; Unclipped Styling Rod</a>. This curling wand was loved by our testers because of its smart digital controls, quick heating time and salon-quality results. This curling wand has the widest temperature range of our finalists, ranging from 160 °F to 450 °F. That makes it suitable for a wide variety of hair types, and its straight barrel can be used to create a variety of looks.</p>
<p>If you prefer the clamp of a traditional curling iron, we have two top picks based upon the length of your hair. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S28DKO0/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Beachwaver &#8211; S1</a> scored well with our testers with average to long hair, who appreciated its auto-rotation feature.</p>
<p>The Beachwaver’s large handle is very comfortable and has large buttons that are easy to use. It also has smart digital temperature controls that can be set at increments of 10 °F. However, the Beachwaver’s lowest temperature is 290 °F, which means it’s not suited for those with very fine or damaged hair.</p>
<p>For those with short hair looking for a small-sized curling iron, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073GG2WN4/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Anjou &#8211; 1-Inch Curling Iron</b></a> is your best bet. This curling iron offers great results and smart digital controls for a bargain at approximately $25. This curling iron’s overall light weight and long power cord make it easy to use around your head. Its shorter, 5.3-inch ceramic barrel is well suited for those with short- to medium-length hair.</p>
