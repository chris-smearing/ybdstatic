								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen it comes to trimming and shaving the delicate bikini area, gentle grooming tools are key — especially for those with sensitive skin. With the help of tender-skinned, irritation-prone testers, we tried out eight of the highest-rated bikini trimmers and bikini razors on the market and selected three standout performers.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QYOSKFS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips Norelco &#8211; GoStyler</a>, a men’s body trimmer with an easy-to-maneuver body and small trimmer head, turned out to be ideal for the bikini area. Our runner-up was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079C81WDS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veet &#8211; Sensitive Precision Beauty Styler</a>, a women’s trimmer that cuts hair effortlessly and also wins points for its light, ergonomic design. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0092K7C1O/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gillette &#8211; Mach3 Men’s Razor</a>, another men’s tool, won in the best bikini razor category for its narrow head and extra-close yet gentle shave.</p>

<li><a href="#bottom">The bottom line</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>We kicked off our research with a visit to Amazon to find out which bikini trimmers and razors were rated the highest by users and why. Then we compiled a list of the features most sought after by women in a trimmer or razor.</p>
<p>Reading through subreddits, trusted product review sites and Amazon customer reviews helped pinpoint the problems faced by users with sensitive skin, as well as the tools they’d personally tried that had provided the smoothest trim or shave with the least irritation.</p>
<p>Given the volume of discussion surrounding how to minimize irritation while trimming and shaving sensitive skin, we decided to dedicate a separate category to the best bikini trimmers and razors for sensitive skin. We also consulted with cosmetologist and skincare expert <a href="https://www.facebook.com/brushedbysabrina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sabrina Orchid</a> about her trimming and shaving best practices, and how to avoid irritation.</p>
<p>Once we were fully educated and up to speed on bikini hair removal, we selected five trimmers (three of them designed especially for sensitive skin) and three razors that boasted high customer ratings on Amazon and checked the boxes of our desired features: affordable tools that were easy to hold and maneuver and delivered a quick, close yet gentle shave or trim with minimal nicks or irritation.</p>
<h2 id="pink-tax">Are men’s grooming products better?</h2>
<p>While researching women’s bikini trimmers and razors, it was impossible to ignore the number of men’s grooming tools that had received high ratings from women for delivering a smooth, nick-free trim or shave specifically in the bikini area. These products often outranked women’s trimmers and razors designed especially for the pubic area.</p>
<p>This observation begged the inevitable question: Do men’s grooming products deliver a higher quality trim/shave than women’s products? (Spoiler: The answer is <b>yes</b>, according to our tests. Scroll down to see our testing results.) Consumer Reports even <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/electric-razors/buying-guide/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> in their Electric Razor Buying Guide that they’ve chosen not to test any women’s models because they had performed relatively poorly in trials — but that there was no reason why women couldn’t use men’s shavers (insert side-eye here).</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dca/downloads/pdf/partners/Study-of-Gender-Pricing-in-NYC.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> published in 2015 by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, women pay an average of 13 percent more than men for equivalent personal care products and an average of 11 percent more for women’s razor cartridges than men’s cartridges. This phenomenon, dubbed the Pink Tax, has stirred up a good amount of outrage.</p>
<p>A quick search online unearthed long and heated subreddit discussions regarding the superiority of men’s grooming products over women’s — often for a fraction of the price. This was also a recurring theme in Amazon customer reviews of men’s body hair trimmers and razors, in which women often raved about how much better the product in question had performed in comparison to those specifically designed for women.</p>
<p>Women’s brands clearly have some catching up to do when it comes to bikini trimmers and razors. In the meantime, we decided to include three highly rated men’s trimmers and razors (which also passed our testing criteria with flying colors) in our pool of contenders.</p>

<h3>Bikini trimmers</h3>
[table id=307 /]
<h3>Bikini razors</h3>
[table id=308 /]
<h2 id="versus">Bikini trimmers vs. bikini razors</h2>
<h3>Bikini trimmers</h3>
<p>Because trimmers cut hair <i>above</i> the skin, without the blade actually coming in contact with the skin, they’re a great choice for women with sensitive skin. There’s no razor burn to worry about, a smaller chance of irritation or ingrown hairs and virtually zero chance of cutting yourself. With trimmers, women can keep the bikini region neat and groomed without shaving everything off. However, though you can usually choose a hair length setting, you’ll never be able to cut your hair as close as you can with a razor.</p>
<h3>Bikini razors</h3>
<p>For the purpose of this article, we’re going to focus on the two types of razors best suited for the sensitive bikini area: cartridge razors and electric foil shavers.</p>
<p>Cartridge razors come in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0092K7C1O/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">3-blade</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SMIIR0W/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">5-blade</a> and even 7-blade varieties, and the number of blades you choose comes down to personal preference. Some razor users claim that less blades scraping the skin equals less irritation; others say that razors with more blades reduce the number of swipes required for a smooth, irritation-free shave. Cartridge razors are a good choice for women who want a close, baby-smooth shave.</p>
<p>The “foil” in the head of an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01APRR4ME/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">electric foil shaver</a> is a thin, perforated sheet of metal covering the razor itself where hairs enter the shaver and are cut by the oscillating blades underneath. Because only the foil comes in contact with the skin — never the actual blades — electric foil shavers tend to cause less irritation than cartridge razors.</p>
<p>Some electric razors are wet/dry, which means you can either use them on dry skin or wet with shaving cream, which typically gives a closer shave. Electric foil razors are convenient and great for traveling (or anytime you don’t have access to a shower); however, they usually don’t deliver as close of a shave as cartridge razors.</p>
<p>Whether you choose to use trimmers or a razor for your bikini area, when you’re just starting out, it&#8217;s a good idea to trim hair down with scissors to about a quarter of an inch, which prevents your trimmers or razor from getting clogged.</p>
<h2 id="tips">Trimming and shaving tips for sensitive skin</h2>
<p>Our bikini-area skincare expert, Sabrina, recommends dedicating one razor to the bikini area only, rather than using the same tool for bikini, legs and underarms. In her own experience, she has also had better luck using a shaving cream instead of a gel.</p>
<p>“My two go-to shave creams are Coochy Oh So Smooth Shave Cream and Cremo,” says Sabrina. “Apply the cream first thing when you get in the shower, wait to shave last in your routine, apply the cream again and shave. Doing this will help make sure the hair is as soft as possible and the skin is prepped.”</p>
<p>Sabrina also points out that tending to your skin outside of the shower pays off in a big way when grooming the bikini area. “Dry brushing can help beforehand, as well as using witch hazel after to help calm skin. To prevent ingrowns, I use PFB Vanish + Chromabright. If you have extra sensitive skin, make sure to toss or change out your razor blades weekly, and store your razor outside of the shower.”</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Wet vs. dry</h3>
<p>When choosing the best bikini line trimmer for you, it’s important to note that many electric trimmers and razors advertised as “waterproof” are not actually impervious to water. Even if the product box is plastered with terms like “water-resistant,” “shower-ready” and “waterproof,” we recommend reading the manufacturer’s instructions or even contacting customer service before taking your trimmer or shaver into the shower with you.</p>
<p>While some electric trimmers and razors are truly waterproof, be forewarned that the majority are only intended for dry trimming and shaving, sometimes with the option to detach and rinse the head under running water.</p>
<h3>Trimmer skin guards/combs and hair-length settings</h3>
<p>To achieve your desired hair length and keep your tool’s blade from touching skin, bikini trimmers will either feature a built-in skin guard/comb that can be clicked into various hair length settings or include separate, manually attachable combs of different lengths. Some skin guards/combs feature rounded tips for an extra-gentle glide — a bonus for those with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>When selecting your trimmer, consider how closely you want to trim your hair down there. Are you aiming for a super close trim? Happy to keep things neat and tidy, but not super short? Or do you want the option of achieving different lengths, depending on the season?</p>
<h3>Blade type</h3>
<p>The best bikini trimmer for sensitive skin will have hypoallergenic, stainless steel blades and foils, to avoid redness and irritation. Bikini razor blades generally fall into two categories: stainless steel and carbon steel, which should be avoided since it tends to rust. Many razors also feature lubricating strips, which are intended to keep skin moisturized as you shave.</p>
<h3>Size and maneuverability</h3>
<p>The bikini zone is one area where an easily maneuverable razor or trimmer is vital. We recommend using slim, compact, lightweight grooming tools and razors with heads that aren’t too wide (no more than 3 centimeters, including attachments) so you can access hard-to-reach spots.</p>
<h3>Ease of cleaning</h3>
<p>As we noted above, some water-resistant bikini razors and trimmers require you to detach the head to rinse them under water, while others are watertight and can just be rinsed off quickly while still intact. Most come with a cleaning brush to help remove tiny hairs from the head. Razors with moisturizing strips can be tougher to clean, since they often end up with more gunk to remove from the blades.</p>
<h2 id="how-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>To test our lineup of eight bikini trimmers and razors, we recruited female testers with especially sensitive skin who had been through the gamut of ingrown hairs, red bumps and general irritation. Our sensitive-skin warriors rated the trimmers and razors on a scale of 1 to 10, using the following metrics.</p>
<h3>Hair-cutting performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>How well does this trimmer/razor groom your bikini area to your liking?</li>
<li>How close of a shave does this razor deliver? Any irritation or nicks?</li>
<li>How well do the skin guards/combs perform?</li>
<li>How effective is this tool’s blade? Do you only need to go over an area once, twice or several times?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Effect on skin</h3>
<ul>
<li>How gentle is the blade on skin? Any irritation, bumps or redness?</li>
<li>What is the effect of this tool’s skin guard/comb on your skin? Any irritation?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Maneuverability and ease of use</h3>
<ul>
<li>How easy is it to grip this tool while shaving?</li>
<li>How would you rate the tool’s size, in terms of ease of use?</li>
<li>Does it reach the areas you want to shave or trim?</li>
<li>How easy is it to clean this tool after use?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Noise level</h3>
<ul>
<li>How would you rate this tool’s noise level? Was it quiet or obnoxiously loud?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Price</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do you think this tool is worth its listed price?</li>
<li>Would you buy this tool yourself, based on its performance and listed price?</li>
</ul>

<p>After mowing our way through eight contenders for the best women’s bikini trimmer, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QYOSKFS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Norelco GoStyler</a> — a grooming tool marketed specifically toward men — was the standout performer, checking off all of our testing criteria and then some.</p>
<p>Although it was neck and neck with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079C81WDS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veet &#8211; Sensitive Precision Beauty Styler</a>, the GoStyler’s winning feature was its capacity to trim all the way down to 1 millimeter — shorter than any lengths offered by the other trimmers. Offering interchangeable 3-millimeter and 5-millimeter combs as well, the GoStyler caters equally to those who want the closest trim possible without shaving, as well as users who prefer a longer, more natural groom.</p>
<p>The GoStyler features stainless steel blades that cut easily and efficiently, requiring only one or two swipes over an area to trim hair to the desired length. Although the GoStyler’s advertising specifically touts its “DualCut” technology (basically, two blades in the head that move speedily from side to side to trim hair), most of the trimmers we tested also featured a two-bladed design.</p>
<p>We experienced zero pulling or irritation during our trimming sessions with the GoStyler, with no nicks to speak of. The buzzing noise produced by this trimmer is not ideal; however, all of the trimmers we tested left something to be desired, decibel-wise.</p>

<p>In a sea of glossy pink, white and lavender women’s trimmers, the GoStyler’s matte black-and-red color scheme is certainly more subdued. Its lightweight, slender body (about 17 centimeters long, with the circumference of an electric toothbrush) fit effortlessly in our hand and was easy to maneuver; the handle’s textured, rubberized surface also provided good grip.</p>
<p>With the comb attached, the end of the GoStyler’s trimmer head was one of two tools we tested that were only 27 millimeters wide (the other was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079C81WDS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veet</a> model). Whereas some of the other trimmers were much too wide for the bikini area, the head of the GoStyler felt appropriately narrow, giving us the option to do more detailed trimming.</p>
<p>According to the manufacturer, the GoStyler is watertight; however, Philips advises against using it under wet conditions because “wet hairs cannot be lifted by the comb properly.” In any case, the trimmer can be rinsed under water and used in the shower if you choose to risk wetting your hairs.</p>
<p>Though this review is focused on its trimming capabilities, it’s worth noting that the GoStyler also comes with a “detail shaver” head — a floating foil-style electric razor head that could be handy for cleaning up the bikini line (though you won’t get as close a shave as you will with a cartridge razor like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0092K7C1O/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gillette Mach3</a>).</p>
<p>The trimmer also comes with a cleaning brush and AA battery, and Philips offers a 45-day money-back guarantee and full 2-year warranty. With its sleek shape, efficient blade and superb maneuverability, the GoStyler feels high-end and expensive for its $19.95 price tag.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Though it’s designed for men’s use, the Philips Norelco &#8211; GoStyler is our top trimmer choice for the women’s bikini area, delivering a smooth, effortless trim that can be adjusted down to 1 millimeter.</li>
<li>With 3- and 5-millimeter hair-length options as well, the GoStyler is a good choice for a variety of trimming preferences.</li>
<li>The GoStyler is truly watertight; it can be used in the shower and rinsed with water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our runner-up for best trimmer is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079C81WDS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veet &#8211; Sensitive Precision Beauty Styler</a>. In many aspects, the Veet trimmer is like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QYOSKFS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips Norelco &#8211; GoStyler</a>’s fraternal twin, delivering the same excellent performance in a glossy pink-and-white package.</p>
<p>Like the GoStyler, the Veet model includes interchangeable combs, though with two length options instead of three: 2 millimeters and 4 millimeters. While the GoStyler features a fully rubberized, textured surface for grip, the Veet model is only partially covered with textured rubber, making it slightly tougher to hang on to. However, it did feel slightly more lightweight in our hand than the GoStyler.</p>
<p>The Veet tool trimmed our bikini area smoothly, requiring only a couple of passes down each “trimming path” to groom the hair to our liking. We didn’t experience any tugging or nicks, and our skin wasn’t irritated or red afterward.</p>
<p>According to the manufacturer, the Veet is a truly wet/dry trimmer. The buzz that emanates from the trimmer is on par with the GoStyler — it’s not obnoxiously loud, but it will make its presence known in your bathroom. In an ironic twist, the femininely designed Veet model’s whine is lower-pitched than the masculine GoStyler.</p>

<p>Like the GoStyler, the Veet feels like a petite, lightweight electric toothbrush in the hand and is easy to hold and maneuver. Its front is coated with rubber for grip, and we wish the back was as well; the shiny white plastic is pretty to look at, but counterintuitive for a non-slip tool. However, the Veet makes up for it with a slightly flatter and wider body, which feels more ergonomic to hold than the GoStyler. With its 27-millimeter head width (with comb attached), this trimmer is narrow enough to maneuver the difficult curves of the bikini area.</p>
<p>Like the GoStyler, the Veet trimmer kit includes an additional head option — a two-sided eyebrow trimmer with 16-millimeter and 6-millimeter hair length options, as well as an attachable eyebrow comb that shortens the length to 2 or 4 millimeters. An AA battery is also included, as well as a cleaning brush. The whole set comes in a clear pink zippered pouch, which is handy for travel. At around $20, the Veet trimmer kit is well-priced for its value, though it doesn’t come with a warranty.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Veet &#8211; Sensitive Precision Beauty Styler trimmed smoothly and efficiently, with no pulling and no irritation afterwards.</li>
<li>This tool’s easily maneuverable design features a slightly flatter body that’s particularly comfortable to hold.</li>
<li>Truly waterproof, the Veet trimmer can be used in the shower.</li>

<p>Another men’s grooming tool, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0092K7C1O/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gillette &#8211; Mach3 Men&#8217;s Razor</a>, is our pick for the best bikini line razor. The Mach 3 has received many endorsements from women for its efficient, gentle, top-notch shave.</p>
<p>The Mach3’s three stainless-steel blades glide effortlessly over the skin of the bikini area, with no roughness or feeling of “catching” on the hairs. After passing the razor over each area once or twice, our skin was literally as smooth as a baby’s bottom. We only nicked ourselves once when, accustomed to shaving with less capable razors, we pressed down too hard mid-swipe. Clearly, the Mach3 requires zero pressure to produce a super-close shave.</p>
<p>Besides that hiccup, we found this men’s razor to be very gentle on the bikini area. Our tester, who has extremely sensitive skin and is prone to red bumps and ingrown hairs, saw no signs of irritation other than three minor bumps the day after she shaved.</p>

<p>In a world of bulky cartridge mega-razors loaded with up to seven blades, the Mach3’s slender, lightweight handle and narrow three-bladed head are ideal for hard-to-reach parts of the bikini area. The rubberized grips on its 14-centimeter chrome handle make it easy to hold on to in the shower, and because its pivoting head measures just 4 centimeters across, we were able to access all the areas we wanted to shave.</p>
<p>Bonus: Since the Mach3 only has three blades, with more space between them than what you’d find in a 5 or 7-blade razor, it rinsed easily after shaving. The Mach3 is priced at around $8 with cartridges running about $2 a pop.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike some bulky bikini razors that were supposedly designed for the difficult-to-navigate pubic area, the Gillette &#8211; Mach3 Men&#8217;s Razor has a compact, narrow head and slim body that make it easy to reach tough spots.</li>
<li>The Mach3’s three stainless-steel blades gave us an incredibly close shave.</li>
<li>Our sensitive-skinned testers experienced minimal irritation after shaving with the Mach3.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After testing a lineup of both women’s and men’s trimmers and razors on the bikini zone, we were most impressed with the men’s tools for grooming the area gently yet effectively. The narrow and efficient <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QYOSKFS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips Norelco &#8211; GoStyler</a> gave us a fast and tidy trim, cutting our hair all the way down to 1, 3 or 5 millimeters with no irritation. Simple to hold and maneuver, the GoStyler won us over with its easy to grip, rubberized body and the closest trim of all the tools we tried.</p>
<p>Our second choice, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079C81WDS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veet &#8211; Sensitive Precision Beauty Styler</a>, performed as well as the GoStyler, with the option to trim hair down to 2 or 4 millimeters. While its body was only partially covered with rubber, we liked its lightweight feel and ergonomic shape.</p>
<p>Out of the razors we tested, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0092K7C1O/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gillette &#8211; Mach3 Men&#8217;s Razor</a>, turned out to be the best shaver for the bikini area. With a narrow, pivoting head and three stainless-steel blades, the Mach3 gave us butter-smooth skin and minimal irritation, even for our sensitive-skinned testers.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After wearing 16 trays and strips for three weeks, the Sparkling White Smiles custom tray system is the teeth whitening kit we'd still use every day.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter months of research and wearing 16 different trays and strips at work for three weeks, we&#8217;ve chosen the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System</a> as the best teeth whitening kit. This is the one system we&#8217;d keep using every day, with custom-made trays that fit perfectly. The kit even includes enough whitening supplies for months of touch-ups. If you&#8217;re looking for strips, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B1X3I1W/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lovely Smile &#8211; Bright White</a> is a reliable, affordable choice.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>Teeth whitening products are, for the most part, re-packaged supplies made for dentists to use in-office or give to patients for home treatment under professional supervision.</p>
<p>The one whitening product that&#8217;s &#8220;accepted&#8221; for at-home use by the American Dental Association is Crest&#8217;s Whitestrips line, which is now in its second generation of products and branded &#8220;Crest 3D White.&#8221; This was an obvious place to start.</p>
<p>When we researched the most-purchased products, though, it&#8217;s pretty obvious that most people who want white smiles don&#8217;t mind buying at-home whitening products that aren&#8217;t formally approved.</p>
<p>Over-the-counter teeth whitening kits use low concentrations of peroxide and are not considered dangerous. The FDA does not regulate teeth whitening kits sold in the U.S. Of course, dentists are quick to point out the uncertainty that comes with this lack of regulation. Dentists have access to stronger whitening products and the training to use them safely.</p>
<p>Written reviews of whitening kits are typically vague about product recommendations, and we didn&#8217;t find any comparative reviews that assess kits against one another.</p>
<p>We did find lots of conversation about teeth whitening on the web. The conversation is mostly about how well whitening works, how quickly it works, and whether it&#8217;s safe to do at home. Subreddits like r/dentistry frequently discuss the pros and cons of at-home whitening.</p>
<p>We looked at the top-selling products available at local discount stores and on major online retailers, and after closely scrutinizing 35 different products and whitening systems, we bought 16 different products to test, including five kits, five types of whitening strips, three stand-alone tray kits and three whitening gel products not sold as kits.</p>
<p>Two of the highest-rated gels we bought, from Philips and Opalescence, are labelled for sale through a dentist but still designed for use at home.</p>
<p>After looking at the range available and talking to a dentist, we decided to test the most popular 35-percent strength in most kits to see if our tester had any sensitivity or other reactions. We also tried a few slightly stronger or slightly weaker solutions.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-whiten">How to whiten teeth at home</h2>
<p>Teeth whitening is very complex. Each person has different teeth and different stains, so it&#8217;s nearly impossible to say what success you&#8217;ll have with a particular whitening method. But the treatment itself is very simple, and the differences between products are minimal.</p>
<p>The ways that dentists will whiten your teeth are well-established. Dentists have been testing whitening treatments in their offices and with take-home kits for decades, and the methods haven&#8217;t changed much. The teeth whitening kits you can buy for yourself are, for the most part, the same thing you&#8217;d get from a dentist.</p>
<p>Whitening teeth involves bleaching built-up organic compounds like tannins from your teeth. This is more than just scrubbing a film off the surface: Whitening products actually remove stains from within the enamel.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>There are two compounds commonly used to achieve this bleaching: hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide. Unstable oxygen-rich molecules in these compounds quickly break down many (but not all) stains.</p>
<p><b>The two molecules are so similar because about 35 percent of carbamide peroxide </b><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/hydrogen-peroxide-urea" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>breaks down directly into hydrogen peroxide</b></a><b>, so the bleaching action is basically identical. </b>Carbamide is more stable in storage, which also makes it take longer to reach its maximum potential effect.</p>
<p>The big debate in teeth whitening is over the best way to evenly apply those peroxides to your teeth — and only to your teeth. Whitening strips stick a peroxide-laced gel onto the front of your teeth, while gel-filled trays can hold a stronger solution in place with a (low) risk of your swallowing it or burning your gums.</p>
<p>Toothpaste with peroxide can also help whiten teeth, though it&#8217;s in such a low concentration that you might never notice any gradual change.</p>
<h3>Charcoal teeth whitener</h3>
<p>Whatever you do, don&#8217;t try to scrub your stains off with an abrasive charcoal powder or use household cleaners in hopes of getting quick results. According to <a href="https://jada.ada.org/article/S0002-8177(17)30412-9/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies of popular products</a>, charcoal teeth whitener toothpaste is usually abrasive enough to do more harm than good. Gentle natural-alternative tooth polishes can be fine as a detergent-free way to keep your teeth clean, but don&#8217;t sacrifice your enamel to get a whiter smile.</p>

<p><b>Whitening strips:</b> The most basic and easiest type of whitening product, these strips of gel usually contain hydrogen peroxide and stick firmly to the surface of your teeth.</p>
<p><b>Trays:</b> If you want to keep a stronger solution of peroxide in better contact with all your front teeth, a tray keeps it on your teeth.</p>
<p>There are four types of trays available:</p>
<p><b>Universal-fit trays:</b> If you don&#8217;t want to go through the trouble of molding a tray to the shape of your teeth, this style will do the job and keep whitening solution or other dental products on your teeth, but they&#8217;re usually not comfortable to wear for more than a few minutes.</p>
<p><b>Heat-moldable trays: </b>These trays are made from a heat-moldable EVA plastic (related to what&#8217;s in a hot glue stick.) When you heat the tray in almost-boiling water, it becomes soft enough to take an impression of your teeth, and you can usually get a perfect fit. Once it’s cooled, you could trim the tray if you want, but the plastic is quite thick. These trays will warp if you rinse them in hot water or leave them in the sun, and then they&#8217;d need to be re-molded to fit.</p>
<p><b>Custom-made trays: </b>These trays are made by a dental service laboratory to fit exactly over plaster copies of your teeth, and excess tray material is trimmed back to the gumline. Your dentist&#8217;s office can make impressions of your teeth and handle the order, but we found many mail-order labs that will sell you a kit to make impressions at home.</p>
<p><b>Disposable Trays: </b>This is a new type of product from Opalescence. Their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IU5EDKK/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GO system</a> uses waxy, moldable trays that come pre-filled for full-coverage whitening without having to squirt any peroxide gel out of a tube.</p>

<p>Whitening strips are some of the most popular whitening products on the market, and for good reason: Starting with the introduction of Crest &#8211; Whitestrips in 2001, at-home whitening went from scary to dentist-approved.</p>
<p>The Crest line of whitening strips from Procter and Gamble is still the only at-home bleaching brand with the <a href="https://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/ada-seal-products/category-display?category=Bleaching+Products" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Dental Association&#8217;s Seal of Acceptance</a>. That means they&#8217;ve paid a lot of money to run patient trials to show that the product works as described and is safe.</p>
<p>One downside to whitening strips is that the peroxide-carrying gel isn&#8217;t able to fill in all the nooks and crannies of your smile: If you have overlapping or crooked teeth, the strips are likely to whiten the forward-facing parts and leave other parts untouched.</p>
<p>The other downside to whitening strips is that manufacturers use vague terms to describe the strength of what you&#8217;re buying. Percentages of active carbamide or hydrogen peroxide are always listed for gel-and-tray systems, but the concentration of active ingredients are rarely listed on whitening strips.</p>
<h2 id="side-effects">Who should avoid teeth whitening?</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.ada.org/en/member-center/oral-health-topics/whitening" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADA&#8217;s summary of clinical trials</a>, sensitivity and gum irritation are the primary known side effects of whitening. These side-effects will subside, but for a weeks-long course of treatment you&#8217;ll want to know what you&#8217;re in for.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got cavities, whitening could put hydrogen peroxide directly in contact with the nerves and blood vessels in your roots, so if you have any suspicion of decay, you should definitely get a check-up before whitening.</p>
<p>If your gums are irritated already — even just from eating something like popcorn — you&#8217;ll be more likely to feel a sting from the whitening gel if you get it on your gums. Some of the kits we tested recommend rinsing with salt water before a whitening treatment to determine if your gums will be hyper-sensitive to the peroxide.</p>
<p>Another warning we saw in whitening directions is about uneven whitening: Mineral deposits will not bleach at the same rate as the rest of your enamel. Likewise, if you&#8217;ve got veneers, partial prosthetic teeth or anything other than tooth enamel in your smile, whitening products will only bleach your real tooth surfaces.</p>

<p>The sad reality is that quick-acting whitening products are also more likely to make your teeth hurt. Studies have shown a <a href="https://www.cda-adc.ca/jcda/vol-65/issue-4/201.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">64-percent rate of complaint</a> among patients with a fairly low concentration of 10-percent carbamide peroxide (or 3.6-percent hydrogen peroxide) which still takes 2 to 3 days of hours-long treatment to show any results.</p>
<p>When we asked officemates about their experiences with teeth whitening (whether at a dentist&#8217;s office or at home), we got similar feedback: Not everyone will have problems with tooth pain after whitening, but many people do.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vanhaywood.com/uploads/articlespage/NGVB%20Limit%20Indic%20JapUKTB06.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Dr. Van Haywood</a>, increasing the strength of the peroxide solution doesn&#8217;t give a linear increase in whitening performance, which means that doubling the strength won&#8217;t necessarily whiten twice as fast. But the effect on sensitivity does increase more directly, so if you&#8217;re trying out at-home whitening you&#8217;ll probably want to stick with a lower-strength product and plan to use it for longer.</p>
<p>The good news, is that you don&#8217;t sacrifice overall results with weaker solutions: Teeth will only whiten a certain amount with these treatments, so using extra-strong products just gets you there more quickly.</p>
<p>Many dentists will suggest a sensitivity-fighting toothpaste like Sensodyne, which contains fluoride and potassium nitrate, both of which <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11820045" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been shown in studies to help reduce sensitivity</a> without reducing the effectiveness of whitening gels. We found suggestions on Reddit that you should start brushing with a sensitivity-fighting toothpaste (or massaging it into your teeth) even weeks before you start bleaching.</p>
<p>Some whitening gels we tested already have potassium nitrate and fluoride in the gel, including the two big-name products we tested: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0141J993Y/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Zoom DayWhite</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00147X6DQ/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Opalescence &#8211; PF</a>. The less-expensive all-in-one at-home kits did not have these ingredients.</p>
<p>Philips also adds a re-mineralizing &#8220;amorphous calcium phosphate&#8221; solution in their whitening gel that’s designed to help restore the surface of your teeth. This is the main reason we found to buy the more expensive whitening gel; in most other ways they&#8217;re identical to other carbamide or hydrogen peroxide solutions on the market.</p>
<p>If you want to stick to the more commonly available whitening products, you can still help reduce sensitivity with a specialized toothpaste containing stannous fluoride, potassium nitrate, Amorphous Calcium Phosphate (ACP) or Colgate&#8217;s proprietary &#8220;pro-argin&#8221; treatment. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078HQ48JX/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sensodyne&#8217;s fluoride-and-potassium</a> product is the best-known over-the-counter brand in the U.S., but ask your dentist about specialized products that might suit your particular sensitivity.</p>
<p>Nova-min is another compound that has worked very well in clinical trials, but after GlaxoSmithKline bought the rights in 2012, they&#8217;ve basically removed it from the North American market. You can buy Nova-min toothpaste from overseas, if you&#8217;re willing to pay a premium. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EF39784/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Here&#8217;s an Amazon listing for the import Sensodyne formula</a>.</p>
<h2 id="one-day-results">Can you whiten teeth in one day?</h2>
<p>Ideally, a tooth whitening system would work instantly. Few of us plan what we&#8217;ll look like at important meetings or in photographs much more than a week in advance, much less a month’s worth of hour-a-day treatments.</p>
<p>As we mentioned above, the downside to using stronger concentrations of whitening agents is sensitivity, but there&#8217;s another factor to remember: Whitening results vary, and you might not get any better result with an expensive in-office treatment than you would with a take-home kit.</p>
<p>If your dentist offers in-office &#8220;power bleaching&#8221; treatment, you&#8217;ll probably have access to the latest in light-activation tools and stronger concentrations of whitening product than you&#8217;d be comfortable using at home. If you really only have one day, a dentist will be able to give you reliable and safe results.</p>
<p>If you have the time, however, a long-term treatment should be just as effective (and much more affordable) than in-office options.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s one major hurdle to testing whitening products: Everyone&#8217;s results will be different. No two smiles are alike, and you can&#8217;t know if the stains that you have will be as easy to remove as another person&#8217;s. We tested with a single subject who has mildly sensitive teeth and no cavities or gum problems.</p>
<p>That said, there&#8217;s a reason all of these products use hydrogen peroxide (and carbamide peroxide, which breaks down to become hydrogen peroxide) as their whitening agent. It&#8217;s been proven to work, and it&#8217;s predictable. Every whitening system designed for effective at-home use is based on peroxide bleaching.</p>
<p>We bought 13 different whitening products, and our tester used them over the course of three months, focusing mostly on differentiating ease of use rather than the effect of the active ingredients.</p>
<p>We tested the activity of the peroxide gels in a coffee-stain test to make sure that these kits aren&#8217;t including fake or watered-down supplies, but it&#8217;s impossible for us to say anything more conclusive than that about results.</p>

<p>First, we laid out each kit and compared the instructions given. We found that the guidance from each product was similar, though some kits were definitely more thorough.</p>
<p>Instructions for shaping the mouthguard were almost always more detailed than instructions for applying the whitening product itself. Instructions for using whitening strips, which we admit are a fairly simple type of product to use, were almost non-existent.</p>
<p>We were expecting some clarification or guidance related to how long to use each product, but in most cases the recommended treatment times included wide ranges and seemed almost arbitrary. If you leave the bleach on your teeth longer, you&#8217;ll get more of an effect, but these suppliers are wary of making promises.</p>
<p>Standout instructions came with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System</a>, which is a good thing since a mistake mixing silicone putty and taking an impression could result in a wasted kit. Thankfully, Sparkling White Smiles also offers an extra tray’s worth of impression putty.</p>
<h3>Ease of molding process</h3>
<p>Timing is important with two-part silicone putty, since it hardens within a minute of mixing, but the heat-molded trays in the other kits required watching for signs that the walls were beginning to droop and acting immediately. One tray left in for a few seconds too long stuck to itself (like the instructions warned) and required a complete do-over.</p>
<p>Most kits include spare heat-moldable tray materials, just in case. Instructions for the kits were adequate, with no real stand-out winners. The timing for when to remove the tray from the hot water, when to put it in your mouth, and keeping all the edges from sticking together was surprisingly complex but manageable.</p>
<h3>Fit and comfort</h3>
[table id=288 /]
<p>Our tester used each tray-style kit to make impressions of his teeth. For most of the heat-shaped trays, the fitting process was repeated once or twice to get a comfortable and secure fit that wouldn&#8217;t leak whitening gel out or saliva in.</p>
<p>The trays from the Sparkling White Smiles lab were, of course, the best-fitting. The quality of fit from the shape-it-yourself trays was surprisingly good, despite our tester&#8217;s lack of experience with the process. Thinner material, like the AuraGlow and Cali White trays used, was easiest to shape.</p>
<p>We tested three other generic heat-formable whitening tray products to see if there was any difference between what&#8217;s included with whitening kits and other popular options. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nova White</a> is the only company selling trays that are notably different, with thicker, textured plastic that curls rapidly if you let it get too hot. With some practice, the thicker plastic allows for an excellent fit.</p>
<p>Two kits we tested included universal-fit trays that don&#8217;t require heat-molding. Cali White includes this as an option along with two trays you can heat-mold, but the highly-rated <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079SNKQJX/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MySmile &#8211; Teeth Whitening Kit</a> only has a universal tray.</p>
<p>After trying two days of whitening with the giant trays, we don&#8217;t recommend them at all. This is definitely one-size-fits nobody, and for our tester, having a giant piece of plastic wedged in his mouth only led to uncomfortable half-hour sessions dealing with excessive saliva.</p>
<p>If heating the custom-fit trays scares you off, then whitening strips or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IU5EDKK/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Opalescence &#8211; GO</a> system are better options.</p>
<h3>Bleach strength</h3>
<p>We tested the strength of each solution on a piece of paper dyed with concentrated coffee.</p>
<p>The big surprise with this test is that whitening strips and some of the thicker gels are basically inactive unless they get wet. On dry paper, they had almost no bleaching effect at all. But after we washed the residue off the paper from the first test, we started to see bleaching in those areas.</p>
<p>The relative difference in activity between the different solutions, which range from an equivalent of 6-percent hydrogen peroxide up to 15 percent, was hard to see in this test. The difference in effect was more noticeable between thick and thin gel than it was between strong and weak concentrations.</p>
<p>Based on what we&#8217;ve read about the effects of peroxide bleaching on different people, it seems like a weaker solution over a longer period of time will have the best outcome. This means more time with the trays in your mouth, and also more days before you start expecting results, but usually less pain from sensitized teeth.</p>
<p>That said, the common 35-percent carbamide peroxide gel included in most over-the-counter kits is popular for a reason. You should see some results in a week, even with half-hour daily whitening sessions.</p>
<h2 id="led-whitening-kits">Does LED whitening do anything?</h2>
<p>LED lights is the most polarizing part of over-the-counter whitening systems. It&#8217;s obviously an effective marketing strategy for companies like HiSmile and Express Smile Atlanta capitalizing on celebrity instagram endorsements.</p>
<p>Three of the kits we purchased included lights: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072LF2356/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cali White &#8211; Deluxe Whitening System</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079SNKQJX/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MySmile &#8211; Teeth Whitening Kit</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M63SQTI/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Crest &#8211; 3D White Whitestrips with Light</a>.</p>
<p>Theoretically, these lights could possibly make a small difference by heating up the peroxide and drying out your enamel.</p>
<p>Note that the ADA does list the whole Crest &#8211; 3D White line as &#8220;accepted,&#8221; but <a href="https://www.ada.org/en/member-center/oral-health-topics/whitening" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they also clearly state</a> that from their reviews of published research they don&#8217;t think light-activation makes a difference.</p>
<p>The lights included with over-the-counter kits aren&#8217;t even close to the equivalent of a light-activated treatment at your dentist&#8217;s office. Those machines use a laser or other high-wattage system, not 50 cents worth of cheap LED emitters. Even those expensive in-office light systems might not be making much of a difference, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4178330/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some studies show</a>.</p>

<p>We tried these three LED systems for a few sessions, to be thorough, but then we tried some control tests on paper and an eggshell. Masking off part of the test surface with foil to see if the light was making a difference, our tests showed no change in whitening with the light, even after 10 repeated treatments.</p>
<p>Our tester was happy to put all the LED parts back into the boxes and go back to whitening with just trays and gel. Taking a selfie with a strange device hanging out of your mouth is kind of cute, but it&#8217;s awkward enough wearing just trays or strips every day.</p>
<p>After looking at research and actually trying the LED systems, we can&#8217;t help thinking this phenomenon is an elaborate prank.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System</a> is a professional-grade whitening setup at a price that&#8217;s almost impossible to beat. For about the same price as a few boxes of Crest &#8211; Whitestrips, you get truly custom-crafted whitening trays and a generous supply of carbamide peroxide gel.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever had orthodontic work done, you probably know the teeth impression procedure: A dental assistant has you bite down on a plastic tray filled with silicone putty, then after the putty solidifies they send away the impressions to make castings of your teeth. After that, they can more easily make dental devices that fit the exact shape of your teeth.</p>
<p>Lab-made whitening trays use exactly that same procedure, but in the age of next-day shipping, you can get trays made without an office visit and at a much lower price. Yes, you have to mix the putty yourself, but that&#8217;s one of the few differences between this kit and getting trays made at the dentist.</p>

<p>Mixing and molding the impressions of your teeth with the included putty is a straightforward procedure, and the instructions included are thorough. The two pieces of putty are a little bit firmer than silly putty, and the colors make it easy to see when you&#8217;ve mashed them together long enough to mix. You then have a few minutes to press your teeth into the putty with the provided tray and wait for it to harden.</p>
<p>If you have difficulty making one set of impressions, Sparkling White Smiles includes enough putty to make one extra impression, and they&#8217;ll walk you through the process if you run into major trouble.</p>

After you send in your impressions these trays will get back to you in a few weeks, and then you'll have a complete at-home whitening setup just like your dentist would sell you.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Once you make your impressions, drop the trays and address form in the mail and your completed trays will be mailed back to you in two weeks. If you&#8217;re in more of a hurry than that, Sparkling White Smiles also offers rush shipping for $22. You have to include a check or credit card info for express service or spare trays.</p>
<p>You can also order a custom-fit soft night guard that&#8217;s thicker than the whitening trays for an extra $46. The whitening trays are thin, so if you&#8217;ve got a major teeth-grinding problem, you might want to shell out for the dedicated guard. $46 isn&#8217;t cheap, but this is still much less than paying most dentists to have a guard made.</p>
<h3>The rest of the kit</h3>
<p>Based on the trays alone, the relatively high cost of the Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System might make the popular mold-it-yourself tray kits like AuraGlow a more obvious option. With enough gel for 50 treatments, though, the $80 we paid for this system was well worth it.</p>
<p>The gel included with the Sparkling White Smiles kit is 22-percent carbamide peroxide. That&#8217;s weaker than many popular kits, which isn&#8217;t a bad thing. Many dentists recommend concentrations as low as 10 percent for at-home treatment, with much longer treatment times to ensure maximum effectiveness. The instructions suggest treating for 30 minutes twice daily with this solution, which is more tray time but less risk of tooth pain than other systems.</p>
<p>Other manufacturers selling the same strength of product, like Opalescence, suggest up to two hours of treatment time with this strength of solution, but it&#8217;s best to consult your dentist if you have specific questions about finding the right treatment regimen for your teeth.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>If you want the very best at-home whitening system, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System</a> gets you a professional fit for less than $100.</li>
<li>Mailing in impressions of your teeth is an extra step, but that&#8217;s still a lot quicker than making two dentist appointments.</li>
<li>The fit and feel of these trays is perfect, and taking impressions went smoothly.</li>
<li>Sparkling White Smiles includes enough 22-percent carbamide peroxide gel for about 50 treatments.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B1X3I1W/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bright White strips from Lovely Smile</a> are, as far as we can tell, identical to most other whitening strips on the market. The active ingredient is a small amount of hydrogen peroxide, and the strips themselves are thin and adhere well to teeth.</p>
<p>Lovely Smile suggests applying these thrips for 15 to 30 minutes during your first go, and for one hour per day after that. The kit contains enough strips for two weeks of whitening treatments, the same treatment length as Crest Whitestrips.</p>
<p>As we hope has been made clear, there&#8217;s no way to say exactly how effective any particular treatment will be for your teeth, but these strips are a low-risk way to start.</p>
<p>As with any whitening strips, the biggest problem is applying them carefully and evenly. It seems the peroxide in these strips is weak enough that they&#8217;re not likely to cause any harm, but you wouldn&#8217;t want to stick them to your gums every day. If you do find your gums sensitive after using strips, the irritation is temporary and should go away quickly.</p>
<p>Some dentists recommend trimming whitening strips so that they&#8217;re only a wide as you need to cover your most visible teeth, since nobody can tell how white your molars are. Excess strip material means more chance it&#8217;ll be touching your gums or even the roof of your mouth on the inside. The Lovely Smile strips are as easy to trim as the other brands are, and it&#8217;s reassuring that the pieces you&#8217;re throwing away aren&#8217;t as expensive.</p>

Hydrogen peroxide is a proven ingredient for strip-based whitening, and the menthol helps you know if you've applied them correctly.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B1X3I1W?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The only drawback to Lovely Smile strips in particular is the hour-long recommended treatment time: strips are pretty easy to get used to compared to trays, but by the time an hour is up you&#8217;ll be ready to get them out of your mouth. The Crest &#8211; Glamorous White and Solimo strips have instructions for half-hour treatment times.</p>
<p>A tingle from the menthol additive in these strips is also a good indicator that you’ve started dissolving the gel in your saliva or that it&#8217;s stuck to your gum tissue instead of your teeth.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re done with your daily hour of strip-wearing, you&#8217;ll definitely want a place to rinse and brush your teeth. A paper towel works in a pinch to wipe the gel off, but it&#8217;s very sticky stuff. Most of the strips we tested were the same in this regard.</p>
<h3>The drawbacks of whitening strips</h3>
<p>As with any product like this, the sticky gel on the Lovely White strip has to touch your tooth enamel to whiten it. If you&#8217;ve got irregular teeth that overlap or otherwise prevent even contact, strips could inadvertently whiten only some parts of your teeth. Trays are a much better way to go in that case.</p>
<p>If you want the assurance that comes from the American Dental Association seal of acceptance, you&#8217;re going to have to spend about double the price of these strips to get the guarantees of Crest&#8217;s famous white strips. The results you get from the Lovely White strips should be the same.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re turned off by the lesser-known brands recommended above, you&#8217;re in luck: You can buy the same whitening products online that your dentist will sell you, usually at a much lower cost. Our pick is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0141J993Y/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Zoom Day White</a> system. This product doesn&#8217;t come with trays, but that&#8217;s easy to address with off-the-shelf heat-molded trays like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this affordable set from Nova White</a>.</p>
<p>Zoom is a whitening system that&#8217;s been used by dentists since the 1990s. Philips bought Zoom from Discus Dental in 2010, and it&#8217;s now one of the top systems used in dental offices.</p>
<p>We picked Zoom over other high-concentration formulas for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, Philips uses hydrogen peroxide rather than carbamide peroxide, and it should work better in short treatment sessions for most people than the equivalent concentration of carbamide peroxide.</p>
<p>Second, Philips includes a remineralization and sensitivity-fighting formula in this package. Potassium nitrate is the same active ingredient used in sensitivity-numbing toothpaste, and Amorphous Calcium Phosphate (ACP) should help restore the surface of your tooth enamel.</p>
<p>Yes, you can get these sensitivity treatments in a toothpaste, but if you&#8217;re already spending half an hour every day putting fancy goop on your teeth, why not kill two birds with one stone?</p>
<p>Even buying it on Amazon, Zoom isn&#8217;t exactly a bargain. Compared to the rock-bottom price of 47 cents per treatment when you&#8217;re buying generic carbamide gel and heat-molded trays, or a cost of $1.60 per treatment for the perfect fit you get with the Sparkling White Smiles kit, the $3.87 per-treatment cost of the Philips system (including a $10 for a separate set of trays) is steep. But it&#8217;s comparable to the cost of some popular all-in-one kits, and you&#8217;re getting sensitivity treatment along with the higher-strength whitening solution.</p>

If you're looking for the fastest results you can get without booking an expensive hyper-bleach at your dentist, this is a good alternative.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0141J993Y?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The downside to buying professional-grade whitening gel on the internet is that these items aren&#8217;t actually intended to be sold direct-to-consumer. That is, they&#8217;re intended to be sold to you by a dentist, not by a dental supply warehouse running an Amazon store.</p>
<p>This whitening gel is designed for at-home with the guidance of a dentist, and the instructions are written that way. Also, Philips won’t give you a refund as Crest will if you aren&#8217;t happy with your results.</p>
<p>That said, 14-percent peroxide is still low compared to the products dentists will use for one-day whitening treatments. This stuff will sting if it gets on your gums, but it&#8217;s not dangerous unless you put it in your eye.</p>
<h3>Affordable, high-quality trays: NovaWhite</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23497" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite.jpg" alt="Philips - Zoom with Nova White trays" width="2000" height="1335" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-1000x668@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-768x513.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-885x591.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-810x541.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-1000x668.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-320x214.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-885x591@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Philips-and-novawhite-320x214@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re buying the Philips &#8211; Zoom gel by itself, you&#8217;ll also need trays. This is the trickiest part of at-home whitening: Heat-molded trays included in most kits are good enough, but they&#8217;re not foolproof.</p>
<p>Our pick for a stand-alone tray to go with Zoom refills is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NovaWhite heat moldable trays</a>: They conform very well to your teeth and they&#8217;re a bargain at less than $10 for a set of four.</p>
<p>That said, the NovaWhite trays do curl over just a bit more quickly when you&#8217;re heating them in hot water than some of the other trays. We found these to be excellent trays for a low price, but plan on shaping both pairs of trays to get the best fit, and follow the instructions about heating time carefully.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to use name-brand whitening gel like your dentist will sell you, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0141J993Y/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Zoom Day White</a> is one of the best.</li>
<li>Philips tempers the strength of this 14-percent peroxide solution with sensitivity-fighting potassium nitrate.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s also a calcium-restoring gel in this solution</li>
<li>Zoom also comes in lower concentrations, but this is our pick for a fast-acting whitening solution.</li>
</ul>

<h3>AuraGlow &#8211; Radiant Effects</h3>
<p>If you want a complete kit that provides good value, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7Y5P9D/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AuraGlow &#8211; Radiant Effects whitening kit</a> is popular for a reason. The trays included in this kit were a little bit easier to heat and mold than most, with good instructions that resulted in a good fit the first time with no tweaking necessary.</p>
<p>After making seven complete sets of kits, we rank this set close to the top. AuraGlow&#8217;s trays give you a little more leeway when you&#8217;re trying to decide if it&#8217;s time to pull them out of the water. The tray material doesn&#8217;t just curl over and stick to itself if it&#8217;s in the hot water two seconds too long.</p>
<p>Your results may vary, of course, with do-it-yourself heat-molded trays. That&#8217;s why we picked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System</a> as our top choice. The thicker, softer plastic of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NovaWhite</a> trays also felt just a little bit tighter overall once we tweaked them with a re-heat and a second attempt at getting a perfect fit.</p>
<p>The gel that comes with the AuraGlow kit isn&#8217;t any worse than what comes with the Sparkling White Smiles kit; it&#8217;s a bit stronger, but you should be careful about keeping it off your gums either way. At $1.50 per application, this set is about half the cost of buying Philips &#8211; Zoom refills and a set of trays, without any of the fancy additives included there.</p>
<p>Compared to the cost of the very least-expensive products available, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004BLXG5U/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SensAllis gel refills</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nova White trays</a>, this kit looks more expensive. Buying the most economical supplies comes out to one third the price-per-application of an AuraGlow kit, though you might never use up all that gel.</p>
<p>On the whole, the AuraGlow kit makes the most sense if you intend to stop whitening after using the one month of included treatments. A month of 35-percent carbamide should theoretically get you all the improvement you&#8217;re likely to see, but results vary.</p>
<h3>Cali White &#8211; Deluxe Whitening System</h3>
<p>If you just have to have a selfie with an LED light for your Instagram story, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072LF2356/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cali White &#8211; Deluxe Whitening System</a> is the LED-bundle kit we&#8217;d pick over the others we checked out.</p>
<p>For about $5 more than AuraGlow&#8217;s kit, Cali White includes a universal-fit tray, which is actually much more awkward than it looks. The included heat-moldable trays are practically identical to the trays included with AuraGlow&#8217;s kit, and you get the same amount of carbamide peroxide gel.</p>
<p>Cali White goes out of their way to promote the benefits of baking soda, cranberry seed extract and aloe in their whitening gel, but it&#8217;s still carbamide peroxide doing the work.</p>
<p>The LED light included is kind of neat, but so far as we can tell it doesn&#8217;t speed up whitening in any way. We tried it, and it&#8217;s more annoying than it could possibly be worth.</p>
<p>Overall, the Cali White kit isn&#8217;t a bad buy for the trays and peroxide gel, but there&#8217;s no reason to pick it over the AuraGlow system.</p>
<h3>Opalescence &#8211; GO</h3>
<p>The take-home universal-fit <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IU5EDKK/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Opalescence &#8211; GO</a> system is unique in that it offers many of the advantages of both tray systems and whitening strips.</p>
<p>This product includes a universal-fit tray that&#8217;s pre-filled with Opalescence hydrogen peroxide gel, but it&#8217;s a moldable wax tray. You put the plastic holder over your teeth, squeeze the tray to fit just right, then remove the plastic.</p>
<p>Sadly, this isn&#8217;t as easy as it sounds. The trays are quite large to fit a wider range of mouth sizes, which means you need to carefully judge how far up and back to move them before you can squeeze them into shape.</p>
<p>These trays have far more gel than we&#8217;ve seen suggested by any filling instructions in other kits — there&#8217;s even gel for the inside of your back molars, just in case your date is shining a flashlight into your mouth.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re squeezing gel around as you mold the tray to fit your teeth, and this is Opalescent&#8217;s thick glue-like gel, not the watery stuff most kits come with. It&#8217;ll stay in place fairly well, but it&#8217;s not as easy to wipe off your gums.</p>
<p>Once you get the hang of how these trays work, they can be made to fit very well. Opalescence is popular with dentists, so if you have questions about strength or timing your regular dentist might be more likely to give you advice. It&#8217;s not as comfortable using this system as strips or custom-made trays, but it&#8217;s better than non-molded trays.</p>
<p>On the whole, we&#8217;re not sold on the value of this product. It&#8217;s not really harder to learn how to fit a heat-molded plastic tray than these waxy trays, and this product is far more expensive than anything else we tested.</p>
<p>At nearly $6 per set of trays, the best reason to go with this system is if you want to share a package with someone for a quick week of touch-up whitening, or you really hate the idea of squeezing hot plastic into your mouth.</p>

<h3>Solimo &#8211; 10-day kit</h3>
<p>Direct from whatever factory makes all of these strips for everyone, Amazon brings you their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CNW4LN5/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Solimo-branded 10-day whitening kit.</a> With the same active ingredients as Crest &#8211; 3D White Whitestrips and the slightly less-expensive Lovely Smile strips, the main reason to pick this set would be if the Lovely White 14-pack is out of stock. The differences between the products are minimal.</p>
<h3>Crest &#8211; 3D White Whitestrips</h3>
<p>We tested both the 3D White <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001OOLLVS/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glamorous White</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M63SQTI/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">&#8220;With Light&#8221;</a> packages, and the differences are, again, minimal. In our control test to check peroxide-bleaching activity, these strips gave very similar results on coffee stains. The main difference is the taller, narrower strip you&#8217;re given for your bottom teeth in the Glamorous White packages, and of course the $34 LED light.</p>
<p>Crest&#8217;s &#8220;With Light&#8221; package also comes with directions that suggest using the strips for a full hour, rather than Glamorous White’s half-hour. It&#8217;s possible that the hydrogen peroxide solution is weaker in the “With Light” package, but Crest might also be using the difference in directions to suggest better results from the more expensive kit.</p>
<p>The LED light from Crest, as in the other kits, showed no effect on the activity of the peroxide in a controlled bleaching test. It&#8217;s possible it could warm your teeth slightly, but it&#8217;s a very small and low-power light source.</p>
<p>The one edge Crest has over the other strip-type whitening kits is that they&#8217;ve spent a lot of money getting the necessary research in place to earn the <a href="https://www.ada.org/en/press-room/news-releases/2017-archives/june/crest-3d-white-glamorous-white-whitestrips-to-receive-ada-seal-of-acceptance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Dental Association&#8217;s Seal of Acceptance</a>. While that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean this system is better than other whitening products, it does mean that it has been proven to work safely in a lot of tests.</p>
<p>Crest (owned by Procter and Gamble) is the only consumer-sale whitening product manufacturer that has successfully applied for the Seal on a whitening product. They&#8217;re in a similar place to P&amp;G&#8217;s Oral-B <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-electric-toothbrush/">electric toothbrushes that we tested</a>: This brand proven, but that doesn&#8217;t mean other brands are selling ineffective products. The ADA won&#8217;t tell us if a company has ever paid up and still failed to earn the Seal on an over-the-counter product.</p>
<h3>Lumist</h3>
<p>The whitening strips from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BFWQEZG/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lumist</a> are the most unique of all the strips we researched. Rather than have just a plastic backing on a sticky peroxide-carrying gel, Lumist makes their backing more formable and stretchy. You can mold these strips around tooth features that the other strips will just bubble and crease on, ironically making Lumist a more three-dimensional solution that Crest&#8217;s so-called 3D Whitestrips.</p>
<p>Lumist uses 20-percent carbamide peroxide in these strips, which makes them faster-acting than other strips and potentially as quick as a tray and gel solution. The price of the Lumist strips is the weak point, though; at $6 per treatment, they’re almost as expensive as the stronger and more comfortable-to-wear Opalescence &#8211; GO trays.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Whitening your teeth at home is a bit like changing your own oil: it&#8217;s not for everyone, but nearly anyone can learn how to do it if they&#8217;re motivated. It&#8217;ll also save you some money.</p>
<p>For the best results, you want a set of plastic trays that will be comfortable to wear for a half-hour to an hour at a time. These trays should also conform exactly to your teeth, keeping the whitening solution on your enamel and off your gums.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System</a> gives you the precision and quality of a tray your dentist could sell you, but without the overhead of paying for an in-office assistant to mix the silicone putty. Along with excellent trays, you get an all-inclusive package with enough whitening gel to last for months.</p>
<p>If $80 is more than you can afford to spend on whiter teeth, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B1X3I1W/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lovely Smile &#8211; Bright White</a> whitening strips will get you two weeks of basic treatment for less than $20. You can expect to see a basic improvement in shade with this system, and whitening strips are recommended by even the most cautious dentists.</p>
<p>If you need speedy results, we like the higher-concentration, fast-acting hydrogen peroxide offered in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0141J993Y/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Zoom Day White</a> system. This solution comes with sensitivity-fighting and mineral-restoring compounds mixed in, so the extra sensitivity from faster-acting peroxide should be minimized. You&#8217;ll need to buy trays like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">these from Nova White</a> separately, though.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After three months of testing against beard trimmers and electric shavers, the Philips- OneBlade is our pick for keeping stubble perfectly groomed.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter three months of head-to-head testing with beard trimmers, electric shavers and conventional razors, the OneBlade is our pick for keeping a stubble-beard at a perfect balance between scruffy and groomed. It might be a good choice as a shaver if you don&#8217;t need smooth results, and it does double-duty with body hair attachments.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078BDHV9P/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips – OneBlade Face + Body</a> has a unique blade design, one of the only successful new designs since motorized hair clippers were invented. Rather than just making a row of v-shaped shears sliding against each other, Philips took the one-dimensional trimmer concept and made a new blade that cuts on both edges.</p>
<p>These are also much thinner blades than most clippers have, so you can cut very close to the skin without risking scratches from the tips of the blade. This means that you get real contrast between areas you want to look clean and areas where you want to leave some scruff.</p>
<p>The downside to this blade design is that you can&#8217;t sharpen the blades. Once they stop cutting effectively, you need to buy a replacement blade unit. They cut well for four months with most hair types.</p>
<p>Like most new electric shavers, the OneBlade is completely waterproof. That makes cleaning easy, and you can shave, trim your beard or groom your body hair in the shower. The Lithium-Ion battery in this upgraded model also lasts for a long time.</p>

<p>The Philips &#8211; OneBlade is the first successful attempt at an electric device that can be both a good hair trimmer and a good electric razor. These technologies have been around for nearly a century, and the OneBlade is a blend of the two mechanisms that performs both tasks.</p>
<p>The OneBlade is most similar to a hair clipper, but the OneBlade uses razor-thin plates instead of heavy, thick clipper blade plates. This means the edges can still cut close without scratching you with pointed cutting tips.</p>
<p>In many ways the thinness of the blades makes the cutting action of the OneBlade more like an electric shaver, where the distance between the moving blade inside and your skin is determined by a protective foil. The OneBlade doesn&#8217;t cut on the flat face of its head, though, just along the two edges.</p>
<h2>What about the other OneBlade?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JZ88HJ5/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OneBlade Core</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HBBR9FC/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hybrid</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GINTAP8/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesis</a> are a family of innovative single-edge safety razors from a high-profile Austin startup. That OneBlade brand is not directly related to the Philips-Norelco hybrid electric trimmer this review is about. But it&#8217;s still a product you should know about if you&#8217;re interested in shaving.</p>
<p>This other OneBlade is a company that set out in 2002 to design the perfect razor, and when the Genesis model launched in 2015 it was universally lauded as an excellent shave. Much like a modern multi-blade cartridge razor, OneBlade designed the head to pivot while you&#8217;re shaving to maintain the perfect angle with minimal practice required. OneBlade uses a single-edge disposable razor blade that you slide in through a carefully-engineered refill slot.</p>
<p>At $400, the OneBlade &#8211; Genesis isn&#8217;t for everyone, but the newer Core and Hybrid models swap in Tritan polyester for some of the steel parts, so they&#8217;re slightly easier to afford. The specially-made Japanese blades are far less expensive than Mach 3 or Fusion refills, but they&#8217;re still 75 cents.</p>
<p>We haven&#8217;t reviewed that OneBlade, because it&#8217;s the definition of a niche product. If you love heirloom-quality products that push the envelope of design and engineering, it&#8217;s worth looking at. But we&#8217;ve <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-safety-razor/">reviewed double-edge safety razors</a> that also give an excellent shave. They also use common double-edge blades, which are one-third the price even if you buy the fancy brands.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a close shave that doesn&#8217;t require buying $4-a-week cartridges, these razors are all good options; some require more practice, some cost more. The electric OneBlade from Philips takes for granted a different set of needs, which is why we&#8217;re writing this review.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested the OneBlade</h2>
<p>Our resident shaving enthusiast gave his straight and safety razors a break for almost six months while he tested beard oil, beard trimmers and electric razors. The OneBlade was part of our lineup of beard trimmers, but it&#8217;s unique enough that we felt it deserved a separate review.</p>
<h3>Closeness</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/closeness.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>In the course of his time with all the different shaving products, our tester would compare different devices back to back, even taking extra passes after a shave to see if leftover stubble could be picked up by a superior device. That gives a relative ranking of better or worse when comparing minute differences between similar shavers, but we needed a real scale to show differences between trimmers, shavers and razors.</p>
<p>Putting our tester&#8217;s face under a microscope or trying to measure hairs with a micrometer is impractical. We came up with an easier and more relatable way to compare the OneBlade with other shavers: <b>We can compare the feel of the leftover stubble after shaving with these devices based on the time it takes to get similar stubble feel from hair that grows out after a smooth blade shave.</b> Hair growth rates aren&#8217;t universal, of course, so this isn&#8217;t a measurement that will translate to another person, but it&#8217;s one way to evaluate differences between shaving methods.</p>
<p>The OneBlade leaves about the same amount of stubble as our tester can feel after 18 hours of growth. A good beard trimmer like the Wahl will only trim down to something like 48-hour stubble, while a top-class electric razor like the Panasonic can get almost as close as a blade shave, usually about the same difference as five-hour growth.</p>
<p>The variability in this kind of measurement is high. If you take your time and learn the growth patterns in your hair you&#8217;ll get a better shave with any method than when you&#8217;re rushing.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re using a waterproof shaver like the OneBlade, making a wet shave part of your morning routine can also take closeness to another level by ensuring that the hairs are standing up as straight as possible. We covered the essentials of wet shave gear in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-shaving-brush/">shaving brush review</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-shaving-cream/">shaving cream review</a>.</p>
<h3>Ingrown hairs and razor bumps</h3>
<p>A problem with ingrown hairs after shaving, often called razor bumps, has the clinical name pseudofolliculitis barbae. This condition primarily affects curly hair. If it&#8217;s shaved below the skin, the sharpened point on a curled or bent hair can start growing out under the skin and cause inflammation, infection or even scarring.</p>
<p>Razor bumps are a much, much bigger problem than just discomfort. It&#8217;s not an isolated problem, either: The <a href="https://www.aocd.org/page/pseudofolliculitisb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Osteopathic College of Dermatology says</a> this condition affects about 60% of African-American men, but it can be a problem for anyone with curly hair.</p>
<p>Alternatives to shaving like depilatory &#8220;shaving powder&#8221; or other forms of hair removal seem drastic, but when the alternative is scarred-over bumps it&#8217;s no wonder people will try extreme measures.</p>
<p>Keeping pores clean is one way to prevent infections, so a clean razor, good preparation routines and post-shave can help, but keeping the hair from curling under the skin is the only way to fully prevent bumps.</p>
[table id=249 /]
<p>Our tester is fortunate not to suffer from ingrown hairs — if anything, his problem is the opposite, with hair growth patterns that are tricky to cut close. But we checked hundreds of reviews from a half-dozen retailers and other sources to see if there were any reports of ingrown hair problems the way there are with razors.</p>
<p>We couldn&#8217;t find any account of razor bumps from using the OneBlade. Irritation, yes, but not bumps. This seems to be as close as you can shave without risking razor bumps. In comparison, many rotary-type and foil shavers can be almost as bad for ingrown hairs as a blade-shave is.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got curly hair, it&#8217;s probably on the thicker side, too, so you may need to replace the OneBlade heads more frequently than other folks. Philips recommends a replacement every four months.</p>
<h3>Irritation</h3>
<p>Unlike razor bumps, irritation is a fairly easy problem to solve. The OneBlade gives a fairly irritation-free shave, relative to other methods, but you&#8217;ll still need to get used to it. Shaving close with the OneBlade requires going against the grain and laying the blade head flat against your skin, so if you&#8217;re pushing too hard you can still get redness.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got skin that&#8217;s especially prone to razor burn, the OneBlade can be used wet. We tried with the winning products from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-shaving-cream/">shaving cream review</a>, and the slickness of a dense lather definitely helped the OneBlade glide more smoothly. You could also use a light oil for similar results, though clean-up isn&#8217;t as easy that way.</p>
<p>Compared to a good electric shaver, the OneBlade is about equivalent in terms of irritation. It&#8217;s much less irritating than a zero-gapped clipper blade, which can actually scratch your skin if you&#8217;re not careful.</p>
<h3>One trimmer for face and body hair</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/face-and-body.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>If you need a close trim on body hair (whether for swimming, cycling or personal comfort) you may have considered an electric shaver for a smoother result. If you use a foil shaver for body hair, though, you&#8217;re probably not going to want to use it anywhere else. Even if you can clean it with antiseptic.</p>
<p>The Face + Body version of the Philips &#8211; OneBlade comes with two spare blades, and along with a set of stubble and short beard combs it also has two comb attachments specifically to help you with trimming body hair. <strong>This means that you can keep your body-grooming attachments totally separate from your face-grooming attachments, but you get the same close trim everywhere.</strong></p>
<p>Most guys who try &#8220;man-scaping&#8221; are just looking for clean results without risking nicks in sensitive areas, and that&#8217;s where OneBlade excels. In our testing, we didn&#8217;t find a way to get nicks in sensitive areas — you still need to pay attention, but it&#8217;s a safe grooming tool. It also pulls less on thin body hair than foil shavers do.</p>
<p>If you need totally-smooth results like you would get from a razor, or if your hair is especially tough, the OneBlade might not be good enough. Our favorite body hair grooming tool overall is still the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H41JQVR/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bodygroom trimmer and shaver</a>, also from Philips. Check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-body-hair-trimmer/">review of body hair trimmers</a> for all the details.</p>
<p>The Bodygroom will shave closer than the OneBlade, and tickles a little bit less. The trimmer side of the Bodygroom will also handle thick, dense hair better. It&#8217;s a bigger, more expensive and more complicated tool, though.</p>
<h3>Charging and battery life</h3>
<p>The OneBlade charger and battery system are very good. We tested the upgraded Face + Body version, which has a Lithium-Ion battery rated by the manufacturer for 60 minutes of use. In our tests it ran for three hours with no load.</p>
<p>Compared with other older Philips nickel-metal hydride batteries, and all but the very biggest beard trimmer batteries, that&#8217;s a great result. It also charges more quickly than budget-priced cordless trimmers, and the charger is dual-voltage for international use with a converter.</p>
<p>Your biggest problem might be losing track of the charger, since you can probably go for two weeks of daily use without needing it.</p>
<h3>Maintenance costs</h3>
[table id=250 /]
<p>If you think about every purchase as an investment, you&#8217;re probably wondering about the replacement blade costs for the OneBlade. As you might expect, the blades can only be purchased from Philips/Norelco, and they&#8217;re not exactly cheap.</p>
<p>Given a three-year expected battery life and four months of blade life, using the OneBlade every day for six years (which includes buying a replacement unit after three and a half years) will cost you almost $250 total. That&#8217;s about $100 less than a premium electric shaver, and less than a quarter the cost of buying new Gillette five-blade razor cartridges every week.</p>
<p>The long-term cost of the OneBlade shouldn&#8217;t scare you off if it does what you need, since this is a unique combination of trimmer and shaver. But blades for a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-safety-razor/">double-edge safety razor</a> are still by far the most economical way to shave at less than 25 cents for a premium blade.</p>

<p>The Philips Norelco OneBlade is a design that&#8217;s going to be best in a very specific set of uses.</p>
<p><b>The first ideal use-case is for people who can&#8217;t use a razor.</b> Mostly that&#8217;s if you&#8217;re worried about razor bumps. If you want a closer shave than hair clippers can provide, but not the closeness of a good foil shaver, the OneBlade is nearly perfect. Its blades don&#8217;t last as long as clipper blades, but they&#8217;re not as expensive as shaver foils.</p>
<p><b>The other case it&#8217;s perfect for is maintaining stubble.</b> With the short 1mm comb in the Face + Body kit, you can keep some slightly-scruffy face fuzz at a consistent length, but still clean up around the edges easily with the bare blade. All this with one tool.</p>
<p>Some argue that the perfect stubble-beard still involved shaving close below the jawline just in case someone wants to caress or nuzzle you there, but the OneBlade does a great job at keeping up appearances.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got thick beard growth and like the look of close-cropped 3/16&#8243; of growth, but not more, the OneBlade has a set of length attachments that will help you keep it there and clean up the edges.</p>
<p>If any of these situations describe your needs for facial hair grooming and you also trim your body hair, the OneBlade is a great do-it-all purchase. The fact that you can keep your armpit blade separate from your face blade is a great benefit of the replaceable blade design.</p>
<h2 id="did-not-like">What we didn&#8217;t like about the OneBlade</h2>
<p>The consequence is that the OneBlade is also missing some qualities of both systems.</p>
<p>If you have thick hair, the blade may not have enough mass or motor power to cut well. This is more of a problem when trimming or cutting off longer hairs than when shaving. The blades are also disposable, unlike clipper blades which can be sharpened.</p>
<p><strong>If you&#8217;re looking for a smooth shave, you&#8217;re also going to be disappointed by the OneBlade.</strong> Compared to a foil-type shaver, it&#8217;s just not possible to get that close. Electric shavers often use a lift-and-cut mechanism to pull hairs into the cutting edge.</p>
<p>At the very least, shavers allow you to press the protective foil into your skin, so stubby hairs pop through holes to be trimmed off right at the base. To get this close with the OneBlade, you&#8217;d have to press the row of cutting teeth into your skin — something Philips prevents with plastic guard teeth.</p>
<p>Electric shavers are already a compromise compared to the bare blades on a manual <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-straight-razor/">straight razor</a> or <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-safety-razor/">safety razor</a>, which cut with no protective gap or guard between the blade and your skin.</p>
<h2 id="other-versions">Other versions of the OneBlade</h2>
<p>We tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078BDHV9P/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">mid-tier “Face + Body” kit</a>; it has a much better battery and more attachments than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D328DH8/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">base model</a>. For $15 more, we think that’s a great deal, but spending around $40 more on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072DTDVMC/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OneBlade – Pro</a> isn’t quite as compelling.</p>
<p>The Pro features an adjustable guide attachment with a 10mm length, which brings it up to par with the rest of the trimmers we tested for mid-length beards, but the attachment isn’t as wide or sturdy as the guides bigger trimmers like the Panasonic have.</p>
<p>The Pro doesn’t come with the spare guides or blades that you can dedicate to body-hair use, which dampens our enthusiasm for it. You can buy those separately for about $30; you can’t buy a longer guide comb for the base OneBlade.</p>
<h2 id="other-shavers">Alternatives to the OneBlade</h2>
[table id=251 /]
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a trimmer that will help you with a beard longer than 3/16&#8243;, the Panasonic or Wahl trimmers from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-beard-trimmer/">beard trimmer review</a> will give you the length guides you need.</p>
<p>The OneBlade is also not a good pick if you need a smooth-feeling shave. Our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-safety-razor/">safety razor review</a> has great picks for close shaves: The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YJ70NY/?tag=ybd1bld-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Feather &#8211; Popular DE safety razor</a> is a good choice if you need a closer shave than the OneBlade offers but you want to minimize irritation. An even closer shave can be had with a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-straight-razor/">straight razor</a>, though they aren&#8217;t for the faint of heart.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s the time-saving of a dry shave you want, the Panasonic and Braun shavers that won our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-electric-shaver/">electric razor review</a> are also a good way to get a smoother shave than the OneBlade can achieve.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you just need to be technically clean-shaven but you’re not worried about the prickly feeling of stubble, the OneBlade is cheaper than an electric shaver and just as easy to use. If your hair is light enough, you&#8217;ll actually look clean-shaven; it’s a much closer shave than other trimmers.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in cultivating the look of stubble, this trimmer is ideal. The included length guides will help you grow out a tiny bit more fuzz in specific areas, and the bare blade will keep your neck and cheeks looking clean.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a body hair trimmer, the OneBlade isn&#8217;t strong enough for everyone&#8217;s hair, but for most it will do a great job.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Our researcher for this project has used a variety of diaper bags over the years, so we already had some expectations about what to look for. We checked the latest reviews from testing sites like BabyGearLabs and Wirecutter.</p>
<p>We also looked at the latest trends on The Bump, Babylist and Instagram. One trend that we had to make a call on was leather and leather-like bags: After researching user reviews for popular artificial-leather bags we decided that they don&#8217;t stand up to wear-and-tear well enough to be a best pick overall.</p>
<p>Genuine leather is a material that usually wears well in a bag, but water and staining are problems. We also recognize that many people simply don&#8217;t want to use leather or other animal products, so we skipped leather bags, at least for this test.</p>
<p>After collecting recommendations for 24 popular diaper bags, we narrowed the field to a set of finalists. We eliminated bags that had more than a handful of complaints about material quality or flaws in manufacturing. We also picked bags that at least claimed to offer insulated bottle pockets.</p>
<p>We eliminated bags that were expensive without justification in the materials used. Most of the bags we tested came in at less than $70. We did make an exception for the JuJuBe&#8217;s perennial award winner; compared to other bags we looked at in the $150–180 price range,  JuJuBe’s zippers and fabric are actually an upgrade (with a warranty to back them up).</p>
<p>We wanted to find bags with style options, rather than focusing on different diaper bags &#8220;for girls&#8221; and &#8220;for dads.&#8221; For example, the fashion-forward JuJuBe &#8211; B.F.F. comes in a range of &#8220;black-out&#8221; styles to cater to all sensibilities.</p>
<p>We did test a few designs that were aiming to be more trendy, too. We avoided overtly &#8220;tacti-cool&#8221; dad-bags, but we tested some diaper changing pads that you could add to any good backpack or messenger bag that you already trust.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs-diaper-bag">Do you really need a diaper bag?</h2>
<p>Should you buy a diaper bag, or is a regular messenger bag or backpack just as good? The case for buying a new diaper bag might seem to rest on style, but there are some compelling reasons to have a dedicated bag.</p>
<p>Most importantly, there is an essential feature missing from a shoulder bag or backpack: a changing pad.</p>
<p>A changing pad isn&#8217;t always necessary to change a diaper. Sometimes, though, you see a puddle on that already-sketchy changing table in the mall. Many public restrooms can make you wonder why you don&#8217;t carry a bottle of bleach solution everywhere.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t even have a changing table to work with, a diaper bag changing pad can&#8217;t make every location suitable, but it really helps in situations where you&#8217;re not prepared to sacrifice your baby&#8217;s favorite blanket.</p>

<p><strong>If you already have a bag you like and just want to make it into a diaper bag with a changing pad, check out our reviews of <a href="#changing-pads">add-on changing pads below</a>.</strong></p>
<p>But there&#8217;s another reason you should think about buying a new bag: A dedicated diaper bag means you don&#8217;t have to shuffle diapers and other essentials in and out of your favorite backpack or shopping bag.</p>
<p>Additionally, a diaper bag eliminates confusion about which bag has the diapers in it when a spouse or sitter has the baby for a few hours. Nothing&#8217;s worse than realizing you brought the wrong bag on a day trip just as certain smells begin to fill the car.</p>
<p>A dedicated diaper bag doesn&#8217;t automatically re-stock itself with diapers, so picking the best bag doesn&#8217;t solve all your problems. But knowing exactly where to stash your emergency supplies is at least a start to winning back some sanity. This is the bag you&#8217;ll take everywhere you go with your baby, so make sure it&#8217;s a good one.</p>

<p>We started our testing with a survey of seven experienced parents, many of whom had three or more kids already out of diapers. We asked them to rank the importance of factors like storage capacity, specialized organization options and backpack straps versus shoulder slings.</p>
<p>After in-depth testing of all the bags, we ranked them against these concerns. We then asked our group of testers to rank the bags from most-desirable to least-desirable.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[table id=235 /]</span></p>
<h3>Storage versatility</h3>
<p>This is the category where our testers were fairly ambivalent about specific bags. Organizer pockets are a great idea, and they can turn out to be perfect for what you need to keep on hand. Most times, however, a bag is just a bag.</p>
<p><strong>After testing, we decided that the best organization features were options to separate the contents of your bag.</strong> Especially if you have stuff for more than one kid in there, this helps you find a specific item without pulling everything out.</p>
<p>The stand-out bag here is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I0P7WIU/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">JuJuBe &#8211; B.F.F.</a> It combines a spacious main compartment, extra side pockets and organizer pouches to make it practically perfect, even for those parents who keep extra stuff in the diaper bag all the time.</p>
<p>On the flip side, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K2RXRWY/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Obersee &#8211; Bern</a> is a great backpack that really doesn&#8217;t distinguish itself as a diaper bag. The tall compartments and organization features are better for carrying laptops and pens than wipes and spare socks.</p>
<h3>Comfortable straps</h3>
<p>How well a particular bag carries definitely depends on your body, but good straps never hurt. We ranked these bags based on how we felt about them after an all-day outing.</p>
<p>In the case of the two backpacks, we took them on a trip that involved shambling around the SFX airport for hours late at night with a three-year-old and an infant.</p>

<p>The Obersee &#8211; Bern isn&#8217;t going to win awards from backpackers on a through-hike, but it&#8217;s definitely the best diaper backpack for comfort. The closest competitor was the Eddie Bauer, though we have to give JuJuBe credit for designing convertible backpack straps that actually work and keep up with the purpose-built backpacks.</p>
<p>The cross-body straps on the rest of the bags are fine if you only need to wear them for a half-hour, but you&#8217;ll be looking for ways to ditch them after that. This is one area where the convertible JuJuBe and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074Q56ZJQ/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ergobaby &#8211; Coffee Run</a> really stand out.</p>
<h3>Changing pad size</h3>
<p>We used the changing pads for diaper changing and they&#8217;re all good enough — that is, they provide you with the reassurance that your baby won&#8217;t be lying on top of something icky during a change. They&#8217;re all fairly small.</p>
<p>The pads are also waterproof enough, but none of them are large enough to change a diaper in a puddle. Check out our <a href="#changing-pads">add-on changing pad review</a> if you want something bigger.</p>
<p>The Eddie Bauer and Maman bags lose points here because the fabric soaks up a trace of liquid and they also use sponge padding instead of closed-cell foam, so they could trap liquid inside. Water beads up and rolls off quite well, but you do not want to leave these pads sitting in something wet and nasty.</p>
<h3>Insulated bottle pockets</h3>
<p>An ice pack is essential for keeping bottles chilled if you&#8217;re on a day-long outing in the heat, even if you&#8217;re using a fully-enclosed cooler. We found the same results in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">cooler review</a> and when <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-lunch-box/">testing the best lunch boxes</a>: Insulation helps, but you need ice to keep perishable food safe for longer than a few hours.</p>
<p>This is another case where our testers had mixed feelings. If you use a lot of bottles every day, having a way to carry them for a little bit longer at safe temperatures is a big deal. But only one of our testers was really sold on having a bottle cooler integrated into a diaper bag.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re carrying a bottle around for more than a few hours on a hot day, an insulated pocket will do very little to keep it cold. You will need to use an ice pack to keep cooler temperatures on an all-day trip.</p>

<p>The Obersee &#8211; Bern is the only diaper bag we tested with insulation worth noting. It can hold three small bottles along with a slim ice pack, which might make all the difference when you&#8217;re traveling.</p>

<p>Many dads resent diaper bags. The look of most trendy diaper bags mimics designer purses or tote bags, so a handful of enterprising men have started companies to offer alternatives. There&#8217;s now an entire market segment for diaper bags designed around military aesthetics: Stuff like MOLLE-style ladder straps and velcro for clever diaper-joke morale patches.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goruck.com/stories/gr1-aka-the-most-badass-diaper-bag-ever-built/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason McCarthy of GORUCK bags insists that a specific bag design for diaper-bag duty is a ridiculous idea</a>, and he&#8217;s not entirely wrong. McCarthy tells you to buy his $400 GR1, of course. It and a lot of other great &#8220;tactical&#8221; bags are very capable of holding diapers, wipes, a change of clothes and other necessities.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re well aware of the diversity of preferences among parents. Not every dad wants to use an ammo pouch to carry bottles, and not all diaper bags for girls will have pastel floral prints. Happily, there are now diaper bags on the market that suit nearly every possible taste.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[table id=236 /]</span></p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve already said above, though, we don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s as easy as saying your favorite bag for other purposes is also your best choice for a diaper bag.<b> If you&#8217;re splitting play-date duties with your spouse, finding a diaper bag you can both be happy with will save you some confusion when you&#8217;re rushing to get somewhere on time.</b></p>
<p>Fortunately, most of the bags we tested come in at least neutral colors and design options. Our dad testers and our mom testers didn&#8217;t think any specific bag style was objectively &#8220;most neutral.&#8221; Taste is still going to play a big role in what you like. That said, we did have some popular picks.</p>
<p>JuJuBe won big with moms for the huge range of styles available. There are offerings that cover the entire spectrum of fashion sensibilities: many are colorful prints, but they do offer more subdued versions, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K3PLBGD/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the &#8220;Gray Matter&#8221; style</a>. It&#8217;s not going to pass for &#8220;tactical,&#8221; though.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077N4G6DW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eddie Bauer- Traverse</a> won some points in this category with the subdued-but-not-boring textured gray fabric. It&#8217;s only available in that color, but nearly everyone loved it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing stopping you from buying two diaper bags if you can’t agree on one design or shape. Just make sure you and your partner are on the same page about which bag actually has diapers and spare clothes in it.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I0P7WIU/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">JuJuBe &#8211; B.F.F.</a> is a lesson in excellence through compromise. This isn&#8217;t a gigantic bag, but it&#8217;s not too small to carry more than the essentials. It&#8217;s not a bag for all-day trekking, but the comfortable straps can be un-clipped. This is both a great shoulder bag and the best backpack diaper bag.</p>
<p>The fabric is durable, with a Teflon coating that makes it washable and stain-resistant. It feels smooth and supple, a real upgrade from the cheap polyester or even the Cordura-style nylon you find on suitcases and messenger bags.</p>
<p>Organization features are the real key to the B.F.F.&#8217;s success. <strong>The main compartment is spacious and allows for carrying bulky items along with your diaper-change essentials.</strong> The front zippered compartment keeps smaller items from getting lost, and there&#8217;s a no-scratch front pocket that&#8217;s great for sunglasses or smartphones.</p>
<p>The side pockets are great, easily holding baby bottles as well as <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/">our favorite water bottles</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-sippy-cup/">sippy cups</a>. They&#8217;re insulated with Thinsulate, which is very good as far as insulation materials go. On a summer day when you&#8217;re out for more than a few hours, you&#8217;ll still want to use an ice pack inside the bag to maintain safe temperatures for milk or formula.</p>
<p>The founders of JuJuBe came from the world of sneakers, backpacks and sunglasses, and they&#8217;ve put together one of the largest selections of styles and prints available. This is a designer diaper bag, but it doesn&#8217;t sacrifice functionality for style.</p>

It easily converts from a great shoulder bag to a very good backpack, and it's just the right size. The great materials are also backed by a lifetime warranty.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I0P7WIU/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>When it comes to the changing pad, there&#8217;s a lot to love about the quality, but it&#8217;s the smallest pad we tested. The memory foam in the middle provides great cushioning, but it would probably be too thick to fit easily in the side pocket if it were any wider. The pad has one satin and one waterproof side to help with a variety of diaper emergencies and environments.</p>
<p>JuJuBe has been making this bag since 2005 and it&#8217;s a design they haven&#8217;t topped. Some of our friends have used JuJuBe bags for more than five years, and they just don&#8217;t die.</p>
<p><b>Key Takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The JuJuBe &#8211; B.F.F. is a near-perfect balance of style and functionality.</li>
<li>You can make the B.F.F a backpack or a shoulder bag and it&#8217;s great either way.</li>
<li>This bag is not too big for one baby, not too small for two toddlers.</li>
<li>Good materials, zippers and buckles are guaranteed for a lifetime against defects.</li>
<li>JuJuBe promises these bags will stand up to machine washing.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077N4G6DW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eddie Bauer &#8211; Traverse</a> backpack diaper bag has a look that all of our testers liked. It&#8217;s not the height of fashion, but the gray textured nylon has a sleek look that helps it blend in anywhere. This diaper backpack also has some features that make it great for carrying your baby-care essentials.</p>
<p>This is definitely the best diaper bag backpack on a budget. The zippers and other hardware are all fine. Not amazing, but perfectly acceptable for a $50 backpack. The one place where the price shows most clearly is in the changing pad: It will work well enough for a year or so, but the stitching on the edge of the pad started to unravel after washing it once.</p>
<p>Among our testers, the only thing more important than good organization features is good backpack straps. This bag has both. If you weigh it down with books it won’t beat a high-end backpack, but the shoulder straps are still comfortable when the bag is full of clothes and diaper-change supplies.</p>
<p>The main internal compartment is narrower than the JuJuBe, but it&#8217;s still a great diaper bag. There are obvious places for diapers, wipes, and other essentials. Our lead tester took this backpack on a Christmas vacation trip with two kids, and the sheer number of pockets with external zippered access was impressive.</p>
<p><strong>Having a few carefully planned pockets is usually better than having random pockets all over a bag.</strong> That principle becomes apparent when you&#8217;re getting used to a backpack like this. There are many pockets that could hold your keys, wallet or baby&#8217;s favorite pacifier, but the chance you&#8217;ll forget which one you used is high for the first week or so.</p>

The changing pad is the only place where the low price really shows. It's not the best backpack we've seen, but it's just right for diaper-change essentials.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077N4G6DW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The wipe pocket on the side of the bag is a handy feature to have that we quickly learned to appreciate in a late-night airport layover. Tossing a 100-count pack of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-baby-wipes/">our favorite wipes</a> into the bag is less annoying than figuring out how many wipes to load. The side-pocket dispenser makes going back for that last sneaky blob of poop less of a hassle.</p>
<p>Stroller clips are built in to the top of this backpack, so you still have a way to hang it if you&#8217;re just out for a stroll. We know that some people don&#8217;t like stroller-mounting bags since a heavy bag can tip some strollers, but it&#8217;s nice to have the option.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Eddie Bauer &#8211; Traverse looks like a regular backpack, but inside it&#8217;s all diaper bag.</li>
<li>Real backpack straps make this easy to carry for all-day outings.</li>
<li>Our testers all liked the style of this bag.</li>
<li>For the price, quality and materials pretty good.</li>
<li>Wipes are kept handy in a convenient dispenser pocket.</li>

<p>This is a special edition of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B7XUVLW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Skip Hop &#8211; Duo</a> that brings some extra touches to a reliable budget-friendly tote. The handles and buckles all look better than the nylon luggage look of the original model, but the upgraded wipe-clean fabric is also stiff enough to help this bag stay upright better.</p>
<p>Compared to the JuJuBe, this is a smaller bag, about 13 liters instead of 16. But the fact that it&#8217;s tall and slim means it feels even smaller than it actually is while carrying loads of baby gear.</p>
<p>The real downside to the slim-and-tall shape of this bag is when you need to carry heavy, bulky stuff. Pumps, lunch boxes and shopping items have to be narrower than three inches to fit down to the bottom of the main compartment. That&#8217;s not a big problem since it&#8217;s a bag that will mostly carry folded clothes, diapers and wipes. However, if you like carrying a jumbo-size package of wipes you might be surprised at how much it fills the space.</p>
<p>This is a cross-body shoulder bag only, which means if you&#8217;re on an all-day outing you may start to resent it flopping around at your side. The shoulder strap is decent, but nothing special. Skip Hop has also sewn in a set of stroller attachment loops.</p>
<p>There are some simple but very effective organization features in this bag. The side pockets are a good size for bottles, and they&#8217;re zippered so the bottles sit inside the bag. This way you get even better insulation than you would with a bit of padding on the outside of a pouch pocket.</p>

The SE style options are more limited than for the regular Duo, but in either case you get a tote that holds plenty and still feels small.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B7XUVLW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p><strong>A zippered accessory pocket on the top holds as much as a mid-size purse — it won&#8217;t keep your glasses safe from your keys, but it&#8217;s a great catch-all for stuff you don&#8217;t want to lose in the bottom of the bag.</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a key-clip ring conveniently positioned on the zipper pull (we&#8217;ve never met anyone who used a key-keeper that&#8217;s hidden inside a pocket), but it doesn&#8217;t actually have a clip. Points for making it potentially useful, but none of our testers actually used it.</p>
<p>Front pockets on the Duo have magnetic buttons that don&#8217;t really do much to keep stuff in if you turn the bag upside-down, but they&#8217;re big enough for <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/">a 32-ounce insulated water bottle like our favorite Klean Kanteen</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a pen loop cleverly hidden in one of the front pouch pockets. We&#8217;d rather keep a pen in the zippered pocket, but at least it won&#8217;t fall out in either case.</p>
<p>The quality of the Skip Hop is not at the same level as the JuJuBe: The fabric stained in one spot after a few weeks and the zippers definitely feel less reliable (though we didn&#8217;t have any problems). Skip Hop won&#8217;t cover damage from a washing machine under warranty either. There&#8217;s a two-year warranty against defects.</p>
<p>The price is definitely a crowd-pleaser, though: Some of our testers assumed it was a $200 bag like the JuJuBe, but the list price is $70 and we&#8217;ve seen it going for as little as $42.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B7XUVLW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Skip Hop &#8211; Duo Special Edition</a> is an even better version of a mainstay budget diaper bag.</li>
<li>You can still hold a lot of diaper-changing gear in this tall, deceptively-slim design.</li>
<li>Special Edition style choices are limited, but they&#8217;re top-tier looks.</li>
<li>While this version only comes in fashion-forward patterns, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J4J243Y/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">regular Duo comes in more neutral styles</a>.</li>
<li>A shoulder bag only, so if you&#8217;ve got a long day you&#8217;ll be relying on the stroller clips.</li>

<p>In many ways, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074Q56ZJQ/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ergobaby &#8211; Coffee Run</a> feels like an attempt to make a better version of the Skip Hop Duo. The shape and pocket configuration are similar, though this is about 40% bigger than the Duo. The big difference is the addition of shoulder straps to make it a convertible design.</p>
<p>On the plus side, Ergobaby has included a big, totally-waterproof changing pad with this bag, six inches wider than most of the others. The organization of the interior pockets is good, and the front zippered pouch is insulated.</p>
<p>Ergobaby is famous for their baby carriers, which are usually made from materials that feel great and have excellent padding. We mostly bought this bag on faith that it would live up to that legacy. It&#8217;s a bit of a let-down that their foray into diaper bags feels like a cheap nylon school backpack.</p>
<p>Even with the water-resistant tub bottom and mesh panels on the shoulder straps, and after looking at the other color options, the look and feel did not impress any of our testers. <strong>Many assumed the Ergobaby was the least-expensive bag we tested, when it was actually more expensive than most at $70.</strong></p>
<p>That said, all but one of our testers said backpack straps are in their top two priorities for diaper bag features. Even if the Ergobaby straps aren&#8217;t exactly class-leading, they&#8217;re better than nothing. Compared to other large totes, like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RYU9FZA/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Skip Hop &#8211; Grand Central</a> or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NBT92X6/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">JuJuBe &#8211; Be Prepared</a>, these backpack straps can really save you from an aching neck when you load up the bag.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KL5LPHK/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Maman &#8211; Designer Tote</a> is putting all their style-eggs in the quilted-jacket basket, and it works pretty well. If you love this look, there&#8217;s a lot to love about the design of this bag, too.</p>
<p>As far as we can tell, this style launched around the same time as the Skip Hop &#8211; Duo Special Edition, so we&#8217;re not going to call out an original or a copycat. The styles are distinct because of the fabric, but most of the actual features are surprisingly similar. That&#8217;s not a bad thing, though, since the Skip Hop tote design has been a great choice since they launched it in 2003.</p>
<p>The same things we loved about the Skip Hop are present here: it&#8217;s a slim, tall tote shape that stands fairly well on its own. Maman gives you places to keep stuff from sinking to the bottom of the bag, but it&#8217;s not an overwhelming number of pockets to lose your keys in.</p>
<p>After using the bag for a few weeks, we started to wonder how well it would resist stains. The waterproof coating on the fabric does its job and it&#8217;s more durable than we expected. The quilt-stitching is almost certainly going to be the weak point in the long-term if you let this bag get buried under other stuff in your trunk or closet: wear on the corners of a bag is one thing, but there&#8217;s nothing appealing about a running stitch on a quilted design.</p>

<p>Obersee has made the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K2RXRWY/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bern backpack diaper bag</a> out of a unique combination of pieces you&#8217;d expect to see other places. This is basically an anti-diaper bag, but in the best way.</p>
<p><strong>If you cover up the labels, you could easily mistake this bag for a SwissGear laptop backpack.</strong> Obersee is a real family-owned American company that mostly sells gymnastics gear, not a giant luggage-brand-conglomerate that just swaps labels, so there&#8217;s nothing disingenuous about saying this was designed as a diaper bag. But the changing pad pocket is definitely a repurposed laptop pocket, complete with a fleece-lined tablet pouch on the side.</p>
<p>This is still a good bag for carrying baby gear. There&#8217;s a full-length zip-up mesh compartment for a change of clothes and plenty of room for whatever you might need to throw inside. There aren&#8217;t any features designed around carrying baby-specific items, but maybe you want a music player headphone pass-through more than a wipe dispenser. We won&#8217;t judge.</p>
<p>There are a few pieces that really do seem like the result of carefully thought-out design and clever innovation. The changing pad is slightly bigger than average, 23 by 14 instead of 22 by 12 inches. It also has a nice easy-cleaning waterproof side, like the Ergobaby changing pad.</p>
<p>The clip-on bottle pocket is a nifty design that does a much better job of keeping two or three bottles cold on a long summer day, but only if you slip an ice pack into the mesh pocket. Without ice it&#8217;s still not really any safer than throwing a bottle in the bottom of a regular diaper bag.</p>
<p>Having a bottle cooler is a great idea. When we took this bag on a trip it was very rewarding being able to store bottles, liquids and gels in it to detach when going through TSA checks before a flight.</p>
<p>Most of the time, though, this clip-on system wasn&#8217;t any better than having a separate bottle cooler bag. If anything, it kind of gets in the way when you need to open the backpack. We found ourselves leaving it detached most of the time we were testing.</p>
<p>If all of that sounds good, maybe this bag is for you. The price was what pushed it to the bottom of our ranking, though: For $80, you can probably find a backpack you like even better and slip an accessory changing pad into it, with money left over for <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-lunch-box/#the-best-small-coolers">a great small cooler</a>.</p>
<h2 id="changing-pads">Changing pad replacements we tested</h2>
<p>If you have a backpack or tote you like already, there&#8217;s nothing stopping you from adding a changing pad to make it a great diaper bag.</p>
<p>We tried the DaffaDoot and Baby Loovi changing pads, both much bigger than the average diaper bag pad and fairly affordable. They&#8217;re also great replacements if you happen to lose the pad that&#8217;s included in your diaper bag.</p>
<h3>An absorbent pad: DaffaDoot</h3>
<p>The first changing pad we tested is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GSJLTS8/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the DaffaDoot</a>. It&#8217;s gigantic — double the size of the average pad. It&#8217;s soft fleece on one side, water absorbent in the middle, and waterproof on the bottom. All that plush material makes this more difficult to fold up and stow in a bag, but it&#8217;s an excellent changing pad.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GSJLTS8/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daffadootCTA.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>A Backup for the Car: DaffaDoot Absorbent Pad</h3><p>This is an extra-large changing pad, but it's also soft and absorbent on one side. We wouldn't want to rely on this as a changing pad on every outing, since you'll have to carry around everything it might soak up in your bag, but for protecting your car's upholstery it's perfect.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GSJLTS8/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a replacement to carry around in a bag, though, all our testers agree that a waterproof pad is definitely better than something that absorbs the kinds of fluids you might encounter during a diaper change. If you have a containment leak in a mall washroom, you want to be able to wipe everything off then and there.</p>
<p><strong>For an emergency in the car (where keeping the upholstery clean is mission-critical) DaffaDoot&#8217;s pad is perfect.</strong> You&#8217;ll probably be happiest if you store it in a plastic bag you can seal well until you have a chance to wash out whatever it soaks up.</p>
<h3>A wipe-down changing pad: Baby Loovi</h3>
<p>We also tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0EU3A5/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baby Loovi change pad</a>, an even bigger pad than the DaffaDoot at 25 by 31 inches. It&#8217;s easy to wipe down after any sort of messy encounter with a leaky diaper.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re the kind of person who appreciates a well-folded roadmap (do they still make those?), or someone who can get a bed-in-a-bag sheet set back in the storage pouch, you&#8217;ll love that the Loovi comes with a storage pouch that&#8217;s just big enough to keep your bag tidy.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0EU3A5/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/babyloovyCTA.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Waterproof Pick: Baby Loovi</h3><p>This is a gigantic changing pad. At three times the size of a regular changing pad, you can probably use it doubled-up most of the time for extra padding. It's still easy to fit in a bag, and you can probably use it as a mattress protector when you're done with diapers.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0EU3A5/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If you can&#8217;t fold things to save your life, The Baby Loovi still a pretty manageable changing pad without the pouch. It isn&#8217;t as cushioning on hard surfaces as the DaffaDoot, but it&#8217;s much better than your average changing pad and easier to carry around.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Buying a diaper bag is a lot like buying most parenting gear: After spending years researching our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-baby-carrier/">baby carrier review</a>, <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-infant-car-seat/">car seat review</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-baby-monitor/">baby monitor review</a> we think it’s clear that parents are faced with overwhelming choices. After carefully selecting and thoroughly testing six diaper bags, we’re confident that this is these picks all have something you&#8217;ll appreciate.</p>
<p><strong>We asked our testers what stood out after using a bag for five years or more, and they told us that backpack straps really do make a difference, but sometimes it&#8217;s also nice to have a shoulder bag.</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I0P7WIU/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">JuJuBe &#8211; B.F.F.</a> is the best example of a do-it-all bag: The straps totally convert from one mode to the other. Either way, the bag is great at keeping stuff organized for one or two babies.</p>
<p>If you prefer a purpose-built backpack or tote, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077N4G6DW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eddie Bauer &#8211; Traverse</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B7XUVLW/?tag=ybddibag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Skip Hop &#8211; Duo SE</a> are great bags too. They don&#8217;t quite live up to the great materials that make the JuJuBe such an unstoppable force in the world of diaper bags, but these two bags are still dependable and well-made for the price.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After weeks spent trying on the best magnetic eyelashes on the market, we found that the Lash’d Up - Natural "i woke up this way" are the only ones worth buying.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent weeks consulting a professional lash expert and testing seven top products to determine <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DXB4CMQ/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Lash’d Up &#8211; Natural &#8211; i woke up this way</b></a> is the best magnetic eyelashes product on the market.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We began our magnetic eyelash review by consulting online reviews from respected retailers like Amazon, Ulta, Target and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. From the get-go, frustration from consumers with the way these lashes were applied and looked was palpable. This was compounded when we began checking out beauty bloggers to get their thoughts on specific magnetic eyelash brands.</p>
<p>However, for every naysayer we came across, we also found bloggers happy about finding a product that freed them from traditional falsies. Often, bloggers would disagree about specific magnetic eyelash brands. Therefore, we picked eyelash brands that garnered the most positive support and conversation.</p>
<p>We also read up on other magnetic eyelash reviews from respected sources such as Elle and Today, and of course, scoured subreddits such as r/MakeupAddiction. We chose our top finalists based on which brands were leaders in the field and which had the most positive feedback from consumers.</p>
<h3>Discontinued Products</h3>
<p>We found that there was a lot of volatility on Amazon regarding magnetic lashes. Four magnetic lash brands we tested were discontinued on Amazon during the course of our testing. The quick appearance and disappearance of magnetic lash products could be a consequence of brands attempting to cash in on a trending product.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, we disregarded any magnetic lashes that had a low number of reviews or were removed from Amazon during the course of our testing.</p>

<p>We won’t lie to you. Applying magnetic eyelashes is no cakewalk. However, if you give yourself about half an hour and follow these tips, you can get the technique down.</p>
<p>There are plenty of magnetic eyelash applicators on the market. We tested the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0778P44J5/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rapid Vitality &#8211; False Eyelash Applicator</a> to apply our lashes. Also, many of our magnetic eyelashes came with a cheaper plastic version of this type of applicator. Neither of our testers found these applicators particularly helpful. Instead, we recommend using <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-tweezers/">tweezers</a> or using the technique described by the lash expert we interviewed, Janelle Friedman. Janelle is the CEO and founder of <a href="http://www.goodjanes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoodJanes Beauty</a>. “This tactic will help to prevent the lashes and magnets from moving too far from the lash line, ensuring they look more natural,” Janelle explains.</p>
<p><b>Step 1: </b>Apply black eyeliner prior to lash application for a smoother blend.</p>
<p><b>Step 2: </b>Line up the bottom lash under your lash line.</p>
<p><b>Step 3: </b>Position the top lash to connect the magnets. Align the top and bottom lashes with your index finger and thumb takes some getting used to, but our testers were eventually able to get the hang of it.</p>
<p><b>Step 4: </b>Apply mascara to blend lashes.</p>
<p><b>Step 5: </b>To take off magnetic eyelashes, place your lashes between your index finger and thumb, then rub your fingers together to gently separate the magnets.</p>
<p>Janelle also recommends investing in a triangulated mirror. These mirrors allow you to see your lash line from multiple angles, which can help take some of the frustration out of applying magnetic eyelashes.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Length of lash</b>: The majority of the lashes we tested were about three-eighths of an inch in length. This is longer than what most people need, but you can always trim your magnetic lashes to be a more manageable length. One of our testers preferred their falsies to be about a quarter of an inch long, while the other preferred a full-length lash. It is a matter of personal preference, largely influenced by your natural lash length and thickness.</p>
<p><b>Material: </b>Magnetic Lashes can be made from synthetic fiber, silk, human hair or mink. Our top pick was made of silk, which we thought looked pretty natural. While we liked the look of some of the synthetic lashes we tested, watch out for those with a plastic, unnatural shine.</p>
<p><b>Full strip or accent: </b>Before buying magnetic eyelashes, you should decide if you want a full strip of falsies or just an accent for your outer eye. We tested both types of lashes and found that accents can be a bit tricky to blend. So, our advice is to go for a full strip and then cut it to the width that works best for you.</p>
<p><b>Amount of lashes</b>: The more lashes, the more dramatic the look. In our testing, we looked for falsies that added some drama to our eyes but didn’t have people asking us if our eyelashes were real.</p>
<p><b>Storage case</b>: All of the lashes we tested were advertised as being reusable. Therefore, a good storage case is important to keep track of teeny-tiny lashes. We wanted a storage case that closes securely, and that has designated spots for lashes.</p>
<p><b>Durability: </b>The last thing anyone wants is for their lashes to pop a magnet the third time they wear them. We tested our lashes multiple times to make sure they were durable enough for multiple uses.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/lashd-up-clip.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We had two testers. One works professionally in the lash industry. She tried on each of our false lashes and answered questions about each lash’s application, material, look and fit. The other tester wore each of our top ranking lashes three separate times to find any possible durability issues.</p>
<h3>Application</h3>
<p>As we said before, applying magnetic lashes is not easy. It took both our testers, even the professional, a while to get the hang of it. <b>There was not much range in difficulty of application, as all of our finalists proved equally difficult to get the hang of.</b> However, one of our testers noted that the One Two Lash &#8211; Founder’s Lash and 3 Second Lash &#8211; Magnetic Eyelashes were a bit easier to apply because they only had one magnet per strip.</p>
<h3>Material</h3>
<p>Most of the lashes we tested were made of synthetic fibers. Our testers had problems with the unnatural, plastic shininess of  3 Second Lash &#8211; Magnetic Eyelashes, AsaVea &#8211; Magnetic Eyelashes and VASSOUL &#8211; 3D Magnetic Eyelashes. In particular, one of our testers said that 3 Second Lash’s product looked “like lashes for a Halloween costume.”</p>
<p>However, our testers were fine with the way the lashes of the Eylure &#8211; Opulent Corner and One Two Lash &#8211; Founder’s Lash sets looked, even though these were also made of synthetic fibers.</p>
<p>We were amazed to find out that the Ardell &#8211; Magnetic Lash Accent #001 was made of human hair, as our testers rated its material as just average looking. Our testers were particularly pleased with the silk lashes of Lash’d Up &#8211; Natural &#8211; i woke up this way, which they described as, “thin and natural looking.”</p>
<h3>Natural vs. dramatic looks</h3>
<p>While trying on our finalists, we asked our testers whether they would use each set for a day look or a dramatic night look. Lash sets that had a large number of long lashes were categorized as dramatic looks, appropriate for a night out or special event. Sets that had fewer lashes were labeled as natural day looks.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that lashes that work for a natural day look still require some mascara and curling to fully blend into your lashes. Day-look lashes also had to be comfortable enough to wear for eight hours straight.</p>
<h3>Fit</h3>
<p>Fit refers to how well the magnetic eyelashes hugged the natural lash line and how comfortable they felt on. This was the “make it or break it” test for our finalists. We had many problems with magnetic eyelashes not curving to the lash line’s natural curve.</p>
<p>Lashes that had two to three magnets per strip generally did a better job at curving along the lash line than those that had one magnet per strip because they had multiple points of contact to bend around. We found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DXB4CMQ/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lash’d Up</a> lashes, which used a two magnet system, had the best fit.</p>
<p>While our testers loved the material and lightweight design of the One Two Lash &#8211; Founder’s Lash, they were unimpressed by the one magnet per strip design, which stuck out too far from the natural curved lash line. The three-second lash also used only one magnet per strip and scored low with our testers.</p>
<p>We were surprised to find that a secure fit was not a big issue for any of our lashes. None of our finalists fell off during the course of testing, even when testers shook their heads or jumped up and down. However, lashes with more magnets felt more secure in general.</p>
<p>Some lashes were a little too wide for our tester’s eyes. This can be easily fixed by trimming off excess lash at the inner corner. Therefore, we did not dock any of our finalists for being too wide.</p>
<h3>Reusability</h3>
<p>All of the lashes we tested were advertised as reusable. However, the reality of being able to reuse teeny-tiny lashes depends largely on having a handy, secure container for them.</p>
<p><b>The best holders by far were the sturdy plastic boxes of the </b><b>One Two Lash: Founder’s Lash</b><b> and the </b><b>3 Second Lash &#8211; Magnetic Eyelashes</b><b>, which were truly handy and easy to keep track of. </b></p>
<p>The Ardell &#8211; Magnetic Lash Accent #001 did not come with a holder, only the cheap plastic tray and cardboard box it came in. We thought that this made these lashes very easy to lose.</p>

<p>Our testers thought that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DXB4CMQ/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Lash’d Up &#8211; Natural &#8211; i woke up this way</b></a> magnetic lashes stood out from the pack because of their ability to curve to your natural lash line. These were the best magnetic lashes we found for all-day looks because of their lightweight design and natural appearance.</p>
<p>These lashes use one full-eye-length top strip with two magnets and two shorter bottom pieces that have one magnet apiece. These strips are pliable enough to be curved along your natural lash line using the two magnets at the inner and outer eye as anchors. Both our testers agreed that the Lash’d Up lashes were easier to get closer to the natural lash line and felt more comfortable than any of our finalists.</p>
<p>The Lash’d Up’s fit makes blending these lashes into your natural lashes much easier because the magnets don’t stick out too far from your eye. However, we still recommend using black eyeliner before application (and mascara after putting on your magnetic lashes) to fully blend them with your natural lashes.</p>

These lashes have two magnets per strip and are extremely flexible, which helps them curve close to your natural lash line.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DXB4CMQ/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Lash’d Up’s lashes are one of the shortest we tested, measuring only about a quarter of an inch in length. The majority of our finalists measured about three-eighths of an inch. The shortness of Lash’d Up’s lashes help give them a more natural curl and overall look.</p>
<p>These silk lashes also have a more natural look because there are fewer lashes in this set than most of our other finalists. This also makes these lashes very lightweight and comfortable to wear. One tester even thought you might forget you had these lashes on after a while.</p>
<p>One downside: The holder for your Lash’d Up lashes is very minimal — just a cardboard box with a plastic tray that slides out. This cardboard box already started breaking during our testing. We fear that it would completely fall apart if you were traveling. We wish Lash’d Up would invest in a more secure carrying case to ensure these lashes don’t get lost.</p>
<p>These lashes were a midrange price of about $15. A few of our finalists offered two pairs of lashes for a similar price, but because of the superior fit and look of Lash’d Up magnetic eyelashes, we are not complaining. This a fair price for magnetic eyelashes that deliver where it counts.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Lash’d Up &#8211; Natural &#8211; i woke up this way</b> magnetic eyelashes are your best pick for a natural day look because of their comfortable fit and lightweight.</li>
<li>Our testers found that Lash’d Up’s dual magnets and flexible strips were better for getting in close to your natural lash line.</li>
<li>These lashes are easy to blend with your natural lashes because of their shorter length, natural curl and silk material.</li>
<li>The holder for these lashes is subpar, but for about $15 you can afford to get a backup set or a better case.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-finalists">Other finalists we do not recommend</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, we were disappointed in the quality and fit of the rest of our finalists. Magnetic lashes are a relatively new beauty trend. Therefore, we are still waiting for a solid competitor to Lash’d Up’s superior quality. We are not able to recommend any of our other finalists, as we discovered during testing that we cannot justify using them over traditional false lashes.</p>
<h3>One Two Lash &#8211; Founder’s Lash</h3>

<p>The most outrageous thing about the <a href="https://www.onetwocosmetics.com/shop/founders-lash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One Two Lash &#8211; Founder’s Lash</a> is the $70 price tag attached to it. While our testers appreciated the natural look of the lash material and their sturdy carrying case (easily the best of our finalists), they were overall unimpressed with the fit of these lashes.</p>
<p>These lashes come with four lash strips per eye. One for your top outer corner, lower outer corner, top inner corner and lower inner corner. Each of these half-length strips comes with one magnet. Our testers liked that these magnets had a handy marking system to keep track of which magnets connected. However, they found that this system did not work well for keeping lashes close to your natural lash line.</p>
<p>Our top pick used dual top magnets as anchors to bend the false lash to match the curve of the natural lash line. However because the One Two Lash’s top magnets are separated, this bending cannot occur. This causes a weird separation to happen between natural and false lash, betraying your use of falsies.</p>
<p>Therefore, despite the obvious quality of the carry case and lash material, we don’t recommend shelling out $70 for these poor-fitting lashes.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/3-second-lash-trade-magnetic-eyelashes-in-black/5011937" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">3 Second Lash &#8211; Magnetic Eyelashes</a> set came with three separate pairs of lashes, two natural looks and one dramatic look. All of these lashes used one magnet per strip system that was not able to hold the lash close enough to the natural lash line. Like the One Two Lashes, these lashes had obvious separation from the natural lash line that was a major problem with our testers.</p>
<p>Our testers also described the material of these lashes as extremely shiny and cheap looking. The dramatic pair included in this set was described by one of our testers as looking like a cheap Halloween costume.</p>
<p>The only upside to this lash set is that it comes with a sturdy carrying case that makes it easier not to lose lashes. However, with the terrible fit and quality of these lashes, you might not care if they get lost.</p>

<p>Our testers found it nearly impossible to blend the dramatic <a href="https://www.ulta.com/magnetic-lash-accent-001?productId=xlsImpprod17631467" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ardell &#8211; Magnetic Lash Accent #001</a> with their natural lashes. These lashes simply have too many lashes to blend at all naturally as an accent lash. Even if you trim these lashes to a more reasonable length, the sheer density of lashes and magnets makes this accent stand out like a sore thumb from your natural lashes.</p>
<p>The Ardell lashes use a three-magnet system, which keeps lashes secure but adds to the visual weight, all located at the outer corner of your eye. Their material was also a bit shiny for our testers’ liking.</p>
<p>To top off this mess, Ardell’s lashes do not come with any decent storage. Putting them back in the cardboard and plastic box they came in is a pain and a mess.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07663DK66/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">VASSOUL &#8211; 3D Magnetic Eyelashes</a> are another hard-to-blend accent lash that frustrated our testers. These lashes were too shiny and thick to properly blend with natural lashes. Our testers also had issues getting the outer corner of these lashes close enough to the lash line.</p>
<p>This could be partly remedied by trimming the outer corner of these falsies closer to their outer magnet, but this still did not solve the glaring distinction between natural lash and false accent.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.target.com/p/eylure-magnetic-lashes-opulent-corner/-/A-53588324" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eylure &#8211; Opulent Corner</a> is also too opulent to blend with the rest of your lashes. In addition, these lashes are too stiff. So even though these lashes have a dual-magnet system, they do not bend enough to sit on your natural lash line. They sit too far down and in a completely straight chunk of dramatic eyelash on the outer corner of your eye — not the look anyone wants.</p>
<p>On the positive side, our testers liked the material of these lashes and the plastic carry case they came with. However, the terrible fit of these lashes makes them impossible to use for an attractive look.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KHBVIH6/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AsaVea &#8211; Magnetic Eyelashes</a> were a very similar story to the Eylure accent lashes. They had too many lashes, all localized in your outer corner, to blend with the rest of your lashes. Also, they too were very stiff, so they didn’t have any of the natural curve that keeps the falsies close to the lash line.</p>
<p>Because these lashes don’t curve along your natural lash line, separation occurs between the natural and false lash, especially near the outer corner of your eye. Our testers also commented that these lash’s material was too thick and shiny to look natural.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After spending over three weeks on our magnetic eyelashes review, we found that your best bet for a natural all-day-look magnetic lash was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DXB4CMQ/?tag=ybdlsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Lash’d Up &#8211; Natural &#8211; i woke up this way</b></a>. What really separates Lash’d Up from the pack is their ability to curve close to your natural lash line, using a magnet at both your inner and outer corners. Our testers also like the more natural amount, thinness and curl of these lashes, which give an attractive look you could wear all day.</p>
<p>Our other finalists, despite having many good reviews, let us down. They did not sit close enough to the lash line and did not look natural enough to justify using them over traditional false lashes.</p>
<p>Our testers found that accent magnetic lashes, on the whole, did not look as natural as full-length lashes because they had more trouble curving with the natural lash line and many had simply too many lashes to blend.</p>
<p>If you want to try magnetic eyelashes, definitely go with the Lash’d Up &#8211; Natural &#8211; i woke up this way. Hopefully, in the coming year, there will be more competitors that offer the same quality as Lash’d Up. However, for now, there are a lot of lackluster magnetic eyelashes that do not sit close enough to the natural lash line to justify buying.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve been going to regular dental checkups in the last decade or so, you&#8217;ve probably been told to buy an electric toothbrush. When our researcher asked his dentist which brand was recommended after a checkup a few years ago, he said very simply that they&#8217;re all pretty good.</p>
<p>/r/Dentistry provides some great discussion about the need for good technique even with a superior toothbrush. It&#8217;s clear that people tend to favor one of the two most popular brands — Oral-B and Philips — but that preference isn&#8217;t based on one obvious preference or another.</p>
<p>After reading reviews from sites like Wirecutter, Techgearlab, and Dentaldorks, it became apparent to us that the differences between brushes would be tricky to test. Consumer Reports, one of the most trusted institutions in unbiased product comparisons, has completely given up testing and recommending specific brushes.</p>
<p>The leading brands are easy to spot; they have TV commercials and YouTube celebrities promoting them. We were curious about up-and-coming contenders, though. There are dozens of other companies making brushes, but are any of them good? Our final list includes three best-selling underdog models that offer features that compete with the big brands.</p>
<p>After noting that heads on kid-specific models were mostly identical to the &#8220;sensitive&#8221; replacement heads made for the &#8220;big&#8221; adult handles, we decided to test brush systems that would work for a whole family rather than testing an entire “for-kids” category separately.</p>
<p>After eliminating obsolete models and closely scrutinizing reviews of the 23 most popular models, we narrowed that list to a set of 12 contenders that we hoped would provide a diverse range of test results.</p>
<p>We included an under-$10 AA-battery-powered brush mostly to calibrate our expectations for midrange brushes, and decided to spring for a pair of ultra-premium brushes just to see what that kind of money can get you.</p>
<p>We decided not to test subscription services this time around, mostly because the new kids on the block seem very similar to the big brands without actually competing on price. (Goby, for example, is more expensive than Oral-B, with fewer features.)</p>

<h2 id="sonic-vs-oscillating">Sonic vs. oscillating toothbrushes</h2>
<p>There are plenty of ways you <i>could</i> make a toothbrush work, from direct-drive gears to ionic plaque removal, but there are two popular types that are easy to find and proven to work:</p>
<p><b>Sonic toothbrushes</b> use a motor to move bristles very quickly with pulses of vibration, somewhere from 250 to 350 pulses per second. (The Sonicare Essence is a middle C at 261 Hz if you check it with a tuner.) A pulse is usually counted as both a back-and-forth stroke, so around 516 strokes per second (&#8220;31,000 brush strokes per minute&#8221;) is a common advertising claim. The vibrations definitely move the bristles, but less than a sixty-<br />
fourth of an inch to either side.</p>
<p><b>Oscillating toothbrushes</b> are almost exclusively made by Oral-B. Rather than vibrating like the sonic types, or spinning the brush head in one direction like a polishing tool, these heads spin in a back-and-forth motion that mimics very quick manual brushing. The brush head rotates back and forth about 125 times per second, with about a quarter-inch of brush movement each cycle.</p>

<p>So, which is better? <a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD004971/ORAL_different-types-of-powered-toothbrushes-for-plaque-control-and-healthy-gums" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cochrane Oral Health reported in 2010</a> that out of 17 trials with 1369 participants, they found no evidence that one type of brush was better than the other.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dentalcare.com/-/media/dentalcareus/research/pdf/triumph/biesbrockjclindenttriumphse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One 2007 study found</a> that the smaller Oral-B heads had an advantage over the larger heads used by Philips, while according to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25597787" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this review in the journal of periodontology</a> and <a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD002281/ORAL_poweredelectric-toothbrushes-compared-to-manual-toothbrushes-for-maintaining-oral-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another review by Cochrane</a>, some of the slight edge that Oral-B has in broad reviews of studies is probably because oscillating heads are tested more often.</p>
<p>Philips claims that their Sonicare system can dislodge and clear gunk (and even plaque) in places that a moving toothbrush bristle can&#8217;t. By all indications, it&#8217;s a system that works: The studies they&#8217;ve chosen to publish on their own site try to show that when you tally all the oscillating-vs-manual and sonicare-vs-manual results, Sonicare is slightly better at removing plaque and keeping gingivitis at bay.</p>
<p>The biggest differences, then, are going to be very personal. Some find the loud, rattling head on the Oral-B brushes to be annoying, while people with ticklish mouths may find the vibration of the sonic brushes unbearable.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Two-minute timer:</b> This is the most important feature of an electric toothbrush, arguably even more important than the motorized bristles. A two-minute timer will encourage most people to brush for the right amount of time, and if it&#8217;s built into the toothbrush you won’t forget it the way you might with an app or countertop timer.</p>
<p><b>Quad pacer:</b> This is an additional feature of better toothbrush timers: Rather than simply notifying you of when two minutes is up, a pacer tells you when you&#8217;ve spent 30 seconds on one quadrant of your mouth. When you&#8217;re using the coaching apps on your phone, Oral-B and Philips actually further divide this with separate timers for your front teeth and each side.</p>
<p><b>Pressure sensor:</b> This feature is designed to warn you when you&#8217;re pressing the toothbrush into your teeth and gums too much, a mistake that can cause gum problems like receding gumlines.</p>
<p><b>&#8220;Smart&#8221; coaching tools: </b>The most expensive brushes include features like a position sensor that tracks exactly how long you brush a particular part of your mouth. They&#8217;ll also track bad habits like excessive pressure.</p>
<p><b>Brush heads for braces: </b>Oral-B and Fairywill sell specialized tips for working around braces, bridges, crowns and other tricky spots. Note that most sonic-type brush makers claim you won&#8217;t special tips if you&#8217;re using a brush with sonic cleaning action, since it can dislodge some material even without direct contact. Which is the best electric toothbrush for braces? After testing a wide variety of types, we&#8217;re confident all of the sonic types work a little bit better than oscillating types, but beyond that there&#8217;s not much difference.</p>

<p><b>Heads for sensitive gums:</b> Softer bristles are better for nearly everyone. In order to get approval from the American Dental Association, brush heads have to use fairly soft bristles that will help avoid gum problems. We found that most of the heads shipped with electric toothbrushes are fairly soft, but the &#8220;sensitive&#8221; heads are also typically a little bit smaller, which we found makes them easier to get around back molars and other tricky spots.</p>
<p><b>Storage for brush heads: </b>In a few cases, the charging stand includes a place to keep spare brush heads. If you&#8217;re sharing a brush handle with a partner, or if your dentist advises that you use a specific accessory head in addition to a regular head, this definitely comes in handy.</p>
<h2 id="ada-seal">Is the ADA seal of acceptance an important feature?</h2>
<p>We looked at brushes listed as &#8220;approved&#8221; by the American Dental Association. They don&#8217;t list many brands, but that&#8217;s partly because it&#8217;s an entirely voluntary standard; a manufacturer has to submit their brush, then prove their marketing claims through expensive clinical trials. Electric toothbrushes only started showing up on the list in late 2017.</p>
<p>To get a direct comment on the real meaning of their list, we reached out to the ADA to learn more about the approval process and the difference between an approved and non-approved brush. They directed us to <a href="https://www.ada.org/en/science-research/ada-seal-of-acceptance/how-to-earn-the-ada-seal/general-criteria-for-acceptance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this page that lists the requirements</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;To qualify for the Seal of Acceptance, the manufacturer of a manual toothbrush must provide evidence that:</p>
<ul>
<li>All toothbrush components are safe for use in the mouth.</li>
<li>Bristles are free of sharp or jagged edges and endpoints.</li>
<li>Handle material demonstrates durability under normal use.</li>
<li>Bristles won’t fall out due to normal use.</li>
<li>The toothbrush can be used without supervision by the average adult to provide a significant decrease in mild gum disease and plaque.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike standards that have easily measured numbers attached to them, like efficiency rating for <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-window-air-conditioner/">air conditioners</a> or clean air delivery rate for <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-air-purifier/">air purifiers</a>, this is a fairly simple pass or fail.</p>
<p>When we asked the ADA if any toothbrush has ever been submitted that&#8217;s bad enough to fail, ADA content specialist Mike Bittern said, &#8220;The list of manufacturers that apply for their products to receive the Seal of Acceptance is confidential information the ADA does not share.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even that requirement to use clinical trials to show a decrease in gum disease is fairly loosely enforced: Oral-B, for example, submitted all of their brushes in one batch with a confusing array of studies to support them, while Philips only submitted one model (and not even their most expensive model).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s safe to assume that the &#8220;average adult&#8221; can get a significant benefit from using just about any toothbrush, seal or not.</p>
<p>If the ADA were making recommendations for a specific kind of electric brush mechanism, or approving a specific brush attachment, we might be inclined to weigh the ADA seal as a more important benefit. As it is, we didn&#8217;t let the lack of a seal stop us from testing or recommending non-ADA alternative brands.</p>

<p>One important question we set out to answer was &#8220;what&#8217;s the difference between a $20 toothbrush and a $200 toothbrush?&#8221;</p>
<p>We were expecting to see more in the way of specific claims and obvious quality differences, but that&#8217;s not what we found at all. The distinctions that set top-of-the-line brushes apart from lowly entry-level models are special touches, but most of them don&#8217;t translate to any difference in your oral hygiene.</p>
<p><b>Bluetooth connectivity</b> is one feature that stood out as carrying the biggest premium and also the least pay-off. Maybe the most significant difference you get with Bluetooth is toothbrush updates: There was every month for the Philips &#8211; DiamondClean; we can&#8217;t decide if that&#8217;s good or just annoying. Practically speaking, Bluetooth serves as a way for manufacturers to make sure you only get the high-end features of their system when you spend more money on a Bluetooth-enabled brush.</p>
<p><b>Position sensors</b> tell you what parts of your mouth you spend the most or least amount of time on. Sensors record in 12 specific zones only (right/front/left in top/bottom inside/outside) but that&#8217;s probably as many zones as we want to track anyhow. The position sensor also tells the app if you&#8217;re scrubbing back and forth too much instead of letting the motor do the brushing.</p>
<p><b>Brush head tracking </b>on the Philips brushes uses a tiny RFID chip on each brush head to help the toothbrush know when you&#8217;ve replaced worn-out bristles, and even to switch modes automatically if you buy a specific head for something like whitening or gum care. It&#8217;s nifty to automatically see all your brush heads in the app, but mode switching is pretty easy with the button and the colored indicator bristles already help you see when the brush is ready to retire.</p>
<p><b>Fancy storage cases and chargers </b>are probably the most obvious perk of buying a high-end brush. Oral-B gives you a place to put four brush heads on the 3000 and the 8000, and the 8000 also comes with a travel case with a USB charge port and smartphone stand built-in for using your app on the road. Philips gives you a decent travel case with the 5100 and all DiamondClean models, and the trademark drinking glass charging stand is standard for the DiamondClean line, but the travel charger and brush holders are reserved for the super-premium DiamondClean 9750 kit.</p>
<p><b>Countertop timers and coaching devices</b> used to be included in Oral-B&#8217;s high-end brush models, but they&#8217;ve been replaced entirely by smartphone apps. If you want a quad-timer display to visualize your brushing progress and pressure feedback without connecting a smartphone or tablet, you can still buy the old Oral-B SmartSeries 7000 for a small discount compared to the new app-only model.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>To find out how well they perform in real-world conditions, a family of three tested these twelve brushes for four months. They compared plaque removal, battery life, clever (and silly) design features, noise and vibration concerns, storage and charger options, and cost of ownership. They also compared Bluetooth-connected apps for the high-end brushes from Philips and Oral-B.</p>
<h3>Evaluating modes and features</h3>
[table id=178 /]
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, for most of us adding more modes to a toothbrush increases the confusion more than the value. The sad truth is that while extra control is nice, none of these features are really worth spending a lot of money on.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s our take on the common features that the big brush makers use to distinguish between their different price levels:</p>
<p><b>Pressure sensor:</b> This is the main feature you pay for in a $40 brush compared to a $25 brush. The pressure sensor will change the brush speed and flash a light to let you know when you&#8217;re pressing too hard.</p>
<p>In theory, this is a built-in coaching tool that helps stop you from wasting time or damaging your gums. In practice, we found it pretty easy to figure out how much pressure to use, and the pressure sensors that were calibrated to a lighter touch would always go off when brushing around the back molars.</p>
<p>We were a bit surprised to find out that if you bear down a little bit too much with the Greater Goods &#8211; Balance it will basically stop brushing. The manufacturer says that this isn&#8217;t intentional, but it works about as well as the pressure sensor on the less expensive Oral-B or Philips models.</p>
<p><b>Adjustable power levels and specialized modes:</b> More expensive brush handles in the $70 price range can change the speed or strength of their brushing action to deliver more aggressive (or more gentle) scrubbing.</p>
<p>Among brushes from Philips and Oral-B, you get more control when you pay for a more expensive brush. The $200 Philips &#8211; DiamondClean Smart has specific customization for the strength of vibration within every mode, and we&#8217;ll admit that level of control was appreciated while our mouths were getting used to the sonic tickle.</p>
<p>The biggest distinction among multimode brushes is how you switch settings: A dedicated mode button is simple and sensible, while brushes without the button (like the Oral-B &#8211; Pro 3000) force you to cycle through every mode even when you&#8217;re just turning the brush on or off.</p>
<p>Among lesser-known manufacturers, four or five modes is standard fare, even for a budget-priced brush. Since the major difference we found is comfort, we tried not to give excessive weight to the presence of these modes. The fact that Greater Goods included a mode switch, though, made it stand out.</p>
<p><b>Bluetooth and position sensors: </b>This is the feature that you really have to shell out for. On the most expensive brushes, a Bluetooth connection to the app allows the companion app to track where in your mouth you scrub too quickly or with too much pressure.</p>
<p>We were fascinated by the sophistication of this kind of record and a bit baffled about who would really benefit from all that information.</p>
<p>If a detailed record of how much time you spend brushing your inside-upper-left molars compared to your lower incisors is exactly what&#8217;s been missing from your life, Philips and Oral-B can both deliver. We liked the Philips app a bit more than Oral-B&#8217;s system, but they&#8217;re both capable.</p>
<h3>Cleaning Performance</h3>
[table id=177 /]
<p>We looked for ways to rank daily brushing effectiveness, but after our lead tester tried a few different methods to measure results, we started to realize that these kinds of raw performance tests aren&#8217;t really representative of what&#8217;s important about a toothbrush.</p>
<p>The most effective method for evaluating brush performance is to use dental disclosing tablets; this is basically bright colored dye that stains plaque and tartar on your teeth so you can see it. You&#8217;ve probably been through this routine with your dentist: Brush as normal, chew the tablet, and see what you missed.</p>
<p>The problem with using disclosing tablets to rank brushes is that the tablets demonstrate flaws in the brusher more than the brush. We found that the biggest difference between our test samples wasn&#8217;t that some brushes are better, but that our tester&#8217;s results got better over time with <i>every</i> brush as he started paying close attention to what he was missing.</p>
<p>We even went so far as to use acrylic model teeth and a piece of textured nylon to test the brushes in more controlled conditions. But the real lesson was a simple one: The best way to get cleaner teeth is to find out what&#8217;s missing with your current technique.</p>
<p>We need to be crystal clear on this point: You&#8217;re still going to need to practice with an electric toothbrush to get really great results. No brand or type of brush is a magic bullet, and if you&#8217;re expecting a brush to restore a receding gumline or whiten your teeth all by itself, you&#8217;re going to be disappointed.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, dentists have been repeating the same line to us for years: buy any electric toothbrush (seriously, it doesn&#8217;t matter which one) and use it for two minutes twice per day. If you want to maximize plaque removal, gum health or any other specific benefit, the most productive thing you can do is show your dentist how you&#8217;re brushing and get feedback on how to improve.</p>
<h3>Testing softness</h3>
<p>One of the two qualifications for a toothbrush to earn approval from the American Dental Association is that it needs to have soft bristles. The days of wire-stiff toothbrush bristles are over: Brushmakers are using the same nylon filament as before, but with thinner shafts for more flexibility.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a small trade-off here: More flex means less scrubbing and a shorter life before the bristles are worn out, but the reduced risk of receding gums is definitely an outcome we&#8217;re happy with.</p>
<p>We tested softness on ripe tomato skins and hard-boiled eggs. None of the toothbrushes damaged the tomato, but the sonic-type toothbrushes quickly started breaking apart the hard-boiled egg. Oral-B&#8217;s oscillating scrubbing motion should be more gentle on extra-sensitive gum tissue than the competing sonic-type brushes, but only barely. This also means they&#8217;re slightly less efficient at breaking up food between your teeth, but again, only barely.</p>
<p>The bigger concern for sensitive mouths will be ticklishness. If the idea of your teeth resonating in musical tones makes your jaw quiver, Oral-B is definitely the safer bet.</p>
<h3>Battery test</h3>
<p>After running each brush for a week of testing and battery charging, we topped them all off at a full charge and then ran them until they would no longer brush.</p>
<p>One note on these tests: Oral-B&#8217;s brushes use old-fashioned nickel-metal-hydride batteries, while every other brand uses lithium ion. This accounts for a big difference in expected battery capacity, and the results aren&#8217;t surprising once you learn that.</p>
<p>The Fairywill and Brio brushes both showed amazing improvements in capacity over the other designs. That said, even the worst performer (the Oral-B &#8211; Pro 3000 at 44 minutes) will give you three weeks of brushing, and the no-fuss wireless charging stands all work very well to keep your brush at the ready.</p>
<h3>Cost of ownership</h3>
[table id=176 /]
<p>Without a clear performance metric to hang a ranking on, and with so many options to choose from, the cost of buying a toothbrush and replacing the heads became a more and more important factor to consider. We calculated the total cost of ownership for each brush over three years to account for the inevitable death of rechargeable batteries.</p>
<p>When you add a second person buying replacement heads, that cost becomes even more important.</p>
<p>The Philips Sonicare heads are very nicely made, but all of the cheaper competitors we tested claim to be using the same Dupont Tynex nylon (which has been the gold standard for toothbrush bristles since it was invented in the 1930s.)</p>
<p>When Oral-B sells their replacements for one quarter the price of a Philips brush package, you start to question the sanity of adding microchips to disposable toothbrush heads. Sonicare is a premium brand for Philips, and they seem intent on milking that for all it&#8217;s worth.</p>
<p>We factored the brush head replacement cycle on these brushes at four times per year, but bumped the Greater Goods system up to six times per year, since the bristles they ship with are softer than average and will wear more quickly. If you switch to medium bristles, they should last about as long as any of the other bristles; they&#8217;re a better-than-average value either way.</p>
<h2 id="best-for-kids">Finding the best electric toothbrush for kids</h2>
<p>We intended to test and recommend a specific model for kids three years and up, but it ended up being more tricky than that.</p>
<p>Our tiny tester definitely felt that the sonic brushes were &#8220;more tickly&#8221; than the oscillating heads from Oral-B, but the noise of those brushes was just as intimidating. Our parent/toddler team wound up using most of the brushes manually, without turning them on.</p>

<p>The Philips &#8211; Sonicare for kids brush heads are easier to maneuver in a small child&#8217;s mouth than the equivalent Oral-B &#8211; Sensitive brush head. The Philips head is smaller and narrower than other brushes, and that&#8217;s a good thing; Oral-B sticks with their standard size, and it&#8217;s still a bit tricky to get behind molars in tiny mouths.</p>
<p>Oral-B does make a few other sizes and shapes for their &#8220;Stages&#8221; series, but finding and buying them is a mess. (And many are actually bigger than the standard sensitive head.) The electric brush head replacements get mixed in with the manual brushes in store listings, and finding the brush head with the color and character design that matches your kid&#8217;s handle is infuriating. Local retailers we checked had a good selection of character choices when purchasing the Oral-B brush handles, but no replacement heads.</p>
<h3>Brushing apps for kids</h3>
<p>All of the kids toothbrush apps we tested were really just timer apps. They add value in two ways. First, apps make the brushing experience more exciting. Second, they track your routine and reward you for keeping good habits.</p>
<p>Oral-B has the &#8220;<a href="https://oralb.com/en-us/products/compare/disney-magic-timer-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disney Magic Timer</a>&#8221; app. When brushing, you &#8220;scrub away&#8221; bubbles from a static image of the characters on your branded toothbrush, which was fairly entertaining for our tester.</p>
<p>Philips, on the other hand, built their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCMSV0tHW8I" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sonicare for Kids</a> app around a virtual pet: &#8220;Sparkly&#8221; needs its teeth brushed to stay happy, and you get treats and accessories to feed and customize your &#8220;pet&#8221; after you brush. This is the feature that our test toddler really went for: surprise rewards for brushing.</p>
<p>Sadly, your Sparkly doesn&#8217;t get the good stuff (clothes and accessories) without the overpriced <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YAR7ZL6/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bluetooth-connected kid-specific brush handle</a>. Otherwise, the Sonicare for kids app works quite well with any old toothbrush.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re just looking for a toothbrush with smaller, softer bristles and control over the vibration speed, the Greater Goods &#8211; Balance is our pick.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re ready to spend $40 on a Sonicare for Kids brush handle, it does unlock special accessories for your kid&#8217;s &#8220;Sparkly&#8221; pet in the app, but there&#8217;s nothing else about that brush to justify the price tag.</p>
<h2 id="best-value">Top pick: Greater Goods &#8211; Balance</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mode-switching2-sm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WWCX7GN/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greater Goods &#8211; Balance</a> would be a competitive entry at $50 or $90, but the fact that it&#8217;s a great sonic-type brush selling for less than $30 makes it an easy pick for best value.</p>
<p>After three months of testing, we started to realize that we were never going to find an overall winner that would be perfect for everyone. Some people won&#8217;t like the vibration of sonic brushes, though others will definitely appreciate how much quieter they are. Some people will be better off with smaller brush heads, while others will benefit from more efficient brushing with a bigger head. Some people will want to use a variety of modes for things like gum massage and deep cleaning, while others will just be annoyed by the complexity.</p>
<p>Greater Goods has found a good middle ground in just about every category we considered, and the bonus perks aren&#8217;t cumbersome or gimmicky.</p>
<p>The standout feature for Greater Goods at a sub-$30 price point is the quad pacer. The brush makes a cheerful little buzzing pulse as a reminder to move to the next part of your mouth every thirty seconds. No app required! <b>The Balance is the only budget-priced brush with a quad pacer, and this feature is one of the most effective ways to improve your brushing routine. </b></p>
<p>The charger is a compact wireless-charging stand, just like most brushes we tested. Unique at this price point is a battery status light that turns red when you&#8217;ve got about six brushing sessions left. It also indicates when it&#8217;s charging and when it&#8217;s full; the competitively-priced Oral-B &#8211; Vitality doesn&#8217;t have <i>any</i> battery lights.</p>
<p>The battery is big enough for almost a month of brushing between charges, but the toothbrush is still cheap enough that you won&#8217;t be as frustrated when you need to replace it in two or three years when the battery stops working. (And it will; They all will.)</p>
<p>The Greater Goods brushes are on the smaller side, which is better in our experience than having a head that&#8217;s too big. The bristles are soft, maybe even softer than the bristles Philips is using. Greater Goods also sells <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XDFSWZP/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">medium</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077GF68XC/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">firm bristles</a> if that&#8217;s your preference. Our dentists have always encouraged us to go for softer bristles when we have a choice, but the optional firm-bristle replacements will last longer.</p>
<p>Confirm with your dentist about what&#8217;s best for you, but softer bristles make this the best electric toothbrush for receding gums.</p>

At this price, it's a bargain.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WWCX7GN/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>There&#8217;s a textured-silicone tongue scraper on the back of the brush head; it&#8217;s not an especially aggressive scraper, but not bad for a back-of-the-toothbrush design.</p>
<p>The four different modes Greater Goods offers are distinct enough to be meaningful, but as with the other brushes we&#8217;re skeptical that the faster vibrations are really any better at whitening. If the vibration is too much at first, it&#8217;s nice to have the option to use the &#8220;sensitive&#8221; mode. The feature that really stands out is mode switching with a dedicated button; usually that only shows up on much more expensive brushes.</p>
<p>The plaque-cleaning performance of this brush in our daily brushing and simulation tests is exactly what we&#8217;d expect from a sonic toothbrush: slightly better than the Oral-B oscillating system at clearing away sticky material.</p>
<h3>So, why not some other cheap brush?</h3>
<p>Greater Goods has a few unique features: a mode button makes turning the brush on and off much less annoying, and the brush heads are a little bit nicer and have a tongue-cleaner built in. This makes it the best cheap electric toothbrush we found.</p>
<p>Greater Goods isn&#8217;t the only company selling this particular brush design. Just looking at Amazon, you&#8217;ll see that brushes from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072P165L8/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mornwell</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072YVWBXH/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aquasonic</a> appear to be coming off the same production line with a different colorway and packaged with different accessories.</p>
<p>We spoke with Patrick Kohm, operations manager at Greater Goods, and he didn&#8217;t divulge anything about their manufacturing partners on the record, but a timeline is pretty revealing. Greater Goods launched their new Balance toothbrush design in early 2017. Shortly thereafter, Risun Tech founded the Mornwell brand to sell oral care products direct from their manufacturing plant.</p>
<p>We like the design either way, but Greater Goods has a real telephone support team that&#8217;s located stateside.</p>
<p>This brush won&#8217;t automatically make you better at cleaning hard-to-reach spots than any other brush, but we like that it doesn&#8217;t trip you up with a clunky interface or confusing options. This is a great brush at a great price, and in our interactions with Greater Goods customer service, they seem like a company on track to do even more great things in the future.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sonic-type Greater Goods &#8211; Balance has the timer and pace reminder features you need to reinforce good brushing habits.</li>
<li>Adjustable power levels and soft bristles are a win for gum health and sensitive teeth.</li>

<p>If you don&#8217;t want a sonic-type toothbrush, or if you need a specialized brush head for a unique problem you&#8217;re facing, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003UKM9CO/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oral-B &#8211; Pro 1000</a> is a great choice. Oral-B offers the largest selection of brush head types, and the Pro 1000 is the best value in their lineup.</p>
<p>Compared to the smooth, quiet bumblebee hum of other electric toothbrushes, the Oral-B design sounds like a cross between a power drill and a clattering dishtray. The oscillating brush snaps back-and-forth in much larger semi-circular movements than the sonic-power brushes do, and that&#8217;s the trade-off. Since the bristles move more slowly over a larger distance, they&#8217;re still effective at removing plaque without buzzing your entire jaw from the inside-out.</p>

<p>Oral-B&#8217;s other big win is the sheer variety of tools they offer: Iif you need an interdental tip to clean a tricky gap, plus a polishing cup to make the most of your whitening toothpaste, plus a soft brush that you can give your kids, Oral-B has you covered.</p>
<p>Oral-B&#8217;s replacement brushes are also available at a much lower cost than most of the competition <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L5M26DQ/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">when you buy in a 10-pack</a>. By comparison, Greater Goods is competitive even in a three-pack, which is one reason they won our best value pick, but we didn&#8217;t find the Philips Sonicare replacement heads any cheaper than $8.33 each (and you need to buy them at Costco to get that price.)</p>

There's also a full set of brush heads to choose from, with something for every need that they can think up.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003UKM9CO/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>While you&#8217;ll probably regret skipping the features and buying a cheaper Oral-B model, we also consider the Pro 1000 the most expensive toothbrush most people should buy. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DT0K6J2/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pro 3000</a> just adds two extra brush modes, and you&#8217;ll need to cycle through all the modes every time you use the brush (whether you use them or not). The Genius only really adds a position sensor for tracking your brushing habits.</p>
<h3>Compared to other Oral-B brushes</h3>

The battery life on the Pro 1000 is a bit disappointing: Like all the Oral-B brushes, it uses a nickel-metal-hydride battery. Run time is 44 minutes, though. That&#8217;s plenty if you always put the brush back on the charging stand between uses, but when the competition gives you more than double the battery life at half the purchase price, you start to wonder what you&#8217;re paying for.</p>
<p>Oral-B has stuck to their gun with the oscillating toothbrush heads that made them famous. If the idea of a buzzing sonic-type toothbrush in your mouth is a turn-off, we think this is easily the best buy in the oscillating brush category. The heads are about half the price of <a href="https://www.goby.co/products/electric-toothbrush/midnight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the competing Goby subscription system</a>, and you can buy them nearly anywhere.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Oral-B &#8211; Pro 1000 doesn&#8217;t tickle your mouth like a sonic-type brush.</li>
<li>Oral-B makes brush heads with every feature you can imagine, from interdental tips to polishing cups.</li>
<li>This model has all the essential features at a reasonable price.</li>
<li>Oral-B&#8217;s oscillating design works, but doesn&#8217;t seem to clean quite as well as the sonic-type brushes.</li>
<li>The 44 minutes of battery life is adequate, but not competitive.</li>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XT1KDSD/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; DiamondClean Smart Series</a> is the flagship of the Sonicare fleet, and the model 9300 (also called HX9903 depending where you look) gets you the premium features that set this sonic toothbrush system apart.</p>
<p>Bluetooth is the backbone feature for every premium toothbrush currently on the market. Philips tracks every sensor on this brush and records when and how you&#8217;re using it with the smart-device app.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to use an app every time you brush, there&#8217;s really not much reason to buy a brush that costs more than $40. If you do want to use an app, we think the Sonicare app is the best, and this very nice toothbrush will make the most of it.</p>
<p>Another unique feature of the Sonicare system is the replacement heads: The 3-series heads all have unique ID tags that let the brush and the app know which mode they&#8217;re designed for. They also track how long you&#8217;ve been using a specific head, so you can get automatic reminders to replace them even if you&#8217;re using multiple head types or sharing the brush handle with your family.</p>
<p>Automatic mode switching is a great feature, because there are a lot of modes available: Clean, White+, Deep Clean+ and Gum Health all correspond to a specific Philips brush head, but you can manually set any mode you like. You can also choose from three power levels within each mode.</p>
<p>Adjustable power levels are the most compelling feature of this brush, because it offsets the biggest liability of the Philips Sonicare technology: the tickling sensation you get when the brush is vibrating against your teeth, gums or cheek 260 times per second.</p>
<p>We interviewed friends who are long-time users of the Sonicare system, and they all claimed they didn&#8217;t notice the vibration anymore. If you&#8217;re worried about how your teeth will respond in the beginning, adjustable power levels will help you ease into it.</p>
<h3>It is really better for brushing?</h3>
<p>We mostly tested this brush with the standard clean mode, and it tied for first place in our peanut-butter-cleaning test. We&#8217;re not going to say that it will remove more plaque from your teeth than another brush would; that depends on your technique. But this is the most power and versatility you can get.</p>
<p>The battery life for the Philips &#8211; DiamondClean was actually 30 percent lower than the other Philips models. This could be because the brush never turns off its Bluetooth transmitter. Still, it&#8217;ll brush your teeth 57 times without recharging — that&#8217;s almost double the battery life of the Oral-B &#8211; Genius 8000.</p>
<p>Philips&#8217; Sonicare system is quieter in every case than the Oral-B system, but the premium DiamondClean is just a little bit quieter on the standard clean mode than the other Philips brushes. It&#8217;s not a dramatic difference, but the brushes seem to have fewer and fewer parts buzzing around inside as you climb the price ladder.</p>
<h3>Compared to other Philips brushes</h3>

<h3>Premium design and accessories</h3>
<p>The premium feel of this brush is for all intents and purposes a design feature. The body is a little bit slimmer and sleeker than the lower-priced brushes, and the available color schemes cater to people who appreciate fine designer goods.</p>

The price tag and cost of replacement heads definitely took this brush out of the running for overall winner, though.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XT1KDSD/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XT1KDSD/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DiamondClean model 9300</a> we tested comes with a pebble-grain-wrapped travel case that holds the handle and two brush heads. If you pay another $60 for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSH2RNQ/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">model 9500</a>, you also get USB-port charging in your travel case so you don&#8217;t have to take your stand on the road. These cases aren&#8217;t explicitly designed to prop up a smartphone the way Oral-B&#8217;s case is, but the slot for the handle works fairly well.</p>
<p>The wireless charging stand (a standard feature in all electric brushes nowadays) also comes with a nice, heavy water glass that fits securely on top. This has basically become a signature feature of the DiamondClean brushes, and it&#8217;s definitely a unique touch. There&#8217;s also a clear plastic adapter for the charging stand if you don&#8217;t want to use the glass.</p>
<p>If you jump to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C799HF6/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">even more expensive model 9750</a>, you also get an exclusive glass countertop stand for four brush heads. The price is within spitting distance of $300, so it only really makes sense if you&#8217;re really, really proud of those $12 brush heads.</p>
<h3>Should you really buy this?</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;re mostly looking for a sleek brush with top-tier cleaning performance, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WWCX7GN/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greater Goods brush</a> gets you the same sonic cleaning performance the DiamondClean does. We like the Greater Goods brush heads, but here&#8217;s a twist: The various Philips Sonicare brush heads mount securely and work just as well on the Greater Goods handle. The arbor they mount on isn&#8217;t identical, but it&#8217;s got all the same key dimensions for the retaining clip to work.</p>
<p>If you love glass and copper-tone accents, Philips is the way to go. (We&#8217;re just a bit saddened that there aren&#8217;t brush heads to match the lunar blue handle. Blue and black? Seriously?) As with <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-electric-shaver/#the-other-finalists">Philips&#8217; high-end shaver</a>, it&#8217;s beautiful product that doesn&#8217;t make sense for most people to buy.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Philips &#8211; DiamondClean model 9300 is the Bluetooth-connected sonic brush that looks, feels and performs like a luxury product.</li>
<li>Philips&#8217; smart app works with a position sensor, brush sensor and head sensor to do something special with that connected advantage.</li>
<li>This brand tied for best cleaning performance in the lab, but that might not matter at all. (And it tickles.)</li>
<li>You could even drink your expensive scotch out of the swanky charging stand glass. That&#8217;s worth the price, right?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Oral-B &#8211; Genius 8000</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KTII3DS/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oral-B &#8211; Genius 8000</a> is a good toothbrush. All the features you could ask for are here, and more. The travel case even has a built-in USB charge port for your phone!</p>
<p>The great ideas often weren&#8217;t followed through, though. For example, the charger doesn&#8217;t put out enough amperage to charge a modern phone or tablet: iPads and phones sometimes started charging, and sometimes didn&#8217;t. &#8220;Near-miss&#8221; pretty effectively sums up many features on this high-end brush.</p>
<p>We were sorely tempted to give the Genius 8000 top spot in the premium category. The features are competitive: easy and programmable mode switching, a great selection of brush heads, and position and pressure tracking to make sure you&#8217;re not over- or under-brushing certain areas.</p>
<p>The Oral-B&#8217;s price is a bit better than the Philips system, too, both for the brush handle and for the replacement heads. The Oral-B is loud and clunky, though, compared to the soft hum of the Philips Sonicare technology. The app is good enough, but not quite as easy to navigate or set up as the Philips app.</p>
<p>The built-in charger in the case is a cool feature that almost makes this the best electric toothbrush for travel, but you&#8217;ll also be more likely to need that charger. Oral-B&#8217;s 64 minutes of battery life are pathetic compared to the 114 minutes we got from the Philips &#8211; DiamondClean. Thankfully, this brush has a three-segment display so you can actually see the battery level.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re really compelled by the value of the specialty brush heads Oral-B offers, the Pro &#8211; 1000 gets you into that system at a much more reasonable price point and has all the essential features.</p>
<h3>Philips &#8211; Sonicare Essence</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QZ67ODE/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Sonicare Essence</a> is the cheapest way into the Sonicare lineup, and that makes it a brush worth checking out, but at the end of the day there&#8217;s not much that makes this a good value.</p>
<p>The Essence gets the same good cleaning results that the other Sonicare brushes do. The DiamondClean was a little bit better in a lab test, but we think you&#8217;d be hard pressed to tell the difference between the Essence and the other brushes if they&#8217;re all on the basic cleaning mode.</p>
<p>What separates this brush from the rest of the lineup is the heads it uses. This is an old system that uses a massive threaded collar to hold the tip and its magnetically coupled drive shaft in place. It&#8217;s much more bulky and complex than the main Philips system, and still expensive at $35 for a year&#8217;s replacements, but that&#8217;s compared to $60 for the premium heads.</p>
<p>For that savings, you sacrifice every feature. There&#8217;s no quadrant-pacing timer, much less a pressure sensor or variable power levels.</p>
<p>Philips has already released a replacement for this model, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019K7DPG4/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Essence+</a>. The Plus model takes the same brush head as the rest of the Sonicare brushes rather than the bulky old screw-on heads, but just like the Essence it&#8217;s missing all the other features.</p>
<p>Sadly, the Essence+ is often selling for almost the same price as the much better 4100 model. If you&#8217;re really in love with the Philips brand but you want a bare-bones brush, this older Essence model is typically a much better value.</p>
<h3>Philips &#8211; Sonicare 4100 and 5100</h3>
<p>The Philips &#8211; Sonicare series is comprised of dozens of models and combo packs. We tested both the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078GVDB19/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Four Series model 4100</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078GVH2VH/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Five Series model 5100</a> because they represent the two clear feature changes: The 4100 adds a quad pacer and pressure sensor to the more basic models, and the 5100 adds a &#8220;gum care&#8221; mode and manual mode switching.</p>
<p>In both cases, we were underwhelmed by these features, especially when compared to the Greater Good &#8211; Balance. If the pressure sensor and mode switch were only adding a $20 premium to the price then these brushes might be worth seeking out; after our tests, though, we&#8217;re not convinced the pressure sensor really helps, and even after paying three times the price of the entry-level brush you&#8217;re going to keep on shelling out more for the $8-$12 brush heads every two or three months.</p>
<p>The &#8220;smart&#8221; features (like the ID-chipped brush heads) make some sense when you&#8217;ve got a Bluetooth-connected app tracking every datum of your brushing life, but those perks are missing on these brush handles.</p>
<p>The batteries are better than average, at 154 minutes for the 5100 and 180 minutes for the 4100, but that in no way justifies the sticker price.</p>
<h3>Oral-B Pro 3000</h3>
<p>The Oral-B Pro 3000 is in an awkward place in Oral-B&#8217;s lineup.</p>
<p>Like the midrange Philips, the features here are hard to justify: A gum care and sensitive mode are both great ideas, but it&#8217;s hard to say exactly who will need them, and for how long.</p>
<p>The Bluetooth on this brush is not a well-developed feature, either. It lets you start and pause the smartphone app&#8217;s timer in perfect sync with the built-in timer on the brush, but without a position sensor you don&#8217;t really get anything else from the app that you wouldn&#8217;t also get with a manual brush.</p>
<p>The main reason to buy this brush is if you love the Oral-B oscillating brush heads and want to program a gum massage into your weekly brushing routine. Bluetooth will let the app control that on the schedule that you or a dentist creates; it really is only automating a simple button press, though.</p>
<p>The other feature that comes with this brush, but not the 1000, is a countertop case that holds spare brush heads for your family or special-purpose brush heads. You can buy <a href="https://www.fix.com/parts/toothbrush/braun/fix10275996/brush-head-storage-67040225/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the same official stand</a> for about $15, or a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071DJ8WWL/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">very similar imitation</a> for about $10.</p>
<p>Forty-two minutes of battery is sufficient, but shameful in a $75 toothbrush. On the whole, the lower cleaning power compared to sonic toothbrushes and the louder motor of the oscillating design makes this a really tough model to recommend.</p>
<p>If the lack of a dedicated mode switch is the only thing you think is missing, you can get that (and some extra modes) for about $15 more in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O8ODHOA/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oral-B &#8211; Pro 5000</a>. After spending a few months with a range of Oral-B models, we&#8217;re pretty sure most people will be fully satisfied with the features of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003UKM9CO/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pro 1000</a> at half the price.</p>
<h3>Brio &#8211; SmartClean</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OJHCCP6/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Brio &#8211; SmartClean</a> seems like a brush that was built to order around a feature set, rather than being carefully designed and improved after testing.</p>
<p>The SmartClean checks most of the essential feature boxes, except a pressure sensor and a mode switch. It has three modes: normal, soft and massage. These are sensible to include, but without a mode button you&#8217;re cycling through all of them every time you start and stop the brush. The white plastic body is hard and shiny where every other brush has a grippy texture.</p>
<p>If this brush were $30 rather than the consistent $68 it sold for when we tested, it would be a competitor for the top pick. At this price, it&#8217;s up against the Sonicare 5100. Brio gives you double the battery life and cheaper brush replacements, plus a brush holder on the charger rather than the travel case that comes with the 5100. It&#8217;s also a little bit quieter than the midrange Philips models. It doesn&#8217;t seem to clean as well, though, and there&#8217;s no pressure sensor.</p>

<h3>Fairywill &#8211; FW-507</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06VWD8NY3/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fairywill &#8211; FW-507</a> feels and looks lower-grade than the other brushes we tried. It&#8217;s a popular model on Amazon that seems to share a production line with a number of other brands.</p>
<p>The USB-compatible charge cable is an interesting feature that may come in handy once in a while, but wireless toothbrush stands make far more sense unless you&#8217;re constantly travelling.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a bad toothbrush, really, but the lack of a mode switch makes the five modes more annoying than they&#8217;re worth. Fairywill squeezed the longest run time out of this big rechargeable battery, but a convenient charging stand is a far more important feature for most people.</p>
<p>The Fairywill replacements were the only brush heads we didn&#8217;t like. They&#8217;re not bad, per se; the bristles appear to be the same soft Nylon used by the rest of the industry, and the shape and size are about right. The way they attach to the handle is a big, hollow mounting shaft with a twist-lock retention mechanism. Again, not awful, just not as simple or easy to clean as other systems.</p>
<h3>Oral-B &#8211; Vitality</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078Y357PS/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oral-B&#8217;s Vitality model</a> is an entry-level electric toothbrush that should be attractive for offering access to Oral-B&#8217;s great brush heads for a low up-front cost. But, when compared to other budget brushes, it&#8217;s a bit disappointing.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s missing? Nearly everything. There&#8217;s not even a charge light to let you know if your charger is plugged in. The lack of a pacing timer is not uncommon for the entry-level model in a big brush maker&#8217;s line, but when <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WWCX7GN/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greater Goods</a> is offering that feature at the $25 price point, this brush is hard to recommend.</p>
<p>The Vitality has a larger-than-usual battery for Oral-B&#8217;s line. It actually runs for 17 days worth of brushing, about a day longer than Oral-B&#8217;s flagship brush. This is still 12 days short of the average we found among other brands. It&#8217;s also a quieter brush than some other Oral-B models, but on the whole we think the Pro 1000 is a worthwhile upgrade if you want the Oral-B heads.</p>
<h3>Oral-B &#8211; 3D White</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008I2IKI6/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oral-B &#8211; 3D White</a> is a strange duck. Oral-B clearly recognizes that their brand is strong enough to sell cheap AA-battery-powered toothbrushes.</p>
<p>The 3D White&#8217;s cleaning performance in our peanut butter test was pretty good, partly because the head is so much bigger than the other Oral-B heads. That said, it&#8217;s actually a bit less efficient at brushing in most actual mouths, since it can be tricky to maneuver that big head.</p>
<p>Battery life is kind of amazing: 305 minutes of constant run time on the included AA alkaline.</p>
<p>That said, this brush fails to meet the basic qualifications that advance most electric toothbrushes ahead of stone-age manual-power brushes. There&#8217;s no timer at all, let alone a quad pacer. If we were picking a tool to clean grout lines, this would be a contender for best value of the bunch. As a toothbrush, it&#8217;s just a gimmicky waste of time.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The best brush is one you&#8217;ll actually enjoy using for two minutes, twice every day. Anything more or less than that is probably not going to make a big difference for your teeth and gums, but it&#8217;s a very good idea to schedule a checkup with your dentist so you can talk about technique.</p>
<p>Our favorite brush, then, has all the essential features to make that happen. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WWCX7GN/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greater Goods &#8211; Balance</a> has a two-minute timer with 30-second pacing reminders that help you get every tooth, while the soft bristles and adjustable power modes mean it&#8217;ll let you ease into a new routine. (You can change to harder bristles, too, if you want stronger scrubbing and longer bristle life.) It does all this for less than half the cost of the competition.</p>
<p>The Balance doesn&#8217;t have Bluetooth. But if you really want to record your brushing habits, the data-collecting features of apps we tested work manually with any toothbrush.</p>
<p>If you really prefer moving bristles to buzzing sonic toothbrushes, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003UKM9CO/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oral-B &#8211; Pro 1000</a> still has a quad pacer and pressure sensor, plus it gives you access to affordable specialty brushes. It&#8217;s double the cost of our top pick and it&#8217;s pretty loud, but for sensitive mouths this is a less intimidating option.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re really sold on the idea of a Bluetooth-connected app that will track how long you brush each part of your mouth and let you schedule a customized routine of automatic gum massage, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XT1KDSD/?tag=ybdetbr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; DiamondClean</a> is a premium brush that does look and feel like a luxury item.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>To select our eight curling iron finalists, we first looked at online reviews from respected retailers like Amazon, Sephora, Target and Bed Bath and Beyond. We used these reviews to determine what consumers look for in a curling iron and which brands are leaders in the field.</p>
<p>Next, we consulted subreddits such as /r/fancyfollicles, /r/beauty and /r/femalehairadvice. We also checked out reviews from authoritative 3rd parties such as Reviews.com. This info helped us further our understanding of important curling iron features.</p>
<p>We continued researching curling iron technical components, such as barrel material, barrel size and temperature controls. We also consulted a professional hairstylist with twenty years experience, Priscilla Bagby.</p>
<p>Priscilla gave us practical information about proper curling iron/wand usage and what features she looks for in each. She also helped us in our decision to narrow down our finalists to only 1-inch barrels. We chose 1-inch barrels because this size can serve a variety of hair types and can be used to achieve the natural-wave look that is currently popular.</p>
<p>With Priscilla’s help, we also decided to represent all three of the most popular barrel materials in our list of finalists: ceramic, titanium and tourmaline. This let us compare the efficacy of the most popular materials on the market. We also included a range of price points, from bargain to luxury, so that we could find the best curling options for any budget.</p>

<h2 id="how-irons-work">How curling irons work</h2>
<p>Curling irons and wands use electrical resistors inside the barrel to heat up and remove water from hair strands. This process of removing water from hair is commonly called the water-set process. This process can be easily understood if you think of your hair like spaghetti. When curling irons remove the water from your hair, the hair dries in a manner similar to uncooked spaghetti. However, when the hair reabsorbs enough moisture, it loses this rigid structure, like when you add your spaghetti to a pot of water.</p>
<p>This process of direct heat and water evaporation inevitably leads to hair damage, because it breaks down the amino acids naturally present in your hair. Easy steps can be taken to prevent hair breakage and excess damage when curling, such as using a heat protectant and not using an unnecessarily high temperature while curling. During our hands-on testing, our testers used heat protectant to avoid hair damage.</p>
<h3 id="irons-vs-wands">Curling irons vs. curling wands</h3>
<p>The primary difference between a curling iron and a curling wand is that a wand does not have a clamp to hold hair around its barrel. With a wand, you use your hands to secure your hair around the barrel. Some people prefer this because it can lead to a more natural looking curl. Curling wands also may have tapered barrels, meaning the barrel becomes narrower at its tip.</p>
<p>Our professional, Priscilla, prefers to use a wand while curling hair because it can be used to “give hair a more natural look.” However, she concedes that most amateurs are more comfortable using curling irons. Without the safety of a clip, users may accidentally burn their hands while securing hair around the wand’s barrel.</p>
<p>Priscilla explains, “One good [skin] burn deters most people [from wands] for good.” However, “mastery can be achieved with repetitive practice.” Also, most curling wands come with a heat-resistant glove to protect your hands from these types of accidents.</p>

<p>Proper technique is very important when curling hair, not only to get the best look, but also to ensure that you do not unintentionally damage your hair. Immediately before using a curling iron or wand, precondition your hair with a heat protectant.</p>
<p>It is also important to avoid unnecessarily high temperatures when curling hair.There is no “one-size-fits-all” temperature that works for everyone; the right temperature for you is based on your hair’s texture and thickness.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about which temperature to use, start at a low temperature (around 300 °F) and slowly increase it until you are able to set a curl with one 15-second hold around the barrel. Once you have your curling iron or wand set to the correct temperature for your hair, Priscilla recommends focusing on three main factors while curling: sectioning, angles and direction.</p>
<h3>Sectioning</h3>
<p>“Sectioning” refers to how you section off parts of your hair for curling. After using a heat protectant, make sure your hair is dry and detangled before sectioning hair with clips.</p>
<p>Priscilla explains that “natural looks will usually just require two sections.” She recommends creating one section above your ears and another below. More sections can be added for more glamorous looks, but don’t go overboard. “No one needs to do five horizontal sections,” Priscilla says. “It’s way too much curl and looks amateur.”</p>
<h3>Angles</h3>
<p>The angle at which you hold your curling iron or wand while your hair is wrapped around its barrel will affect your curl. Priscilla explains ,“Holding the barrel of your iron or wand on a diagonal will result in a more natural beachy wave pattern, horizontal will result in a more natural brushed curl, and vertical will result in a ringlet curl.”</p>
<h3>Direction</h3>
<p>The direction of a curl can either be toward or away from your face. The curl’s direction, coupled with the angle at which you curl it, can have a huge influence on the overall look of your hair.</p>
<p>For those wanting a natural, two-sectioned look, Priscilla recommends directing the top layer of curls away from your face and the bottom layer towards your face to “maximize volume.” However, if you want to create an even more “lived-in” natural look, alternate the direction of the curls throughout your hair to create “a more natural pattern.”</p>
<p>If you are looking for an old-school Hollywood glam look, Priscilla explains that you should begin on your bottom section by directing curls away from your face, holding your iron or wand at a vertical angle. Continue that all the way around until you end up on the other side of your face with curls that are now directed towards your face. “Pull a boars-head groom brush through and voila, you’re Rita Hayworth.”</p>
<p>“The biggest mistakes that I see with clients and stylists alike is the strong desire to run your fingers through the curl while it’s still hot,” says Priscilla. For curls that last, let your hair cool completely before brushing or applying product. “If you want to relax the curl, simply grab the end of the curl, stretch the curl and hold while it’s cooling.”</p>

<p><b>Barrel size:</b> Curling iron and wand barrels range from 0.5 to 1.5 inches in diameter. We chose to test all 1-inch barrels because they create a curl that is structured, but not too tight for most hair lengths. If you have very cropped hair, you may want to opt for a smaller barrel size; or if you have very long hair, a larger one.</p>
<p>Barrel <i>length</i> is also a consideration because it determines the amount of hair you can wrap around your iron. Standard barrels are usually around 5-7 inches long. Extra-long models can extend up to 9.5 inches, which can be helpful for people with very long hair. Shorter models, under 5.5 inches, are handy for those with shorter hair and/or those who want an easier to carry curling iron.</p>
<p><b>Temperature range:</b> Most curling irons can reach incredibly high temperatures upwards of 400 °F. However, these temperatures are not necessary for most hair types. You should check a curling iron’s minimum and maximum temperatures to make sure it can sustain your ideal heat.</p>
<p><b>Ionic: </b>Ionic curling irons produce negative ions to attract the positive water ions naturally present in hair. These ions promote frizz-free, shiny hair. All of the curling irons and wands we tested promote ionization, although they all have different barrel types.</p>
<p><b>Barrel material: </b>Most curling iron barrels are metal with a coating of one of the materials listed below. However, higher-quality irons are available that are completely comprised of ceramic or titanium. Gold and tourmaline are used as coatings for either metal, ceramic or titanium irons. Coated irons that have a metal substrate may pose durability issues over the course of years, as the barrel’s coating may wear off and cause hot spots of exposed metal.</p>
<p>Some curling iron manufacturers make proprietary blends of the following materials (for example, “tourmaline infused ceramic”):</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ceramic: </b>Ceramic is a material that heats up quickly and evenly, making it a great pick for curling irons.</li>
<li><b>Titanium: </b>The preferred material of our professional hairstylist, Priscilla, titanium curling irons heat up faster than ceramic irons and are lightweight. However, titanium curling irons tend to be on the pricey side.</li>
<li><b>Tourmaline:</b> Tourmaline is a semiprecious gemstone, which is crushed to coat the curling iron’s barrel. This material boosts the negative ions produced by the curling iron, which helps make hair smooth and shiny.</li>
<li><b>Gold</b>: Curling irons with gold-plated barrels heat evenly and prevent overheating, making them a good choice for frequent use.</li>
</ul>
[table id=164 /]
<p><b>Safety features:</b> Ever leave your house and think, “Did I forget to unplug my curling iron?” If so, you understand why an automatic shutoff feature helps your peace of mind. An important safety consideration, automatic shutoff ensures your iron is never left on for more than thirty minutes to an hour.</p>
<p>Other important standard safety features include heat-protectant gloves to protect hands and a stand to prevent the iron from burning your counter. All of our curling wand finalists came with heat-protectant gloves, and all of our finalists had some sort of stand.</p>
<p><b>Usability:</b> A curling iron that is too heavy or unwieldy may lead to hair damage/breakage. Overall usability refers to the the iron’s weight, handle ergonomics, cord length and intuitiveness of the controls.</p>
<p><b>Aesthetics:</b> A good quality, attractive curling iron means it won’t be an eyesore sitting on your counter.</p>

<h3>Hands-on curling</h3>
<p>To see if our finalists really delivered perfect curls, we had regular consumers put them to the test. After using each curling iron, our testers answered questions about the appearance, usability, results and overall impression of our finalists. Our three testers each had a different hair type ranging from short and fine to long and thick. Each tester’s unique hair type meant that they had a different ideal temperature for curling hair.</p>
[table id=166 /]
<p>All of our testers also had some experience with curling irons. Our tester with the least experience had used a curling iron a handful of times and had no experience with curling wands. Our tester with the most experience was familiar with both irons and wands and had used a wand on a biweekly basis.</p>
<p>Our testers largely preferred the curling irons with digital controls as they were clear, simple and accurate. In particular, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FVHH2H6/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neuro</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXS1OXQ/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xtava</a> were found to have the best controls, as their digital temperature controls are simple to use and have bright LED numbers that are easy to read.</p>
<p>Two of our finalists, Hot Tools and Mr Big, have dial temperature controls. Our testers appreciated the dial controls for their simplicity, but were disappointed with the smaller number of heat settings.</p>
<p>The Bed Head and NuMe both have only one heat setting. This limitation was universally disliked by our testers. The single temperature setting for both of these curlers was too hot for all of our testers’ hair. In fact, our tester with average thickness hair experienced smoke due to burnt hair follicles; to prevent further damage, we avoided testing on fine-hair.</p>
<p>The most intimidating curling iron for our testers was the Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curl Secret. This curler is unique in that it is an automated curling machine, meaning it sucks in a section of hair and curls it around an inner barrel. Although it required some learning, this curling iron turned out to be easy-to-use, but ultimately delivered lackluster results.</p>
<p>While not a fully automated machine, the Beachwaver also has a mechanism to twist hair along its barrel. Our testers with medium and long hair were able to get the hang of its barrel-twisting controls easily. However, the mechanism was useless for our tester with short hair.</p>
<h3>Barrel length</h3>
<p>We found that the advertised barrel lengths of our curling irons were often longer than their practical lengths. These advertized lengths often include the unheated tip (at the end of the barrel) as well as the small portion of the barrel located below the curling iron clamp. To determine the length of the curling iron barrel that can effectively be used to curl, we did our own measuring.</p>
<p>Take, for example the Anjou, which was advertised as a 6.3-inch barrel. While this measurement is technically correct, it is misleading. If you subtract the unheated end of the Anjou’s barrel and the bit below its clip, the part of the Anjou’s barrel that actually heats hair is 5.3 inches.</p>
<p>This size made the Anjou ideal for our short-haired tester, but was too small for our long-haired tester. On the other hand, the Mr Big Curling Iron is advertised at 9.5 inches but, practically, only 8 inches of its barrel can be used for curling. Our tester with long hair appreciated this extra length, but our tester with short hair found it too cumbersome.</p>
<p>From our tester’s experiences, we recommend looking for barrels that are 5.5 inches and longer if you have long hair. If your hair is shorter, you should look for 5.5 inches or less. While you shop, keep in mind that advertised barrel lengths probably include the iron’s unheated tip.</p>
<h3>Temperature range</h3>
<p>We used a thermometer attached to a thermocouple to test the highest and lowest temperature settings of our curling irons. Keep in mind that the accuracy of these thermometer readings may vary slightly, as they were not performed in a lab.</p>
<p>The Neuro proved to be the most accurate curling iron of our finalists. Its tested temperatures were within 1 °F of its advertised minimum and maximum specs.</p>
<p>Generally, the rest of our finalists tested a bit lower than their advertised temperatures but were within 10 &#8211; 15 °F. While 11 of our 12 finalists claimed to reach temperatures over 400 °F, we measured that only the Neuro, Hot Tools and Mr Big Curling Iron measured above 400 °F. So if you need very high temperatures to curl your hair, we recommend the Neuro as your best-choice curling wand and the Hot Tools as a solid runner-up.</p>
[table id=165 /]
<p>This heat setting test was particularly useful for the Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curl Secret. This curling iron has four clearly labeled heat settings, and one ambiguous setting simply labeled “POWER.” We found the Conair’s “POWER” setting to be around 270 °F.</p>
<p>The NuMe measured significantly below 410 °F, its advertised temperature, reaching only 343 °F. This underperformance was noticed by our testers, who were displeased with the NuMe’s curling results.</p>
<h3>Heating speed</h3>
<p>To test how long each of our curling irons took to reach its maximum temperature, we again employed the thermometer and thermocouple, along with a stopwatch. We found that the Neuro was our fastest curling wand to heat up, taking only two minutes and 42 seconds to reach 449 °F. The titanium barrel of the Neuro helped it to easily beat the competition in heat time.</p>
<p>The curling irons that heated up fastest were the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E68O4JU/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curl Secret</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B074QWJWTB/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mr Big Curling Iron</a>. The Conair took two minutes to reach 397 °F, and the Mr Big took two minutes and 41 seconds to reach 412 °F.</p>
<p>The majority of our finalists took somewhere between five to 10 minutes to reach their maximum temperature. The slowest to reach its maximum temperature was the NuMe which took over 10 minutes to reach 343 °F. This slow heat time is most likely due to the NuMe’s 100-percent ceramic barrel, a material that takes longer to heat up.</p>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<p>To score high on our overall usability, a curling iron should have simple controls, feel comfortable and lightweight, plus have a long cord. Our testers gushed over the grips of the Neuro and Anjou, which they found particularly easy to hold.</p>
<p>Our testers did not like the grips on the NuMe and Bed Head. They complained that these finalists lack grip texture and ergonomic shaping, and that they have a weight-balance issue which makes them unwieldy.</p>
<p>We measured each curling iron’s power cord and found that the Neuro had the longest cord at 9-feet long. The Xtava, Anjou, Mr Big Curling Iron and Beachwaver also had very long cords, all around 8 to 8.5 feet. The curling wand with the smallest cord was the Remington at 5 feet, 10 inches. However, cord length did no prove to be an issue for any of our testers, as they found even the Remington to be a comfortable length.</p>
<p>The lightest of our curling irons was the Vivid &amp; Vogue, which only weighs about 0.8 pounds (12.2 ounces). This makes the Vivid &amp; Vogue ideal to travel with, especially since it features dual voltage. Our testers thought this extra-light weight made the iron easy to use. The majority of our curling irons and wands range from 1 to 1.5 pounds, which our testers described as a comfortable weight.</p>
<p>The heaviest curling iron we tested was the Hot Tools at 2 pounds. This curling iron’s extra weight gives the impression of a quality tool, but two of our testers complained that this extra weight made it feel more unwieldy.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXS1OXQ/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xtava &#8211; Twist Conical Curling Wand</a> impressed our testers with its styling results. All of our testers gushed about the curls created with this iron, especially our testers with long and medium length hair. The Xtava’s graduated barrel helped our testers get natural-looking, tousled, loose curls.</p>
<p>This curling wand is a great choice for those who want the “natural curl” look. If you are looking for a bit more of a structured curl, you might consider opting for a straight-barrel version of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXS1OXQ/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xtava</a> or the Neuro discussed below.</p>
<p>Out of the box, our testers thought the Xtava looked sleek and smart with its all-black design. They were also highly impressed with its easy-to-use digital controls. The Xtava’s simple buttons and easy-to-read digital screen allow you to control the temperature from 200 °F to 410 °F in ten degree increments.</p>
<p>Our testers also liked that this wand displays its temperature while it heats up, so you know exactly when it’s ready to use. The Xtava took four minutes and 20 seconds to reach its maximum temperature, which we measured as 383 °F. This was an average heat time for our finalists.</p>

<p>While this 383 °F temperature is lower than the Xtava’s advertised maximum (410 °F), we believe it is within the margin of error for our testing. However, if you have thicker hair that should be ironed at temperatures above 400 °F, we greatly recommend splurging for the hotter Neuro. That said, the Xtava is a great choice for the majority of hair types that should be curled below 400 °F, including fine, normal and wavy hair.</p>
<p>The Xtava’s smart controls, plus its comfortable handle, made the Xtava very easy to use for our testers. In addition to the standard heat-protectant glove that comes with most curling wands, the Xtava also came with a good quality case that proved convenient to use.</p>

<p>The Xtava’s tourmaline-infused ceramic barrel measured 5.5 inches in length and tapered from 1.5- to 1-inch wide. This makes it great for medium- to long-length hair. Those with very short hair might opt for the smaller-barreled Xtava, which tapers from 1 inch to 0.5 inch wide.</p>
<p>The weight of the Xtava curling wand is pretty standard among its peers at 1.4 pounds. While this may not be a super-lightweight model, none of our testers complained of arm fatigue.</p>
<p>The only feature our testers thought could be improved in the Xtava is its heat stand, which is pretty small and can easily tip over. However, the Xtava comes equipped with other safety features, such as an automatic shutoff plus a good quality heat-protectant glove and case.</p>
<p>The Xtava’s appearance is sleek, black and serious. However its controls are friendly, and its curling results are flirty and fun. Despite the high quality of the Xtava, it comes at a bargain at around $20. To put the cherry on top, the Xtava is dual voltage, which means you can use it outside of the United States.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FVHH2H6/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neuro &#8211; Unclipped Styling Rod</a> is a straight-barreled curling wand. Our testers thought the Neuro’s expensive price tag is worth it for those with very thick hair, or for those who want a more structured curl. However, if you have thin, normal or moderately thick hair and are looking for a loose tousled curl, the Xtava is a better choice.</p>
<p>The Neuro’s high price tag is partly due its high-quality titanium barrel and smart digital controls. This titanium barrel heats up quickly and can reach an incredible 450 °F, the highest temperature of all our finalists. Therefore, if you have very thick or textured hair, this curling iron is probably worth the splurge.</p>
<p>All of our testers ranked the Neuro’s digital controls far above its competitors. This curling wand’s temperature range was 160 °F &#8211; 450 °F, which you can set in 10-degree increments. Its digital temperature was exceptionally easy to read, and its buttons were intuitive.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FVHH2H6/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neuro-cta-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neuro-cta-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neuro-cta-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neuro-cta-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neuro-cta-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neuro-cta-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neuro-cta-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neuro-cta-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neuro-cta.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Luxe Pick: Neuro - Unclipped Styling Rod</h3><p>If you have thick hair and a bigger budget, the Neuro is easy to use and highly effective. This professional-grade curling wand can create a variety of looks, and its titanium-plated barrel can reach a remarkable 450 °F.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FVHH2H6/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Our heat testing also revealed that this curling wand is exceptionally accurate, measuring within 1 °F of its advertised temperature. The Neuro was also the fastest curling wand to heat up, taking only two minutes and 42 seconds to reach 449 °F. Our heat testing data proved that the Neuro’s titanium barrel is worth the price.</p>
<p>The Neuro also comes equipped with other professional-grade features, such as a customizable automatic shutoff feature. This feature allows you to program the curling wand to shut off after whatever amount of time you choose.</p>
<p>The Neuro’s straight barrel is 5.5-inches long, which works well for a variety of hair lengths. Because its barrel is straight, our testers found that it can be used to get a slightly more defined curl than the Xtava. This curling iron works well for creating different types of curls based upon the angle of the iron and the direction of the curl.</p>
<p>The Neuro’s styling results and its professional features make it ideal for consumers looking to spend more to get serious curling power. Like the Xtava, the Neuro is dual voltage, making it a good choice for trips abroad.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Neuro &#8211; Unclipped Styling Rod’s titanium 5.5-inch long barrel heats up the fastest of our finalists, taking just under three minutes to reach 450 °F.</li>
<li>The Neuro was the most accurate of our finalists, measuring within 1 °F of its advertised temperatures, and its simple digital controls allow you to select temperatures in 10-degree increments (200 °F to 450 °F).</li>
<li>With a temperature range suited for a wide range of hair types, our testers found this curling wand extremely easy to use and were pleased with its styling results.</li>
<li>The $100 price tag of the Neuro is worth it for those with very thick hair who are looking for a structured curl.</li>

<p>Our testers with medium-length and long hair loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S28DKO0/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Beachwaver</a>’s automatically rotating barrel, which was unique among our finalists. The Beachwaver’s rotation is controlled by two direction buttons on its barrel, but you don’t have to use this feature if you don’t want to. However, our testers with hair past their shoulders found this feature very handy in getting strands to wrap uniformly around the barrel.</p>
<p>Our short-haired tester found the Beachwaver to be too bulky overall to use successfully. However, our other testers appreciated the Beachwaver’s large handle, which they said felt more ergonomic than our other finalists. The Beachwaver’s large buttons are intuitive, which make using its fancy rotation feature easy.</p>
<p>The Beachwaver’s lowest temperature setting was 290 °F, meaning that it’s unsuitable for those with very fine, color-treated or damaged hair. Our testers liked this curling iron’s digital temperature controls, which allow you to easily select the temperatures in 10-degree increments up to 410 °F.</p>

With its large handle, this curling iron is comfortable to hold and features intuitive controls.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S28DKO0/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Though the Beachwaver was advertised to reach 410 °F, we measured its highest temperature to be 398 °F. This measurement may be within the margin of error for our testing, but if you’re looking for a curling iron that easily exceeds 400°F, we recommend going with the Hot Tools instead. However, the Beachwaver is a great pick for the majority of average- to long-hair types that should be curled at settings below 400 °F.</p>
<p>This curling iron took six minutes and 30 seconds to reach its maximum temperature, an average time for our finalists.</p>
<p>The Beachweaver’s clamp is the smallest of our finalists, yet our testers found it very effective. This small clamp minimizes the crinkle sometimes left by a curling iron’s clamp. Its 5.5-inch long barrel creates attractive curls that our testers rated “above average.”</p>
<p>The main drawback of the Beachwaver is its high price point at over $100. However, its comfortable handle and smart, automatic-spin feature make it a great curling iron for longer hair. The Beachwaver also comes equipped with an automatic shutoff feature that turns off the iron if left unused for 30 minutes.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Beachwaver &#8211; S1 is a good choice for those with medium length or long hair.</li>
<li>This curling iron has an automatic rotating barrel that is easy to control and helps to create nicely styled curls.</li>
<li>Though hefty in size, the Beachwaver’s handle is comfortable to hold, and large buttons make using its fancy features easy.</li>
<li>This curling iron is our luxury pick, with a price point upwards of $100.</li>

<p>We found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073GG2WN4/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anjou &#8211; 1-Inch Curling Iron</a> is the best choice for shorter hair. Our testers thought the Anjou’s more manageable size (14.4 inches overall) and ceramic barrel made it a great overall curling iron. Our testers were pleased with the curls the Anjou made, and they proved the iron to be both effective and easy to use.</p>
<p>The Anjou’s ceramic barrel is advertised as 6.3 inches; however, our testers found that they were only able to practically use 5.3 inches of the barrel. This is because the 6.3-inch measurement includes the unheated end of the barrel, as well as the portion of the barrel below the iron’s clamp.</p>
<p>This posed a problem for our tester with the longest hair, which falls around her mid to lower back. This tester wanted a little more length from the Anjou’s barrel in order to fit more hair around it. However, our other two testers had no issue with the Anjou’s barrel length.</p>

<p>The Anjou also comes equipped with digital heat controls, which allow you to select the temperature in 10-degree increments from 200 °F &#8211; 410 °F. The Anjou’s buttons are very small, which our testers thought was a bit of a pain. However, the controls are very simple and allow for specific temperature setting. We found that the Anjou took about six minutes and 33 seconds to reach its maximum temperature, which was a pretty average heating time among our finalists.</p>
<p>This curling iron works well for most hair thicknesses, except for those with very thick or textured hair that needs to be curled above 400 °F. We measured its maximum and minimum temperatures to be 198 °F to 398 °F, just a bit lower than its technical specs. This slight temperature discrepancy was not noticed in our hands-on testing.</p>
<p>Weighing 1.2 pounds, this curling iron is relatively lightweight, which our testers thought made it easy to manipulate. This curling iron is also dual voltage, so you can travel with it overseas.</p>
<p>The Anjou is easy to use, features smart controls and offers great results, making it a great pick for those with short- to medium-length hair. To top things off, the Anjou is a bargain, costing only about $25.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Anjou &#8211; 1-Inch Curling Iron is a good choice for those with short to medium-length hair because of its more manageable size at 14.4-inch length and 1.2-pound weight.</li>
<li>This curling iron’s digital controls allow you to select the temperature between 200 °F to 410 °F, and our testers were pleased with the curls created by the Anjou’s 5.3-inch ceramic barrel</li>
<li>The Anjou works well for a variety of hair thicknesses, but it’s not the best pick for those with very thick or textured hair that needs to be curled above 400 °F.</li>
<li>The Anjou comes at a very reasonable price point, costing only around $25.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/conair-reg-titanium-ceramic-1-inch-barrel-curling-iron/1041281284?Keyword=curling%20iron" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curling Iron</a> came in just behind the Anjou in its overall testing score, ranking above average with most of our testers. Our tester with the shortest hair especially liked the Conair’s smaller size and lighter weight.</p>
<p>The Conair’s barrel is made of ceramic-infused tourmaline and measures 5 inches long. This length worked well for our short- and medium-length hair testers, but it was too small for our long-haired tester. Overall, our testers ranked the curls created by the Conair as average.</p>
<p>The Conair lost points in its low-quality appearance. Its light weight (1.08 pounds) and — as one tester described it, “Aquaman-blue” handle — contributed to this overall impression of cheaper quality. However, when you consider that the Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro was able to yield average styling results for an incredibly cheap price at just around $20, it’s easy to forgive the Conair’s appearance.</p>
<p>The Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro’s controls are simple but do not offer the specificity of a digital curling iron. The Conair allows you to select the temperature at five different presets. If you select only “POWER,” the curling iron reaches about 275 °F. Beyond that base setting, your other options are 310 °F, 330 °F, 360 °F and 400 °F.</p>
<p>The Conair took an average length of time to reach its maximum temperature, six-and-a-half minutes. Our measured temperatures for the Conair were a bit lower than the specified minimum and maximum temperatures. This curling iron works best for those with normal or thick hair. Because of its limited temperature range, it’s not a good pick for those with very thin or very thick hair.</p>
<p>Overall, this curling iron is a solid budget pick as it offers average styling results with easy-to-use controls and at a friendly $20 price. This curling iron is better suited for those with short to medium-length hair because of its shorter barrel.</p>
<h3>Hot Tools: 1-Inch 24k Gold Curling Iron</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00176B8BG/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17432 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k.jpg" alt="Hot Tools curling iron" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hot-tools-24k-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></a></p>
<p>Our testers thought that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00176B8BG/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hot Tools &#8211; 1-Inch 24k Gold Curling Iron</a> was an overall average curling iron. Like the Conair curling iron, the Hot Tools delivers average styling results. However, during our temperature testing, this curling iron reached one of the highest temperatures of our finalists, heating up to 405 °F. Therefore, if you have thick hair and are looking for a bargain, the Hot Tools is a solid-choice curling iron.</p>
<p>The Hot Tools relies on a dial temperature control system, which is simple, but lacks the accuracy of digitally controlled irons. This curling iron also heated up in a reasonable amount of time, taking about six minutes to reach its maximum temperature.</p>
<p>In addition, the Hot Tools price is very affordable, falling just under $30. It has an easy-to-grip handle and a gold barrel, which measures 4.25 inches. This was our heaviest curling iron, coming in around 2 pounds. When curling a lot of hair, this extra weight can turn hair curling into an arm workout. Overall, the Hot Tools is a solid curling iron, but it lacks the professional features and exceptional results to make it one of our top picks.</p>
<h3>Remington &#8211; Pro Curling Wand</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-17437 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro.jpg" alt="Remington Pro curling wand" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/remington-pro-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>While our testers were happy with the loose curl that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010AIHKF4/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Remington &#8211; Pro Curling Wand</a> creates, they were less than impressed with this wand’s temperature display and plastic handle. Our testers wished the Remington’s digital temperature display was brighter and more readable and that its handle had a better stand for holding the wand while hot.</p>
<p>The Remington reached its maximum temperature quickly, taking only four-and-a-half minutes. However, we measured the maximum temperature a bit below the advertised 410 °F. If you have extremely thick or textured hair, this is not the wand for you. However, it does work well for all other hair thicknesses that can be curled at a setting under 400 °F.</p>
<p>This curling iron comes at a good price, around $25. However, the Xtava &#8211; Twist Conical Curling Wand comes at a similar price point and offers more professional features and better performance. Therefore, the Remington would only be a good choice if the Xtava was out of stock.</p>
<h3>Mr Big Curling Iron &#8211; 1-Inch</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-17434 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big.jpg" alt="Mr Big curling iron" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mr-big-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, our tester with long hair appreciated the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B074QWJWTB/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mr Big Curling Iron</a> the most, mainly because of its very long barrel that measures 8 inches. However, all of our testers thought that Mr. Big’s curling results were lacking and that its long clamp was unnecessary.</p>
<p>The Mr. Big Curling Iron was our fastest heating curling iron, reaching an incredible 412 °F in only two minutes and 41 seconds. However, because of this curling iron’s unwieldiness, we recommend opting for the Hot Tools if you have very thick hair and are looking for a curling iron that offers temperatures above 400 °F.</p>
<p>For its large size, Mr. Big is relatively lightweight, weighing 1.2 pounds. However, this iron is unnecessarily cumbersome to manipulate around your head, particularly for those with average-length hair. Even if you have long hair, there are curling irons which offer better results, such as the Beachwaver.</p>
<h3>Vivid &amp; Vogue &#8211; Travel Curling Iron</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-17438 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue.jpg" alt="Vivid and Vogue travel curling Iron" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vivid-and-vogue-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Do you have short hair and travel a lot? If the answer is yes, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B074KG5FXK/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vivid &amp; Vogue &#8211; Travel Curling Iron</a> is a good option for you. If the answer is no, you should probably invest in a larger curling iron. This curling iron has a tiny 3.75-inch barrel and weighs less than a pound.</p>
<p>The Vivid &amp; Vogue has a very simple temperature switch that offers only high or low temperature settings. Its high-temperature setting measured about 350 °F, and its low setting measured 223 °F. This small curling iron took a longer time to reach its maximum temperature, clocking in at around eight minutes.</p>
<p>This extremely lightweight flat iron is simple and cheap, costing around $15. It is a solid flat iron for those with thin, short hair who travel a lot. However, its small barrel and overall lower quality make it a poor choice for everyday use or for those with hair that falls below their shoulders.</p>
<h2 id="others-not-recommended">Other finalists we do not recommend</h2>
<h3>Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curl Secret</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E68O4JU/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curl Secret</a> was the only fully automatic curling machine we tested. Initially, it visually and conceptually intimidated our testers. This machine requires hair to be placed inside two plates that are pressed together and then automatically curl hair inside a curling chamber. However, in practice the Conair was very easy to use and would not curl any piece of hair that was tangled.</p>
<p>This curling machine was extremely quick to reach its maximum temperature. We found that it reached 397 °F in two minutes. Because the Conair &#8211; Curl Secret only has two temperature settings, which we measured to be 372 °F and 397 °F, this curler is only suited for those with normal to thick hair.</p>
<p>Despite its ease of use, our testers were all dissatisfied with the curls produced by the Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curl Secret. Our tester with the shortest hair was unable to use the machine because her hair was not long enough for the machine to properly funnel into its barrel. Our testers with longer hair thought that their curls came out too crinkled. Therefore, we recommend spending time practicing your technique with a manual curling iron, rather than settling for the subpar results of the Conair &#8211; InfinitiPro Curl Secret.</p>
<h3>Bed Head &#8211; Curlipops Curling Wand</h3>
<p>To put it simply, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007ISRNJS/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bed Head &#8211; Curlipops Curling Wand</a> is too hot. When tested on hair of normal thickness, this curling iron burnt follicles to the point of producing smoke. With only one heat setting at 400 °F, our tester with fine hair was unable to try this curling iron due to risk of serious hair damage.</p>
<p>Our heat test showed that this curling iron’s advertised 400 °F temperature is accurate. At seven minutes and 20 seconds, it took a bit longer than average to reach its maximum temperature. This curling iron is suited for those with very thick hair that requires high heat.</p>
<p>The Bed Head iron also lacks an automatic shutoff function. Paired with its high heat, this deficiency poses serious safety concerns if you forget to unplug your curling iron. Even if you have hair that needs to be curled at this high temperature, our testers ranked this curling iron’s curls as slightly below average.</p>
<h3>NuMe &#8211; Classic Curling Wand</h3>
<p>Like the Bedhead, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B011LSFDE2/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NuMe &#8211; Classic Curling Wand</a> only has one heat setting, which frustrated our testers who all wanted more accurate controls. While its temperature is advertised to be a super-hot 410 °F, we measured it to be around 350 °F. That means this curling iron is only suited for those with hair of normal thickness.</p>
<p>Because the NuMe has a 100-percent ceramic barrel, it takes over 10 minutes to heat up to high temperature. This measured to be the longest heating time of any of our finalists.</p>
<p>Our testers also found the NuMe’s handle to be uncomfortable and thought it was unwieldy to use. This curling iron lacks an automatic shutoff, but still commands a higher price tag at around $70. We recommend you skip this curling wand and instead opt for either the affordable Xtava or the luxury Neuro.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Overall, we were pleased to find that you can get a great curling iron or wand without breaking the bank. With proven performance, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXS1OXQ/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xtava &#8211; Twist Conical Curling Wand</a> earns our pick for the best curling wand.</p>
<p>Our testers were impressed with the Xtava’s smart, easy-to-use, digital temperature system as well as its overall sleek appearance. This curling wand’s graduated barrel delivers a tousled curl that our testers universally appreciated. The Xtava comes with professional features, such as an automatic shutoff and dual voltage, yet only costs around $20.</p>
<p>On the more expensive side of curling wands was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FVHH2H6/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neuro &#8211; Unclipped Styling Rod</a>. This curling wand was loved by our testers because of its smart digital controls, quick heating time and salon-quality results. This curling wand has the widest temperature range of our finalists, ranging from 160 °F to 450 °F. That makes it suitable for a wide variety of hair types, and its straight barrel can be used to create a variety of looks.</p>
<p>If you prefer the clamp of a traditional curling iron, we have two top picks based upon the length of your hair. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S28DKO0/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Beachwaver &#8211; S1</a> scored well with our testers with average to long hair, who appreciated its auto-rotation feature.</p>
<p>The Beachwaver’s large handle is very comfortable and has large buttons that are easy to use. It also has smart digital temperature controls that can be set at increments of 10 °F. However, the Beachwaver’s lowest temperature is 290 °F, which means it’s not suited for those with very fine or damaged hair.</p>
<p>For those with short hair looking for a small-sized curling iron, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073GG2WN4/?tag=ybdcrlwnd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Anjou &#8211; 1-Inch Curling Iron</b></a> is your best bet. This curling iron offers great results and smart digital controls for a bargain at approximately $25. This curling iron’s overall light weight and long power cord make it easy to use around your head. Its shorter, 5.3-inch ceramic barrel is well suited for those with short- to medium-length hair.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We tested eight of the best hair straightening brushes on the market to determine which straightened curly and wavy hair the best. Ultimately, the MiroPure - 2-in-1 was our top choice. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter hours of research, discussions with professional hair stylists and test driving products by straightening five heads of curly and wavy hair, we confidently recommend the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LZFH8PV/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> MiroPure &#8211; 2-in-1</a> as the best hair straightening brush. The brush glides through all hair types easily, while the included textured, heat-resistant glove helps provide tension. Our budget pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B4902PI/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">USpicy &#8211; FS005</a>, makes hair shiny and smooth at a more affordable price point, but its controls are harder to operate.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-chose">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>To begin with, we gathered consumer opinions from subreddits like /r/curlyhair and /r/naturalhair to learn which features in a hair straightening brush are most important to people with curls and waves. We read articles from well-known beauty magazines such as Allure to see which brands are making waves, and then we watched YouTube videos to learn how to use a straightening brush (and to see which brush the YouTubers recommend).</p>
<p>After that, we spoke with professional hair stylist and San Diego salon owner, Cindy Close of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Hair-Galleria-161277147258775/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hair Galleria</a>, to discuss how to use a hair straightener brush and which features are key. We also recruited a former stylist with coarse, wavy hair to be one of our testers. In this way, we learned about the mechanics of using a hair straightener brush, like how important tension is when straightening hair.</p>
<p>Armed with knowledge, we finally headed over to big box retailers such as Ulta, Target and Amazon to read consumer reviews and narrow down our choices. We only selected hair straightener brushes with at least a four star rating. Some of the hair straightening brushes use heated bristles, while some use hot air. We tested a variety of each style. Once we had our eight finalists, we spent several weeks testing on multiple people and conducting hands-on tests.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs a hair straightening brush?</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a straight hair look, but need a tool that causes less damage and maintains volume better than a traditional flat iron, a straightening brush may be the ideal hot tool for you.</p>
<h3>Flat iron pros and cons</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.conair.com/co/89/flat-iron-hot-brush-or-hot-air-brush-making-the-right-choice/341" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conair</a>, the pros to using a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-flat-iron/" rel="noopener">flat iron</a> are that it is simple to use and you can straighten your hair much more quickly than with a straightening brush. The cons are that the high heat levels can quickly dry out hair and the metal plates can heat unevenly and damage hair. Since they are so powerful, flat irons are best for thick, very curly hair.</p>
<h3>Hair straightening brush pros and cons</h3>
<p>If you have hair that is damaged or of thin to average thickness, you would more likely benefit from a straightening brush than a flat iron. A straightening brush uses heated plates and bristles to glide through dry hair strands. Brushes have lower temperatures and no hot spots (which flat irons can tend to have), and are better at maintaining volume as they straighten.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use">How to use a hair straightening brush</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >

<p>Heat is used to relax the hydrogen bonds in your hair, which changes your hair’s texture and allows you to straighten your hair by holding it in a certain position until the bonds reform.</p>
<p>Any kind of hot hair tool set above 120 ℉ can cause damage, and the impact on curly hair can be especially devastating. Using tools with a temperature that is set too high can cause <a href="https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/curls/this-is-what-happens-when-you-straighten-curly-hair" target="_blank" rel="noopener">irreversible damage to your hair</a> at a molecular level, changing natural curl patterns and leading to severe breakage. It is important to find the correct temperature for your hair type, starting with the lowest possible temperature.</p>
<p>There is no one single setting that works for all heads of hair. Our professional stylist recommends that you consider the condition and strength of your hair. For example, if you have fine, overprocessed or chemically treated hair, you should start with a setting below 300 °F.</p>
<p>For normal hair that has not been overly processed, she recommended staying under a temperature of 380 °F, while thick hair with no damage would be fine at 400 °F. Since determining the right setting can be tricky, it’s best to use a lower setting and work your way up if necessary.</p>
<p>Applying heat protectant before you begin can help minimize direct damage caused by heat. In our tests, we used a heat protectant with argan oil. Argan oil not only protects hair from the direct damage caused by heat, but it has the added bonus of protecting hair from <a href="https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/the-4-major-causes-of-hair-damage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">environmental factors</a> that damage hair. These factors include ultraviolet rays, wind, salt water, hard water build up and extreme temperatures (either too hot or cold).</p>
<h2 id="features-to-consider">Features to consider</h2>
<p>There are a few key things to look for when purchasing a hair straightening brush, and we’ll walk you through some of the most important features.</p>
<p><strong>MCH technology:</strong> MCH stands for metal ceramic heater, a new technology that uses 20 percent to 30 percent less energy than a PTC (positive temperature coefficient) heater. A tool with MCH heating technology reaches higher temperatures overall, at a faster speed (as quickly as 30 seconds). A hot tool with a PCB circuit board takes 45 seconds to reach the same heat.</p>
<p><strong>Ceramic technology:</strong> Ceramic is a composite material usually made of clay, which emits a non-damaging, far infrared heat. Far infrared heat is unique because it penetrates the hair shaft, making it the most efficient, gentlest way to heat hair. Ceramic also has unique heat conducting properties, so it heats up more quickly and evenly than dryers with metal or plastic heating elements.</p>
<p><strong>Ionic generator:</strong> Ionic iron produces negative charges, which create a smooth, shiny texture.</p>
<p><strong>Anti-scald:</strong> This feature ensures the heating element won’t come into contact with your scalp.</p>
<p><strong>Temperature range:</strong> Be sure to check for lowest minimum temperature. If you have fine or overprocessed hair, you’ll want to look for at least a minimum temperature of 300 ℉. Ranges above 400 ℉ are likely to be overkill.</p>
<p><strong>Usability:</strong> Are the controls easy to maneuver, and is it easy to set the temperature? Do the bristles hold hair in place without pulling or snagging?</p>
<p><strong>Auto shutoff:</strong> This is a great safety feature, so you aren’t second guessing yourself after you’ve already left for the office.</p>
<p><strong>Brush width and length:</strong> A smaller brush is recommended for curly or textured hair (allowing you straighten in small sections), while wider brushes can be a time-saver. Plate length also determines how long it will take to straighten your hair: the longer the plate, the more hair you can straighten at one time. In the end, it comes down to personal preference.</p>
<p><strong>Wet to dry:</strong> Our stylist consultant preferred wet to dry brushes because they pull less and don’t snag the hair. They’re also an excellent time saver and can significantly shorten your grooming routine.</p>
<p><strong>Bristle type:</strong> Silicone or rubber bristles help you work through tangles, while nylon may be better for those with a sensitive scalp.</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> If you’re going to use a tool on a regular basis, it should be something you enjoy looking at too.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Heating speed</h3>
<p>Since the highest heat setting we needed to use on our testers was 410 ℉, we used this temperature to determine how long it takes each brush to heat up for use. Once we set the temperature on the digital display of the straightening brush, we used a timer to count how long until each brush indicated readiness on its digital display.</p>
<p>While all of the models indicate when they are ready to use, we used an infrared thermometer to double check that they had reached their peak temperature when the brush indicated ready. We tested every 10 seconds until we reached 410 ℉ or its highest recorded temperature. We held it 6 inches away from the center of the brush, aiming it straight down onto the brush paddle.</p>
<p>In most cases, the digital display indicated the brush was ready to use long before it hit its peak temperature. The only brush that reached our desired temperature by the time the digital display indicated readiness was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0714J2X7T/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CNXUX &#8211; Hair Straightener Brush</a>. The CNXUX also reached its peak temperature the fastest.</p>
<p>We measured the temperature each of the brushes again after a full five minutes, to see if they ever reached their peak advertised temperature. While none of the brushes reached their true advertised temperature, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DT0K3P4/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InStyler &#8211; Straight Up</a> came the closest at 418 ℉.</p>
<p>Since the hot air brushes only have on/off settings, we didn’t measure heating speed, but we did gauge their heat output. We measured it the same the way we tested <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-hair-dryer/" rel="noopener">hair dryers</a>. After setting the brush to high and giving it a few minutes to warm up, we held the thermometer 6 inches from the center of the paddle to take our reading.</p>
<p>The Revlon &#8211; OneStep Dryer &amp; Styler and Lescolton &#8211; One Step Dryer &amp; Styler measured comparably (230 ℉ and 235 ℉, respectively), with a lower temperature than the majority of the hair dryers we tested for another article. Lower heat may make it more difficult to straighten thick or coarse hair, but it also means less damage.</p>
<h3>User experience</h3>
<p>One of the first things we considered in terms of user experience is weight. For example, we considered questions such as: does it hurt your wrist? Is it comfortable to hold for long periods of time? Our testers found the MiroPure &#8211; 2-in-1 and InstaMagic &#8211; Straightening Brush to be heavier than comfortable. These brushes may cause arm fatigue if you have long or thick hair that takes more time to work through.</p>
<p>We also considered the location of buttons, noting whether it was likely you would accidentally change settings during use. We also took note of whether the brush handle was long enough to avoid contorting your arm at awkward angles. Due to its recessed buttons and slim handle size, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LZFH8PV/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MiroPure &#8211; 2-in-1</a> won our votes as the most serviceable model. Perhaps the most bulky and cumbersome to use was the Lescolton &#8211; One Step Dryer &amp; Styler, which was so large as to be unwieldy.</p>
<p>Finally, we measured the cord length with a ruler and noted which brushes have a swivel cord. A swivel cord (the joint of the cord where it reaches the brush) makes the brush more comfortable and convenient to use, since it is less likely to get tangled as you are working. The InStyler &#8211; Straight Up had the shortest cord length at five feet. Generally we found that having a swivel cord made more of a difference in usability than cord length.</p>
<h3>Hands-on testing</h3>
<p>We asked five testers with a wide range of hair types (from thick to thin/damaged), lengths (short, medium and long) and curl patterns (from kinky to loose waves) to help us determine the best hair straightening brush.</p>
<p>For heat protection and to reduce frizz, we had each tester apply Eva NYC Mane Magic with argan oil before using any of the straightening brushes.</p>
<p>We had our testers rate each hair straightening brush on a scale of one to five (with five being best) for sleekness, smoothness and straightness. We also asked them to consider factors like how easy the brushes were to use, if they were heavy, and how well they were designed. Then we averaged the ratings for a final score. In the end, the preferences of the testers came down to hair type and less to do with tightness of curl.</p>
<h3>The results</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DT0K3P4/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InStyler &#8211; Straight Up</a> was rated the highest by our three thick hair testers. We already established that due to its higher heat levels, a flat iron is probably best for thick and very curly hair. However, if you have <a href="https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/seniors/do-gray-curls-have-their-own-hair-type" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gray strands</a> or color treated hair (making it drier, more porous and more susceptible to damage), these special considerations may make straightening brush your best choice.</p>
<p>Our testers with fine hair gave high ratings to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LZFH8PV/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MiroPure &#8211; 2-in-1</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0714J2X7T/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CNXUX &#8211; Hair Straightener Brush</a>. These models were less likely to catch and pull fine hair, but for the same reason, had less grip on thick or coarse hair.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B4902PI/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">USpicy &#8211; FS005</a> worked well on all types of hair, as it didn’t catch, but you could still get enough tension on thicker hair. The InstaMagic &#8211; Straightening Brush was the least favorite model, as it snagged on fine or long hair, yet didn’t straighten coarse hair despite a decent amount of tension.</p>
<p>Overall, our testers preferred the models using heated plates and bristles to the models using hot air. On the other hand, these hot air brushes had lower temperatures than the other straightening brushes, making them safer for those with fine or damaged hair.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">The best overall: MiroPure 2-in-1</h2>

After testing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LZFH8PV/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MiroPure &#8211; 2-in-1</a> on several heads of curly and wavy hair, we could see it gave the most consistent results across the board. It worked as well on fine, spiralled curls as it did on thick, kinky curls. Notably, it also left the hair the shiniest (perhaps due to the double ionic generator which seals the cuticles). Our tester with coarse, wavy hair found it didn’t straighten the ends as well as some of its competitors, so it may be best for users with fine to normal hair.</p>
<p>Users with fine to normal hair who are looking for shine as much as the straight factor will prize the MiroPure over our other top picks.</p>
<p>Not only did the MiroPure provide excellent results, but we loved it for its usability. It has a smooth, comfortable handle, and recessed buttons so you don’t accidentally change settings. For extra safety, it has a temperature lock and auto shutoff feature after 60 minutes. The swivel cord kept us from getting in an awkward tangle with the cord, making it more like a professional tool.</p>
<p>Finally, it comes with textured glove that makes it easy to grip hair, and a felt drawstring storage bag to keep everything together. According to our tester who is a former stylist, the glove was key to providing tension without burning your fingers. Our other testers found this bonus tool helpful as well, and the MiroPure is one of only two straightener brushes we tested that came with a glove. The bag was also a nice feature, since it helps keeps the bristles free of dust or debris.</p>

<p>While brush size is largely a matter of personal taste, we found that the 2.5 x 4 inch brush was the perfect size to work in small sections for tight curls, but also to straighten a whole head of hair efficiently. The brush has an anti-scald design so you don’t burn your scalp, and features cutting edge nanotechnology. We found we were able to get closer to the scalp with brushes with an anti-scald feature.</p>
<p>One of the things we really dug about the MiroPure was the number of heat settings. It has 16 different temperature settings, so it can be adjusted to a wide variety of hair types. The lowest setting is 300 ℉, so it is better for those with normal to thick hair. If you have very fine or damaged hair, the lowest heat setting on the MiroPure may still be too high for you.</p>
<p>Despite claims of reaching 450 ℉, the MiroPure only reached 395 ℉. However, the heat is evenly distributed so it straightens the whole section of hair being brushed, meaning fewer passes on the same strands. One thing we didn’t like is that at its highest setting (450 ℉), the brush smells like a hot glue gun. The good news is that most people will never need to set it that high.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The MiroPure &#8211; 2-in-1 has a double ionic generator, and it resulted in the shiniest strands during our hands-on comparison with other straightening brushes.</li>
<li>It has the most variable heat settings, with 16 different options from 300 ℉ to 450 ℉. This makes it best for people with fine to medium thickness hair, who want the wow factor in terms of shine.</li>
<li>The comb itself features nanotechnology, which manipulates atoms and molecules, helping to remove odors and microbes on the scalp.</li>
<li>The included heat resistant glove provides grip and tension for getting hair straighter, while protecting your hands and fingers from burns.</li>
</ul>

Despite its mid-range price, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B4902PI/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">USpicy &#8211; FS005</a> has the look and feel of a more luxury straightening brush. Since you don’t necessarily want a cheap straightening brush just because it’s inexpensive, we opted to name the brush with the most value as our budget pick. That would be the USpicy, with features like an anti-scald design, 360° swivel cord and automatic shutoff timer. If you have fine to normal thickness hair, you can expect nearly the same results as our top pick, albeit less shine. The lower price mainly means a sacrifice in ease of use with the controls.</p>
<p>It’s easy to use, and has an attractive matte black finish that makes it look like a quality tool. It comes with a glove to protect against heat and provide more tension, plus a cleaning tool and a storage bag. As we mentioned previously, the glove is extremely helpful to ensure the most tension.</p>

<p>It has cool tip ionic bristles, which helped us get closer to the roots. Our testers felt that the USpicy provides consistent heat, allows you to get the whole strand straight, and leaves less frizz. The controls aren’t as easy to use as our top pick, and we had to press each button multiple times before it would respond.</p>
<p>The handle is slim and the oval brush shape is 2.5 inches x 5 inches. It has fewer temperature settings than we might prefer, but it has the lowest heat setting (250 ℉), making it the best choice for those with fine or damaged hair.</p>
<p>One of the drawbacks to the USpicy is how easy it is to lock the temperature. It’s a useful feature, but we found ourselves accidentally locking the temperature even before we reached the setting we wanted. It’s a minor annoyance in an otherwise great design.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The USpicy &#8211; FS005 has a low heat setting, and at its highest setting, doesn’t get overly hot. This makes it a good option if you have finer hair.</li>
<li>It has a swivel cord for easy use and anti-scald design to prevent accidental burns.</li>
<li>With a matte black finish that isn’t easily smudged with fingerprints, the USpicy looks nice sitting on your counter and the provided drawstring bag keeps the brush and bonus tools in one place.</li>
<li>The USpicy, despite lower temperatures, left our testers hair straight, smooth and shiny.</li>

Perhaps because it has the truest temperature, reaching the highest recorded temp (418 ℉) of the finalists we tested, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DT0K3P4/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InStyler &#8211; Straight Up</a> was the favorite of our testers with thick tresses. It was also the only brush we tested that had an accurate “ready” indicator. It’s the most expensive model we tested, but our testers with thicker hair said they found it was worth the price.</p>

<p>The InStyler has a wider brush, measuring 3 inches x 6 inches, which is another reason it was preferred by those with thick hair; you can straighten a lot of hair quickly. It has cool tip ionic bristles, so the heat doesn’t touch your scalp, and each bristle is surrounded by ceramic plates: 65 in total. The heat is consistent and powerful, so you can tame even the thickest mane and finish long hair quickly.</p>
<p>One downside is that at its highest setting, it has the hot glue gun smell we mentioned previously. But again, at 450 ℉, it’s not a setting that most people will need to use. Also, and this is to be expected given its high heat levels, it took longer to cool down than our other finalists. We didn’t feel this was an issue, just something to keep in mind if you intend to store it immediately after use.</p>
<p>The InStyler does snag hair, so it’s best for those with thick or medium thick hair. People with thin hair may want to steer away from this brush.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The InStyler &#8211; Straight Up has a wider brush, so working through thick, coarse, or long hair is a breeze. However, it may not be best for those with fine hair since it can snag.</li>
<li>It has the highest recorded temp of the models we tried, which provided enough power to straighten the strands of our testers with thick hair in one pass.</li>
<li>Cool tip ionic bristles mean that you can get to the root without worrying about burning your scalp, and it leaves hair shinier and smoother.</li>
<li>With 65 ceramic plates, the temperature is even across the surface of the brush.</li>
</ul>

<h3>CNXUX &#8211; Hair Straightener Brush</h3>

We loved the design of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0714J2X7T/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CNXUX &#8211; Hair Straightener Brush</a>, with a slim profile, swivel cord, and square comb with ceramic bristles. The CNXUX heats up the fastest, and reaches close to its advertised temperature, with a high recorded temp of 410 ℉. It also has a faster automatic shutoff than the other finalists, turning off after only 30 minutes. Depending on how long it takes to finish your hair, this could be a plus or a minus, but we appreciate it for safety reasons.</p>
<p>We didn’t make the CNXUX our top pick because our testers reported that it leaves waves and isn’t smoothing enough. Despite a true temperature, it takes multiple passes to straighten hair because there is very little to no tension. The positive side to this is it doesn’t snag or pull hair, either. It’s a good option for those with fine hair and a loose wave that just needs a little help.</p>
<h3>Vidal Sassoon &#8211; VS433C</h3>

The majority of our hair straightening brushes have a paddle brush, but the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H2GG2II/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vidal Sassoon &#8211; VS433C</a> stands out for having a one-inch barrel-round brush that is ideal for creating volume. All of our testers agreed that it is better for styling than simply straightening. It can be used on damp hair, so it’s great if you need to save on time. The Vidal Sassoon is also very lightweight, making it ideal for travel.</p>
<p>It worked best on short hair and on medium length hair with a bob hairstyle, as it was able get closer to the root than our other straightener brushes. It doesn’t have heat settings, only a high/low switch, so it doesn’t offer much in the way of customization. For this reason, and the fact that it doesn’t work well on longer or thicker hair, it didn’t make our top cut.</p>

<h3>Revlon &#8211; OneStep Dryer &amp; Styler</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013HJEA4C/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Revlon &#8211; OneStep Dryer &amp; Styler</a> has a square-shaped paddle that our testers found ideal for blow drying, and ionic technology that left their hair smoother. It has flexible bristles that prevent tangling, so if you have found that most straightening brushes snag your hair, this model could be an ideal choice. On the other hand, our testers with thick hair found that it doesn’t provide enough tension to be effective.</p>
<p>With a paddle size of 4 inches x 5 inches, it appears bulkier than the dry straightening brushes, but it was still lightweight and easy to use.</p>
<p>We didn’t make this a top pick due to low ratings by our testers, but if your main goal is to cut blow drying time in half and smooth hair cuticles, the Revlon is still a helpful tool.</p>
<h3>Lescolton &#8211; One Step Dryer &amp; Styler</h3>
<p>You can use the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0714LHP8N/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lescolton &#8211; One Step Dryer &amp; Styler</a> wet or dry, making it a versatile option for someone who wants an all-one-tool for styling. In terms of features, the Lescolton has a lot to offer: nanotechnology (to inhibit bacterial growth), tourmaline technology and negative ion technology for faster drying with less damage. The bristles of the brush are even designed to work as a scalp massager, and the brush is very good at working through tangles.</p>
<p>On the other hand, our testers felt this would actually work better on straight hair, which just needs hot air to pass through and doesn’t require any tension. The same aspect that makes it good at detangling makes it hard to get enough tension for straightening. It tended to make curly hair fluffy, which could be great if you are looking for a volumizer, but was enough to keep it from being a top pick.</p>
<h3>InstaMagic &#8211; Straightening Brush</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ISW92FG/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InstaMagic &#8211; Straightening Brush</a> is different than the other brushes we tested because the bristles have a staggered formation rather than straight rows. This gives it the ability to grip coarse hair easily and provide tension. However, in the end our testers felt like it should have accomplished more with its grip. Additionally, the staggered bristles meant it snagged hair.</p>
<p>It is also one of our heavier finalists, and as one tester commented, “for the weight, it’s not doing much work.”</p>
<p>We had to read the manual to change it from Celsius to Fahrenheit (hold down the plus and minus buttons at the same time), so we didn’t find it as easy to use as the other models. What we did like about it: the swivel cord and wide plates for getting through hair fast.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>While the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LZFH8PV/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MiroPure &#8211; 2-in-1</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DT0K3P4/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InStyler &#8211; Straight Up</a> are priced slightly higher than their counterparts, we found they provided the most value of the finalists we tested. The MiroPure is the most versatile hair straightening brush we tested, due to a higher range of heat settings than a typical hot brush. It performs well on multiple hair types and curl patterns, providing consistently shiny and sleek results. However, it is probably best for those with fine to normal thickness hair.</p>
<p>The InStyler &#8211; Straight Up was a top choice among our testers with thick manes, since its powerful, evenly distributed heat meant fewer passes on even coarse or coiled hair. It is easy to use, and left our testers’ hair straight and smooth.</p>
<p>For the best value, we recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B4902PI/?tag=ybdbsh-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">USpicy &#8211; FS005</a>. It has all the features of a more expensive pick and works well on fine to medium thickness hair. It is slightly more basic than our top pick, with fewer settings and not as sleek of a design. That said, the USpicy delivers consistently smooth results, has a low heat setting for those with damaged hair, and is a great pick at a middle of the road price.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>or nine weeks, we tested seven beard trimmers on beards of all lengths. We washed the trimmers, tested battery life and compared their attachments. Ultimately, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006NXRD58/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wahl &#8211; PowerPro 9686</a> earned our pick for best beard trimmer. It’s a corded trimmer with great blades and uses clip-on attachments just like your barber&#8217;s. If you don’t mind recharging, our top cordless pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M24BKOZ/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; ER-GB370K</a>, has an adjustable comb guide that replaces a mountain of clip-on attachments.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>To track down a lineup of worthy candidates, we checked out reviews from solid publications like Wirecutter. We were disappointed with most of the info we found, most of the content from magazines and style websites seemed more like promotional info.</p>
<p>Youtube reviews of clippers wound up being some of the most solid info we found, though most of the great in-depth reviews are from a barbershop perspective, so not many gave in-depth info about attachments useful for self-trimming.</p>
<p>We filtered retailers ratings and user reviews extensively, ruling out models with poor review scores on Amazon. We looked for the most popular models from established manufacturers, and selected models that were new or recent updates if a popular brand had multiple offerings.</p>
<p>Consulting with barbers at <a href="https://www.thestatesmangrooming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Statesman in Anaheim</a> and <a href="https://www.floydsbarbershop.com/tustin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Floyd&#8217;s in Tustin</a> gave us some assurance that we were looking at solid brands and useful features.</p>
<p>We only selected one corded trimmer for review. Compact corded trimmers (which are mostly tools for barbers and stylists doing detail work) tend not to include the attachments you&#8217;d want to have for beard-keeping. You could buy a hair clipper set, like the Wahl &#8211; Super Taper with eight attachments, but those clippers are just too big to be convenient.</p>
<p>If you do need a corded trimmer with more oomph to cut through your super-hard alpha-hairs, the Wahl &#8211; 5 Star Detailer or Andis &#8211; T-Outliner are barbershop-grade trimmers with adjustable blades. They don&#8217;t come with many attachments, though, and most beards won&#8217;t require the extra power.</p>
<p>Our top cordless pick from Panasonic also has a pro-grade bigger brother: the ER-GP80 is a top-class cordless hair trimmer with a fancy linear motor. But it&#8217;ll set you back about $180, and that&#8217;s just too much for most of us to spend on a beard trimmer. Likewise for the new Bevel Trimmer, which looks great for edging and stubble but doesn&#8217;t have any attachments for maintaining beard length.</p>
<p>We also dismissed gimmicky features like vacuums and digital speed controllers. If we got those features for free in a proven product we wouldn&#8217;t turn them down, but the core features need to be the priority.</p>

<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Battery or plug-in power:</strong> Cordless trimmers are significantly more popular than their corded predecessors, and it&#8217;s easy to make a case for the convenience. How much motor speed you give up going cordless depends on the model, but all batteries will die eventually.</p>
<p><strong>Size of blade:</strong> Wider blades make for quick work and straight edges, while narrower trimmers can be easier to work with around the chin and nose.</p>
<p><strong>Waterproof operation:</strong> If you have a shower mirror, waterproof cordless trimmers are great way to avoid leaving tiny hairs all over your bathroom. They&#8217;re also easy to clean, just soap and rinse the head under running water! You might also want to apply some clipper lube when you&#8217;re done, just to keep rust at bay.</p>
<p><strong>Stands and travel cases:</strong> The most sophisticated kits in this lineup included a pouch to store accessories or a stand for convenient countertop charging, but we didn&#8217;t find any models with both. Good travel cases are pretty easy to find, charging stands not so much.</p>
<p><strong>Attachment guides:</strong> The comb-toothed attachments on a trimmer will keep it at a consistent distance from your face, which makes it easy to keep your beard at a consistent length. Which attachment works best depends on what kinds of trimming you do most, and how you like to shape your beard.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories:</strong> A few of these kits include accessories like nose hair trimmers, narrow-blade detail trimmers or even foil shavers. We think the nose hair trimmer attachments are a nice bonus, but the shavers were basically junk.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>After leading a team of testers in our nine-week <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-beard-oil/">beard oil review</a>, our &#8220;bearditor&#8221; took his six-month beard progressively down to nothing with each of these trimmers.</p>
<h3>Trimming long beards</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/longbeard.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Using a comb, freehand trimming and the longest of the included guide attachments, we tested which trimmer works best for maintenance of a beard longer than one-half inch.</p>
<p>The difficulty of freehand trimming made this the trickiest category to judge. Using a guide like the No. 8 clip-on attachments for the Wahl trimmers means you won&#8217;t have to worry as much about taking a random chunk out of your beard. But, in the era of &#8220;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/yeard/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yeards</a>&#8221; an inch barely counts as &#8220;long.&#8221; If you want to join that club and keep your beard looking neat, you&#8217;ll need to learn how to shape a beard with a comb and the bare trimmer blade.</p>
<p>We gave this test to the Wahl trimmers simply because of the versatility of these kits for shaping and blending, especially as you&#8217;re figuring out how long your mustache can get before it starts stealing your beverages.</p>
<p>The Wahl T-shaped blades were great for freehand shaping, though the wide Panasonic blade is stiff competition if you don&#8217;t need the longer attachments anyway.</p>
<h3>Trimming with a shorter attachment</h3>
<p>For short beards, a guard or comb attachment make it much easier to maintain a consistent length. All of the trimmers except the OneBlade included at least a ⅜&#8221; comb, and even this is longer than what was once considered &#8220;groomed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every attachment we tested is very capable of helping you keep your beard at a consistent length, but we noticed that most adjustable guides were only adjusting the height of the blade, with no protection from the tips.</p>
<p>Except for the Panasonic with its longer teeth, the adjustable combs won&#8217;t keep you from &#8220;dipping&#8221; the teeth into your beard as you run it over tricky areas. We also preferred the Panasonic&#8217;s wider blade for quicker twice-weekly trimming; it&#8217;s tricky to use around the nose at first, but we think it&#8217;s worth the learning curve.</p>
<p>For most beards, we also think a built-in adjustable guide makes more sense than the various clip-on guides than barbers use on their trimmers. The Andis and Wahl trimmers perform very well and are great to use, but if the attachment pops off and falls behind something when you&#8217;re travelling, your trimmer basically becomes worthless until you can replace it.</p>
<h3>Stubble maintenance</h3>
<p>Using the shortest guide combs and the bare trimmer edge, we tried to maintain perfect groomed stubble with each model.nThe ideal trimmer will allow a perfect fade from bare neck to slightly-longer stubble along the jawline, then back to a shaven finish on the upper cheeks.</p>
<p>The Philips &#8211; OneBlade was the only trimmer that got anywhere close to an all-in-one solution for this look. If you want to keep permanent five o&#8217;clock shadow, the bare trimmer shaves close enough that you can actually create some contrast with the shortest attachment. This way you can leave a little more fuzz on your face but clean up the edges with the bare trimmer blade, which helps you look &#8220;groomed but rugged&#8221; rather than lazy.</p>
<p>Other trimmers will get close enough to leave an even scruff, but you&#8217;d definitely need to clean up with a razor if you want to keep your neck and cheeks looking clean.</p>
<p>A notable performer in this test is the Andis &#8211; Slimline. The trimmer blade is designed for lining up perfect edges on barbershop fades, and you can even &#8220;zero-gap&#8221; the blade halves to get it cutting closer than the other conventional trimmers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUFb7NWuios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instruction videos</a> and plastic templates make it pretty simple, but note that a zero-gapped blade can scratch you if you&#8217;re not careful. So the OneBlade&#8217;s design still has an edge for casual users.</p>

<h3>Battery life</h3>
<p>We topped off the battery on each trimmer, then ran it until the blades stalled. Every model (except the bargain-priced Remington &#8211; PG6025) could run for longer than 90 minutes, which is plenty of battery for weekly trimmings. They were all running strong enough to cut hair reliably until the end.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re using these in a barbershop, the extra runtime from the gigantic battery in the Wahl &#8211; 9818 is a great bonus, though we should note that it&#8217;s also the heaviest trimmer by far.</p>
<p>The Andis &#8211; Slimline Pro Li runs less than half as long as the Wahl, but that doesn&#8217;t take it out of the running: if you use a trimmer for extended periods, the handy charging stand means the overall battery life isn&#8217;t as important, and the light weight and adjustable blade will probably be worth that tradeoff.</p>

<p>The corded <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006NXRD58/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wahl &#8211; PowerPro 9686</a> stands out in this crowd because you&#8217;ll never have to worry about the battery running flat, and with two trimmer blades and the biggest set of attachments it&#8217;s a bargain.</p>
<p>We paid about $25 for this setup, and it has everything you could ask for. The detail trimmer blade even works quite well for nose hair.</p>
<p>Guide combs are most useful in beards shorter than a half-inch. Once you get past that length, things get tricky: a uniform 1 inch of chin hair usually looks kind of bulbous, so most beardsmen are going to start tapering. The longer guards in this kit might just stay in the box.</p>
<p>That said, it&#8217;s good to have options. Even if you&#8217;re just starting your journey toward a monster beard, the guides will help you learn about the grain and texture of your beard while you psych up for freehand trimming and shaping with a comb.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of this array of attachments but were hoping for something cordless, the Wahl &#8211; 9818 is just that. Beyond cutting the cord (and doubling the price) the differences between the two trimmers come down to attachments. The cordless model has a more nostril-friendly ear/nose trimmer and a (poorly-performing) tiny shaver, while this corded model has a barely-functional six-position guide that you could leave attached to its second trimmer blade.</p>
<p>Wahl also includes some &#8220;stubble guides&#8221; that protect your skin from the points of the blade while cutting closer than the 1/16&#8243; guide comb. These work well to reduce scratching, though they don&#8217;t trim nearly as close as the short settings on other models. The bare blade trims closer than the Panasonic, about the same as the Andis out of the box, but you can&#8217;t zero-gap these Wahl blades.</p>

The detail blade even works for nose hair!</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006NXRD58/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The only real drawback to this set is that there are so many pieces to keep track of, and most are only good, not great. The adjustable guide is actually pretty bad compared to other trimmers. If you need the longer clip-on attachments for blending out to a longer beard, it works. If you don&#8217;t need anything longer than a half-inch, the Panasonic is a better design that you&#8217;ll probably be happier using.</p>
<p>Wahl includes a zip-up pouch to keep all the attachments together, but let&#8217;s face it, fishing through a pocket that has eight of these combs in it isn&#8217;t actually convenient. (Note: You can put white paint on the size markers to help you read them.)</p>
<p>If you want a corded trimmer with more oomph, the Wahl &#8211; 5 Star Detailer or Andis &#8211; T-Outliner are barbershop-grade trimmers with adjustable blades. They don&#8217;t come with many attachments, though, and most beards won&#8217;t require the extra power. The Wahl &#8211; Peanut is another popular offering, again with few attachments, we also like the rocker power switch better than the slide switch on the Peanut.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Wahl &#8211; PowerPro is a great trimmer with a full set of attachments and a five-year warranty.</li>
<li>It isn&#8217;t cordless, and it isn&#8217;t waterproof, but you&#8217;ll never have to worry about an aging battery.</li>
<li>Includes 12 guide combs, everything from long stubble up to a full inch.</li>
<li>This wide T-blade makes detailing edges a little easier.</li>
<li>The accessory detail trimmer is a nice touch, though many won&#8217;t ever use it.</li>

<p>This was a tough pick. Each trimmer we tested has a strength (and a weakness) for particular applications, but the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M24BKOZ/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; ER-GB370K</a> rose to the top of the cordless ranks. Panasonic&#8217;s great features make this easier to use than most other trimmers, and both the motor and blade are top-class.</p>
<p>The Panasonic is versatile enough to do nearly everything, from stubble to shaping full beards, with just its one built-in attachment. This adjustable comb doesn&#8217;t go at long as some of the fixed-length clip-on attachments for other trimmers, but for beards less than 1/2&#8243; (where a length guide is most useful) we love that this wide, sturdy guide won&#8217;t pop off in use or get lost in a drawer.</p>
<p>The teeth on this guide attachment are a little longer in the front than on the other adjustables, so it&#8217;s tricky to go straight up under your nose for a close-trimmed mustache. But they help maintain a consistent length better on the rest of your face, and that&#8217;s what the guide is for anyway.</p>

<p>The Panasonic&#8217;s battery isn&#8217;t as long-lasting as some other trimmers, but the wall-mount charger is convenient and avoids the tangle of cords you usually face with a charger. The two pieces are a lot easier to keep in a drawer between trims than most other models.</p>
<p>Panasonic has one big advantage over the Wahl &#8211; 9818, and that&#8217;s a waterproof design. You can wash the trimmer without taking it apart, and also use it in the shower. The Philips &#8211; 5210 is also waterproof, but we like the wider blade and the closer-cut stubble on the Panasonic.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Panasonic&#8217;s GB370K is cordless, waterproof and doesn&#8217;t burden you with accessories to keep track of.</li>
<li>A strong, but quiet motor makes this easier to live with.</li>
<li>This versatile guide comb adjusts from stubble to bushy in precise steps.</li>
<li>If you remove the comb, this wide blade cuts closer than most other trimmers.</li>
<li>The battery life is short, but the price is also low.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078BDHV9P/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; OneBlade Face + Body</a> has a unique blade design, one of the only successful new designs since motorized hair clippers were invented. It&#8217;s also nearly perfect for keeping a short beard or stubble looking neat.</p>
<p>Rather than just making a row of v-shaped shears sliding against each other, Philips took the one-dimensional concept and made a trimmer that cuts on both edges.</p>
<p>These are also much thinner blades than most clippers, so you can cut very close to the skin without risking scratches from the tips of the blade. This means that you get real contrast between areas you want to look clean and areas where you want to leave some scruff.</p>
<p>The following guide comb attachments are included, along with three blades:</p>
<ul>
<li>3/64&#8243; (1mm)</li>
<li>5/64&#8243; (2mm)</li>
<li>1/8&#8243; (3mm, #1 hair clipper guide equivalent)</li>
<li>3/16&#8243; (5mm, shorter than a #2 equivalent)</li>
<li>A separate 1/8&#8243; comb for body hair use</li>
<li>An &#8220;edge guard&#8221; for shaving delicate skin</li>
</ul>
<p>This is halfway between the other trimmers and the real electric shavers we tested. That&#8217;s going to seem a bit silly for some people, since it&#8217;s not doing either job all the way: You won&#8217;t get smooth shaves, and the short guide combs won&#8217;t help in longer beards. But, if you&#8217;ve got a shorter beard or if you just want to keep your stubble looking neat, it&#8217;s a pretty perfect tool.</p>

<p>This wouldn&#8217;t be our first pick for freehand shaping longer beards, but the blades are quite capable even in that role. Most guys who aspire to full-length beards aren&#8217;t going to be using the bare blade for lining up edges anymore, but if you do it&#8217;s a versatile tool.</p>
<h3>Also a great body hair trimmer</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for one device that can manage all of your grooming, this has you covered below the neck, too. If your back hair is out of control, our other <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-body-hair-trimmer/">body hair trimmer picks</a> are still better at helping you reach, but for everything else the Philips &#8211; OneBlade is a pretty compelling pick.</p>
<p>Is it gross to say that you can use a beard trimmer as a body hair trimmer? Yes, but in this case Philips has kind of cheated. The package comes with three completely separate blade assemblies that you can dedicate to whatever funky fate you choose.</p>
<p>You even get a specific comb attachment for body hair that will help you keep your blades from getting mixed up. This is also by far the easiest trimmer to wash thoroughly, so you won&#8217;t need to worry about contaminating your Dopp kit.</p>
<p>The &#8220;edge guard&#8221; works pretty well for keeping delicate skin out of the blades, but the foil shaver on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0037HP9OA/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Bodygroom</a> is still the safest pick for getting right to the skin in sensitive places.</p>
<h3>What about upgrade options?</h3>
<p>We tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078BDHV9P//?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">mid-tier &#8220;Face + Body&#8221; kit</a>; it has a slightly bigger battery and more attachments than the base kit. For $15 more, we think that&#8217;s a great deal, but spending around $40 more on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072DTDVMC/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OneBlade &#8211; Pro</a> isn&#8217;t quite as compelling.</p>
<p>The Pro features an adjustable guide attachment with a 10mm length, which brings it up to par with the rest of the trimmers we tested for mid-length beards, but the attachment isn&#8217;t as wide or sturdy as the guides bigger trimmers like the Panasonic have.</p>
<p>The Pro doesn&#8217;t come with the spare guides or blades that you can dedicate to body-hair use, which dampens our enthusiasm for it. You can buy those separately for about $30; you can&#8217;t buy a longer guide comb for the base OneBlade.</p>
<h3>How well does it shave, though?</h3>
<p>Our tester used these beard trimmers at the same time as early testing for our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-electric-shaver/">electric shaver guide</a>, using the shavers on neck and cheeks with the beard trimmers to maintain a goatee. We tried the OneBlade in this role, and it&#8217;s not the same class of shave as any of our top picks. If you&#8217;ve got anyone inspecting how close you shave, (be that a domestic partner or a Sergeant), this won&#8217;t do the job.</p>
<p>If you just need to be technically clean-shaven, but you&#8217;re not worried about the prickly feeling of stubble, the OneBlade is cheaper and just as easy to use as an electric shaver. If your hair is light enough, you might even fool people; it&#8217;s a good deal closer than any of the other trimmers.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The OneBlade Face + Body works very well for shaving down to a clean-but-prickly shadow.</li>
<li>This kit includes comb attachments up to three sixteenths of an inch to maintain a shorter beard or mustache.</li>
<li>Philips included the longest-lived battery among the waterproof trimmers.</li>
<li>Also a great body hair trimmer, this model comes with a spare blade and comb just for that purpose.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Wahl &#8211; 9818</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058SY1XQ/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wahl &#8211; 9818</a> is basically a cordless version of the PowerPro trimmer we picked for long beards. The cost is double, but it has the longest battery life on any cordless trimmer we tested.</p>
<p>Battery life isn&#8217;t the only factor to consider when you&#8217;re buying a cordless tool, but it&#8217;s nice to see these kinds of specs. We were happy that we could even get inside to see what kind of battery it is (an off-the-shelf 1000mAh 14650-size cell soldered to the control board).</p>
<p>The battery and heavy steel body are the only parts that got a real upgrade, though. More critical features, like the guide attachment design, are identical to every other cheap Wahl trimmer. OK, not amazing.</p>

<p>That said, if you want to maintain a 3/4&#8243; longer beard at a set length, Wahl&#8217;s clip-on attachments are basically your only option.</p>
<p>For this more expensive cordless trimmer, our standards are a bit higher, and we&#8217;re disappointed that Wahl still uses these flimsy attachments. They&#8217;ll pop off if you put a lot of pressure on them, and you have to squint to read the size markings.</p>
<p>Waterproofing is also a missing feature that would make this a much better cordless trimmer. No, it&#8217;s not a must-have feature, but most of us don&#8217;t have a giant can of clipper spray always at the ready. A waterproof design would make use and cleaning much easier.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to put up with the fussy cleaning requirements of a pro-style clipper, we&#8217;d like to see some pro-grade design considerations, too. Wahl uses a cheap, spring-tensioned blade assembly here, not an adjustable blade like the Andis &#8211; Slimline Pro.</p>
<p>Wahl sets these to trim pretty close, so most people aren&#8217;t going to miss out on gap adjustment, but it&#8217;s another win for the Andis trimmer if you&#8217;re looking for a line-up trimmer.</p>
<p>Wahl still has a more versatile kit than any other trimmer, but most users would trade half of the attachments for some missing features. The build feels solid, but that&#8217;s entirely because of the stainless body tube; the internal components are just as cheap as any of the other trimmers. (A point borne out by the spotty reliability record in the Amazon reviews.)</p>
<h3>Andis &#8211; Slimline Pro Li</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01499YQP2/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Andis &#8211; Slimline Pro Li</a> is a small, light, versatile tool that finds its way onto many barbershop and stylist workstations. It&#8217;s missing some features that would make it an easy top pick, but for some people it might still be the right tool.</p>
<p>The Slimline is at its best without a guide comb. That&#8217;s how most barbers use it, and the few guides that are included makes it clear that Andis knows this. Barbers also complain about these attachments, just like the Wahl attachments.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t need the #4-#8 attachments that the Wahl has, there are a few things this trimmer has going for it. It&#8217;s slimmer and lighter, so it&#8217;ll be easier to pack for travel even if you don&#8217;t have to hold it up all day. The blade is also adjustable to &#8220;hit&#8221; a zero-gap line, so you can get right down to the skin if you want to. (Be careful, and check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019WSCKL2/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">templates that can help you</a> line up the edge.)</p>
<p>If it weren&#8217;t for the OneBlade, then, this might be our pick for trimming close-cropped and precisely-lined beards. With that option on the table, though, the only reason to go for the non-waterproof and more-expensive Slimline is if you find that the OneBlade blades won&#8217;t cut your hair well.</p>
<h3>Philips &#8211; 5210</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017YNUH9E/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Philips Norelco &#8211; 5210</a> is another very close contender for our top cordless pick. The battery runs just a hair longer than the Panasonic&#8217;s, and the adjustable guide combs it comes with will cover beard growth that&#8217;s just a bit longer, too, out to a #4 equivalent with the two longer attachments.</p>
<p>We like the design of these guides for close-cropped beards, and in those conditions we think this is going to be a better choice than the Panasonic, since the long &#8220;teeth&#8221; on Panasonic&#8217;s guide aren&#8217;t really needed.</p>
<p>That said, the 5210 has a stubble-length adjustable guide that&#8217;s deceptive: adjustment marking indicate that you can go from 0.4 mm to 0.8 before you get to the 1mm height setting, but in real-world conditions these settings are no different from taking the attachment off. You won&#8217;t get any contrast from different stubble lengths using these shortest settings.</p>
<p>The OneBlade is a more versatile system for short beards, and it has a much longer battery life and better design overall if that&#8217;s the kind of job you need to do. For beards longer than a #3 guide comb, the Panasonic takes over as a more capable trimmer, with a wide blade and one do-it-all attachment for Philips&#8217;s 3.</p>
<h3>Remington &#8211; PG6025</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H2B4H2M/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Remington &#8211; PG6025</a> is the multi-use pick from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-body-hair-trimmer/#grooming">body hair trimmer</a> review, and it&#8217;s still a good trimmer for $20. The nose hair trimmer attachment is as good as Wahl&#8217;s, though for $5 more Wahl has a much more complete beard trimming package.</p>
<p>Remington&#8217;s budget-priced trimmer had the weakest battery of our lineup, and it&#8217;s not waterproof. The included shaving foil isn&#8217;t really worth using, maybe it&#8217;d be OK on your legs or for other areas that are less sensitive than your face.</p>
<p>The adjustable guide Remington uses is decent enough to work. Remington calls their three snap-on guides &#8220;beard and stubble combs&#8221; and the 8-step adjustable a &#8220;hair&#8221; comb. You&#8217;ll be fine whichever attachment you pick for beard trimming, but none of them are especially good.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Picking the best beard trimmer is a bit like picking the best beard: Every man is going to have different preferences. We narrowed down three picks that will excel in three different beard lengths, and we think that&#8217;s the best way to approach this decision.</p>
<p>For average-length beards on average guys, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M24BKOZ/?tag=ybdbtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; ER-GB370K</a> has everything you need and nothing you don&#8217;t. It trims close enough for clean edges, but it also has a versatile guide comb that works very well in mid-length beards. The plug-in charging stand is also a nifty way to cut down on bathroom clutter.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter two months of testing eight different designs, we&#8217;ve picked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FYVOJC/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; ER430K</a> as the best nose hair trimmer. This is a refined improvement of the classic trimmer design, with a better blade and a vacuum to keep crusty clippings off your shirt. The ER430K is fully waterproof, so it&#8217;s easy to clean and keeps batteries dry. Our runner-up <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTS51NI/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; NT1500</a> proved it’s a better detail trimmer than it is a nose hair trimmer.</p>

<p>The Wahl 5545 included in this review has been owned and used by our tester for about 10 years and represents a baseline for standard designs. There&#8217;s nothing specifically wrong with it, but we looked at the range of other models on the market to see if we could find improvements in design and function.</p>
<p>Finding credible information to narrow down our selections was tricky. Magazine-style features like <a href="https://www.askmen.com/entertainment/guy_gear/best-nose-hair-trimmers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one from AskMen</a> didn&#8217;t describe anything specific about the performance or cutting ability of the different trimmers they recommend and seemed mostly to focus on claims rather than results.</p>
<p>The relevant subreddits yielded more credible answers about what works and some recommendations. Manual trimmers seemed popular among /r/buyit4life Redditors, so we included the two most popular designs.</p>
<p>We looked for niche blogs that might give more insight into what makes or breaks a trimmer, but again we found no evidence of side-by-side testing in popular reviews.</p>
<p>Amazon and other retailers ratings/user reviews were probably the most useful source of info, with some solid (if anecdotal) evidence of models that were great. As always, we filtered for an average score of 4.0 or better and looked for leading designs that had consistently good reviews.</p>
<p>Nose hair trimmers use cheap components and very basic designs, so we&#8217;re not surprised to see that even the most highly-regarded designs seem to have some units leave the factory with parts that don&#8217;t work or break quickly. A 10-percent failure rate seems to be about average for the most popular models. There was no apparent alternative in compact trimmers with better longevity, at any price.</p>
<p>The vast majority of trimmers use a &#8220;nose cone&#8221; cutter guard, so we tried hard to find representative models that used other shapes or designs. We picked three trimmers with other cutter designs to see if any differences showed up in testing.</p>

<h2>Should you trim or pluck?</h2>
<p>Some popular misconceptions come up frequently when people discuss managing nose hair. For example, many will rightly point out that plucked hairs take longer to grow back than hairs trimmed to a length just inside the nose. Plucking is pretty easy with a pair of the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-tweezers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best tweezers</a>, and that means it&#8217;s better all around, right?</p>
<p>Maybe not. There are a lot of legends and scary stories that you&#8217;ll hear about nose-hair-plucking. Our tester grew up hearing stories from his grandpa about someone who died after plucking a hair that went all the way up into his brain, a story that&#8217;s almost certainly not accurate. We spent some time sorting fact from fiction and getting the details about why you might not want to do it.</p>
<p>Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a real thing, and it&#8217;s really bad, but that doesn&#8217;t mean plucking a nose hair will kill you. Basically, plucking a nose hair leaves the inside of your nose with an unprotected wound that could get infected. An infection so close to your brain <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-plucking-nose-hairs-can-cause-lethal-infections-2016-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is definitely something you want to avoid</a>.</p>
<p>A trimmer that reaches all the way to the base of a nose hair may sound like a great idea, but remember that your nose hairs do serve a useful purpose guarding against stuff that could cause those serious infections. Aggressive trimming won&#8217;t leave a hole, but it still means you&#8217;re not getting the protection the hairs are supposed to provide. Careful trimming of just the ends of the hairs means you&#8217;ve still got hair where you need it, but not peeking out at your date.</p>
<p>Also, remember that trimming your hair cannot cause its rate of growth to change: Using a nose hair trimmer will not make your hairs come back quicker or thicker. The rate of growth varies, but on average it should take about six months to grow an inch. Plucked hair takes far longer to grow back (since you&#8217;ve removed the follicle and it&#8217;ll take time to grow a new one), but just because trimmed hair grows back in a few weeks doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s growing more quickly or in a different shape.</p>
<p>These trimmers are for more than just noses, though. Trimmers are sometimes said to be better for eyebrows than tweezers, though if you&#8217;ve got especially bushy brows then you might appreciate the opportunity to thin them out. We have a bunch of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-tweezers/#hair-removal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommendations for hair removal tweezers</a>, and it&#8217;s probably worth owning both types of tool.</p>

<strong>Trimmer type:</strong> There is no detailed taxonomy of names for trimmer types that we could find, but you&#8217;ll probably recognize most of the cutting elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rotary nose-cone trimmers</strong> use a spinning blade inside an outer guard blade. It can&#8217;t trim especially close, but it keeps your nose safe from cuts. This is by far the most popular design.</li>
<li><strong>Reciprocating clippers</strong> are like tiny hair clippers with a combed blade moving back and forth against a guard blade. Unlike some hair clippers, these are specifically designed so they can&#8217;t cut you, though they can still tickle.</li>
<li><strong>The Philips Nosetrimmer uses</strong> the only really unique cutter design, with a tiny blade moving back and forth inside a hollow foil like a micro-shaver. Despite the unfortunate name, we&#8217;re happy to report that these blades do not trim the flesh of your nose.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Multipurpose systems:</strong> We tested a few models that came with attachments, but the tiny motors in these trimmers aren&#8217;t good for much more than cutting a few hairs at a time.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a device that does more than just trim nose hairs, you&#8217;re definitely better off making the more demanding task a priority. We <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-beard-trimmer/">reviewed beard trimmers</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-body-hair-trimmer/#grooming">body hair trimmers</a> with attachments suitable for nose hair, and they all work just as well as (if not better than) AA-battery-powered trimmers.</p>
<p><strong>Waterproof design:</strong> No, this isn&#8217;t to protect the trimmer from your nose, it&#8217;s to help with cleaning. All the nose hair trimmers we found were designed to be washed out, but some were completely sealed, so water won&#8217;t even get into the battery compartment. This isn&#8217;t a big functional difference for trimming, but keeping water out of the electrical connections will help ensure a long life.</p>

<h3>Battery life</h3>
<p>We put fresh Ikea &#8211; Alkalisk AA alkaline batteries in each of these and let them run until they stopped cutting hair.</p>
<p><strong>We want to point out that this isn&#8217;t an absolute virtue: a longer battery life may also indicate a weaker motor.</strong> In the case of the Panasonic, it seems clear that vacuuming up hair clippings has a cost in battery life.</p>
<p>The overall winner for battery life was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002UM5LNW/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair &#8211; NE150R</a>, with a reciprocating blade that trims very efficiently despite its tiny motor. Even when the battery voltage drops too low to spin up the Panasonic, this trimmer will keep on cutting. That said, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTS51NI/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; NT1500</a> was only 10 minutes short of the Conair&#8217;s time, so the waterproof design earned a runner-up pick.</p>
<p>These (and most other) alkaline cells we used give about 1186 mAH with a draw comparable to the Panasonic&#8217;s bigger motor, so you could improve runtime by switching to better battery chemistry like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZV9WTM/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon Basics NiMH AA</a>.</p>
<h3>Easy cutting and comfort test</h3>
<p>Our tester used these trimmers on every nose, eyebrow and ear hair he could find for two months, and supplemented with chest, leg and armpit hair for additional testing. (Leg hair actually hurt the most!)</p>
<p>The electric trimmers all did a good job cutting hair we pushed into the blades, but when it came to actual cutting inside the nostril some designs worked better than others.</p>
<p>The biggest difference we saw among rotary-type blades was inside vs. top cutting blades. Panasonic has developed a blade for their trimmers that cuts on the end as well as the sides, and the ToiletTree trimmer is a very similar design. This allowed for quicker and easier cutting in every task, without giving up the safety and simplicity of the &#8220;nose-cone&#8221; guard blade.</p>
<p>The manual trimmers from Kedsum and Groom Mate were the only designs that caused &#8220;pulling&#8221; in use. The blades sometimes failed to cut hairs cleanly, pulling on the hair instead of removing the trimmed end. We tested with a variety of hair types and tried to ensure we were holding the trimmer still while spinning the blade, but the careful practice didn&#8217;t change the frequency of painful results. You can get OK results with these manual trimmers, but even scissors would be better.</p>
<h3>Thick hair test</h3>
<p>Using thick hair and peanut butter, we tried to bog down these trimmers to the point where they wouldn&#8217;t cut anymore. While some trimmers had more difficulty connecting their cutting elements with the thick and sticky hair, all the powered trimmers were still able to cut.</p>
<h3>Cleaning test</h3>
<p>After running each of the trimmers through hair and peanut butter to get them good and gummy, we tried cleaning each with soap and water, then disassembling to see how clean they really were.</p>
<p>While cleaning, we also put dry tissue paper in the battery compartment and immersed the trimmers in the sink to see how waterproof they actually are. All the units advertised as waterproof actually were, using an O-ring seal around the battery compartment cap to keep water away from the battery terminals.</p>
<h2 id="top-pick">Top pick: Panasonic &#8211; ER430K</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-14638 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Panasonic-ER430K.jpg" alt="Panasonic-ER430K" width="1794" height="1196" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Panasonic-ER430K.jpg 1794w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Panasonic-ER430K-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Panasonic-ER430K-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Panasonic-ER430K-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Panasonic-ER430K-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Panasonic-ER430K-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Panasonic-ER430K-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Panasonic-ER430K-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Panasonic-ER430K-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Panasonic-ER430K-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Panasonic-ER430K-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Panasonic-ER430K-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FYVOJC/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; ER430K</a> is a more complicated nose hair trimmer than most. Not satisfied to simply trim your nose hair, it also uses a tiny vacuum to collect the hairs in a little trap for later disposal.</p>
<p>If this trimmer weren&#8217;t great at doing what it says on the box, we wouldn&#8217;t recommend it specifically because of the vacuum. Fortunately, this is one of the best trimmers we tried, and the price is right in the middle of the range. The vacuum, then, is a nice bonus.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re cleaning this trimmer, it takes less work to clean out gunk because of the flow-through design that allows the vacuum to grab hairs. The manual says to clean the trimmer with the motor off, but if you do run it while submerged it&#8217;ll scrub the blades really well with a fast-flowing stream of water drawn through by the vacuum system. The instruction left us uncertain about whether this is intended, but the vacuum-free ERGN30K model lists this as a feature called &#8220;vortex cleaning.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t care about the vacuum feature and want to save $5, the ERGN30K uses the same great blade and should be just as easy to clean. Panasonic lists the same 90-minute runtime for the cheaper model that we got with the vacuum-powered ER430K, but they might just be giving a conservative estimate. The vacuum feature is handy enough that we think the ER430K is worth an extra $5, and it also comes with a cap and zippered case to keep it clean.</p>

<p>As mentioned in our testing section, you should see much better run-times with this powerful little motor if you switch to high-capacity nickel metal hydride batteries like these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZV9WTM/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon Basics</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MXCIK32/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eneloop Pro</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000WDSFPM/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ansmann</a> cells. You&#8217;d see an increase with other trimmers, too, but the 90-minute runtime on an alkaline indicates that the Panasonic is pulling just less than 1 ampere of power. This is compared to around 0.3 amps for the others, which means Panasonic will gain more runtime from better battery chemistry.</p>

The real competition for Panasonic&#8217;s trimmer is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E4PMQAO/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ToiletTree</a> trimmer. Some of these are more expensive, some are a bit cheaper, but unless you&#8217;re buying from eBay or Aliexpress you&#8217;re not saving any money by going for lesser-known brands.</p>
<p>As you can see from the image above, the ToiletTree trimmer (with the white post) uses a very similar cutter to Panasonic&#8217;s, so it has similar advantages. It&#8217;s hard to say if the Panasonic was working better for us because of a stronger motor or just because of the vacuum drawing hair into the blades, but it did seem to snip hairs a little bit more readily. The biggest difference between the two is definitely the noise of the vacuum, though we think it&#8217;s a worthwhile trade-off. (And, as we&#8217;ve said, if you don&#8217;t want that feature the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0049LUI9O/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">no-vacuum ERGN30K model</a> is one of the least expensive trimmers we found.)</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A refined blade design helps the Panasonic &#8211; ER430K cut better and at nearly any angle.</li>
<li>The vacuum actually works and helps keep those bits of crusty hair off your shirt.</li>
<li>The strong motor and vacuum feature come at a cost: runtime is only 96 minutes on alkaline AA cells.</li>
<li>Panasonic put a lot of work into making this waterproof and easy to clean.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="runner-up">Runner-up: Philips &#8211; NT1500</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-14639 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500.jpg" alt="Philips-NT1500" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Philips-NT1500-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
If the traditional nose-cone design doesn&#8217;t appeal to you, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTS51NI/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; NT1500</a> is definitely worth checking out. This trimmer uses a blade that&#8217;s something like a cross between an electric shaver and a clipper, and it works very well.</p>
<p>On many metrics this trimmer is superior to the Panasonic: it&#8217;s cheaper, it runs four times longer on a battery and it&#8217;s almost just as easy to clean. But for easy trimming of nose hair, the usefulness lags behind Panasonic&#8217;s evolved form of the old standby.</p>

A waterproof design sets this apart from other contenders, but the Panasonic is better inside your nostrils. Easy to clean and long-running, the price is right for a variety of clean-up jobs.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTS51NI/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>You&#8217;ll spend more time fishing around in your nostril with Philips&#8217;s design trying to connect the cutter and that one pesky hair. If you want to keep a decent amount of hair inside your nostril to help you avoid breathing in dust, this design isn&#8217;t very helpful.</p>
<p>For trimming other stray hairs on your face, though, this is a great design. Eyebrow trimming with the included comb attachment works well, and it&#8217;s easy to run over the back of your ear to grab hairs you didn&#8217;t even know about.</p>
<p>The Philips trimmer even does an OK job with sideburns and mustache edges, though it&#8217;s not a replacement for a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-beard-trimmer/">beard trimmer</a>. It won&#8217;t get especially close, either, so if you were relying on this to form sideburns you&#8217;d definitely want to do so before you shave. On the plus side, this design won&#8217;t pull or pinch or even tickle the way some other trimmer blades can.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Philips &#8211; NT1500 is a less-conventional trimmer shape that still works very well for cutting nose hair.</li>
<li>For ear and eyebrow hair, this trimmer is just a bit easier to use.</li>
<li>This trimmer runs longer than any of the other waterproof designs, 373 minutes on an alkaline AA.</li>
<li>The price is right: this is also the least expensive waterproof trimmer we found.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conair &#8211; NE150R</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002UM5LNW/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair &#8211; NE150R</a> uses a blade design that might be most familiar. Basically a tiny five-segment hair clipper, it&#8217;s dialed in to cut efficiently. If you were always certain exactly where your stray hairs are, this design would be ideal. Most people are going to want something they can quickly run around the inside of their nostril, though, and the NE150R doesn&#8217;t do this quite as well as the traditional nose-cone design.</p>
<p>In most other respects, though, this is an excellent trimmer. The blade design is simple and very easy to clean, though sadly the motor and battery compartment aren&#8217;t waterproof. This was the most affordable trimmer we tested, from a name that&#8217;s as old as any in grooming products. The alkaline battery runtime for this trimmer was even a little bit longer than the Philips.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re at all ticklish, the way these blades move back and forth next to your skin might be slightly unnerving. We don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a problem, necessarily, but since the competition can cut without tickling your nose as much, Conair loses a few places in the ranking.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t care about waterproofing and you can always see exactly what hairs you need to cut, this would be a great pick. For the rest of us, it&#8217;s just not quite as good as the Panasonic.</p>
<h3>ToiletTree</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E4PMQAO/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ToiletTree</a> may or may not be the company that designed this trimmer, but it&#8217;s one of the best-selling models out there. The ToiletTree brand came up frequently in consumer mentions in our research, and they&#8217;re now stocked at CVS stores. There are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y5CJG3Z/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">other trimmers that appear to be identical</a>, but this one is easy to find.</p>
<p>On the plus side, this trimmer is quieter than the vacuum on the Panasonic and uses a similar blade design that trims on the end of the cone as well as the sides. It works almost just as well as the Panasonic, and it will run for almost three times longer on a AA battery.</p>
<p>That said, the ToiletTree costs a few dollars more than the Panasonic, and it&#8217;s not quite as powerful or easy to clean. If battery life were a more important consideration this might rank higher. Someday we may see USB-rechargeable designs that make sense, but at this point, you&#8217;re still going to need to keep batteries around. Even a two-fold increase in battery life isn&#8217;t going to change the way you feel about a trimmer.</p>
<p>The LED light is also a bit silly  — even a poorly-lit bathroom doesn&#8217;t really benefit from the amount of light that this puts out. In comparison, the vacuum on the Panasonic trimmer might actually save you from some embarrassment or help keep your bathroom clean.</p>
<h3>Wahl &#8211; 5545</h3>
<p>Everyone who has seen or owned a nose hair trimmer probably knows what they need to know about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002FS4VJQ/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wahl &#8211; 5545</a>. This is a bare-bones rotary trimmer: the rotating blades chop off anything that comes into the nose-cone as they run along the inside.</p>
<p>Compared to our top pick, this design is lacking in a few ways. The blades are only cutting on the sides, compared to the Panasonic design that snips off at the top as well. The motor seems noticeably stronger on the Panasonic, which does have a tradeoff in battery life.</p>
<p>The Wahl doesn&#8217;t have waterproofing, either, which doesn&#8217;t stop you from rinsing the blade under your tap, but after using designs that you can drop in the sink it&#8217;s a definite regression.</p>
<p>We were also surprised that this trimmer isn&#8217;t more affordable. Panasonic has a number of bare-bones designs that are cheaper, and even the waterproof Philips model we picked as our runner up was a few dollars less.</p>
<p>Wahl uses basically this same blade design as an attachment on their cordless 9818 Beard trimmer, and as a free accessory in that package, it&#8217;s good to go. As a stand-alone design, though, it&#8217;s just not compelling.</p>
<h3>Conair &#8211; PG 1000</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074R3G45B/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conair &#8211; PG 1000</a> looks like a compelling alternative to the old Wahl design and the new Panasonic design for nose hair cutter shapes. The rotary trimmer is shaped in a cone, with blades that seem designed to trim an even length at the opening of your nostril.</p>
<p>In practice, though, this trimmer has two problems. First, hair that enters the trimmer from the middle of the blade cone rather than the side is actually prevented from moving out to the cutting path. Second, you can&#8217;t remove the cutting blade from this trimmer for cleaning.</p>
<p>We had hoped that this would be competitive with the Panasonic, but it was actually one of the least-effective trimmers we used. It works, but basically any other blade design will trim hair more quickly and easily.</p>
<h3>Not recommended: Kedsum and Groom Mate</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14634" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/manual-nose-hair-trimmers.jpg" alt="Kedsum and GroomMate" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/manual-nose-hair-trimmers.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/manual-nose-hair-trimmers-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/manual-nose-hair-trimmers-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/manual-nose-hair-trimmers-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/manual-nose-hair-trimmers-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/manual-nose-hair-trimmers-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/manual-nose-hair-trimmers-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/manual-nose-hair-trimmers-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/manual-nose-hair-trimmers-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/manual-nose-hair-trimmers-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/manual-nose-hair-trimmers-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/manual-nose-hair-trimmers-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ID2D1B6/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kedsum</a> is one of many brands selling this scissor-action rotary trimmer, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BPPF5Z4/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Groom Mate &#8211; Platinum XL</a> is a similar rotary cutter that requires two hands to use. These blades cut in a very similar way to the standby rotary electric blade in the Wahl, but with some interesting differences that make them less useful.</p>
<p>On both trimmers, hairs need to slip down into the side of the cutter to be snipped off; on really long hair it works, but if you&#8217;re just doing a precautionary clean-up pass you could easily miss hairs that aren&#8217;t lying in the right direction.</p>
<p>When cutting nose hair, this was mostly a pain-free experience. At times, though, hair was pinched and pulled by the cutting motion. Ouch. It&#8217;s hard to say exactly what the problem is, and it&#8217;s worse when we try it on eyebrow or arm hair than inside the nostril, but since these aren&#8217;t very efficient trimmers to begin with it&#8217;s just not worth the potential pain.</p>
<p>If we had to pick a battery-free way to trim nose hair, we&#8217;d go with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000127IP2/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">these high-end scissors from Rubis</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cocos-Closet-Safety-Hair-Scissors/dp/B01BRV4Q00/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this more affordable option</a> instead.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for your first nose hair trimmer, enjoy your youth while it lasts. If you&#8217;re like those of us who are looking for a trimmer to replace something you&#8217;ve had for a few years that has already died, we have some picks that will hopefully impress.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FYVOJC/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic &#8211; ER430K</a> is a nearly perfect nose hair trimmer with a powerful motor and blades that cut any hairs at every angle. If you&#8217;re trimming on the way out the door, the vacuum feature also keeps crusty hairs off your shirt. This is a waterproof trimmer that&#8217;s easy to wash and maintain, and the price is right.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like something that&#8217;s a little more versatile and doesn&#8217;t eat through batteries as quickly as Panasonic&#8217;s rotary trimmer, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTS51NI/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; NT1500</a> is cost-effective and quite good at trimming hairs. The Philips is better on ears and eyebrows than inside the nostril, but it&#8217;ll run four times longer than the Panasonic on a AA battery and it&#8217;s still waterproof.</p>

Battery life isn't as good as some other trimmers, but we think the design is worth that price.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FYVOJC/?tag=ybdnose-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
